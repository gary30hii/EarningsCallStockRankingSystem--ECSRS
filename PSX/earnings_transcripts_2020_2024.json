My name is David, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jeff Dietert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Jeff, you may begin.\nJeff Dietert: Good afternoon, and welcome to Phillips 66 Partners fourth quarter earnings conference call. Participants on today's call will include Kevin Mitchell, Vice President and CFO; Tim Roberts, Vice President and COO; Casey Gorder, General Manager, Operations. Today's presentation materials can be found on the Events section of the Phillips 66 Partners website along with supplemental financial and operating information. Slide 2 contains our safe harbor statement. We will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and our Q&A session. Actual results may differ materially from today's comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here as well as in our SEC filings. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin.\nKevin Mitchell: Thank you, Jeff and good afternoon, everyone. In the fourth quarter, Phillips 66 Partners delivered strong operating performance and solid results in a challenging market environment. We achieved a major milestone at the South Texas Gateway Terminal with the completion of the second dock and the loading of its first VLCC. The Board of Directors approved a fourth quarter distribution of $0.875 per common unit unchanged from the fourth quarter 2019. Moving on to Slide 4 to discuss full year highlights. The partnership demonstrated the strength of its fee-based portfolio. Despite the unprecedented challenges of 2020 adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow only declined modestly from our strong 2019 performance. We continue to operate safely and reliably. Phillips 66 Partners reported earnings of $791 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the year was $1.2 billion. We continue to execute our growth program. The Gray Oak Pipeline, our largest project to date reached full operations in the second quarter and the expanded capacity at Clemens Caverns was placed into service in July. In addition, we advanced the South Texas Gateway Terminal and continued construction of the C2G Pipeline. These assets all supported by long-term customer commitments will further integrate our portfolio. Moving on to Slide 5 to discuss financial results for the quarter. The partnership reported fourth quarter earnings of $104 million, compared with $206 million in the third quarter. The decrease was due to $96 million of impairments related to investments in two crude oil logistics joint ventures. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $318 million. This was an increase of $5 million from the third quarter due to higher Bakken Pipeline volumes, partially offset by lower volumes on the Sand Hills Pipeline. Fourth quarter distributable cash flow was $240 million, down $3 million from the prior quarter. The decrease reflects higher maintenance CapEx in the fourth quarter. Slide 6 highlights our financial flexibility and liquidity. We ended the fourth quarter with $7 million of cash and $334 million available under our revolving credit facility. The partnership funded $90 million of growth capital during the quarter, this included spend on the C2G Pipeline and investment in the South Texas Gateway Terminal. The debt-to-EBITDA ratio on a revolver covenant basis was 2.9, which is consistent with our target to remain below 3.5. Our distribution coverage ratio was 1.2. We recognized the ongoing uncertainty associated with the Dakota Access pipeline litigation. Earlier this week, the appellate court affirmed that Dakota must prepare an environmental impact study, which is already underway and is expected to be completed by the end of the year. The court also affirmed the vacating of the easement under Lake Oahe. While the court did not mandate the shutdown of the pipeline, while the EIS is being prepared, it recognized there's a pending motion for injunction on that issue in the lower court. The economic implications are a temporary shutdown extended beyond the pipeline owners to customers, state and local governments, consumers and workers throughout the energy value chain. Dakota Access pipeline has a history of safe operations and we believe it should be allowed to operate, while this matter continues to process. We will continue to consider options as the legal process plays out. Phillips 66 Partners remains focused on those areas within our control including safe, reliable operations and disciplined capital allocation to maintain financial flexibility. Now, Casey will provide an update on our growth projects.\nCasey Gorder: Thank you, Kevin, and hello everyone. Moving to Slide 7, I'll provide an update on our major projects, which continue to progress during the quarter. At the South Texas Gateway Terminal, the second dock commenced crude oil export operations in the fourth quarter. This enables the berthing and loading of two vessels at the same time with up to 800,000 barrels per day of throughput capacity. We expect construction to be completed in the first quarter of 2021 with total storage capacity of $8.6 million barrels. Phillips 66 Partners owns a 25% interest in the terminal. We continue construction of the C2G Pipeline, connecting Clemens storage Caverns to petrochemical facilities in the Corpus Christi area. The project is backed by long-term commitments. Pipeline construction is about 85% complete and is expected to start-up in mid 2021. We continue to execute on projects that optimize our existing asset base, including the Zena Lateral associated with the Gray Oak Pipeline. Our integrated portfolio has created a number of opportunities for capital efficient high return optimization projects. We will continue to identify and evaluate these quick win projects to meet customer demand, while maintaining capital discipline. The 2021 capital budget of $300 million includes $165 million for growth and $135 million for maintenance capital. Growth capital will be directed towards in-flight and optimization projects. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nSpiro Dounis: Hi, afternoon guys. Question for you Kevin first maybe, in the past you talked about achieving $1.5 billion EBITDA run rate, realized we're not there yet, but barring the Bakken Pipeline for a second, is that still a good way to think about your earnings power, I guess, as the market normalizes of this current asset base? Or is it going to take incremental investment to get there at some point?\nKevin Mitchell: Yes. I think to get to $1.5 billion of EBITDA; you probably don't quite get there with the current asset base in part if I remember right and Tim I need to confirm this for me. I think we included Liberty in that and so that's the big difference between what we had at the time we made that statement versus where we are today. So that's really the primary differentiator versus those previous projections.\nSpiro Dounis: Okay. That's helpful. And then next question perhaps not surprisingly just on Dakota Access, I realized a fair amount is out of your control and I appreciate your update on that Kevin, but I guess if we could just focus on what is in your control and I guess that's how you would react to a potential closure and I think this is probably what's on most people's minds. But I guess what tools are at your disposal, not from a legal perspective, but just in terms of the balance sheet and how you react to the extent that closure is actually just a temporary measure to the extent not only extends inside of a year, if that's really all the EIS is going to take. Do you feel compelled to react to that or is that a weighted out type of strategy?\nKevin Mitchell: Well, I think, if we're in a situation where there's a shutdown, even if temporary, there's going to be a fair amount of uncertainty as to how long that's going to last. And so, we do think about all of the options available to us. And from a financial standpoint, there are really two main levers and that's growth capital and the distribution. Growth capital has already come down significantly. So Casey mentioned the $165 million in the budget this year that's significantly lower than where we've been the last couple of years. So there's a little bit of room there, but not a lot. And so I just say all options are on the table. We're not going to give any specific guidance at this point of time other than to reinforce that any decisions we make are going to be focused on preserving the balance sheet at PSXP and protecting the best interest of all the unitholders.\nSpiro Dounis: Understood, that's it for me. Thanks guys and have a good weekend.\nKevin Mitchell: Thanks.\nOperator: Theresa Chen with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTheresa Chen: Hi. So I wanted to follow up on the DAPL topic. I mean, where the units currently sit, it looks like about 80% to 90% probability of a shutdown is priced into PSXP stock. And I wanted to hear from your own words, what are your expectations for the February 10th hearing? What do you think the potential outcomes are and their perspective likelihoods?\nTim Roberts: Hi, Theresa. This is Tim. I think, Kevin, actually summarized this. It feels fairly binary with regard to [indiscernible] it's not. And then at that point we've got options that we would want to look at and we're going to deal with Energy Transfer. They've got their earnings call. They'll probably want to deal with take the point on this, but we're in discussions with them as far as what legal options we have. Obviously, it's in our interest to continue to pursue keeping the pipeline running.\nCasey Gorder: Yes, Energy Transfer is leading the legal effort on that project.\nTheresa Chen: Okay. And Kevin to your earlier comment about the distribution as a potential lever to preserve the balance sheet and protect unitholders. So if the pipeline does shut and you pull that lever, what kind of coverage do you think that the base business should target given that you do have long-term plan for the Midstream business and equity markets remain closed? Would you target something higher than what you have historically?\nKevin Mitchell: Well, it's \u2013 I love to get into a path of trying to speculate where we might go on the distribution specifically, but we're triangulating around the balance sheet metrics, thinking about debt metrics as well as coverage metrics from a distribution standpoint. So it's not just about having the cash generation, the distributable cash flow to be able to cover the distribution. It's the broader picture of the balance sheet and the leverage metrics around that as well. And so, we're just thinking through all of those elements.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good afternoon.\nKevin Mitchell: Hi, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: I just wanted to start with Phillips \u2013 PSX had been talking about the real world's fuels business and potentially some expansions there. I'm just wondering if that could translate into opportunities for PSXP or how that might impact the partnership overall?\nTim Roberts: Yes, it can. I would say right now that, for example, Rodeo, you do Rodeo, you're still going to be moving the fuels, so that really doesn't change whether it's renewable fuel or not, it\u2019s still going to be using pipelines and terminals to go ahead and get the product to market. Now, good and bad side of that is really PSXP does not have much as far as any footprint out on the West Coast. So this would benefit the PSX Midstream segment. But if our footprint were to expand into other locations for renewable, clearly that may overlap with some PSXP assets.\nKevin Mitchell: Yes. And I would just say, Jeremy, as long as it generates its qualifying EBITDA from that standpoint for the MLP then those types of assets would lend themselves to that structure. So, there's no reason to think that if we had those types of assets within the broader portfolio, they couldn't be candidates to be in the MLP. So I think there's certainly some something that could be possible in the future.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. And maybe touching on a point you raised there just we \u2013 there's the potential for capacity rationalization on the refinery side in the U.S. Going forward I am just wondering what's PSXP's view on that? How it could impact the partnership? How do you see the refiners that PSXP stands on the cost curve there?\nTim Roberts: I would tell \u2013 I mean, Jeremy, I think to keep it fairly simple is that really where a lot of the PSXP assets are located around Mid-Con and we feel we have got a highly integrated, highly competitive footprint. And so, we do feel like we're well positioned both now and into the future with those assets and our PSXP is associated with those assets.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. And just want to touch on terminal volumes a little bit there. I think they might have touched down quarter-over-quarter, 3Q into 4Q when we thought maybe they would have ticked up a little bit there. Just wondering if you could touch on drivers to that.\nKevin Mitchell: Yes, I think on the volume piece, it's really just a reflection of refinery utilization. I think that was consistent with what we saw on the pipeline assets as well that you saw the terminal volumes decreased quarter-over-quarter.\nOperator: John Mackay with Goldman Sachs, your line is open.\nJohn Mackay: I just wanted to follow up one more on DAPL. I understand comments you made on this ongoing process. Just looking for maybe a more specific one, you might be able to answer. Just in terms of \u2013 could you talk about what the specific trigger for PSXP needing to share \u2013 needing to fund its share of the DAPL debt would specifically look like? And if this was a temporary shutdown during an EIS for instance, what would happen in that case?\nKevin Mitchell: Yes. John, this is Kevin. A temporary shutdown would be unlikely to trigger an action under the debt. Now, you probably get into a how long is temporary, but the way we think about this sort of big picture is that it would take a permanent shutdown that would be sort of more conclusive in terms of that determination around it being a triggering event. And so that's all laid out within the loan agreements around that in terms of that criteria. And so the way we think about it a temporary shutdown would not be a trigger, the permanent shutdown would be.\nJohn Mackay: I understood. That's helpful. Thank you. Maybe just turning slightly to \u2013 a slight easier one. Can you just comment on the impairment this quarter and what drove that and what assets those where?\nKevin Mitchell: Yes, so we have two impairments both of them were crude oil logistics related, one was a rail terminal in North Dakota, the other was a crude pipeline in the Mid-Continent. In both cases, it's really sort of normal process. We assess all of our assets and then investments for impairment periodically. And just when we look at the future projections around production and revenues, they sort of didn't pass the threshold to maintain the previous book value investment. And so, we took the appropriate impairment.\nJohn Mackay: Great, thank you.\nOperator: We have reached the end of today's call. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.\nJeff Dietert: Thank you. We appreciate your interest in Phillips 66 Partners. And please follow up with Shannon or me if you have any further questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Jeff Dietert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Jeff, you may begin.\nJeff Dietert: Good morning, and welcome to the Phillips 66 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Participants on today's call will include Greg Garland, Chairman and CEO; Kevin Mitchell, EVP and CFO; Bob Herman, EVP, Refining; Brian Mandell, EVP, Marketing and Commercial; and Tim Roberts, EVP of Midstream. Today's presentation material can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website, along with supplemental financial and operating information.

Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our diversified integrated portfolio, strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation enable us to navigate through this challenging market environment. In the third quarter, we delivered improved results in our Midstream, Chemicals and Marketing businesses. We had an adjusted loss of $1 million or $0.01 per share and generated $795 million of operating cash flow, excluding working capital. We're proud of our employees and how they continue to step up to the challenges of 2020, including the pandemic, the West Coast fires, Gulf Coast hurricanes. Most recently, our people responded to the storms by helping their families, their neighbors and safeguarding our assets. Through our employees' commitment to operating excellence, our facilities were secured and sustained minimal damage. Our company has provided $7 million in assistance to our employees and contributions to communities across the Gulf Coast to help those affected by the storms. Our employees continue to execute our strategy with an unwavering focus on operating excellence in what has been a very uncertain and challenging environment. Our year-to-date safety results are exceeding last year's industry-leading performance despite the current challenges. Every day, we strive toward a zero incident, zero accident workplace and to keep our people healthy and safe. In the third quarter, we returned $393 million to our shareholders through dividends. We remain committed to a secure, competitive and growing dividend. Since we formed the company, we returned over $27 billion to shareholders through dividends, share repurchases and exchanges. In the near term, our focus is on ensuring the financial and operational strength of our company and overcoming this period of market weakness. We expect to exceed the $500 million in cost reductions and the $700 million in consolidated capital spending reductions announced earlier this year. We will continue to maintain disciplined capital allocation with a focus on long-term value creation for our shareholders. We're executing our growth strategy and achieved a major milestone with the completion of the Sweeny Hub Phase 2 expansion. We completed the 2 new 150,000 barrel a day fractionators at the Sweeny Hub, bringing the site's total fractionation capacity to 400,000 barrels per day. Frac 2 reached full rates in September, and Frac 3 started operations in October. Both fractionators have operated at rates exceeding design capacity. The fractionators are supported by long-term customer commitments. Phillips 66 Partners continued construction on the C2G pipeline, connecting its Clemens storage caverns to petrochemical facilities in the Corpus Christi area. The project is backed by long-term commitments and is expected to be completed in mid-2021. At the South Texas Gateway Terminal, the first stock and 5.1 million barrels of storage capacity have been commissioned. Terminal operations are expected to ramp up through the end of this year as additional phases of construction are finished. We expect the project to be completed in the first quarter of 2021 with a total storage capacity of 8.6 million barrels and up to 800,000 barrels per day of export capacity. Phillips 66 partners owns a 25% interest in the terminal. As we wrap up our major projects in execution this year, we expect that total capital spending for 2021 will be $2 billion or less. We look forward to sharing the details of our 2021 capital program with you in December, applying the approval of our Board. Phillips 66 recognizes the climate challenge and is making investments to competitively position the company for a more carbon future. Recently, we announced plans to reconfigure our San Francisco Refinery in Rodeo, California, into the world's largest renewable fuels facility to meet the growing demand for renewable energy. The plant will no longer produce fuels from crude oil, but instead, we'll have the flexibility to run used cooking oil, fats, greases and other feedstocks. Upon completion in early 2024, the facility will have over 50,000 barrels per day or 800 million gallons per year of renewable fuel production capacity. This capital-efficient investment is expected to deliver strong returns. The conversion is expected to reduce the plant's greenhouse gas emissions by 50% and help California meet its low carbon objectives. Earlier this month, CPChem announced its first commercial scale production of polyethylene from recycled mixed waste plastics. This development is an important milestone, further demonstrating CPChem's commitment to proactively help the world find sustainable solutions, including elimination of plastics waste in the environment. We have a dual challenge of providing affordable, abundant, reliable energy to the world and also addressing the global climate challenge. Our company is committed to both while continuing to deliver shareholder returns. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review the financials.\nKevin Mitchell: Thank you, Greg. Hello, everyone. Starting with an overview on slide 4, we summarize our financial results. We reported a third quarter loss of $799 million. We had special items amounting to an after-tax loss of $798 million including impairments related to the planned conversion of the San Francisco refinery to a renewable fuels facility as well as the cancellation of the Red Oak pipeline project. Excluding special items, we had an adjusted loss of $1 million or $0.01 per share. Operating cash flow was $795 million, excluding working capital. Adjusted capital spending for the quarter was $549 million, including $347 million for group projects. We returned $393 million to shareholders through dividends. Moving to slide 5. This slide shows the change in adjusted results from the second quarter to the third quarter, an improvement of $323 million. Adjusted pretax results across all segments were improved, except refining. The income tax benefit was mainly driven by bonus depreciation on assets recently completed and the ability under the CARES Act to carry back net operating losses to previous periods. Slide 6 shows our midstream results. Third quarter adjusted pretax income was $354 million, an increase of $109 million from the previous quarter. Transportation-adjusted pretax income was $202 million, up $72 million from the previous quarter. The increase was due to higher pipeline and terminal volumes supported by recovering demand. Third quarter results reflect a ramp-up of volumes on the Gray Oak pipeline and the start-up of South Texas Gateway Terminal. NGL and other delivered adjusted pretax income of $102 million. The $19 million increase from the prior quarter was due to higher Sweeny Hub volumes and inventory impacts. At the Sweeny Hub, the Freeport LPG export facility averaged 12 cargoes per month, and Frac 1 averaged 120,000 barrels per day. DCP Midstream adjusted pretax income of $50 million was up $18 million from the previous quarter, reflecting hedging impacts. Turning to Chemicals on slide 7. Third quarter adjusted pretax income was $132 million, up $43 million from the second quarter. Olefins and polyolefins' adjusted pretax income was $148 million. The $42 million increase from the previous quarter is due to higher polyethylene margins driven by improved sales prices, partially offset by lower polyethylene volumes and higher operating costs. Global O&P utilization was 94%, reflecting downtime at US Gulf Coast facilities. CPChem proactively shut down facilities in preparation for the storms that made landfall in the third quarter. The facility sustained minimal damage and have returned to normal operations. Adjusted pretax income for SA&S decreased $6 million, primarily due to lower margins, partially offset by higher volumes. During the third quarter, we received $112 million in cash distributions from CPChem. Turning to Refining on slide 8. Refining third quarter adjusted pretax loss was $970 million, down from an adjusted pretax loss of $867 million last quarter. The decrease was due to lower realized margins partially offset by higher volumes. Realized margins for the quarter decreased by 32% to $1.78 per barrel. The decrease reflects tightening crude spreads and the absence of the steep contango market structure experienced in the second quarter. In addition, secondary product margins were lower due to rising crude prices. Crude utilization was 77% compared with 75% last quarter. Improved utilization reflects increased refining runs in the Central Corridor and West Coast regions, partially offset by downtime at Gulf Coast refineries. We shut the Lake Charles refinery in late August and the Alliance refinery in mid-September in preparation for hurricanes Laura and Sally. Lake Charles downtime was extended due to third-party power supply issues following Hurricane Laura, and restart was further delayed by Hurricane Delta. The Lake Charles refinery has safely resumed operations, and Alliance remains down for planned turnaround activity. Pretax turnaround costs were $41 million, in line with the prior quarter. The third quarter green product yield was 85%. Slide 9 covers market capture. The 3:2:1 market crack for the third quarter was $8.17 per barrel compared to $7.47 per barrel in the second quarter. Realized margin was $1.78 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 22%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 35%. Market capture is impacted by refinery configuration. We make less gasoline and more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack. During the quarter, the distillate crack decreased $2.46 per barrel, and the gasoline crack improved $2.27 per barrel. Losses from secondary products of $1.80 per barrel increased $0.85 per barrel from the previous quarter due to rising crude prices. Losses from feedstock were $0.35 per barrel compared with $0.67 per barrel last quarter. The other category reduced realized margins by $2.77 per barrel. This category includes RINs, freight costs, clean product realizations and inventory impacts. Moving to Marketing and Specialties on slide 10. Adjusted third quarter pretax income was $417 million, $124 million higher than the second quarter. Marketing and other increased $107 million due to higher margins and volumes. The marketing business captured strong margins during the quarter and benefited from recovering demand. Specialties increased $17 million due to higher finished lubricants volumes. We reimaged 284 domestic branded sites during the third quarter, bringing the total to approximately 5,000 since the start of the program. In our international marketing business, we reimaged 31 European sites, bringing the total to 143 since the program's inception. Refined product exports in the third quarter were 139,000 barrels per day, a decrease from the prior quarter. On slide 11, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted pretax costs of $213 million, a decrease of $11 million from the prior quarter. The improvement is primarily due to lower employee-related expenses, partially offset by higher net interest expense. Slide 12 shows the change in cash for the quarter. We started the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash on our balance sheet. Cash from operations was $795 million, excluding working capital. There was a working capital use of $304 million driven by an increase in tax receivables. Our net debt issuances were $70 million. Adjusted capital spending was $549 million. We expect full year 2020 adjusted capital to be approximately $2.9 billion. We returned $393 million to shareholders through dividends. Our ending cash balance was $1.5 billion. We remain focused on conserving cash and maintaining strong liquidity in the current environment. At September 30, we had $7 billion of committed liquidity, reflecting $1.5 billion of cash plus available capacity on our credit facilities of $5 billion at Phillips 66 and $0.5 billion of Phillips 66 Partners. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In Chemicals, we expect the fourth quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, crude utilization will be adjusted according to market conditions. In October, utilization has been in the mid-60% range, impacted by downtime at the Lake Charles and Alliance refineries. We expect fourth quarter pretax turnaround expenses to be between $80 million and $100 million. We anticipate fourth quarter Corporate and Other costs come in between $220 million and $230 million pretax. With that, we'll now open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks so much guys, and good morning. My opening question is around the balance sheet and the dividend outlook from here. I think the message today is that you guys view the dividend as sustainable, but can you just talk to that? And then can you also just give us some flavor, maybe this is for Kevin, about conversations with the ratings agencies about credit, and how do you feel about where your balance sheet position is right now?\nGreg Garland: Let me take the first part and Kevin take the second. I think, I mean, Neil, first of all, one of the things I've learned is you never say never right in this business. But all the actions that we've taken to date, cutting our costs, cutting our CapEx, increasing our liquidity have been around defending the dividend. And as you look at Q3, essentially, we covered our CapEx and our dividend through cash. Certainly, we feel comfortable as we -- if things don't get any better and we stay kind of where we're at, then we feel really comfortable that our first dollar is going to go stay in capital at $1 billion, our second dollar is going to go to the dividend, $1.6 billion that we can cover sustaining CapEx and our dividend from our cash. I think that's one of the great strengths of the PSX portfolio and the diversified nature of our portfolio. So I'll let Kevin talk a little bit about the balance sheet and expectations there.\nKevin Mitchell: Yes. So we've consistently expressed our objective to maintain a strong balance sheet, keep that financial flexibility, and that's reflected in our credit ratings, A3 at Moody's and BBB+ at S&P. As you would expect, this year with a couple of debt issuances that we've done, we've had plenty of opportunity to have conversations with the rating agencies. Those have gone well. Our ratings have stayed where they are. We've had no actions, and we still have a stable outlook on the current rating. So we feel good about that. In the event that we need to go to the balance sheet, we feel pretty comfortable that we still have decent capacity without having a detrimental impact on the overall health of the balance sheet. So you think from a long-term standpoint, our objective is to have a solid investment-grade credit rating, and we're clearly there at this point. We've added some debt. We've also talked about a 30% debt-to-capital ratio. We're above that right now. I think as we come through this current situation, then we were able to get debt back down, we'd anticipate that over time, we'd like to see ourselves back in around about that range. But we've always said that's not an absolute target. The real objective is to maintain the solid investment-grade credit ratings, and we're comfortably there, and we feel good that we can stay there.\nNeil Mehta: Great. And a follow-up is just around marketing. It was a strong quarter there. Just any flavor in terms of what drove the outperformance? And real time, what are you seeing for demand in the markets that you serve?\nGreg Garland: Thanks, Neil. Yeah, we're very happy with the marketing earnings in Q3 versus Q2. We were up 40% on margins in the U.S. and 16% on volume. Overseas, we were up 23% on margins and volumes as well. I think a number of things. If you look at Q2, underlying commodity flat price came off hard in April, and it was up May and June. And as you know, flat price is inversely correlated to marketing margins. So that that helped our margins a good bit. Also, the volumes, of course, were up in Q3 versus Q2 when COVID was more fierce during the Q2 time period. Currently, we're seeing gasoline off about 10% in the U.S. And when we talked to our large truck stop customers, they say that until recently, diesel demand was back up to pre-COVID levels, but they've started to see it come off a bit, 3%, 4% type levels. Overseas, we were back up to 100% of demand peak-COVID levels. Currently, with lockdowns tightening just a bit, we're seeing those levels come off just a few percentage points, but happy with where we've gotten to from the lows in early Q2.\nKevin Mitchell: One thing I might add, we've seen strength on the West Coast. The port of -- LA Port is up 13% year-on-year. And we're actually seeing PADD 5 diesel demand up year-on-year. So some strength, especially on the West Coast.\nOperator: Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPhil Gresh: Yes, hi. Good afternoon. Just want to start with the question on refining here. Some of your peers are acknowledging that the U.S. industry needs to close 1 million barrels a day of capacity in order to balance the market. You guys have, obviously, taken some action here with Rodeo. I'm curious how you think about the U.S. refining industry, the amount of capacity that needs to close? And with respect to the existing system as it stands and where utilization is, how do you think about your individual refineries and whether it makes sense to have a temporary idling or permanent idling at some point for another refinery? Thank you.\nBob Herman: Yeah, Neil, it's Bob. I think we would agree there needs to continue to be some rationalization between the U.S. and the European refining system. But specifically in the U.S., right, the refineries run the gamut between really strong and there's some -- maybe some weaker assets out there. But fundamentally, the U.S. refining system is the most complex, lowest cost refining system with the exception of maybe a couple of big assets in the Middle East. So I think as demand rationalizes over time, the U.S. is really positioned to be a strong player. You'll see some export activity that will rise over time into Latin America and South America into West Africa, but the U.S. really does stand to take up that mantle as we go forward. Having said that, there will be assets that will continue to rationalize out of this, and you've seen it on both the east coast and the west coast, and no doubt, some of the maybe landlock players as time goes on here we'll have difficulties as crude diffs remain squeezed in the U.S. Jeff, you've got some numbers on closure so far.\nBrian Mandell: Yeah. We've been tracking announced refinery closures. And in fact, we've had to revise it three times this week. I think we're up to almost 2 million barrels a day of announced closures globally. There's another 700,000 barrels a day of temporary closures and then another 700,000 barrels a day of refineries that have talked about potential of converting into terminals or other activities. So 3 million to 3.5 million barrels a day globally. It's kind of split regionally with equal parts of U.S., Europe, and Asia. We've even seen an Australia refinery that's been announced closure earlier today. And as you listen to many of the integrated oil companies, they've made comments on planning to further reduce their exposure in the downstream. So we're moving rapidly through rationalization. I think as we watch diesel inventories come off really hard over the last few weeks here, I think that's a little bit of this tunnel for margins to improve. And with margins improving, utilization will come back as the market dictates. But until that kind of happens, I don't think we'll see it. The growth in GDP numbers this last week, I think, are a really good bow whether that says diesel demand should continue to strengthen into the winter and the normal cold season and the burning of heating oil in the North is going to be a help. So I think we might be in a position to tug a little water here for a couple of months. But I think it's setting ourselves up that as we get to spring and look forward into next year's gasoline season, that we do have a real chance of returning to a lot more normalcy in the margin structure and then utilization.\nPhil Gresh: Okay. Great. Thank you for all that. Just a follow-up on your own refining performance here in the quarter and the pace of margin normalization, how do you think about, I guess, the capture rates that you've been seeing this quarter and last quarter? Obviously, hurricane effects. Kevin, you called out a number of factors in the other bucket that were headwinds here in the quarter. So how do you think about the sensitivity of capture rates to the overall margin profile? And as we move forward, if margins get better, captures get better and things like that versus maybe some one-off items that may have happened in the quarter?\nBrian Mandell: Yes. I think the way, I look at the capture rate is when you've got cracks that are down in the $6 to $8 range, right, those are -- that part is kind of covering your cost. And then crude diffs are really, as a refining system, where we make our money. And when we haven't -- we've seen very tight crude diffs on just about every flavor of crude across our system. So it's hard to get much crack expansion there. The other thing that plays into it, too, when you're at low utilization and low cracks, kind of the fixed part of the barrel, which is the 11% or 12% that we don't turn into clean product. That kind of $2 offset that you see on those margins is a lot bigger deal at an $8 margin than it was at a $15 margin. So that -- those 2 factors for me really come in and kind of camp down that margin capture ability.\nOperator: Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nRoger Read: Yes, thanks good morning. I guess I'd maybe like change the direction a little bit from refining to the midstream. Greg, probably a question for you. But one of the pushbacks we get is with E&P is changing behavior, maybe a little less production growth in coming years. You've built out a lot in the midstream. Can you kind of characterize for us how midstream should perform in a maybe more static or production growth market? And what your exposure would be to any sort of, let's say, reprice on tariffs or export fees and so forth?\nGreg Garland: Tim, I'll let you take that.\nTim Roberts: Yes, Roger, on that, a couple of things when you look at our portfolio specifically is that we've been in earnest trying to develop MDCs and make sure we get commitments. And so those have been very important for us with regard to long-term commitments, MDCs with good counterparties, investment-grade. So, that's been very helpful for our portfolio, especially on the third-parties. But then also as a sponsored MLP, we have quite a bit of exposure with regard to PSX. So that helps to also shore up some of our earnings volatility, you see. But also just on a fundamental basis, we do see that there will be basin growth. Yes, granted everyone's state of uncertainty and what's going on out there and they're retrenching a bit. But we still think there's going to be a call on managed shale with regard to global demand to support growth in that area over the next couple of years. And the other part I would say just when you look at our portfolio specifically, it's just really that we really participate in the crude side. But we're also got a good weighting with regard to the NGL space as well, which actually during this time has been rather resilient and supporting by chemicals, global chemicals demand, growth, res com, and then subsequently also going into the motor fuel pool as well.\nGreg Garland: I think the average term across our portfolio is probably eight-ish years. And so we've got some time to ride through this. I do agree that the next one- to three-year period, there's going to be fewer investable opportunities in midstream, and this is going to become more of a run well and optimized business for many people. I think you'll see some consolidation of midstream over the next couple of years. And so I think that the model going forward the next couple of years is it's going to be a little bit different than the model we've executed the last five years. And the other thing I would say is somewhere around 80% probably across the portfolio is under MDCs. And so we think we're really set up well to ride through this next couple of years of our Midstream business and still deliver great performance in our midstream business.\nRoger Read: Great. Thanks. And just a follow-up Kevin for you. The working capital related tax adjustment, can you kind of walk us through working capital expectations into the end of the year? Typically, I think Philips gets a pretty big pull on working capital. And then part on the tax, when would you expect to recover the actual tax receivable there?\nKevin Mitchell: Yes. Okay. So, on the tax component, as you see on the financial statement, a significant tax benefit on the income statement, but that's not turning into cash in the current year, that's flowing through the receivable. And on a year-to-date basis, we've increased our tax receivable by $1.2 billion, $1. 3 billion year-to-date and that, we would anticipate collecting next year post completion of our 2020 tax return and so we would expect that to turn into cash sometime in the second quarter of next year. From a broader working capital expectation going into the third quarter, you're going to see two dynamics going on. One is, to the extent that the current operating environment stays as it's been which appears to be then from a tax standpoint, you'd still expect to be generating losses and so you'll have that negative effect on working capital. But we typically have an inventory draw in the fourth quarter and we anticipate that happening again this year. And so that will generate some positive cash from a working capital perspective.\nOperator: Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I hope you are all doing well there. Greg, I wonder if I could just pick up on the comment you made there about a slightly different business model for the midstream than we've seen in the last five years. I wonder if I could ask you to elaborate on that with specific focus on your ownership structure of PSXP?\nGreg Garland: Well, I think that \u2013 I mean, first of all, I think that the upstream and the pace of drilling upstream will determine the pace of opportunities in midstream for any future growth. So we talked about that a lot, and so we'll see. I suspect we're in a period of stronger capital discipline from the upstream players in a mode of returning more capital to shareholders, which will by definition, probably slow the growth of upstream. And conversely, that will limit the investable opportunities in midstream. So we recognize that. We're supportive of that. We think that's the right thing for the energy space long term in our country. For PSXP, it still highlights the value of our midstream business, and we like that. I think that it's a model that will continue to move forward. We evaluate alternative scenarios for PSXP, just like we do for any other asset in our portfolio as we move forward. But at this point in time, we still like the MLP structure. I think we would all acknowledge that the life cycle of an MLP has probably been shortened versus what it was maybe five years ago or six years ago. Kevin, I don't know, or Tim, if you want to add anything to that?\nKevin Mitchell: No, I think you covered that.\nDoug Leggate: Okay. I don't want to elaborate too much on that. But when you see it trading with a 15% yield, Greg, would it make sense to buy that in at some point?\nGreg Garland: Yes, I think \u2013 well, for PSXP, certainly, I would say we're not happy with where the units are trading, and we look at that 15% yield and scratch your head a little bit, Doug. But I also think that PSXP has a bit \u2013 has that DAPL overhang. And I think that if you look at where the units are trading today, I think most people are priced in a complete shutdown of Apple. And so we're not there. But that's in the hands of someone else and a judge that, hopefully, I guess, year-end or early next year, we'll get a determination on that. So I don't know, Tim or Jeff, you want to add anything to that. But the overhang is what we're looking at right now.\nJeff Dietert: That's right.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks, guys. My follow-up is kind of a broad question. I don't know which one of you guys wants to answer this, but we got an election in three or four days in case you weren't aware. But what do you see as the principal risks to your business? Whether it would be tax? Whether it would be regulation? Whether it would be something like DAPL, just give us a quick summary as to how you're preparing for a potential, the change in administration?\nGreg Garland: Well, first of all, for clarity, I don't know to answer that questions. So I guess this falls to me to give an answer. So I think in a BBB scenario, there's no question that from a regulatory standpoint, it's going to be a tougher environment for all kinds of infrastructure. But energy, in particular, our base case view is probably going to something more like we saw eight years under the Obama, Biden administration than what we've seen for the last four years. I do think that infrastructure is going to be harder to permit. I think pipelines, in particular, will be harder to permit. So you can make a case that the existing pipes probably worth more in the ground under that kind of scenario. I think with that question, corporate taxes are going to go up in that scenario, which, by the way, should help the MLP structure just in terms of relative cost of capital versus a C-corp. So we're looking at that. And then we'll see where we end up on climate and climate solutions. But I think that the odds are probably higher than have some sort of cost of carbon that emerges with time in a BBB scenario versus the status quo. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it holistically and kind of the impacts to our business. Jeff, I don't know if you want to add anything?\nJeff Dietert: It's well then.\nOperator: Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. Good morning guys. \nJeff Dietert: Good morning.\nPaul Cheng: Greg, if I can follow-up on that but string it to Europe. With the new kind of now going to -- get low on and most side get past very soon. How that -- you're looking at your asset in Europe and how -- what's the game plan? Do you need to fundamentally change how you operate the refining and also the retail operation? And the second question\u2026\nGreg Garland: Paul, I'm sorry, I missed the first part of that question.\nPaul Cheng: The first part is that with the European, the EU going to go on the climate law, how that is going to change your operation? And what is the game plan for your European assets, whether that you need to fundamentally change the way how you operate, or that -- I mean, do you have any view that under the new climate law, how those assets should be? So that's the first question. The second question is that you're somewhat related. In your larger customers in Europe, they're all coming up with a formal energy transition plan, and we assume that at a Biden administration, as Doug has asked the question. So does the Phillips 66 need to formulate a formal energy transition plan? And is that -- does that involve more in some form of diversifying into other business? Like your larger customer, they all get into the renewable or low carbon electricity power business. So is that something you guys will be interested or that you're saying, you know what, this is different, and it's not for us.\nGreg Garland: So I'll take a stab at that, Paul. I mean first of all, there's aspirational goals out there. And there's probably reality and what can actually be accomplished during that timeframe. And so I think our view is that fossil fuels on both in transportation and, like, power generation are going to be around for quite a long time, multiple decades. That doesn't mean there's not more that we can do in terms of energy transition. Obviously, for us, the things that are nearest to us like renewable diesel, those kind of opportunities where you see us starting to move in those areas. By the way, including in Rodeo, we're looking at carbon capture, we're looking at solar in conjunction with that project. So I think you'll see us move in those areas. We're starting to add hydrogen fueling stations in Europe with our partner Coop in Switzerland. We are part of the Giga Stack consortium in the United Kingdom, which is essentially green hydrogen. We have offshore wind trays producing hydrogen to be consumed in the industrial base in the Humber side area. And so I think we continue to study and look at that. We think hydrogen is really multiple decades away. It's a big step forward in terms of transportation fuel. A lot of it, it's technology, it's cost. The green hydrogen is probably five to seven times more than the steam reforming of methane. And so I think that there's some opportunities there. We continue to work our battery technology. We're working on next-generation batteries in our research and development, solid oxide fuel cell development also in our research and development areas. And so we've got quite a bit going on in terms of energy transition within the portfolio. But the nearest easiest steps for us to take are really to move towards lower carbon intensity fuels like the projects at Rodeo, like Rise. Also, we're -- Humber, we're making about 1,000 barrels a day of renewable diesel, going about 4,000 to 5,000 barrels a day here shortly. We've got a project -- San Francisco actually comes on, I think, first quarter next year. Yeah, why don't you talk about that? What we've got going on?\nTim Roberts: Yeah. So we've announced the big project at Rodeo, But before that comes on, while we're still running a fuels refinery there, we're converting one of our hydrocrackers to be able to run soybean-based oils to make our renewable diesel, and that unit will produce about 9,000 barrels a day at a very attractive capital efficiency on that project. And that sets us up to begin the -- setting up our supply chains into Rodeo and our marketing chains on the other side of that for the renewable diesel out of Rodeo. The next step we'll take then is the commercial agreement we have with Rise, who is building two renewable diesel facilities, one in Reno, one in Las Vegas, where we will supply the feedstocks and take all of the renewable diesel offtake, be able to put that into the California market. That's our next step forward in late 2020 and 2021. And then we would expect to have the permitting done sometime in 2022 and begin the conversion of the Rodeo refinery to eventually have the largest renewable diesel facility in the world and make about 50,000 barrels a day of renewable diesel. Feedstocks for that, our premise to be about 80% of the harder-to-process feedstock. So that's used cooking oil, fast oils, greases, telos [ph] from a variety of sources around the world. And Rodeo is really uniquely positioned because, A, we sit in the California market where there's a high demand for lower carbon intensity fuels. And secondly, we have water access to the Far East to bring in all of these difficult-to-process renewable feedstocks. So the second piece is that it's a hydrocracking facility. We have two high-pressure hydrocrackers there that will be converted to both process renewable feedstocks and very capital efficient. At the end of the day, we will convert the facility and build the pretreatment facilities for a total capital cost of about $1 per gallon per year of capacity. That's 50% cheaper than anything else we've seen announced and sometimes three times cheaper than some of the competing projects we've seen in that. So we feel really good that by 2024, we will be a major player in the renewable fuels in California and other places in the United States.\nGreg Garland: I think just to highlight, the $750 million to $800 million, that's one of the biggest projects we have in the portfolio at this time. So we're making a substantial investment there.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nOperator: Manav Gupta from Credit Suisse, please go ahead, your line is open.\nManav Gupta: Hi, guys. You mentioned about 80% lower CI feedstock and 20%, most likely soybean and canola. Generally, in the current market, what kind of discounts are these lower CI, harder-to-process feedstock carrying versus the soya bean oil? So, soya bean oil is trading at $0.33 per pound, like where are these harder-to-process feedstocks trading at a discount to soya bean oil?\nGreg Garland: I think, Manav, there's a fair amount of variance from region-to-region on the feedstocks and the transportation cost to get them from point A to point B. So, I think the important thing is, is that we have the flexibility as we operate to pick the lowest cost feedstock in the market. And it's similar to high complexity refining, where you've got a lot of flexibility on what feedstocks and what yields you have. We're building in with the pretreating capability the flexibility to take advantage of the lowest cost, most optimal feedstock in order to produce the renewable diesel. So, we're, I think, well-positioned in that regard.\nManav Gupta: Okay. A quick follow-up is you initially mentioned the multiple storms that hit you both in chemicals as well as the refining part. Is there any kind of opportunity cost you lost out because of all these hurricanes, or can you just give us a sequence of like which are the facilities that did get impacted by subsequent hurricanes that hit a Gulf Coast?\nBob Herman: Yes, I'll take a shot at that. On the -- with the first one, if you recall, it seems like a long time ago now, but on August 25th, we shut down the Lake Charles facility for Hurricane Laura and ended up being down all the whole month of September because of the power infrastructure in the General Lake Charles region that was essentially completely destroyed. We did not start restarting that facility until early October. And in fact, we didn't have full power back into the refinery to be able to operate as anything that we wanted to until October 5th. Unfortunately, then on October 9th, Hurricane Delta came essentially right back up the same path. And while it was a lower intensity storm, we still had to shut back down and essentially start over. Power infrastructure held up a little better in that timeframe. So, about the middle of October, we started restarting the Lake Charles facility. So, today, we're back up and running there. We've still got a few units left to start, but we will be market dictating the rate. But we'll be -- everything that we want to be up will be up and running here within the next week or 10 days at Lake Charles. In Alliance, we shut down September 13 for Hurricane Sally, which was originally pointed right at Alliance. We got lucky with that one and that, of course, moved off a little bit, and we did not take a direct hit. We chose to keep Alliance down because we had some maintenance planned for October anyway and rather than restart and shut back down for that, we just moved the maintenance back up. Maybe fortuitous, maybe only in 2020, can you say being down is fortuitous, but Hurricane Zeta came right through that area two nights ago. And so, we were already down, obviously, and didn't have to shut back down for that one. Power was out again in the area. We expect to get power back today or tomorrow to Alliance. But we had pulled forward some work that we wanted to get done there that was difficult to do in future turnarounds, and we anticipate continuing to execute that work sort of through mid-December and then position ourselves to be ready to restart Alliance in the new year, assuming the market conditions are there and giving us the signal that we need to bring on more capacity. We have enough refining capacity in the Gulf Coast, obviously, to cover all of our marketing needs right now and any commitments that we have to our customers. And we'll \u2013 as we gave guidance earlier, we'll let the market tell us what utilization ought to be in the first quarter.\nGreg Garland: And, Manav, just to follow-up on chemicals. So CPChem took down several of their facilities on the Gulf Coast in anticipation of those storm events. They were probably more fortunate than that. They really were not impacted. So everything is back up and running normal now.\nOperator: Matthew Blair from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMatthew Blair: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Greg, do you have an update on whether that potential $0.05 PE increase for October is going through? And do you expect to see the normal seasonal impact in PE later in the quarter, or do you think that low inventories could provide some support on pricing?\nGreg Garland : Yeah. I'll let Tim answer that.\nTim Roberts: Yeah. It looks like at this point in time that, that increase is going to get pushed. There's been a really a nice run-up up to this point in time, and demand has been good, but we think it's more due to seasonality than it is anything else, which is usually like this time of the year, you see a seasonal effect in demand in the chems business.\nGreg Garland : Yeah. I think, the -- you think about margins, so we were kind of $0.18 full time margins in Q1, $0.10 in Q2, $0.19 in Q3 on an IHS Markit margin basis. And today, they're $0.28, $0.29. So they're above mid-cycle. And I think it's been driven by a combination of things. One is, the demand has been fundamentally good across the globe. But we see it in Asia, Europe, we see it in North America, strong demand. And then there's been some impact in terms of the hurricane. So, at some point -- at one point, it was about 20% of the U.S. ethylene capacity was off-line because of the Hurricane Laura. And so, that had some impact. Inventories have come down on the ethylene side. So that's really always positive for margins. And so, I think, our view is, coming into the fourth quarter, we have kind of this seasonal weakness or pause, if you will, in terms of the petrochemical space. But we're relatively optimistic about petrochemicals for next year.\nMatthew Blair: Sounds good. And then, just turning to renewable diesel. So thanks for the update on the feedstocks. I wanted to ask about the permitting in California. Normally, that's kind of a challenge. Do you anticipate an easier route this time because of the nature of the facility? Could you just address that?\nGreg Garland : Yeah, I think so. You're correct. It is always difficult to permit anything in California. And it is a very rote process at the end of the day, and there are many steps that we have to go through. The biggest permit that we have to get is a land use permit in Contra Costa County, and that will require an environmental impact statement and go through all that work. We took a very different approach as a company on this particular project, in that, we made sort of full-court press with many stakeholders in the state of California the day before we announced. So we had multiple conversations in Sacramento, everywhere from Govern Newsom's office to Cal EPA to CARB to local legislators to the local Contra Costa County, Board of Supervisors. And I would say that, we were met with great enthusiasm for this property across the board from those that are going to be responsible at the end of the day for actually permitting it. And in the meantime, the permit is in. It's been deemed complete by Contra Costa County, which really starts the process for them. So they will hire independent third party to do the environmental assessment of that, and that is all beginning. So we're there and ready to help support them through that. We haven't seen really any opposition at this point to the project. And I think as people are understanding more and more the benefits of us doing this project, as we mentioned, the environmental benefits and NOCs, SOCs and greenhouse gas reductions, we think the permitting process will flow through. And it's kind of a normal timeline and look forward to getting that permit in early 2022.\nOperator: Theresa Chen from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nTheresa Chen: Hi. Going back to some of the earlier comments on supply rationalization in the market and just thinking about the overall demand-supply balance for refining capacity, how do you view the probability weighted quantity of supply that is new supply that's coming into the market in the Middle East and Asia?\nGreg Garland : Yes. So there's about 1 million barrels a day scheduled for 2020, and highly likely that some of that gets pushed out into 2021. We're seeing a slowdown in activity from a COVID perspective and its impact on labor, as well as capital cost reductions in the industry. So I think those barrels are going to get pushed out as we look today, there's not a real reason to rush any of these projects into service.\nTheresa Chen: Got it. And turning back to the West Coast, thank you for all the color on the renewable diesel projects and your thoughts around that. I was curious to hear how you view the whole electrification theme. Given the recently ordered [indiscernible] from Newsom's office and the 9 other states in the U.S. considering similar orders as well as the legislation produced to Congress and mandate on the federal level. Can you talk about your views on these aspirations maybe meeting wall of reality?\nGreg Garland : So yes, I'll take a stab, and then Bob can help me because he's pretty active in this area. But I think these are aspirational goals. And I think that -- I think the sign post we're going to watch for is when billions, if not trillions of dollars start flowing in infrastructure investments around distribution, power generation, etcetera, that you could truly electrify the fleets. So I'm probably more bullish on low carbon fuel standard as we think about it moving from California, Oregon, Washington State to maybe to the East Coast. And so I think the near term, easier things to do in terms of renewables that can lower carbon intensity. Those make sense that you can earn good returns doing those projects. And I think the electrification is going to take a long time to get there.\nBob Herman: Yes. And I think we would agree with the AFPM has got a statement out there that we would stand behind solid with you, and that Governor Newsom doesn't actually have the authority to do what his aspirational executive order played out. And you just think about the logistics of banning ICE in California, but there's these states around the call of Arizona, Nevada organ that have car dealerships, too. So it's hard to understand how this actually becomes a reality when there really isn't enough electricity in California today for base demand.\nOperator: Benny Wong from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBenny Wong: Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for taking my questions.\nJeff Dietert: Good morning.\nBenny Wong: Good morning, Jeff. First one around Alberta production limits being lifted in December. Want to get you a sense what you think that might have an impact on Canadian crude differentials? And how it might cause you to shift your feedstock sourcing strategy, given you guys are one of the largest importers of the Canadian crude?\nBrian Mandell: Hi, Benny, this is Brian. Hey, on Canadian crude, until just a few weeks ago, it was it's 4.2 million barrels of pipeline capacity out of Canada, and there wasn't 4.2 million barrels of production with some core issues and Polaris pipeline issues. Now we're starting to see the production come back. We're starting to see more production than pipeline capacity. So our view is, over time, it will take some time, we think that the differentials will start to widen out to variable rail rates, which we see about 13 50 off of WTI. So that's good for us. Every dollar is about $100 million for Phillips 66. So we continue to watch that. Actually, you've seen the past few weeks, the differentials were under $10, and now, as of yesterday, $10.60, so they're already starting to expand.\nBenny Wong: Great. Thanks for the color, yes. My follow-up is maybe for Greg. Greg, you and your team has always had a longer perspective of the world, and that often translates into how you run the business. And I think in the past, you have guided us to think about Phillips 66, generating a mid-cycle EBITDA of about $9 billion. Recognizing it's uncertain times, but just wanted to get your thoughts and maybe a degree of confidence if that mid-cycle level EBITDA generation is still reasonable? And if it is, how do we get back there? Is it refining rationalization alone? Can it get back to us there? Thanks.\nGreg Garland: Yes. I think shorter term, we still got a little bit of an inventory overhang we've got to work through. I mean directionally, inventories have been moving the right way. So we feel relatively good about that. But I think that we won't clean it up in 4Q. We may get a shot at it in 1Q. But certainly, we think as we approach the summer driving season in 2Q that we'll have an opportunity to see margins more normalized and for us. So we're talking about CPChem. Essentially, the market margin is above mid-cycle today. Our Midstream business is going to continue to perform well. Our Marketing and Specialty businesses has been a very consistent [indiscernible] EBITDA business. So the real question, Mark, on the PSX portfolio is when does refunding get back to mid-cycle conditions? And so we probably got a shot at doing that kind of midyear next year. So Jeff or Bob, do you want to add anything to that?\nJeff Dietert: Yes, I would just add that at CPChem, the addition of U.S. Gulf Coast 1 came at a time when margins were declining. And so the earnings power of that facility has really not been shown in a mid-cycle margin environment. So, I think that will be supportive of higher contributions from CPChem.\nOperator: We have reached the end of today's call. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.\nJeff Dietert: Thank you for your interest in Phillips 66. Before I wrap up, I'd like to thank Brent Shaw for his significant contributions to the Investor Relations Group. Brent's been promoted to another role at Phillips 66 and I'd like to welcome Shannon Holy to the IR team. Thank you very much for your time today and please call Shannon or me with any questions.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Tim Roberts",
            "content": "Yes, Roger, on that, a couple of things when you look at our portfolio specifically is that we've been in earnest trying to develop MDCs and make sure we get commitments. And so those have been very important for us with regard to long-term commitments, MDCs with good counterparties, investment-grade. So, that's been very helpful for our portfolio, especially on the third-parties. But then also as a sponsored MLP, we have quite a bit of exposure with regard to PSX. So that helps to also shore up some of our earnings volatility, you see. But also just on a fundamental basis, we do see that there will be basin growth. Yes, granted everyone's state of uncertainty and what's going on out there and they're retrenching a bit. But we still think there's going to be a call on managed shale with regard to global demand to support growth in that area over the next couple of years. And the other part I would say just when you look at our portfolio specifically, it's just really that we really participate in the crude side. But we're also got a good weighting with regard to the NGL space as well, which actually during this time has been rather resilient and supporting by chemicals, global chemicals demand, growth, res com, and then subsequently also going into the motor fuel pool as well. Yeah. So we've announced the big project at Rodeo, But before that comes on, while we're still running a fuels refinery there, we're converting one of our hydrocrackers to be able to run soybean-based oils to make our renewable diesel, and that unit will produce about 9,000 barrels a day at a very attractive capital efficiency on that project. And that sets us up to begin the -- setting up our supply chains into Rodeo and our marketing chains on the other side of that for the renewable diesel out of Rodeo. The next step we'll take then is the commercial agreement we have with Rise, who is building two renewable diesel facilities, one in Reno, one in Las Vegas, where we will supply the feedstocks and take all of the renewable diesel offtake, be able to put that into the California market. That's our next step forward in late 2020 and 2021. And then we would expect to have the permitting done sometime in 2022 and begin the conversion of the Rodeo refinery to eventually have the largest renewable diesel facility in the world and make about 50,000 barrels a day of renewable diesel. Feedstocks for that, our premise to be about 80% of the harder-to-process feedstock. So that's used cooking oil, fast oils, greases, telos [ph] from a variety of sources around the world. And Rodeo is really uniquely positioned because, A, we sit in the California market where there's a high demand for lower carbon intensity fuels. And secondly, we have water access to the Far East to bring in all of these difficult-to-process renewable feedstocks. So the second piece is that it's a hydrocracking facility. We have two high-pressure hydrocrackers there that will be converted to both process renewable feedstocks and very capital efficient. At the end of the day, we will convert the facility and build the pretreatment facilities for a total capital cost of about $1 per gallon per year of capacity. That's 50% cheaper than anything else we've seen announced and sometimes three times cheaper than some of the competing projects we've seen in that. So we feel really good that by 2024, we will be a major player in the renewable fuels in California and other places in the United States. Yeah. It looks like at this point in time that, that increase is going to get pushed. There's been a really a nice run-up up to this point in time, and demand has been good, but we think it's more due to seasonality than it is anything else, which is usually like this time of the year, you see a seasonal effect in demand in the chems business."

            "name": "Brian Mandell",
            "content": "Yeah. We've been tracking announced refinery closures. And in fact, we've had to revise it three times this week. I think we're up to almost 2 million barrels a day of announced closures globally. There's another 700,000 barrels a day of temporary closures and then another 700,000 barrels a day of refineries that have talked about potential of converting into terminals or other activities. So 3 million to 3.5 million barrels a day globally. It's kind of split regionally with equal parts of U.S., Europe, and Asia. We've even seen an Australia refinery that's been announced closure earlier today. And as you listen to many of the integrated oil companies, they've made comments on planning to further reduce their exposure in the downstream. So we're moving rapidly through rationalization. I think as we watch diesel inventories come off really hard over the last few weeks here, I think that's a little bit of this tunnel for margins to improve. And with margins improving, utilization will come back as the market dictates. But until that kind of happens, I don't think we'll see it. The growth in GDP numbers this last week, I think, are a really good bow whether that says diesel demand should continue to strengthen into the winter and the normal cold season and the burning of heating oil in the North is going to be a help. So I think we might be in a position to tug a little water here for a couple of months. But I think it's setting ourselves up that as we get to spring and look forward into next year's gasoline season, that we do have a real chance of returning to a lot more normalcy in the margin structure and then utilization. Yes. I think the way, I look at the capture rate is when you've got cracks that are down in the $6 to $8 range, right, those are -- that part is kind of covering your cost. And then crude diffs are really, as a refining system, where we make our money. And when we haven't -- we've seen very tight crude diffs on just about every flavor of crude across our system. So it's hard to get much crack expansion there. The other thing that plays into it, too, when you're at low utilization and low cracks, kind of the fixed part of the barrel, which is the 11% or 12% that we don't turn into clean product. That kind of $2 offset that you see on those margins is a lot bigger deal at an $8 margin than it was at a $15 margin. So that -- those 2 factors for me really come in and kind of camp down that margin capture ability. Hi, Benny, this is Brian. Hey, on Canadian crude, until just a few weeks ago, it was it's 4.2 million barrels of pipeline capacity out of Canada, and there wasn't 4.2 million barrels of production with some core issues and Polaris pipeline issues. Now we're starting to see the production come back. We're starting to see more production than pipeline capacity. So our view is, over time, it will take some time, we think that the differentials will start to widen out to variable rail rates, which we see about 13 50 off of WTI. So that's good for us. Every dollar is about $100 million for Phillips 66. So we continue to watch that. Actually, you've seen the past few weeks, the differentials were under $10, and now, as of yesterday, $10.60, so they're already starting to expand."

            "name": "Bob Herman",
            "content": "Yeah, Neil, it's Bob. I think we would agree there needs to continue to be some rationalization between the U.S. and the European refining system. But specifically in the U.S., right, the refineries run the gamut between really strong and there's some -- maybe some weaker assets out there. But fundamentally, the U.S. refining system is the most complex, lowest cost refining system with the exception of maybe a couple of big assets in the Middle East. So I think as demand rationalizes over time, the U.S. is really positioned to be a strong player. You'll see some export activity that will rise over time into Latin America and South America into West Africa, but the U.S. really does stand to take up that mantle as we go forward. Having said that, there will be assets that will continue to rationalize out of this, and you've seen it on both the east coast and the west coast, and no doubt, some of the maybe landlock players as time goes on here we'll have difficulties as crude diffs remain squeezed in the U.S. Jeff, you've got some numbers on closure so far. Yes, I'll take a shot at that. On the -- with the first one, if you recall, it seems like a long time ago now, but on August 25th, we shut down the Lake Charles facility for Hurricane Laura and ended up being down all the whole month of September because of the power infrastructure in the General Lake Charles region that was essentially completely destroyed. We did not start restarting that facility until early October. And in fact, we didn't have full power back into the refinery to be able to operate as anything that we wanted to until October 5th. Unfortunately, then on October 9th, Hurricane Delta came essentially right back up the same path. And while it was a lower intensity storm, we still had to shut back down and essentially start over. Power infrastructure held up a little better in that timeframe. So, about the middle of October, we started restarting the Lake Charles facility. So, today, we're back up and running there. We've still got a few units left to start, but we will be market dictating the rate. But we'll be -- everything that we want to be up will be up and running here within the next week or 10 days at Lake Charles. In Alliance, we shut down September 13 for Hurricane Sally, which was originally pointed right at Alliance. We got lucky with that one and that, of course, moved off a little bit, and we did not take a direct hit. We chose to keep Alliance down because we had some maintenance planned for October anyway and rather than restart and shut back down for that, we just moved the maintenance back up. Maybe fortuitous, maybe only in 2020, can you say being down is fortuitous, but Hurricane Zeta came right through that area two nights ago. And so, we were already down, obviously, and didn't have to shut back down for that one. Power was out again in the area. We expect to get power back today or tomorrow to Alliance. But we had pulled forward some work that we wanted to get done there that was difficult to do in future turnarounds, and we anticipate continuing to execute that work sort of through mid-December and then position ourselves to be ready to restart Alliance in the new year, assuming the market conditions are there and giving us the signal that we need to bring on more capacity.

            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our diversified integrated portfolio, strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation enable us to navigate through this challenging market environment. In the third quarter, we delivered improved results in our Midstream, Chemicals and Marketing businesses. We had an adjusted loss of $1 million or $0.01 per share and generated $795 million of operating cash flow, excluding working capital. We're proud of our employees and how they continue to step up to the challenges of 2020, including the pandemic, the West Coast fires, Gulf Coast hurricanes. Most recently, our people responded to the storms by helping their families, their neighbors and safeguarding our assets. Through our employees' commitment to operating excellence, our facilities were secured and sustained minimal damage. Our company has provided $7 million in assistance to our employees and contributions to communities across the Gulf Coast to help those affected by the storms. Our employees continue to execute our strategy with an unwavering focus on operating excellence in what has been a very uncertain and challenging environment. Our year-to-date safety results are exceeding last year's industry-leading performance despite the current challenges. Every day, we strive toward a zero incident, zero accident workplace and to keep our people healthy and safe. In the third quarter, we returned $393 million to our shareholders through dividends. We remain committed to a secure, competitive and growing dividend. Since we formed the company, we returned over $27 billion to shareholders through dividends, share repurchases and exchanges. In the near term, our focus is on ensuring the financial and operational strength of our company and overcoming this period of market weakness. We expect to exceed the $500 million in cost reductions and the $700 million in consolidated capital spending reductions announced earlier this year. We will continue to maintain disciplined capital allocation with a focus on long-term value creation for our shareholders. We're executing our growth strategy and achieved a major milestone with the completion of the Sweeny Hub Phase 2 expansion. We completed the 2 new 150,000 barrel a day fractionators at the Sweeny Hub, bringing the site's total fractionation capacity to 400,000 barrels per day. Frac 2 reached full rates in September, and Frac 3 started operations in October. Both fractionators have operated at rates exceeding design capacity. The fractionators are supported by long-term customer commitments. Phillips 66 Partners continued construction on the C2G pipeline, connecting its Clemens storage caverns to petrochemical facilities in the Corpus Christi area. The project is backed by long-term commitments and is expected to be completed in mid-2021. At the South Texas Gateway Terminal, the first stock and 5.1 million barrels of storage capacity have been commissioned. Terminal operations are expected to ramp up through the end of this year as additional phases of construction are finished. We expect the project to be completed in the first quarter of 2021 with a total storage capacity of 8.6 million barrels and up to 800,000 barrels per day of export capacity. Phillips 66 partners owns a 25% interest in the terminal. As we wrap up our major projects in execution this year, we expect that total capital spending for 2021 will be $2 billion or less. We look forward to sharing the details of our 2021 capital program with you in December, applying the approval of our Board. Phillips 66 recognizes the climate challenge and is making investments to competitively position the company for a more carbon future. Recently, we announced plans to reconfigure our San Francisco Refinery in Rodeo, California, into the world's largest renewable fuels facility to meet the growing demand for renewable energy. The plant will no longer produce fuels from crude oil, but instead, we'll have the flexibility to run used cooking oil, fats, greases and other feedstocks. Upon completion in early 2024, the facility will have over 50,000 barrels per day or 800 million gallons per year of renewable fuel production capacity. This capital-efficient investment is expected to deliver strong returns. The conversion is expected to reduce the plant's greenhouse gas emissions by 50% and help California meet its low carbon objectives. Earlier this month, CPChem announced its first commercial scale production of polyethylene from recycled mixed waste plastics. This development is an important milestone, further demonstrating CPChem's commitment to proactively help the world find sustainable solutions, including elimination of plastics waste in the environment. We have a dual challenge of providing affordable, abundant, reliable energy to the world and also addressing the global climate challenge. Our company is committed to both while continuing to deliver shareholder returns. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review the financials. Let me take the first part and Kevin take the second. I think, I mean, Neil, first of all, one of the things I've learned is you never say never right in this business. But all the actions that we've taken to date, cutting our costs, cutting our CapEx, increasing our liquidity have been around defending the dividend. And as you look at Q3, essentially, we covered our CapEx and our dividend through cash. Certainly, we feel comfortable as we -- if things don't get any better and we stay kind of where we're at, then we feel really comfortable that our first dollar is going to go stay in capital at $1 billion, our second dollar is going to go to the dividend, $1.6 billion that we can cover sustaining CapEx and our dividend from our cash. I think that's one of the great strengths of the PSX portfolio and the diversified nature of our portfolio. So I'll let Kevin talk a little bit about the balance sheet and expectations there. Thanks, Neil. Yeah, we're very happy with the marketing earnings in Q3 versus Q2. We were up 40% on margins in the U.S. and 16% on volume. Overseas, we were up 23% on margins and volumes as well. I think a number of things. If you look at Q2, underlying commodity flat price came off hard in April, and it was up May and June. And as you know, flat price is inversely correlated to marketing margins. So that that helped our margins a good bit. Also, the volumes, of course, were up in Q3 versus Q2 when COVID was more fierce during the Q2 time period. Currently, we're seeing gasoline off about 10% in the U.S. And when we talked to our large truck stop customers, they say that until recently, diesel demand was back up to pre-COVID levels, but they've started to see it come off a bit, 3%, 4% type levels. Overseas, we were back up to 100% of demand peak-COVID levels. Currently, with lockdowns tightening just a bit, we're seeing those levels come off just a few percentage points, but happy with where we've gotten to from the lows in early Q2. Tim, I'll let you take that. I think the average term across our portfolio is probably eight-ish years. And so we've got some time to ride through this. I do agree that the next one- to three-year period, there's going to be fewer investable opportunities in midstream, and this is going to become more of a run well and optimized business for many people. I think you'll see some consolidation of midstream over the next couple of years. And so I think that the model going forward the next couple of years is it's going to be a little bit different than the model we've executed the last five years. And the other thing I would say is somewhere around 80% probably across the portfolio is under MDCs. And so we think we're really set up well to ride through this next couple of years of our Midstream business and still deliver great performance in our midstream business. Well, I think that \u2013 I mean, first of all, I think that the upstream and the pace of drilling upstream will determine the pace of opportunities in midstream for any future growth. So we talked about that a lot, and so we'll see. I suspect we're in a period of stronger capital discipline from the upstream players in a mode of returning more capital to shareholders, which will by definition, probably slow the growth of upstream. And conversely, that will limit the investable opportunities in midstream. So we recognize that. We're supportive of that. We think that's the right thing for the energy space long term in our country. For PSXP, it still highlights the value of our midstream business, and we like that. I think that it's a model that will continue to move forward. We evaluate alternative scenarios for PSXP, just like we do for any other asset in our portfolio as we move forward. But at this point in time, we still like the MLP structure. I think we would all acknowledge that the life cycle of an MLP has probably been shortened versus what it was maybe five years ago or six years ago. Kevin, I don't know, or Tim, if you want to add anything to that? Yes, I think \u2013 well, for PSXP, certainly, I would say we're not happy with where the units are trading, and we look at that 15% yield and scratch your head a little bit, Doug. But I also think that PSXP has a bit \u2013 has that DAPL overhang. And I think that if you look at where the units are trading today, I think most people are priced in a complete shutdown of Apple. And so we're not there. But that's in the hands of someone else and a judge that, hopefully, I guess, year-end or early next year, we'll get a determination on that. So I don't know, Tim or Jeff, you want to add anything to that. But the overhang is what we're looking at right now. Well, first of all, for clarity, I don't know to answer that questions. So I guess this falls to me to give an answer. So I think in a BBB scenario, there's no question that from a regulatory standpoint, it's going to be a tougher environment for all kinds of infrastructure. But energy, in particular, our base case view is probably going to something more like we saw eight years under the Obama, Biden administration than what we've seen for the last four years. I do think that infrastructure is going to be harder to permit. I think pipelines, in particular, will be harder to permit. So you can make a case that the existing pipes probably worth more in the ground under that kind of scenario. I think with that question, corporate taxes are going to go up in that scenario, which, by the way, should help the MLP structure just in terms of relative cost of capital versus a C-corp. So we're looking at that. And then we'll see where we end up on climate and climate solutions. But I think that the odds are probably higher than have some sort of cost of carbon that emerges with time in a BBB scenario versus the status quo. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it holistically and kind of the impacts to our business. Jeff, I don't know if you want to add anything? Paul, I'm sorry, I missed the first part of that question. So I'll take a stab at that, Paul. I mean first of all, there's aspirational goals out there. And there's probably reality and what can actually be accomplished during that timeframe. And so I think our view is that fossil fuels on both in transportation and, like, power generation are going to be around for quite a long time, multiple decades. That doesn't mean there's not more that we can do in terms of energy transition. Obviously, for us, the things that are nearest to us like renewable diesel, those kind of opportunities where you see us starting to move in those areas. By the way, including in Rodeo, we're looking at carbon capture, we're looking at solar in conjunction with that project. So I think you'll see us move in those areas. We're starting to add hydrogen fueling stations in Europe with our partner Coop in Switzerland. We are part of the Giga Stack consortium in the United Kingdom, which is essentially green hydrogen. We have offshore wind trays producing hydrogen to be consumed in the industrial base in the Humber side area. And so I think we continue to study and look at that. We think hydrogen is really multiple decades away. It's a big step forward in terms of transportation fuel. A lot of it, it's technology, it's cost. The green hydrogen is probably five to seven times more than the steam reforming of methane. And so I think that there's some opportunities there. We continue to work our battery technology. We're working on next-generation batteries in our research and development, solid oxide fuel cell development also in our research and development areas. And so we've got quite a bit going on in terms of energy transition within the portfolio. But the nearest easiest steps for us to take are really to move towards lower carbon intensity fuels like the projects at Rodeo, like Rise. Also, we're -- Humber, we're making about 1,000 barrels a day of renewable diesel, going about 4,000 to 5,000 barrels a day here shortly. We've got a project -- San Francisco actually comes on, I think, first quarter next year. Yeah, why don't you talk about that? What we've got going on? I think just to highlight, the $750 million to $800 million, that's one of the biggest projects we have in the portfolio at this time. So we're making a substantial investment there. I think, Manav, there's a fair amount of variance from region-to-region on the feedstocks and the transportation cost to get them from point A to point B. So, I think the important thing is, is that we have the flexibility as we operate to pick the lowest cost feedstock in the market. And it's similar to high complexity refining, where you've got a lot of flexibility on what feedstocks and what yields you have. We're building in with the pretreating capability the flexibility to take advantage of the lowest cost, most optimal feedstock in order to produce the renewable diesel. So, we're, I think, well-positioned in that regard. And, Manav, just to follow-up on chemicals. So CPChem took down several of their facilities on the Gulf Coast in anticipation of those storm events. They were probably more fortunate than that. They really were not impacted. So everything is back up and running normal now. Yeah. I'll let Tim answer that. Yeah. I think, the -- you think about margins, so we were kind of $0.18 full time margins in Q1, $0.10 in Q2, $0.19 in Q3 on an IHS Markit margin basis. And today, they're $0.28, $0.29. So they're above mid-cycle. And I think it's been driven by a combination of things. One is, the demand has been fundamentally good across the globe. But we see it in Asia, Europe, we see it in North America, strong demand. And then there's been some impact in terms of the hurricane. So, at some point -- at one point, it was about 20% of the U.S. ethylene capacity was off-line because of the Hurricane Laura. And so, that had some impact. Inventories have come down on the ethylene side. So that's really always positive for margins. And so, I think, our view is, coming into the fourth quarter, we have kind of this seasonal weakness or pause, if you will, in terms of the petrochemical space. But we're relatively optimistic about petrochemicals for next year. Yeah, I think so. You're correct. It is always difficult to permit anything in California. And it is a very rote process at the end of the day, and there are many steps that we have to go through. The biggest permit that we have to get is a land use permit in Contra Costa County, and that will require an environmental impact statement and go through all that work. We took a very different approach as a company on this particular project, in that, we made sort of full-court press with many stakeholders in the state of California the day before we announced. So we had multiple conversations in Sacramento, everywhere from Govern Newsom's office to Cal EPA to CARB to local legislators to the local Contra Costa County, Board of Supervisors. And I would say that, we were met with great enthusiasm for this property across the board from those that are going to be responsible at the end of the day for actually permitting it. And in the meantime, the permit is in. It's been deemed complete by Contra Costa County, which really starts the process for them. So they will hire independent third party to do the environmental assessment of that, and that is all beginning. So we're there and ready to help support them through that. We haven't seen really any opposition at this point to the project. And I think as people are understanding more and more the benefits of us doing this project, as we mentioned, the environmental benefits and NOCs, SOCs and greenhouse gas reductions, we think the permitting process will flow through. And it's kind of a normal timeline and look forward to getting that permit in early 2022. Yes. So there's about 1 million barrels a day scheduled for 2020, and highly likely that some of that gets pushed out into 2021. We're seeing a slowdown in activity from a COVID perspective and its impact on labor, as well as capital cost reductions in the industry. So I think those barrels are going to get pushed out as we look today, there's not a real reason to rush any of these projects into service. So yes, I'll take a stab, and then Bob can help me because he's pretty active in this area. But I think these are aspirational goals. And I think that -- I think the sign post we're going to watch for is when billions, if not trillions of dollars start flowing in infrastructure investments around distribution, power generation, etcetera, that you could truly electrify the fleets. So I'm probably more bullish on low carbon fuel standard as we think about it moving from California, Oregon, Washington State to maybe to the East Coast. And so I think the near term, easier things to do in terms of renewables that can lower carbon intensity. Those make sense that you can earn good returns doing those projects. And I think the electrification is going to take a long time to get there. Yes. I think shorter term, we still got a little bit of an inventory overhang we've got to work through. I mean directionally, inventories have been moving the right way. So we feel relatively good about that. But I think that we won't clean it up in 4Q. We may get a shot at it in 1Q. But certainly, we think as we approach the summer driving season in 2Q that we'll have an opportunity to see margins more normalized and for us. So we're talking about CPChem. Essentially, the market margin is above mid-cycle today. Our Midstream business is going to continue to perform well. Our Marketing and Specialty businesses has been a very consistent [indiscernible] EBITDA business. So the real question, Mark, on the PSX portfolio is when does refunding get back to mid-cycle conditions? And so we probably got a shot at doing that kind of midyear next year. So Jeff or Bob, do you want to add anything to that?"

            "name": "Kevin Mitchell",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Hello, everyone. Starting with an overview on slide 4, we summarize our financial results. We reported a third quarter loss of $799 million. We had special items amounting to an after-tax loss of $798 million including impairments related to the planned conversion of the San Francisco refinery to a renewable fuels facility as well as the cancellation of the Red Oak pipeline project. Excluding special items, we had an adjusted loss of $1 million or $0.01 per share. Operating cash flow was $795 million, excluding working capital. Adjusted capital spending for the quarter was $549 million, including $347 million for group projects. We returned $393 million to shareholders through dividends. Moving to slide 5. This slide shows the change in adjusted results from the second quarter to the third quarter, an improvement of $323 million. Adjusted pretax results across all segments were improved, except refining. The income tax benefit was mainly driven by bonus depreciation on assets recently completed and the ability under the CARES Act to carry back net operating losses to previous periods. Slide 6 shows our midstream results. Third quarter adjusted pretax income was $354 million, an increase of $109 million from the previous quarter. Transportation-adjusted pretax income was $202 million, up $72 million from the previous quarter. The increase was due to higher pipeline and terminal volumes supported by recovering demand. Third quarter results reflect a ramp-up of volumes on the Gray Oak pipeline and the start-up of South Texas Gateway Terminal. NGL and other delivered adjusted pretax income of $102 million. The $19 million increase from the prior quarter was due to higher Sweeny Hub volumes and inventory impacts. At the Sweeny Hub, the Freeport LPG export facility averaged 12 cargoes per month, and Frac 1 averaged 120,000 barrels per day. DCP Midstream adjusted pretax income of $50 million was up $18 million from the previous quarter, reflecting hedging impacts. Turning to Chemicals on slide 7. Third quarter adjusted pretax income was $132 million, up $43 million from the second quarter. Olefins and polyolefins' adjusted pretax income was $148 million. The $42 million increase from the previous quarter is due to higher polyethylene margins driven by improved sales prices, partially offset by lower polyethylene volumes and higher operating costs. Global O&P utilization was 94%, reflecting downtime at US Gulf Coast facilities. CPChem proactively shut down facilities in preparation for the storms that made landfall in the third quarter. The facility sustained minimal damage and have returned to normal operations. Adjusted pretax income for SA&S decreased $6 million, primarily due to lower margins, partially offset by higher volumes. During the third quarter, we received $112 million in cash distributions from CPChem. Turning to Refining on slide 8. Refining third quarter adjusted pretax loss was $970 million, down from an adjusted pretax loss of $867 million last quarter. The decrease was due to lower realized margins partially offset by higher volumes. Realized margins for the quarter decreased by 32% to $1.78 per barrel. The decrease reflects tightening crude spreads and the absence of the steep contango market structure experienced in the second quarter. In addition, secondary product margins were lower due to rising crude prices. Crude utilization was 77% compared with 75% last quarter. Improved utilization reflects increased refining runs in the Central Corridor and West Coast regions, partially offset by downtime at Gulf Coast refineries. We shut the Lake Charles refinery in late August and the Alliance refinery in mid-September in preparation for hurricanes Laura and Sally. Lake Charles downtime was extended due to third-party power supply issues following Hurricane Laura, and restart was further delayed by Hurricane Delta. The Lake Charles refinery has safely resumed operations, and Alliance remains down for planned turnaround activity. Pretax turnaround costs were $41 million, in line with the prior quarter. The third quarter green product yield was 85%. Slide 9 covers market capture. The 3:2:1 market crack for the third quarter was $8.17 per barrel compared to $7.47 per barrel in the second quarter. Realized margin was $1.78 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 22%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 35%. Market capture is impacted by refinery configuration. We make less gasoline and more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack. During the quarter, the distillate crack decreased $2.46 per barrel, and the gasoline crack improved $2.27 per barrel. Losses from secondary products of $1.80 per barrel increased $0.85 per barrel from the previous quarter due to rising crude prices. Losses from feedstock were $0.35 per barrel compared with $0.67 per barrel last quarter. The other category reduced realized margins by $2.77 per barrel. This category includes RINs, freight costs, clean product realizations and inventory impacts. Moving to Marketing and Specialties on slide 10. Adjusted third quarter pretax income was $417 million, $124 million higher than the second quarter. Marketing and other increased $107 million due to higher margins and volumes. The marketing business captured strong margins during the quarter and benefited from recovering demand. Specialties increased $17 million due to higher finished lubricants volumes. We reimaged 284 domestic branded sites during the third quarter, bringing the total to approximately 5,000 since the start of the program. In our international marketing business, we reimaged 31 European sites, bringing the total to 143 since the program's inception. Refined product exports in the third quarter were 139,000 barrels per day, a decrease from the prior quarter. On slide 11, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted pretax costs of $213 million, a decrease of $11 million from the prior quarter. The improvement is primarily due to lower employee-related expenses, partially offset by higher net interest expense. Slide 12 shows the change in cash for the quarter. We started the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash on our balance sheet. Cash from operations was $795 million, excluding working capital. There was a working capital use of $304 million driven by an increase in tax receivables. Our net debt issuances were $70 million. Adjusted capital spending was $549 million. We expect full year 2020 adjusted capital to be approximately $2.9 billion. We returned $393 million to shareholders through dividends. Our ending cash balance was $1.5 billion. We remain focused on conserving cash and maintaining strong liquidity in the current environment. At September 30, we had $7 billion of committed liquidity, reflecting $1.5 billion of cash plus available capacity on our credit facilities of $5 billion at Phillips 66 and $0.5 billion of Phillips 66 Partners. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In Chemicals, we expect the fourth quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, crude utilization will be adjusted according to market conditions. In October, utilization has been in the mid-60% range, impacted by downtime at the Lake Charles and Alliance refineries. We expect fourth quarter pretax turnaround expenses to be between $80 million and $100 million. We anticipate fourth quarter Corporate and Other costs come in between $220 million and $230 million pretax. With that, we'll now open the line for questions. Yes. So we've consistently expressed our objective to maintain a strong balance sheet, keep that financial flexibility, and that's reflected in our credit ratings, A3 at Moody's and BBB+ at S&P. As you would expect, this year with a couple of debt issuances that we've done, we've had plenty of opportunity to have conversations with the rating agencies. Those have gone well. Our ratings have stayed where they are. We've had no actions, and we still have a stable outlook on the current rating. So we feel good about that. In the event that we need to go to the balance sheet, we feel pretty comfortable that we still have decent capacity without having a detrimental impact on the overall health of the balance sheet. So you think from a long-term standpoint, our objective is to have a solid investment-grade credit rating, and we're clearly there at this point. We've added some debt. We've also talked about a 30% debt-to-capital ratio. We're above that right now. I think as we come through this current situation, then we were able to get debt back down, we'd anticipate that over time, we'd like to see ourselves back in around about that range. But we've always said that's not an absolute target. The real objective is to maintain the solid investment-grade credit ratings, and we're comfortably there, and we feel good that we can stay there. One thing I might add, we've seen strength on the West Coast. The port of -- LA Port is up 13% year-on-year. And we're actually seeing PADD 5 diesel demand up year-on-year. So some strength, especially on the West Coast. Yes. Okay. So, on the tax component, as you see on the financial statement, a significant tax benefit on the income statement, but that's not turning into cash in the current year, that's flowing through the receivable. And on a year-to-date basis, we've increased our tax receivable by $1.2 billion, $1. 3 billion year-to-date and that, we would anticipate collecting next year post completion of our 2020 tax return and so we would expect that to turn into cash sometime in the second quarter of next year. From a broader working capital expectation going into the third quarter, you're going to see two dynamics going on. One is, to the extent that the current operating environment stays as it's been which appears to be then from a tax standpoint, you'd still expect to be generating losses and so you'll have that negative effect on working capital. But we typically have an inventory draw in the fourth quarter and we anticipate that happening again this year. And so that will generate some positive cash from a working capital perspective. No, I think you covered that."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jeff Dietert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Jeff, you may begin.\nJeff Dietert: Good morning and welcome to Phillips 66's second quarter earnings conference call. Participants on today's call will include Greg Garland, Chairman and CEO; Kevin Mitchell, Executive Vice President and CFO; Bob Herman, EVP, Refining; Brian Mandell, EVP Marketing and Commercial; and Tim Roberts, EVP, Midstream. Today's presentation material can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website, along with supplemental financial and operating information. Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement. We will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and our Q&A session. Actual results may differ materially from today's comments. Factors that could cause results to differ are included here, as well as in our SEC filings. With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg Garland.\nGreg Garland: Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. In the second quarter, we experienced the unprecedented disruption to our business from COVID-19, resulting in a challenging operating environment. Going into the second quarter, we anticipated demand for our products would be weak as states were under lockdown and people were working remotely. Across our businesses, we've seen demand recovery from the trough, although uncertainty remains for the second half of the year. We continue to focus on the wellbeing of our employees, their families, communities, maintaining safe and reliable operations and ensuring the financial and operational strength of our Company. Our business is an essential business, and we're committed to safely providing critical energy products and services for our customers. Phillips 66 implemented the appropriate steps to protect our workforce, consistent with CDC, national, state and local directives. We have safely and successfully operated our facilities in support of our commitment to provide essential services. During the quarter, we issued $2 billion of senior notes and increased our term loan capacity by $1 billion. We expect to exceed $500 million in cost reductions and reduce consolidated capital spending by $700 million this year. These actions protect the security of the dividend and our strong investment grade credit rating as we navigate this challenging business environment. We will continue to exercise disciplined capital allocation with the focus on long-term value creation for our shareholders. In the second quarter, we had an adjusted loss of $324 million or $0.74 per share. We generated $764 million of operating cash flow and returned $393 million to our shareholders through dividends. During the quarter, we achieve strong safety performance. We continue to strive toward a zero incident, zero accident workplace. We're executing our strategy and progressing major growth projects. The Gray Oak Pipeline commenced full operations from West Texas and the Eagle Ford to the Texas Gulf Coast, marking the completion of the project. Phillips 66 Partners has a 42.25% interest in Gray Oak Pipeline. Gray Oak connects to multiple refineries and export facilities in the Corpus Christi area, including the South Texas Gateway Terminal. The first dock and eight tanks totaling 3.4 million barrels of storage capacity have been commissioned. In July, the first crude oil tanker was loaded for export. Marine operations, including the second dock are expected to ramp up by the end of this year as additional phases of construction are finished. We expect the project to be completed in the first quarter of 2021 with the total storage capacity of 8.6 million barrels and up to 800,000 barrels per day of export capacity. Phillips 66 Partners owns a 25% interest in the terminal. At the Sweeny Hub, we recently completed the planned tie-in work to integrate fracs 2 and 3 with the Freeport LPG export facility. The fracs will begin commissioning in the third quarter and start operations in the fourth quarter of 2020. Fracs are backed by long-term customer commitments. Upon completion, Sweeny Hub will have 400,000 barrels a day of fractionation capacity. Also at the Sweeny Hub, Phillips 66 Partners recently completed storage expansion at the Clemens Caverns from 9 million barrels to 16.5 million barrels in support of fracs 2 and 3 in the C2G Pipeline. In Marketing, the West Coast retail joint venture recently closed on a previously announced acquisition of 95 sites, bringing the total to approximately 680 sites. The joint venture enables increased long-term placement of our refinery production and increases our exposure to retail margins. In closing, I'd like to thank our employees for their focus on safe, reliable operations, for their demonstrating commitment and capability to be smart and agile, finding new ways of working together with a determined purpose towards value-creation and for living our values of safety, honor and commitment in what has been a very disruptive and challenging environment. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to go through the financial results.\nKevin Mitchell: Thank you, Greg. Hello, everyone. Starting with an overview on slide 4, we summarize our financial results. We reported a second quarter loss of $141 million. We had special items amounting to $183 million. After excluding these items, we had an adjusted loss of $324 million or $0.74 per share. Operating cash flow was $764 million, which included a $94 million working capital benefit. Adjusted capital spending for the quarter was $901 million, including $684 million for growth projects. We returned $393 million to shareholders through dividends, and we ended the quarter with 437 million shares outstanding. Moving to slide 5, this slide highlights the change in pre-tax income by segment from the first quarter to the second quarter. During the period, adjusted earnings decreased $774 million, driven by lower results across all segments. Slide 6 shows our Midstream results. Second quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $245 million, a decrease of $215 million from the previous quarter. Transportation adjusted pre-tax income was $130 million, down $70 million from the previous quarter. The decrease was due to lower pipeline and terminal volumes, driven by lower refinery utilization. In addition, equity affiliate earnings decreased due to lower pipeline throughput volumes, consistent with lower U.S. oil production and reduced product demand. NGL and other delivered adjusted pre-tax income of $83 million. The $96 million decrease from the prior quarter was due to lower margins and volumes at the Sweeny Hub, as well as inventory impacts. The Freeport LPG export facility averaged 11 cargoes per month, and the fractionator ran at 92% utilization. Freeport from Frac 1 were down during part of the quarter as planned tie-in work was completed to integrate Fracs 2 and 3. DCP Midstream adjust the pre-tax income of $32 million was down $49 million from the previous quarter. The decrease reflects lower hedging impacts, driven by improved commodity prices. Turning to Chemicals on slide 7. Second quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $89 million, down $104 million from the first quarter. Olefins and Polyolefins adjusted pre-tax income was $106 million. The $87 million decrease from the previous quarter is due to lower polyethylene and normal alpha olefins margins, driven by lower sales prices and higher feedstock costs. This was partially offset by record polyethylene sales volumes. Global O&P utilization was 103%. Adjusted pre-tax income for SA&S decreased $1 million. During the second quarter, we received $272 million in cash distributions from CPChem.  Turning to Refining on slide 8. Refining second quarter adjusted pre-tax loss was $867 million, down from an adjusted pre-tax loss of $401 million last quarter. The decrease was due to lower realized margins and volumes partially offset by lower turnaround costs. Realized margins for the quarter decreased by 63% to $2.60 per barrel. Lower Gulf Coast realized margins were due to clean product realizations in a rising price environment during the second quarter and inventory impacts. In the central corridor, lower realized margins reflect narrowing Canadian crude differentials. Crude utilization was 75%, compared with 83% last quarter. Refining runs were reduced due to lower clean product demand. Pre-tax turnaround costs were $38 million a decrease of $291 million from the previous quarter. The second quarter clean product yield was 83%. Slide 9 covers market capture. The 3:2:1 market crack for the second quarter was $7.47 per barrel, compared to $9.82 per barrel in the first quarter. Realized margin was $2.60 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 35%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 72%. Market capture is impacted by refinery configuration. We make less gasoline and more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack. During the quarter, the distillate crack decreased $5.56 per barrel and the gasoline crack declined by $0.73 per barrel. Losses from secondary products of $0.95 per barrel improved $0.37 per barrel from the previous quarter due to lower crude prices. Losses from feedstock were $0.67 per barrel, a decline of $0.46 per barrel from the prior quarter due to narrowing Canadian crude differentials. The other category reduced realized margins by $2.22 per mile. This was $2.05 per barrel lower than the prior quarter, driven by lower clean product realizations. Moving to Marketing and Specialties on slide 10. Adjusted second quarter pretax income was $293 million, $195 million lower than the first quarter. Marketing and Other decreased $175 million. The decrease primarily reflects lower volumes, driven by COVID-19-related demand impacts as well as lower realized margins due to rising product prices in the quarter, compared with falling first quarter prices. Specialties decreased $20 million due to lower finished lubricants volumes. We reimaged 284 domestic branded sites during the second quarter, bringing the total to approximately 4,720 since the start of the program. In our international marketing business, we reimaged 29 European sites, bringing the total to approximately 120, since the program's inception. Refined product exports in the second quarter were 160,000 barrels per day, in line with the prior quarter. On slide 11, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted pretax costs of $224 million, an increase of $27 million from the prior quarter. The increase is primarily due to higher net interest expense and employee-related expenses, partially offset by lower environmental expense. Slide 12 shows the change in cash for the year. We started the year with $1.6 billion in cash on our balance sheet. Cash from operations was $1.4 billion, excluding working capital. There is a working capital use of $425 million. Consolidated debt increased by $2.7 billion. Year-to-date, we issued $3.2 billion of debt, including $1 billion drawn on a term loan facility and $2 billion of senior notes. We paid off approximately $500 million of maturing debt. Year-to-date, adjusted capital spending is $1.8 billion. Capital spending will be significantly less in the second half of the year. We expect 2020 adjusted capital to be approximately $2.9 billion as we continue to optimize our capital program. We returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through $789 million of dividends and $443 million of share repurchases completed in the first quarter. Our ending cash balance was $1.9 billion. We're focused on conserving cash and maintaining strong liquidity in the current environment. At June 30th, we had $8.4 billion of liquidity, reflecting $1.9 billion of consolidated cash, $1 billion of undrawn term loan capacity and available credit facility capacity of $5 billion at Phillips 66 and $0.5 billion at Phillips 66 Partners. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In Chemicals, we expect the third quarter global O&P utilization rates to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, crude utilization will be adjusted according to market conditions. In July, utilization has been in the low 80% range. We expect third quarter pretax turnaround expenses to be between $50 million and $70 million. We anticipate third quarter corporate and other costs to come in between $220 million and $230 million pretax. Finally, we are not providing effective tax rate guidance for 2020 due to the range of potential impacts the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our business. With that, we\u2019ll now open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPhil Gresh: First question I had was digging into the refining margin performance a little bit deeper. In particular, looking at your slides, there were two areas that seemed like the biggest headwinds in the quarter. One was feedstock in the Atlantic Basin, and the other was this other category on the Gulf Coast. Kevin, I know you gave a little bit of color there already. But, anything additionally you could share about that result and whether some of that was perhaps temporary in nature. You talked about inventory impacts. So, yes, any additional color?\nBob Herman: Yes. Phil, good morning. This is Bob. The other in the Gulf Coast really came down to two items in both through timing. So, about half of it was due to product realizations as we put product into the Colonial Pipeline and other pipelines. In a rising price environment, we tend not to capture all the crack. And that price environment where it's going the other way, we get a tail wind out of that. In this particular quarter, we had rapidly rising prices during the quarter and that hit us there. And then, the second was a pretty sizable inventory impact. In the Gulf Coast, we had two big turnarounds in the first quarter, Sweeny and Alliance, where we built a lot of inventory and then we pulled that inventory down, coming into the second quarter. So, if you add up those two items alone in the Gulf Coast -- it amounts to about $3 on the market capture. So, both of those really come back to a timing issue for us. On feedstock cost on the East Coast, again, it was a little bit of a timing issue with wind and waterborne barrels, land, particularly at Bayway in relationship to a very volatile crude market. So, we saw effective feedstock costs in the second quarter to be pretty high, coming into Bayway, just really from a timing between 1Q and even month-to-month in the quarter as crude really moved around.\nGreg Garland: But, Phil, in aggregate, that feedstock impact on Atlantic Basin was not that different to the Q1 impact. There's typically -- you see a negative on capture on feedstock in Atlantic Basin.\nPhil Gresh: So, would you say that we're past that at this point as we look forward, or is it something that you still need to be thinking about?\nKevin Mitchell: I think, on -- inventory moves around on us all the time, and it's always hard to predict what's going to happen. Typically when prices are more stable, like we've been seeing the last couple of weeks, we tend to mute those kind of effects.\nPhil Gresh: Okay. And my follow-up question would just be a bigger picture question on refining fundamentals. How are you guys envisioning the way the second half of the year might play out? Obviously, we do have soft crash spreads. Now here in July, utilization guidance for most companies is still reasonably low. Inventory is still needed to be worked down. And we're going to be slipping into the winter gasoline mode as well. So, a lot of moving pieces. But, I'm curious, your perspective, how you see this playing out?\nGreg Garland: Hey Phil. I think, it would be a question of demand going forward. We see demand on gasoline right now at about 15% off, much better than a 50% we\u2019ve seen in April. On heating oil, we talked to our big -- customers, they're seeing about 8% demand disruption. And then, finally, the product that\u2019s been hardest hit, jet, we're seeing about 50%. Number of us here in the room have been flying on commercial flights recently. And you can see the pickup on both, on the planes and in the airport. So, we are optimistic that that will get better as the year progresses. It's interesting, if to look at our 1,000 stores in Germany and Austria where Germany and Austria didn't have a hard second wave of COVID, we're seeing 95% demand on gasoline, 95% demand on distillate. So, again, we're optimistic, we can get through this wave of -- the second wave of COVID that we can push up our demand in the U.S. And I think that refiners will continue to run demand levels going forward.\nKevin Mitchell: I might add that we're coming up on the fall season and there's some seasonal impacts driving to and from schools is in rough numbers about 5% of demand, and there's probably a carryover impact on commuting as well. So, I think that will have an influence. We're expecting a strong planting season -- or excuse me harvest season this fall, as well to support distillate demand.\nOperator: Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nNeil Mehta: Hi, team. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, the first question is about the integrated business model and the value of operating in multiple different businesses. I think, over the course of the cycle, we've definitely seen that. It's been a benefit for Phillips 66. But, Greg, curious on your perspective, especially in light of the fact you have one of your large competitors monetizing some parts of their business?\nGreg Garland: Well, you think about integrated model that we have, we still think that there's a value added model, Neil. I try not to let single points in times -- or single point pandemics really influence our long-term thinking around this. When we think about the ability to capture that value, starting with DCP, gas gathering, gas liquids, integrating through our fracs and LPG export and being able to take product in, into our chemicals business and then through the refining chain. We like that optionality that gives us in terms of investable opportunities. But certainly, the earnings streams that come out of those businesses are strong for us. So, we'll continue to think about this integrated business as a value add business for us. There's no question, the pandemic\u2019s probably impacted all segments of this business. But, it's not unique to us, I would say.\nNeil Mehta: Yes, very clear. And then, the follow-up is just your thoughts on Dakota Access, how it's likely to play out from here, the firm's decision on any -- on the ruling? And then, the bigger picture question around Midstream is relative to what was laid out at the November Analyst Day, what's changed and any quantification of what's changed would be helpful too?\nTim Roberts: This is Tim Roberts. On that data, let me address that first of all. Look, obviously, we're disappointed with the ruling that initially came out with regard to mandating and environmental impact study. And then subsequently, the federal ruling on that which they needed the permit, which then led to a potential shutdown on August 5th on the pipe. Fortunately, it's been appealed to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. I think, you guys are aware of that. So we're waiting for that outcome currently, and there's been a stay put in place, while they're evaluating the case. So, it'll -- look, we think, at this point, the positions that we have are well founded, and certainly clearly disappointed by a position that's taken on our pipeline. It has run for three years, and it has run safely. And it\u2019s truly the most economic and safe way to get hydrocarbons to the marketplace. So, it is a little bit frustrating on that point. Now, we\u2019ll let the court play out at this point from there. One of the things that is also little bit -- we are challenged with a little bit is just the fact, the impact it's got on the region. When you look at it, both on the producers, from state, local governments, communities, people that work in the energy value chain and those that don't who support businesses in the energy space. They're really getting impacted by this. And so, to us, with COVID-19 going on with the pandemic, it\u2019d be bad without a pandemic, but with the pandemic, we just feel this is going to be tough economically on some very specific regions of the country. With regard to the Midstream strategy, I think I\u2019d just characterize this. Look, certainly the long haul transmission business, it\u2019s been challenged a little bit, especially with COVID-19, the pandemic or shock. All those things have caused us to pause. And you've seen that through our actions like deferring a couple of our projects. We need more clarity. I think, our producers need more clarity, shippers need more clarity. So, we need to get a view on that. From a Midstream standpoint, if it's a good project, we're going to do it. And when you look at the diversity of our business in our Midstream space. Yes, we've got crude transportation; yes, we're in clean products, as far as terminals and moving product out of refineries. And then, subsequently, we're also deep in the NGL value chain. So, we look at all those. We\u2019re not a one trick pony at this point. When you look at, we have ways to shift our investment through those three different very-specific businesses in our midstream business. So, yes, you may see us come off, we're certainly going to be a little more cautious as we look at transmission lines. But, that doesn't mean, we're not going to do those. We're going to make sure it makes sense. We've got people who are willing to make long-term commitments that are good solid counterparties. And hence the returns were shorter than we need. So, those happen. Of course, we're going to be interested in that. But if not, we will find other ways to pivot and build out our integration within our Company.\nKevin Mitchell: Neil, just to quantify the Midstream, we reported $2.26 billion of EBITDA in 2019. At the Investor Day, we highlighted projects that could take that to $3 billion by 2022. The projects that we have deferred represent about $300 million to $400 million of EBITDA that would scale that back. And so, I think that's one way of thinking about it. From a DAPL perspective, you can see from our historical disclosure, it contributes or has contributed about $250 million a year to PSXP. We own roughly 75% of PSXP at PSX. So, the PSX impact is in the ballpark of about $200 million a year.\nOperator: Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDoug Terreson: Good morning, everybody.\nGreg Garland: Good morning.\nDoug Terreson: So, financially, the pandemic has obviously reduced financial flexibility and led to higher debt levels at a lot of companies, Phillips 66 included. Simultaneously, economic growth is expected to recover. And as it does, my questions are, what are the likely implications for capital management, which has been a positive hallmark for you guys over the years? And specifically, how are you thinking about the balance between spending, shareholder distributions, et cetera given the changes in debt? So, the question is really about how you're thinking about financial priorities over the medium-term?\nGreg Garland: Yes. Well, so, our view is, mid-year next year, we'd probably get back to something approaching the mid-cycle for our Company. And as we do that and we can kind of get back to a normalized framework as we think about the 60-40 allocation. I think, the other thing I would say is, clearly, taking on $3 billion of debt. There's going to be some priority to debt repayment over the next two to three years. We've got the 364-day facility, it comes -- it\u2019s a $1 billion, comes due in the first quarter of next year. And then, in 2022, we've got another $2 billion kind of a normal course debt coming due. So, you should think about us trying to pay between $1 billion to $3 billion of debt off in the next two to three years. As we start approaching mid-cycle conditions and certainly pick back up with share purchases. The other thing I would say is, our view is that investable opportunities in Midstream in '21 and '22 are probably going to be less than what we would have anticipated. That's going to free up more capital to put towards debt repayment and a shareholder distribution stuff. So, anyway, that's how I'm thinking about it at this moment in time.\nDoug Terreson: Okay. That sounds good. And then, my second question is about refining and specifically, how you guys are thinking about closures of refining capacity over the next few years. And the reason that I ask is because, I think during the last cycle, [indiscernible] final tally of closures was about 6 million to 7 million barrels per day over the two to three years, following the trough in the cycle. And we have seen recent announcements of closures in Asia. We've got IMO [ph] related factors and current refining economics aren't great either. So, it seems like we could be in the early stages of going back to that closure track as well. So, just want to see how you're thinking about how the supply side could be affected by this factor in coming years, if you think it will be meaningful?\nBob Herman: Hey Doug. It\u2019s Bob here. I think we would agree with you that 2008-2009 is kind of a good go by and we would expect rationalization across the globe since it really is a global business. Even before the pandemic, we expected to see significant rationalization in Europe and some quite frankly in the U.S. And so, we've seen that, right? We've got PES that's down, and I think everybody could agree that's not coming back. We've got other temporary closures right now. Whether they come back, probably depends a lot on how long the COVID-19 hangs in there. I guess, our bigger view would be we expected several million barrels to rationalize across the globe, before this. The pandemic only pushes it forward, and we probably get it sooner than later. So, I think you'll see a lot of people make their moves early. And, it may not happen ratably here because I think people will run maybe as long as they can with these assets, but they're going to run up against either really expensive turnarounds or some kind of regulatory impact in some parts of the world. And that's going to make a decision for them, I think.\nGreg Garland: Doug, I think, the other thing I would add is not only rationalization of existing facilities, but delays in new capacity additions with the significant capital spending reductions that have been put in place with the COVID impact on challenges getting labor. As you will know, even in a good environment, these projects tend to get delayed, but in the environment we're in today, they're likely to get delayed even more significantly.\nOperator: Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nRoger Read: If I can get two questions, kind of small questions on Refining and then one on Chemicals. On Refining, what do you think is happening or what do you think needs to happen in exports to kind of bring the market back, thinking pretty specifically the Gulf Coast here? And then, on the crude supply side with WCS specifically, how you see that coming in? Because that was obviously a big headwind in Q2. Just curious how you think of that for the second half of the year?\nBrian Mandell: This is Brian. On exports, if you look at Q1, Q1 exports, the gasoline and distillate were about little over 2.2 million barrels a day, which we would say is typical in Q2, little close to 1.6, which is about 30% off and in July, we're about 20% off. So, we're starting to come back and we can see that in the marketplace. We can see Mexico's having refinery problems. In June, they were down about 35% utilization. We think, July, they\u2019re probably in the high 20s, with more problems. We can see them in the marketplace that coming in and out for spot barrels, they were just turned barrels before. We've even talked to some folks in the retail business who have said that some of their volumes have come back to pre-COVID level. So, we're seeing better demand -- for Phillips 66, we exported in Q2 160,000 barrels. That was the same amount we exported in Q1. Typically for us at Phillips 66, it\u2019s more opportunistic, and we've had better opportunities domestically over the next couple of quarters. \nBob Herman: I think, I might add on that. I think, if you look at the distillate inventory overhang, it\u2019s mostly in the Gulf Coast at this point, right. That's where the barrels were sitting in that. We need to get those back into the export market to help clean up inventory levels in the business, right? That's the missing piece for Pad 3 I think.\nKevin Mitchell: I think the U.S. statistics, the DOE coming out weekly, that's kind of the most evident. But, if you look at Asian and European distillate inventories, they've come off their highs and are improving at a faster pace than what we're seeing in the U.S.\nGreg Garland: Brian, do you want to take WCS part of the question?\nBrian Mandell: On WCS, we've seen differentials in Q1 to Q2, differentials came off about $9 and from Q2 to Q3, Q3 is kind of baked in for about two-thirds of it, we'll see another $2 off. For what we're seeing in Canada and for -- in August, we're seeing about 200,000 barrels offline for production maintenance and about another 200,000 barrels shut-in. That means that production -- pipeline takeaway is greater than production. So, that's what's kept the differential rather tight. We think that will change going on -- going next few months in September and October. We think that production will be greater than the pipeline capacity takeaway. And we'll see the differential start to widen closer to rail arms.\nRoger Read: Okay, great. Thanks. And then, on the Chem side, I just wanted to understand, margins were obviously weak in the quarter but you ran at 103%. Sounds like margins are probably better Q3 but guidance is only in the mid 90s. So, I guess the way I think about it, why run so hard when things were weak but running less so when things look a little bit better? What kind of underwrote the decisions in Q2 or the market conditions in Q2 to pull such a high utilization? And should we think about you maybe build inventories that we can see sold later at better pricing?\nKevin Mitchell: Yes, not really building inventory in the Chemicals segment. So, if you go back to 2019, ethane\u2019s [Technical Difficulty] margin was $0.22, it was $0.18 in the first quarter and got to $0.10 in the second quarter but actually troughed about $0.07 in May. And today, we're pushing kind of $0.16. As you look across to the U.S., Europe and Asia, we\u2019re seeing rising prices. So, spot prices in the U.S. are up $0.08, contracts up $0.05, Europe contracts up $0.08 and Asia spot $0.055. And so, there's been really good price movement. Part of that reflects a rising crude price environment, part of that reflects just really strong demand for consumer products. And so, I would say, if you bifurcate kind of the petrochemicals business into consumer and durables, the consumer part is doing really well. The durables is still challenging, but improving. So, think automotive and others. And on the consumer side, which is mostly where CPChem is, market facing, there's kind of two trains that are going on. One is hygiene. And so, think about the wipes and the bleach and the detergent and the hand sanitizer and all that. And those products across the world continue to sell strongly. And the other is a term that chemicals guys are calling nesting that people aren't moving very far from the nest or staying home, they\u2019re cooking more, they're using more disposables, they are using more trash bags or buying more bottled water that\u2019s wrapped with plastic. They're buying -- doing home improvement projects, so polyethylene paint cans and garden chairs. They're trying to find things to do outside of the house. So, they're spending more money on kayaks and coolers and camping materials and things like that. It's all really positive for high density demand. So, I think we're constructive on the demand side. And I would say strong demand, weak to improving margins, and that\u2019s where we're running into.\nOperator: Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDoug Leggate: So, Kevin, I wonder if you could talk about your tolerance for debt on the balance sheet. Obviously, you're navigating the cycle but, but where does the balance sheet stock up in terms of relative priorities for use of cash, and what do you see as unnecessary headwind with the visibility of what sort of is going on so far?\nKevin Mitchell: Yes. So, I walk through the components of liquidity that we have available to us, we're still in good shape in terms of, if we need additional cash, we have availability through the different sources that I commented on earlier. But as you sort of look beyond that and as we start to come out the other side of this from a prioritization standpoint, what you're going to see is that pay-down of debt will be in the near term a priority from a capital allocation standpoint. And typically we don't talk about having to pay down debt as part of capital allocation construct. And it still works out okay for us because we've got the term loan, $1 billion on the term loan. That matures in the first quarter of next year. We also have $0.5 billion floating rate note maturity, also in the first quarter of next year. And then, as you go into 2022, there's a $2 billion of notes coming due and there is another $0.5 coming due in 2023. So, we have plenty of opportunity to deal with this over the coming sort of next couple of years or so. I think, if we're able to take care of the 2021 maturities, like $1.5 billion, I think we'll feel pretty comfortable with where the balance sheet is at that point. That will still have us a slightly higher debt than we had when we went into this. But, in the overall scheme of things, I think, we'll feel pretty comfortable with where that puts us.\nDoug Leggate: Greg, I'm afraid, I'm going to take a bit of a different track given we\u2019re three months ahead of the election -- I guess two months ahead of the election. The topic of carbon tax. We heard the majors articulate some support for the Baker-Shultz plan amongst others. But, it's appeared on the Democratic platform as a possibility that something that they might want to push a new legislative from setting. So I'm just wondering what PSX\u2019s official position is on carbon tax and I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nGreg Garland: Yes. We haven't had an official position on a carbon tax, Doug, partly because we need to see what the policy really is and what does it look like. I would say that our view is that it really -- it needs to be done at Congress, they need to legislate climate program. We prefer that. So, obviously to having a patchwork of state and local regulations, which is a lot less efficient for us. There's a few key things that we would be looking for in any program. First of all, transparency is really important for people. And I'm talking about consumers to be able to understand the impact and the costs associated with any climate program. I think it needs to be companywide, economy wide and it's got to be applicable to all sources of emissions. And also, it's got to recognize that oil and gas is going to have a big role to play for many years to come. It really used to be market based, it's predictable and internationally competitive. So, given all those boundary conditions, certainly we would support something around a carbon tax if that's the preferred method that comes out of the Congress.\nOperator: Paul Cheng from Scotiabank, please go ahead.\nPaul Cheng: Couple of questions. Greg, in the past, you have talked about renewable diesel business and have some reservation, because of the government mandate and all that. Just curious that with the pandemic and everything going on and perhaps also have Democratic administration, does your view on that change? And if yes, how big is that business that you may be willing to -- or that you will be targeting or that you may like in the long haul.\nGreg Garland: I'm going to let Bob kind of talk about what we're doing in renewables, and then I'll come back and address that question specifically.\nBob Herman: Okay. So, currently, we are in a renewables business, over at our Humber refinery for the last year or. So, we've been processing used cooking oil, co-processing it in our cat cracker there and making about a 1,000 barrels a day renewable diesel. We've actually got a project in flight right now to raise that to about 4,000 barrels a day. It's around the logistics to get it into the plant. We don't have any problem running it. And on the commercial front, right, we've committed to backing two renewable plants that are being built by a third-party in Nevada. So, we'll supply them feedstock and take 100% of the product off of those two plants. So, between those two, that's about 15,000 barrels a day of renewable diesel that we'll have at our disposal to meet the needs -- our own needs in California. In addition, we've got our project in progress at our San Francisco refinery that will convert a hydro treater to run renewable feedstocks, make about another 9,000 barrels a day or so of renewable diesel. Beyond that, we continue to do the engineering to understand what does it make sense to build more renewable capacity across our system. As you know, we had a big project at our Ferndale refinery up in Washington state to make 18,000 barrels a day of renewable diesel. We could not get permit, certainty in that environment up there. So, we canceled that project. But that hasn't stopped us from continuing to evaluate options on the West Coast, the Gulf Coast and at our other plants as to where does it make sense to do more renewables. Our fundamental belief is the renewable need is there and it's going to be there long term. So, we need to find a way to help and meet the demand of the market for renewable diesel in particular.\nGreg Garland: So, I think, our approach at this point has been to partner certainly and to use existing assets where we can in a capital light mode. So, I still worry about the credit and how that credit price gets set. But, as you watch what's happening, particularly on the West Coast, low carbon fuel standard, moving up the entire West Coast, maybe to the East Coast of the U.S., I think there's going to be a place in the portfolio for renewables.\nPaul Cheng: Great. So, you have say some [indiscernible] how big is that business that you will be willing to assess in the long-term as a percentage, let's say for your overall asset and your cash flow, or do you think that this business is really just that niche and you don't want it to be too big?\nGreg Garland: Well, our current view is, we would probably either build or partner to cover about what we view is 80% of our requirements, and we probably remain exposed for credits for about 20%. And we haven't changed that strategy yet, Paul. But, that's kind of our current our current views in this market.\nOperator: Justin Jenkins from Raymond James, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJustin Jenkins: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I want to follow-up on Neil's question about Dakota Access earlier. I'm curious that PSXP has to stand on its own financially in like the events that DAPL is shut down or would PSX be willing to entertain maybe some more supportive options than might otherwise be the case, just to the MLP?\nKevin Mitchell: Justin, it's Kevin. Yes. So, it's hard to speculate around activities that may or decisions that may or may not happen and how that will play out. But fundamentally, when you look at the MLP, it's got two levers at its disposal, right, in terms of helping its financial position. And then, one is the distribution; and two is the level of capital spending. And as you know, the capital spending is pretty high this year. But, a lot of those projects are coming to an end over the course of this year. And so, there'll be more flexibility, as you look into future years in terms of what CapEx needs to sit at the MLP. But, what I'd also say, as you step back and look at the PSXP, it is in a -- it goes into this in a very strong position. So, the MLP last year generated, at least almost $1.3 billion of EBITDA. It's got a strong balance sheet, strong credit rating. And that's a function of -- it was all the transactions that have taken place between PSX and PSXP over the last several years, they've all been done on a very fair basis, that both works for the MLP and for the sponsor. And at the same time, you sort of lay on a conservative financial strategy and policy around how we've managed the balance sheet at PSXP, and it's actually in a really good position. It's really hard to speculate around what other -- what sort of sponsor support might be provided on event that we don't know may happen around all of that. So, I think I'll probably just leave it there. One other comment though is, also bear in mind, DAPL is one asset, so PSXP is a great portfolio. It's predominantly fee-based driven assets. And while DAPL is a very -- it's significant asset, it's a good asset, it is just one asset within the broader portfolio. And so, we're pretty confident that PSXP will be able to work its way through this whole situation.\nJustin Jenkins: Understood. I appreciate the answer, Kevin. I think second question is just a quick one for you as well on the cash flow statement, JV distributions were pretty high. You mentioned the CPChem distribution, is a good chunk of that one time in nature?\nKevin Mitchell: Yes. I think, it's fair to look at -- what you probably want to look at CPChem on a year-to-date basis, the distributions were in Q1, and they were high in Q2. And so, it's probably more appropriate to think of it like that because it was an under -- in Q1 they under distributed from an earnings standpoint. And that's a big driver of that under distributed equity earnings benefit. It shows up on the cash flow statement.\nOperator: Manav Gupta from Credit Suisse, Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nManav Gupta: Hey, guys, a quick question. You have a very light footprint and retail and wholesale operations, and trying to understand a little bit of follow-up to Roger\u2019s question. Domestically, which are the regions where you're seeing the strongest demand recovery? And domestically, which are the regions where either gasoline is lagging versus the average? And are there regions you actually think where the demand may never recover like to the pre-pandemic levels?\nGreg Garland: We took a look at that earlier this morning, in fact, and we're seeing that 50% demand destruction of gasoline, actually that's the same in each of our pads that we\u2019re operating in. We didn't see any difference in the pads that we're operating in. I would say that it's hard to say at this 10 seconds whether we'll see continued demand destruction. I know, on the West Coast, there have been companies that announced that we've got back to work for a while, schools, we don't know when they're going to get back to work. My guess would be that in the future, people will get back to work. There's something about being at the office and the exchange of ideas at the office that makes that a more positive way to work. So, I think this is somewhat short term. By the middle of next year, I think people will be back to work and will be normal, just like it has been.\nManav Gupta: And a quick follow-up question again on the Canadian side. You have expenses, you are one of the biggest buyers of Canadian crude. In terms of volumes versus, May or -- April or May, what kind of increase in volumes from Canada are you seeing at this point of time, versus just two or three months ago?\nGreg Garland: So, we've been importing from Canada roughly the same amount, a little over 500,000 barrels a day. We're limited on pipelines, logistics, and that\u2019s kind of limits for Canada crude exported out of the West Coast.\nManav Gupta: Thank you.\nOperator: Theresa Chen from Barclays, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTheresa Chen: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. So, first on the DAPL front. I understand that to PSX, end of the event of a shutdown will be roughly $200 million per year of EBITDA. Can you talk about potential offsets in your system if differentials do blow out, you can import and accrued by rail at Bayway and Ferndale?\nGreg Garland: So, currently, we move by rail to Bayway and Ferndale by 75,000 barrels a day. We think we can get another 75% maybe up to 120,000 barrels a day of additional crude to both refineries from the Bakken. We're taking a look at differentials. And as they get wider, we'll be in a position to move those extra barrels.\nTheresa Chen: Got it. And Brian, a follow-up to Manav\u2019s question on structural demand. So, when you talk about the markets where things have progressed more steadily and recovering to -- close to normal, 95% of demand in Germany and Austria, for example. So, are you seeing like plateauing at 95%? Is it continuing to recover, can you talk about 5% up to structural losses? How should we think about that?\nBrian Mandell: I think that's still affect of COVID you can -- I mean, COVID is not gone in Germany and Austria, just like it isn't gone here in the U.S. So, we would expect that to get back to 100% at the point where we have some type of therapeutic or some kind of cure to COVID. But at current rate, that is instructional. People want to get out, they want to drive. So, we think it's just the lingering effects of COVID-19.\nOperator: Prashant Rao from Citi, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPrashant Rao: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Sort of a two-part, so I'll just leave at the one with the two parts to it, and they are both on Midstream. I kind of wanted to get a sense of -- it feels like there's a lot of moving parts here, but you've got Gray Oak with full operations, the tie-in work is done on Sweeney. Throughput volumes look like they are -- should at least pace product demand and crude demands are coming back up. So, it feels really like 2Q should be sort of a bottom for the year from where we stand right now. I wanted to get your sense on, if that's sort of a fair assumption. And then, from there, the second part, then if I think about sort of the trajectory of the snapback towards getting back to earnings levels, where we were, back half of last year, at least or 1Q of this year. How much of that is volume-driven and what's the -- how much of that is more margin driven? I know, the two are interrelated. But, if you could help us to sort of think about per Boe margin as the volumes come back, how that should trend and ultimately get you north of $400 million on earnings per quarter. Does that is -- that something that seems in scope for the back half of this year? So, those two parts, it would be helpful to get some color on both.\nGreg Garland: The first part, on that with regard to our systems and so forth, when you look at Gray Oak and all the activity that we've got going on, I can say that you're right. Second quarter, really does seem like it was the bottom at the trough. Obviously, it's a little tough to kind of go out with the second wave of the pandemic. Certainly, we're going to work our way through that. But, we've seen things progressively move up through the quarter. So that I would say is -- we feel that way currently. We've got a lot of activity going on. We have seen, for example on Gray Oak, I'm pleased to tell you that we're up and running. We have seen volumes have picked up, and we're near and we see global [ph] currently, which is good, which is not where we were in the middle of the quarter, for the second quarter. So, that's directionally going in the right direction. When we see overall volumes through our NGL system, all of them month-to-month are improving. So directionally, we feel pretty good that it's moving in the right direction. It's the length of time it takes to recover. We still think the middle of next year is when you see banks start normalize to a point, where we're back in mid cycle.\nKevin Mitchell: I think, maybe the only thing I'd add to that. As you think about kind of Gray Oak Fracs 2, 3, those are pretty much fixed fee. So, there's not a lot of commodity exposure there. Where we still have commodity exposure is really around the LPG export. And of course in the second quarter, we had some downtime for the tie-in. So, we ran the frac a little lighter and didn't give export barrels out and also the fees went down across the dock in the second quarter. But, we do think that we'll see some improvement in terms of get more volume across the dock and also some opportunities to increase dock fees. So that's where the big exposure is. And that's more than the $200 million, probably, if you think about it in the total scope, the opportunity set for us.\nGreg Garland: And I think, Prashant, as you know these projects are underwritten by long-term shipper commitments that support the investment and the return on these projects.\nOperator: Ryan Todd, Simmons Energy, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRyan Todd: Maybe a couple quick of follow-ups on Refining. Despite the idling of MPC\u2019s Martinez Refinery, what those utilization rates are still kind of struggling from the trough of the downturn relative to other regions? Can you talk about maybe how regional demand fundamentals are driving the different recovery paths that you see for utilization rates in the Gulf Coast versus the West Coast or East Coast?\nGreg Garland: Yes. I think actually, if you look at our system across our different pads, we don't see that much difference in utilization. I think pads is pad. Right now, I think, in California in particular, right, if the conventional wisdom before the pandemic was we were refinery long in California sometimes for market balance, today, we're something above that. So, even with Martinez down, the demands of the market don't require the refining system out there really to be running harder than we currently are. We're in the low-80s across our system, and that's pretty constructive for California also.\nRyan Todd: Okay, thanks. And then, maybe on the marketing side. The retail results have been relative bright spot and they were again this quarter. I wanted to ask how the outlook is looking in the third quarter, as commodity prices have started to normalize or maybe you can speak to further opportunities to organically build on your West Coast retail JV from here?\nKevin Mitchell: Obviously, we completed most of the West Coast retail joint venture late last year, which is fortunate time for us. We've finished the rest earlier this month. So, we've taken back cash on the margins and the value driven by the West coast joint venture, and it's been about what we said it would be in about 50 million to 60 million barrels -- $50 million to $60 million a year in terms of EBITDA, for that joint venture. So, we're kind of happy about where it is. Of course, it's hard to tell during the COVID period but we think it's on track. And we'll continue to take a look at opportunities to grow that joint venture and opportunities to integrate into our business. We think integration is very important as Greg mentioned earlier, and we're looking for opportunities to integrate, particularly on the West Coast and even more particularly in the Middle America, where we have large refining business.\nOperator: We have now reached the end of today's call. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.\nJeff Dietert: Thank you, David. Thank all of you for your interest in Phillips 66. If you have additional questions after today's call, please contact Brent or myself. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "This is Tim Roberts. On that data, let me address that first of all. Look, obviously, we're disappointed with the ruling that initially came out with regard to mandating and environmental impact study. And then subsequently, the federal ruling on that which they needed the permit, which then led to a potential shutdown on August 5th on the pipe. Fortunately, it's been appealed to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. I think, you guys are aware of that. So we're waiting for that outcome currently, and there's been a stay put in place, while they're evaluating the case. So, it'll -- look, we think, at this point, the positions that we have are well founded, and certainly clearly disappointed by a position that's taken on our pipeline. It has run for three years, and it has run safely. And it's truly the most economic and safe way to get hydrocarbons to the marketplace. So, it is a little bit frustrating on that point. Now, we'll let the court play out at this point from there. One of the things that is also little bit -- we are challenged with a little bit is just the fact, the impact it's got on the region. When you look at it, both on the producers, from state, local governments, communities, people that work in the energy value chain and those that don't who support businesses in the energy space. They're really getting impacted by this. And so, to us, with COVID-19 going on with the pandemic, it'd be bad without a pandemic, but with the pandemic, we just feel this is going to be tough economically on some very specific regions of the country. With regard to the Midstream strategy, I think I'd just characterize this. Look, certainly the long haul transmission business, it's been challenged a little bit, especially with COVID-19, the pandemic or shock. All those things have caused us to pause. And you've seen that through our actions like deferring a couple of our projects. We need more clarity. I think, our producers need more clarity, shippers need more clarity. So, we need to get a view on that. From a Midstream standpoint, if it's a good project, we're going to do it. And when you look at the diversity of our business in our Midstream space. Yes, we've got crude transportation; yes, we're in clean products, as far as terminals and moving product out of refineries. And then, subsequently, we're also deep in the NGL value chain. So, we look at all those. We're not a one trick pony at this point. When you look at, we have ways to shift our investment through those three different very-specific businesses in our midstream business. So, yes, you may see us come off, we're certainly going to be a little more cautious as we look at transmission lines. But, that doesn't mean, we're not going to do those. We're going to make sure it makes sense. We've got people who are willing to make long-term commitments that are good solid counterparties. And hence the returns were shorter than we need. So, those happen. Of course, we're going to be interested in that. But if not, we will find other ways to pivot and build out our integration within our Company."

            "content": "This is Brian. On exports, if you look at Q1, Q1 exports, the gasoline and distillate were about little over 2.2 million barrels a day, which we would say is typical in Q2, little close to 1.6, which is about 30% off and in July, we're about 20% off. So, we're starting to come back and we can see that in the marketplace. We can see Mexico's having refinery problems. In June, they were down about 35% utilization. We think, July, they're probably in the high 20s, with more problems. We can see them in the marketplace that coming in and out for spot barrels, they were just turned barrels before. We've even talked to some folks in the retail business who have said that some of their volumes have come back to pre-COVID level. So, we're seeing better demand -- for Phillips 66, we exported in Q2 160,000 barrels. That was the same amount we exported in Q1. Typically for us at Phillips 66, it's more opportunistic, and we've had better opportunities domestically over the next couple of quarters. On WCS, we've seen differentials in Q1 to Q2, differentials came off about $9 and from Q2 to Q3, Q3 is kind of baked in for about two-thirds of it, we'll see another $2 off. For what we're seeing in Canada and for -- in August, we're seeing about 200,000 barrels offline for production maintenance and about another 200,000 barrels shut-in. That means that production -- pipeline takeaway is greater than production. So, that's what's kept the differential rather tight. We think that will change going on -- going next few months in September and October. We think that production will be greater than the pipeline capacity takeaway. And we'll see the differential start to widen closer to rail arms. I think that's still affect of COVID you can -- I mean, COVID is not gone in Germany and Austria, just like it isn't gone here in the U.S. So, we would expect that to get back to 100% at the point where we have some type of therapeutic or some kind of cure to COVID. But at current rate, that is instructional. People want to get out, they want to drive. So, we think it's just the lingering effects of COVID-19."

            "name": "Bob Herman",
            "content": "Yes. Phil, good morning. This is Bob. The other in the Gulf Coast really came down to two items in both through timing. So, about half of it was due to product realizations as we put product into the Colonial Pipeline and other pipelines. In a rising price environment, we tend not to capture all the crack. And that price environment where it's going the other way, we get a tail wind out of that. In this particular quarter, we had rapidly rising prices during the quarter and that hit us there. And then, the second was a pretty sizable inventory impact. In the Gulf Coast, we had two big turnarounds in the first quarter, Sweeny and Alliance, where we built a lot of inventory and then we pulled that inventory down, coming into the second quarter. So, if you add up those two items alone in the Gulf Coast -- it amounts to about $3 on the market capture. So, both of those really come back to a timing issue for us. On feedstock cost on the East Coast, again, it was a little bit of a timing issue with wind and waterborne barrels, land, particularly at Bayway in relationship to a very volatile crude market. So, we saw effective feedstock costs in the second quarter to be pretty high, coming into Bayway, just really from a timing between 1Q and even month-to-month in the quarter as crude really moved around. Hey Doug. It's Bob here. I think we would agree with you that 2008-2009 is kind of a good go by and we would expect rationalization across the globe since it really is a global business. Even before the pandemic, we expected to see significant rationalization in Europe and some quite frankly in the U.S. And so, we've seen that, right? We've got PES that's down, and I think everybody could agree that's not coming back. We've got other temporary closures right now. Whether they come back, probably depends a lot on how long the COVID-19 hangs in there. I guess, our bigger view would be we expected several million barrels to rationalize across the globe, before this. The pandemic only pushes it forward, and we probably get it sooner than later. So, I think you'll see a lot of people make their moves early. And, it may not happen ratably here because I think people will run maybe as long as they can with these assets, but they're going to run up against either really expensive turnarounds or some kind of regulatory impact in some parts of the world. And that's going to make a decision for them, I think. I think, I might add on that. I think, if you look at the distillate inventory overhang, it's mostly in the Gulf Coast at this point, right. That's where the barrels were sitting in that. We need to get those back into the export market to help clean up inventory levels in the business, right? That's the missing piece for Pad 3 I think. Okay. So, currently, we are in a renewables business, over at our Humber refinery for the last year or. So, we've been processing used cooking oil, co-processing it in our cat cracker there and making about a 1,000 barrels a day renewable diesel. We've actually got a project in flight right now to raise that to about 4,000 barrels a day. It's around the logistics to get it into the plant. We don't have any problem running it. And on the commercial front, right, we've committed to backing two renewable plants that are being built by a third-party in Nevada. So, we'll supply them feedstock and take 100% of the product off of those two plants. So, between those two, that's about 15,000 barrels a day of renewable diesel that we'll have at our disposal to meet the needs -- our own needs in California. In addition, we've got our project in progress at our San Francisco refinery that will convert a hydro treater to run renewable feedstocks, make about another 9,000 barrels a day or so of renewable diesel. Beyond that, we continue to do the engineering to understand what does it make sense to build more renewable capacity across our system. As you know, we had a big project at our Ferndale refinery up in Washington state to make 18,000 barrels a day of renewable diesel. We could not get permit, certainty in that environment up there. So, we canceled that project. But that hasn't stopped us from continuing to evaluate options on the West Coast, the Gulf Coast and at our other plants as to where does it make sense to do more renewables. Our fundamental belief is the renewable need is there and it's going to be there long term. So, we need to find a way to help and meet the demand of the market for renewable diesel in particular."

            "name": "Greg Garland",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. In the second quarter, we experienced the unprecedented disruption to our business from COVID-19, resulting in a challenging operating environment. Going into the second quarter, we anticipated demand for our products would be weak as states were under lockdown and people were working remotely. Across our businesses, we've seen demand recovery from the trough, although uncertainty remains for the second half of the year. We continue to focus on the wellbeing of our employees, their families, communities, maintaining safe and reliable operations and ensuring the financial and operational strength of our Company. Our business is an essential business, and we're committed to safely providing critical energy products and services for our customers. Phillips 66 implemented the appropriate steps to protect our workforce, consistent with CDC, national, state and local directives. We have safely and successfully operated our facilities in support of our commitment to provide essential services. During the quarter, we issued $2 billion of senior notes and increased our term loan capacity by $1 billion. We expect to exceed $500 million in cost reductions and reduce consolidated capital spending by $700 million this year. These actions protect the security of the dividend and our strong investment grade credit rating as we navigate this challenging business environment. We will continue to exercise disciplined capital allocation with the focus on long-term value creation for our shareholders. In the second quarter, we had an adjusted loss of $324 million or $0.74 per share. We generated $764 million of operating cash flow and returned $393 million to our shareholders through dividends. During the quarter, we achieve strong safety performance. We continue to strive toward a zero incident, zero accident workplace. We're executing our strategy and progressing major growth projects. The Gray Oak Pipeline commenced full operations from West Texas and the Eagle Ford to the Texas Gulf Coast, marking the completion of the project. Phillips 66 Partners has a 42.25% interest in Gray Oak Pipeline. Gray Oak connects to multiple refineries and export facilities in the Corpus Christi area, including the South Texas Gateway Terminal. The first dock and eight tanks totaling 3.4 million barrels of storage capacity have been commissioned. In July, the first crude oil tanker was loaded for export. Marine operations, including the second dock are expected to ramp up by the end of this year as additional phases of construction are finished. We expect the project to be completed in the first quarter of 2021 with the total storage capacity of 8.6 million barrels and up to 800,000 barrels per day of export capacity. Phillips 66 Partners owns a 25% interest in the terminal. At the Sweeny Hub, we recently completed the planned tie-in work to integrate fracs 2 and 3 with the Freeport LPG export facility. The fracs will begin commissioning in the third quarter and start operations in the fourth quarter of 2020. Fracs are backed by long-term customer commitments. Upon completion, Sweeny Hub will have 400,000 barrels a day of fractionation capacity. Also at the Sweeny Hub, Phillips 66 Partners recently completed storage expansion at the Clemens Caverns from 9 million barrels to 16.5 million barrels in support of fracs 2 and 3 in the C2G Pipeline. In Marketing, the West Coast retail joint venture recently closed on a previously announced acquisition of 95 sites, bringing the total to approximately 680 sites. The joint venture enables increased long-term placement of our refinery production and increases our exposure to retail margins. In closing, I'd like to thank our employees for their focus on safe, reliable operations, for their demonstrating commitment and capability to be smart and agile, finding new ways of working together with a determined purpose towards value-creation and for living our values of safety, honor and commitment in what has been a very disruptive and challenging environment. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to go through the financial results. But, Phil, in aggregate, that feedstock impact on Atlantic Basin was not that different to the Q1 impact. There's typically -- you see a negative on capture on feedstock in Atlantic Basin. Hey Phil. I think, it would be a question of demand going forward. We see demand on gasoline right now at about 15% off, much better than a 50% we've seen in April. On heating oil, we talked to our big -- customers, they're seeing about 8% demand disruption. And then, finally, the product that's been hardest hit, jet, we're seeing about 50%. Number of us here in the room have been flying on commercial flights recently. And you can see the pickup on both, on the planes and in the airport. So, we are optimistic that that will get better as the year progresses. It's interesting, if to look at our 1,000 stores in Germany and Austria where Germany and Austria didn't have a hard second wave of COVID, we're seeing 95% demand on gasoline, 95% demand on distillate. So, again, we're optimistic, we can get through this wave of -- the second wave of COVID that we can push up our demand in the U.S. And I think that refiners will continue to run demand levels going forward. Well, you think about integrated model that we have, we still think that there's a value added model, Neil. I try not to let single points in times -- or single point pandemics really influence our long-term thinking around this. When we think about the ability to capture that value, starting with DCP, gas gathering, gas liquids, integrating through our fracs and LPG export and being able to take product in, into our chemicals business and then through the refining chain. We like that optionality that gives us in terms of investable opportunities. But certainly, the earnings streams that come out of those businesses are strong for us. So, we'll continue to think about this integrated business as a value add business for us. There's no question, the pandemic's probably impacted all segments of this business. But, it's not unique to us, I would say. Good morning. Yes. Well, so, our view is, mid-year next year, we'd probably get back to something approaching the mid-cycle for our Company. And as we do that and we can kind of get back to a normalized framework as we think about the 60-40 allocation. I think, the other thing I would say is, clearly, taking on $3 billion of debt. There's going to be some priority to debt repayment over the next two to three years. We've got the 364-day facility, it comes -- it's a $1 billion, comes due in the first quarter of next year. And then, in 2022, we've got another $2 billion kind of a normal course debt coming due. So, you should think about us trying to pay between $1 billion to $3 billion of debt off in the next two to three years. As we start approaching mid-cycle conditions and certainly pick back up with share purchases. The other thing I would say is, our view is that investable opportunities in Midstream in '21 and '22 are probably going to be less than what we would have anticipated. That's going to free up more capital to put towards debt repayment and a shareholder distribution stuff. So, anyway, that's how I'm thinking about it at this moment in time. Doug, I think, the other thing I would add is not only rationalization of existing facilities, but delays in new capacity additions with the significant capital spending reductions that have been put in place with the COVID impact on challenges getting labor. As you will know, even in a good environment, these projects tend to get delayed, but in the environment we're in today, they're likely to get delayed even more significantly. Brian, do you want to take WCS part of the question? Yes. We haven't had an official position on a carbon tax, Doug, partly because we need to see what the policy really is and what does it look like. I would say that our view is that it really -- it needs to be done at Congress, they need to legislate climate program. We prefer that. So, obviously to having a patchwork of state and local regulations, which is a lot less efficient for us. There's a few key things that we would be looking for in any program. First of all, transparency is really important for people. And I'm talking about consumers to be able to understand the impact and the costs associated with any climate program. I think it needs to be companywide, economy wide and it's got to be applicable to all sources of emissions. And also, it's got to recognize that oil and gas is going to have a big role to play for many years to come. It really used to be market based, it's predictable and internationally competitive. So, given all those boundary conditions, certainly we would support something around a carbon tax if that's the preferred method that comes out of the Congress. I'm going to let Bob kind of talk about what we're doing in renewables, and then I'll come back and address that question specifically. So, I think, our approach at this point has been to partner certainly and to use existing assets where we can in a capital light mode. So, I still worry about the credit and how that credit price gets set. But, as you watch what's happening, particularly on the West Coast, low carbon fuel standard, moving up the entire West Coast, maybe to the East Coast of the U.S., I think there's going to be a place in the portfolio for renewables. Well, our current view is, we would probably either build or partner to cover about what we view is 80% of our requirements, and we probably remain exposed for credits for about 20%. And we haven't changed that strategy yet, Paul. But, that's kind of our current our current views in this market. We took a look at that earlier this morning, in fact, and we're seeing that 50% demand destruction of gasoline, actually that's the same in each of our pads that we're operating in. We didn't see any difference in the pads that we're operating in. I would say that it's hard to say at this 10 seconds whether we'll see continued demand destruction. I know, on the West Coast, there have been companies that announced that we've got back to work for a while, schools, we don't know when they're going to get back to work. My guess would be that in the future, people will get back to work. There's something about being at the office and the exchange of ideas at the office that makes that a more positive way to work. So, I think this is somewhat short term. By the middle of next year, I think people will be back to work and will be normal, just like it has been. So, we've been importing from Canada roughly the same amount, a little over 500,000 barrels a day. We're limited on pipelines, logistics, and that's kind of limits for Canada crude exported out of the West Coast. So, currently, we move by rail to Bayway and Ferndale by 75,000 barrels a day. We think we can get another 75% maybe up to 120,000 barrels a day of additional crude to both refineries from the Bakken. We're taking a look at differentials. And as they get wider, we'll be in a position to move those extra barrels. The first part, on that with regard to our systems and so forth, when you look at Gray Oak and all the activity that we've got going on, I can say that you're right. Second quarter, really does seem like it was the bottom at the trough. Obviously, it's a little tough to kind of go out with the second wave of the pandemic. Certainly, we're going to work our way through that. But, we've seen things progressively move up through the quarter. So that I would say is -- we feel that way currently. We've got a lot of activity going on. We have seen, for example on Gray Oak, I'm pleased to tell you that we're up and running. We have seen volumes have picked up, and we're near and we see global [ph] currently, which is good, which is not where we were in the middle of the quarter, for the second quarter. So, that's directionally going in the right direction. When we see overall volumes through our NGL system, all of them month-to-month are improving. So directionally, we feel pretty good that it's moving in the right direction. It's the length of time it takes to recover. We still think the middle of next year is when you see banks start normalize to a point, where we're back in mid cycle. And I think, Prashant, as you know these projects are underwritten by long-term shipper commitments that support the investment and the return on these projects. Yes. I think actually, if you look at our system across our different pads, we don't see that much difference in utilization. I think pads is pad. Right now, I think, in California in particular, right, if the conventional wisdom before the pandemic was we were refinery long in California sometimes for market balance, today, we're something above that. So, even with Martinez down, the demands of the market don't require the refining system out there really to be running harder than we currently are. We're in the low-80s across our system, and that's pretty constructive for California also."

            "name": "Kevin Mitchell",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Hello, everyone. Starting with an overview on slide 4, we summarize our financial results. We reported a second quarter loss of $141 million. We had special items amounting to $183 million. After excluding these items, we had an adjusted loss of $324 million or $0.74 per share. Operating cash flow was $764 million, which included a $94 million working capital benefit. Adjusted capital spending for the quarter was $901 million, including $684 million for growth projects. We returned $393 million to shareholders through dividends, and we ended the quarter with 437 million shares outstanding. Moving to slide 5, this slide highlights the change in pre-tax income by segment from the first quarter to the second quarter. During the period, adjusted earnings decreased $774 million, driven by lower results across all segments. Slide 6 shows our Midstream results. Second quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $245 million, a decrease of $215 million from the previous quarter. Transportation adjusted pre-tax income was $130 million, down $70 million from the previous quarter. The decrease was due to lower pipeline and terminal volumes, driven by lower refinery utilization. In addition, equity affiliate earnings decreased due to lower pipeline throughput volumes, consistent with lower U.S. oil production and reduced product demand. NGL and other delivered adjusted pre-tax income of $83 million. The $96 million decrease from the prior quarter was due to lower margins and volumes at the Sweeny Hub, as well as inventory impacts. The Freeport LPG export facility averaged 11 cargoes per month, and the fractionator ran at 92% utilization. Freeport from Frac 1 were down during part of the quarter as planned tie-in work was completed to integrate Fracs 2 and 3. DCP Midstream adjust the pre-tax income of $32 million was down $49 million from the previous quarter. The decrease reflects lower hedging impacts, driven by improved commodity prices. Turning to Chemicals on slide 7. Second quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $89 million, down $104 million from the first quarter. Olefins and Polyolefins adjusted pre-tax income was $106 million. The $87 million decrease from the previous quarter is due to lower polyethylene and normal alpha olefins margins, driven by lower sales prices and higher feedstock costs. This was partially offset by record polyethylene sales volumes. Global O&P utilization was 103%. Adjusted pre-tax income for SA&S decreased $1 million. During the second quarter, we received $272 million in cash distributions from CPChem.  Turning to Refining on slide 8. Refining second quarter adjusted pre-tax loss was $867 million, down from an adjusted pre-tax loss of $401 million last quarter. The decrease was due to lower realized margins and volumes partially offset by lower turnaround costs. Realized margins for the quarter decreased by 63% to $2.60 per barrel. Lower Gulf Coast realized margins were due to clean product realizations in a rising price environment during the second quarter and inventory impacts. In the central corridor, lower realized margins reflect narrowing Canadian crude differentials. Crude utilization was 75%, compared with 83% last quarter. Refining runs were reduced due to lower clean product demand. Pre-tax turnaround costs were $38 million a decrease of $291 million from the previous quarter. The second quarter clean product yield was 83%. Slide 9 covers market capture. The 3:2:1 market crack for the second quarter was $7.47 per barrel, compared to $9.82 per barrel in the first quarter. Realized margin was $2.60 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 35%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 72%. Market capture is impacted by refinery configuration. We make less gasoline and more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack. During the quarter, the distillate crack decreased $5.56 per barrel and the gasoline crack declined by $0.73 per barrel. Losses from secondary products of $0.95 per barrel improved $0.37 per barrel from the previous quarter due to lower crude prices. Losses from feedstock were $0.67 per barrel, a decline of $0.46 per barrel from the prior quarter due to narrowing Canadian crude differentials. The other category reduced realized margins by $2.22 per mile. This was $2.05 per barrel lower than the prior quarter, driven by lower clean product realizations. Moving to Marketing and Specialties on slide 10. Adjusted second quarter pretax income was $293 million, $195 million lower than the first quarter. Marketing and Other decreased $175 million. The decrease primarily reflects lower volumes, driven by COVID-19-related demand impacts as well as lower realized margins due to rising product prices in the quarter, compared with falling first quarter prices. Specialties decreased $20 million due to lower finished lubricants volumes. We reimaged 284 domestic branded sites during the second quarter, bringing the total to approximately 4,720 since the start of the program. In our international marketing business, we reimaged 29 European sites, bringing the total to approximately 120, since the program's inception. Refined product exports in the second quarter were 160,000 barrels per day, in line with the prior quarter. On slide 11, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted pretax costs of $224 million, an increase of $27 million from the prior quarter. The increase is primarily due to higher net interest expense and employee-related expenses, partially offset by lower environmental expense. Slide 12 shows the change in cash for the year. We started the year with $1.6 billion in cash on our balance sheet. Cash from operations was $1.4 billion, excluding working capital. There is a working capital use of $425 million. Consolidated debt increased by $2.7 billion. Year-to-date, we issued $3.2 billion of debt, including $1 billion drawn on a term loan facility and $2 billion of senior notes. We paid off approximately $500 million of maturing debt. Year-to-date, adjusted capital spending is $1.8 billion. Capital spending will be significantly less in the second half of the year. We expect 2020 adjusted capital to be approximately $2.9 billion as we continue to optimize our capital program. We returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through $789 million of dividends and $443 million of share repurchases completed in the first quarter. Our ending cash balance was $1.9 billion. We're focused on conserving cash and maintaining strong liquidity in the current environment. At June 30th, we had $8.4 billion of liquidity, reflecting $1.9 billion of consolidated cash, $1 billion of undrawn term loan capacity and available credit facility capacity of $5 billion at Phillips 66 and $0.5 billion at Phillips 66 Partners. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In Chemicals, we expect the third quarter global O&P utilization rates to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, crude utilization will be adjusted according to market conditions. In July, utilization has been in the low 80% range. We expect third quarter pretax turnaround expenses to be between $50 million and $70 million. We anticipate third quarter corporate and other costs to come in between $220 million and $230 million pretax. Finally, we are not providing effective tax rate guidance for 2020 due to the range of potential impacts the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our business. With that, we'll now open the line for questions. I think, on -- inventory moves around on us all the time, and it's always hard to predict what's going to happen. Typically when prices are more stable, like we've been seeing the last couple of weeks, we tend to mute those kind of effects. I might add that we're coming up on the fall season and there's some seasonal impacts driving to and from schools is in rough numbers about 5% of demand, and there's probably a carryover impact on commuting as well. So, I think that will have an influence. We're expecting a strong planting season -- or excuse me harvest season this fall, as well to support distillate demand. Neil, just to quantify the Midstream, we reported $2.26 billion of EBITDA in 2019. At the Investor Day, we highlighted projects that could take that to $3 billion by 2022. The projects that we have deferred represent about $300 million to $400 million of EBITDA that would scale that back. And so, I think that's one way of thinking about it. From a DAPL perspective, you can see from our historical disclosure, it contributes or has contributed about $250 million a year to PSXP. We own roughly 75% of PSXP at PSX. So, the PSX impact is in the ballpark of about $200 million a year. I think the U.S. statistics, the DOE coming out weekly, that's kind of the most evident. But, if you look at Asian and European distillate inventories, they've come off their highs and are improving at a faster pace than what we're seeing in the U.S. Yes, not really building inventory in the Chemicals segment. So, if you go back to 2019, ethane's [Technical Difficulty] margin was $0.22, it was $0.18 in the first quarter and got to $0.10 in the second quarter but actually troughed about $0.07 in May. And today, we're pushing kind of $0.16. As you look across to the U.S., Europe and Asia, we're seeing rising prices. So, spot prices in the U.S. are up $0.08, contracts up $0.05, Europe contracts up $0.08 and Asia spot $0.055. And so, there's been really good price movement. Part of that reflects a rising crude price environment, part of that reflects just really strong demand for consumer products. And so, I would say, if you bifurcate kind of the petrochemicals business into consumer and durables, the consumer part is doing really well. The durables is still challenging, but improving. So, think automotive and others. And on the consumer side, which is mostly where CPChem is, market facing, there's kind of two trains that are going on. One is hygiene. And so, think about the wipes and the bleach and the detergent and the hand sanitizer and all that. And those products across the world continue to sell strongly. And the other is a term that chemicals guys are calling nesting that people aren't moving very far from the nest or staying home, they're cooking more, they're using more disposables, they are using more trash bags or buying more bottled water that's wrapped with plastic. They're buying -- doing home improvement projects, so polyethylene paint cans and garden chairs. They're trying to find things to do outside of the house. So, they're spending more money on kayaks and coolers and camping materials and things like that. It's all really positive for high density demand. So, I think we're constructive on the demand side. And I would say strong demand, weak to improving margins, and that's where we're running into. Yes. So, I walk through the components of liquidity that we have available to us, we're still in good shape in terms of, if we need additional cash, we have availability through the different sources that I commented on earlier. But as you sort of look beyond that and as we start to come out the other side of this from a prioritization standpoint, what you're going to see is that pay-down of debt will be in the near term a priority from a capital allocation standpoint. And typically we don't talk about having to pay down debt as part of capital allocation construct. And it still works out okay for us because we've got the term loan, $1 billion on the term loan. That matures in the first quarter of next year. We also have $0.5 billion floating rate note maturity, also in the first quarter of next year. And then, as you go into 2022, there's a $2 billion of notes coming due and there is another $0.5 coming due in 2023. So, we have plenty of opportunity to deal with this over the coming sort of next couple of years or so. I think, if we're able to take care of the 2021 maturities, like $1.5 billion, I think we'll feel pretty comfortable with where the balance sheet is at that point. That will still have us a slightly higher debt than we had when we went into this. But, in the overall scheme of things, I think, we'll feel pretty comfortable with where that puts us. Justin, it's Kevin. Yes. So, it's hard to speculate around activities that may or decisions that may or may not happen and how that will play out. But fundamentally, when you look at the MLP, it's got two levers at its disposal, right, in terms of helping its financial position. And then, one is the distribution; and two is the level of capital spending. And as you know, the capital spending is pretty high this year. But, a lot of those projects are coming to an end over the course of this year. And so, there'll be more flexibility, as you look into future years in terms of what CapEx needs to sit at the MLP. But, what I'd also say, as you step back and look at the PSXP, it is in a -- it goes into this in a very strong position. So, the MLP last year generated, at least almost $1.3 billion of EBITDA. It's got a strong balance sheet, strong credit rating. And that's a function of -- it was all the transactions that have taken place between PSX and PSXP over the last several years, they've all been done on a very fair basis, that both works for the MLP and for the sponsor. And at the same time, you sort of lay on a conservative financial strategy and policy around how we've managed the balance sheet at PSXP, and it's actually in a really good position. It's really hard to speculate around what other -- what sort of sponsor support might be provided on event that we don't know may happen around all of that. So, I think I'll probably just leave it there. One other comment though is, also bear in mind, DAPL is one asset, so PSXP is a great portfolio. It's predominantly fee-based driven assets. And while DAPL is a very -- it's significant asset, it's a good asset, it is just one asset within the broader portfolio. And so, we're pretty confident that PSXP will be able to work its way through this whole situation. Yes. I think, it's fair to look at -- what you probably want to look at CPChem on a year-to-date basis, the distributions were in Q1, and they were high in Q2. And so, it's probably more appropriate to think of it like that because it was an under -- in Q1 they under distributed from an earnings standpoint. And that's a big driver of that under distributed equity earnings benefit. It shows up on the cash flow statement. I think, maybe the only thing I'd add to that. As you think about kind of Gray Oak Fracs 2, 3, those are pretty much fixed fee. So, there's not a lot of commodity exposure there. Where we still have commodity exposure is really around the LPG export. And of course in the second quarter, we had some downtime for the tie-in. So, we ran the frac a little lighter and didn't give export barrels out and also the fees went down across the dock in the second quarter. But, we do think that we'll see some improvement in terms of get more volume across the dock and also some opportunities to increase dock fees. So that's where the big exposure is. And that's more than the $200 million, probably, if you think about it in the total scope, the opportunity set for us. Obviously, we completed most of the West Coast retail joint venture late last year, which is fortunate time for us. We've finished the rest earlier this month. So, we've taken back cash on the margins and the value driven by the West coast joint venture, and it's been about what we said it would be in about 50 million to 60 million barrels -- $50 million to $60 million a year in terms of EBITDA, for that joint venture. So, we're kind of happy about where it is. Of course, it's hard to tell during the COVID period but we think it's on track. And we'll continue to take a look at opportunities to grow that joint venture and opportunities to integrate into our business. We think integration is very important as Greg mentioned earlier, and we're looking for opportunities to integrate, particularly on the West Coast and even more particularly in the Middle America, where we have large refining business."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jeff Dietert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Jeff, you may begin.\nJeff Dietert: Good morning and welcome to Phillips 66\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call. Participants on today\u2019s call will include Greg Garland, Chairman and CEO; Kevin Mitchell, Executive Vice President and CFO; Bob Herman, Executive Vice President, Refining; Brian Mandell, Executive Vice President, Marketing and Commercial; and Tim Roberts, Executive Vice President, Midstream. Today\u2019s presentation material can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website, along with supplemental financial and operating information. Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement. We will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and our Q&A session. Actual results may differ materially from today\u2019s comments. Factors that could cause results to differ are included here, as well as in our SEC filings. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg Garland, for opening remarks.\nGreg Garland: Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before addressing the quarter, we want to comment on the current environment. First and foremost, our focus continues to be on the wellbeing of our employees and their families, our communities, maintaining safe and reliable operations, and ensuring the financial and operational strength of our company. Our business is essential and we\u2019re focused on providing critical energy products and services for our customers. The safety and health of our workforce is our top priority. Phillips 66 has implemented appropriate steps to protect our workforce that are consistent with CDC, national, state and local directives. We\u2019ve limited our operating facilities to business critical staff, and implemented strict protocols to prevent introduction and spread of the Coronavirus. In our Houston and Bartlesville offices, over 95% of our employees are working remotely. Our employees have stepped up to the challenge during these unprecedented times and are adopting new ways of working to ensure business continuity. Our plan today for our company, we have them in place to ensure a safe return to our normal operations. We contributed $3 million to COVID-19 relief efforts in the communities where we live and operate. The funds will provide essential support for first responders, food banks, healthcare, and other critical organizations serving vulnerable populations. We recently announced actions in response to the challenging business environment. We\u2019re focused on conserving cash and maintaining strong liquidity to manage through this unprecedented down-cycle. We secured a $2 billion term loan facility and issued $1 billion of senior unsecured notes. We suspended share repurchases in March. We\u2019ve taken action to reduce cost by $500 million this year. Organization is doing a great job of identifying opportunities and efficiencies. And we\u2019re leveraging our [Vantage 66] [ph] initiatives to achieve these cost savings. We\u2019re reducing consolidated capital spending by $700 million. This reduction will be partly offset by $400 million increase as DCP Midstream will not be exercising its option to participate in Sweeny Fracs 2 and 3 this year, In Midstream, we\u2019ve deferred the Red Oak Pipeline and Sweeny Frac 4 projects. Phillips 66 Partners has also deferred Liberty Pipeline and postponed final investment decision on the ACE Pipeline. In Refining, we\u2019re deferring and canceling certain discretionary projects. We continue to fund sustaining capital to ensure safe and reliable operations. And we\u2019re executing the in-flight projects that are nearing completion. We deferred some turnarounds until later this year and also into 2021. We\u2019ve reduced refinery runs across the system in response to lower product demand and margins. In April, our crude capacity utilization was in the high 60% range. These steps provide additional liquidity and flexibility, as we navigate this global crisis. By doing so, we\u2019re protecting the company, the security of the dividend and our strong investment grade credit rating. We remain focused on disciplined capital allocation and creating long-term value for our shareholders. In the first quarter total adjusted earnings were $450 million, or $1.02 per share. We generated $217 million of operating cash flow or $736 million, excluding working capital. We returned $839 million to our shareholders. During the quarter, we achieved strong safety performance. We continue to strive toward a zero incident, zero accident workplace. We\u2019re executing our strategy and progressing major growth projects. The Gray Oak Pipeline commenced full operations of West Texas service on April 1; and more recently, the Eagle Ford segment of the pipeline starting operations, marking completion of the project. At the Beaumont Terminal, we added 2.2 million barrels of fully contracted crude oil storage, increasing the terminal\u2019s total crude and product stores capacity to 16.8 million barrels. We continue to advance midstream growth projects scheduled for completion this year, including Sweeny Fracs 2 and 3, Beaumont dock 4, as well as PSXP\u2019s Clemens Caverns expansion and the South Texas Gateway Terminal. These projects are progressing well as planned. In Chemicals, CPChem and Qatar Petroleum are jointly pursuing development of petrochemical facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Qatar. CPChem continued front-end engineering design for its U.S. Gulf Coast project and advanced joint venture discussions with its partner. CPChem has deferred a final investment decision on the Gulf Coast project. In Refining, we completed the FCC unit upgrade at the Sweeney Refinery to increase production of higher-value petrochemical products and higher-octane gasoline. The project was completed on time and within budget. In Marketing, our West Coast retail joint venture is expected to close on the acquisition of approximately 100 sites in the second quarter of 2020 as previously announced. The joint venture enables increased long-term placement of our refinery production and increases exposure to retail margins. In closing, we\u2019re honored that 5 of our refineries were recently recognized by AFPM for their 2019 safety performance. Our Ferndale, Santa Maria, Borger, Lake Charles and Bayway refineries received Distinguished Safety Awards. This is the highest annual safety award in our industry, and the fourth year in a row that our refineries have received this honor. AFPM also recognized CPChem\u2019s Borger, Conroe, Orange and Port Arthur facilities for exemplary 2019 safety performance. So congratulations to all those facilities. We\u2019re proud of you, really well done. And with that, I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Kevin to go through the financials.\nKevin Mitchell: Thank you, Greg. Hello, everyone. Starting with an overview on Slide 4, we summarize our financial results. We reported a first quarter loss of $2.5 billion. We had special items amounting to an after-tax loss of $2.9 billion. This includes a $1.8 billion impairment of Refining segment goodwill, and a $1.2 billion pre-tax impairment of the company\u2019s investment in DCP Midstream. After excluding special items, adjusted earnings were $450 million or $1.02 per share. Operating cash flow was $736 million, excluding working capital. Adjusted capital spending for the quarter was $900 million, including $644 million for growth projects. We returned $839 million to shareholders through $396 million of dividends, and $443 million of share repurchases. We ended the quarter with 437 million shares outstanding. Moving to Slide 5. This slide highlights the change in pre-tax income by segment from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. During the period, adjusted earnings decreased $239 million, driven by lower results in Refining. The first quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 4%. The lower rate was primarily due to a higher proportion of income attributable to non-controlling interests and foreign operations relative to domestic results in a low earnings environment. Our rate was further reduced by impacts from state taxes and recent tax changes under the CARES Act. Slide 6 shows our Midstream results. First quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $460 million, an increase of $55 million from the previous quarter. Transportation adjusted pre-tax income was $200 million, down $50 million from the previous quarter. The decrease was due to lower equity affiliate earnings, largely reflecting reduced volume commitments on the REX Pipeline. In addition, decreased refinery utilization impacted volumes on our pipelines and terminals. On April 1, the Gray Oak Pipeline began the full operation of West Texas service, and later in April, the Eagle Ford segment came online. The pipeline is now fully operational. NGL and Other delivered record adjusted pre-tax income of $179 million. The $59 million increase from the prior quarter was due to propane and butane trading activity, as well as record margins at the Sweeny Hub. The Freeport LPG export facility averaged 13 cargoes per month and the fractionator ran at 114% utilization. DCP Midstream adjusted pre-tax income of $81 million was up $46 million from the previous quarter. The increase reflects hedging gains driven by lower commodity prices as well as lower operating costs. In response to the challenging environment, DCP Midstream is reducing costs, reducing growth capital by 75%, and recently cut the quarterly distribution by 50%. Turning to Chemicals on Slide 7. First quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $193 million, up to $20 million from the fourth quarter. Olefins and Polyolefins adjusted pre-tax income was $193 million. The $39 million increase from the previous quarter is due to higher polyethylene sales volumes, reflecting increased demand in the first quarter, primarily for food packaging and medical supplies, following lower seasonal fourth quarter demand. Global O&P utilization was 98%. Adjusted pre-tax income for SA&S decreased $23 million due to low margins and higher turnaround activity. During the first quarter, we received $33 million in cash distributions from CPChem. CPChem is taking steps to reduce 2020 capital by $600 million and operating costs by $300 million. Turning to Refining on Slide 8. Refining first quarter adjusted pre-tax loss was $401 million, down from adjusted pre-tax income of $345 million last quarter. Across our system, the weaker results were largely due to lower realized margins and volumes as well as higher turnaround costs. Realized margins for the quarter decreased by 25% to $7.11 per barrel. Crude utilization was 83% compared with 97% last quarter. The first quarter was impacted by significant turnaround activity, economic run cuts as well as unplanned downtime. We completed turnarounds at the Alliance, Sweeny and Los Angeles refineries. In addition, we had outages at the Bayway and Ponca City refineries. Pre-tax turnaround costs were $329 million, an increase of $97 million from the previous quarter. The first quarter clean product yield was 82%, a decrease from the prior quarter due to downtime on secondary units. Slide 9 covers market capture. The 3:2:1 market crack for the first quarter was $9.82 per barrel compared to $12.45 per barrel in the fourth quarter. Realized margin was $7.11 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 72%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 76%. Market capture is impacted by refining \u2013 refinery configuration, we make less gasoline and more distillate than premise in the 3:2:1 market crack. During the quarter, the distillate crack decreased approximately $4 per barrel, and the gasoline crack declined by almost $2 per barrel. Losses from secondary products of $1.32 per barrel improved $1.03 per barrel from the previous quarter due to falling crude prices. Losses from feedstock were $0.21 per barrel. Feedstock advantage declined $1.23 per barrel from the prior quarter. The decrease is primarily due to timing of crude purchases relative to crude runs. The other category reduced realized margins by $0.17 per barrel. This was an improvement of $0.37 per barrel from the prior quarter driven by clean product price realizations. Moving to Marketing and Specialties on Slide 10. Adjusted first quarter pre-tax income was $488 million, $201 million higher than the fourth quarter. Marketing and Other increased $197 million from higher realized margins, reflecting the impact of falling refined products spot prices, partly offset by lower volumes. Specialties increased $4 million due to higher finished lubricant margins. We reimaged 250 domestic branded sites during the first quarter bring the total to approximately 4,440 since the start of the program. In our international marketing business, we reimaged 11 European sites, bringing the total to approximately 90, since the program\u2019s inception. Refined product exports in the first quarter were 160,000 barrels per day compared with 157,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter. On Slide 11, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted pre-tax cost of $197 million, an improvement of $14 million from the prior quarter. The decrease is primarily due to lower employee related expenses, partially offset by higher charitable contributions. Slide 12 shows the change in cash during the quarter. We started the year with $1.6 billion in cash on our balance sheet. Cash from operations was $736 million, excluding working capital. There was a working capital use of $519 million. Consolidated debt increased by $1.2 billion. We funded $900 million of adjusted capital spending and returned $839 million to shareholders, including $443 million through share repurchases. On March 18, we suspended our share repurchase program. Our ending cash balance was $1.2 billion. We are focused on conserving cash and maintaining strong liquidity in the current environment. At March 31, we had $6.9 billion of liquidity, reflecting $1.2 billion of consolidated cash, a $5 billion revolving credit facility at Phillips 66 and the $750 million revolving credit facility at Phillips 66 Partners. Phillips 66 has a commercial paper program for short-term funding needs. In April, we paid off $525 million of maturing debt, executed $1 billion in bond issuances, and secured $1 billion of incremental term-loan capacity, which is currently undrawn. S&P and Moody\u2019s reaffirmed Phillips 66\u2019s investment-grade credit ratings of BBB+ and AAA respectively. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I\u2019ll cover a few outlook items. In Chemicals, we expect the second quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90%s. In Refining, crude utilization will be adjusted according to market conditions. In April, utilization was in the high 60% range. We expect second quarter pre-tax turnaround expenses to be between $45 million and $70 million. We anticipate second quarter corporate and other costs to come in between $200 million and $220 million pre-tax. With that, we\u2019ll now open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning. Thanks. Thanks team for taking the question. The first one is just around what you guys are seeing real time, on demand? You have a large marketing system. So any real-time data points would be valuable. And then, if you could tie that into your comments on utilization, you ran in the high 60%s in April, and recognizing there\u2019s probably some commercial limitations on the terms of how you you\u2019re able to talk about, how you expect that to go forward? Any thoughts as you think about planning in May, in June on the utilization side?\nGreg Garland: Okay. Brian?\nBrian Mandell: Hi, Neil, thanks for the question. We have line of sight in Western Europe where we have stores and also in the U.S. So we\u2019ll start with Western Europe. At the worst of the demand destruction, we were down about 70%. We\u2019ve seen things come back to about 50% now. In Germany and Austria, they\u2019re starting to open up those communities a little bit, bigger stores can now open. If you come over to the U.S. we were seeing 50% demand destruction depending on rural or urban areas. Now, that\u2019s up to about 35%. So things are getting better. In terms of refinery utilization, we are matching our utilization with demand. So as demand moves up, we are moving up our utilization as well. We got down to about 65% utilization when demand was at its worst.\nGreg Garland: So, Neil, as you think about gasoline demand, consumer-driven, roughly 35% of gasoline demand is driving to and from work. And recent statistics show over 90% of the U.S. population under some form of lockdown. And the pace of recovery is going to be driven by the impact of COVID-19 and the relief from these policies. About 16 states have scheduled to lift stay-at-home policies and public opinion starting to rally towards restarting the economy. As people come back to work and start driving, they\u2019ll be greeted with lower gasoline prices, down about 40% year-on-year at retail and support from $6 trillion stimulus package, which should support recovery as well.\nNeil Mehta: Yeah, appreciate that. The follow-up is, on the marketing side of the business, where earnings came in better than at least our model for the first quarter. Is there any guidance or the way we should think about that as we go into 2Q and 3Q, recognizing volumes would be down? Any thoughts in terms of how you see the next 6 months from a margin standpoint and whether there can be an offset?\nGreg Garland: Thanks, Neil. Certainly marketing speaks to the benefit of diversity in our portfolio. And as you might know, in Europe, where we had very, very strong margins, we have \u2013 about 80% of our stores in Western Europe are retail-owned, company-owned stores. So we get the benefit of the retail margin in that segment. And the retail margin was very, very strong. I\u2019ll say for the first quarter, until about mid-March, when COVID hit, we were running above volumes, budget volumes. And when COVID hit, we came off. But for the quarter, probably about 90% of volumes, but margins 2 to 3 times what we had budgeted for margins, so very, very strong margins. Typical of falling flat price, so really did a good job there. And in the U.S. where most of our stores are jobber-owned or wholesale-owned stores, still decent volumes in the U.S. and margin not as good as overseas, but we had good margins in the U.S. too with falling prices.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDoug Terreson: Good morning, everybody.\nGreg Garland: Hey, Doug.\nBrian Mandell: Morning.\nDoug Terreson: So, Greg, you guys have been originator of the disciplined capital management approach. And it\u2019s obviously serving shareholders well during the upturn and now the downturn too. So, kudos to the team for that. And while you reiterated your commitment today, we\u2019re in an unusual period of high industry stress, which is usually associated with consolidation, if financial and strategic merit is available. So my question is while you\u2019ve historically used your internal capital management program, to drive value, and you guys have obviously been successful, peers have often used acquisitions. And so, I want to see how you frame the strategic opportunity set today, whether you think it\u2019s that different from prior downturns, and also, any other notable color or philosophy that you can share on this topic?\nGreg Garland: Sure. Thanks, Doug. Well, this is 40 years for me in the business. This is my first global pandemic. I\u2019ve been through several economic crisis, so. And what I always tell people is that, single point in time forecasts in the middle of a crisis are always dangerous and often wrong. And that was true if crude was $100 and crude is $20. And we always view our business through the lens of mid-cycle, Doug. We think that\u2019s appropriate way to do it. We\u2019ve had this 60/40 allocation framework, 60% kind of reinvested back in our business and 40% return to shareholders. We still think that\u2019s a good framework. Obviously, there\u2019s times when you\u2019re going to be on the other side of that, like in the current crisis liquidity is king. You\u2019ve seen us take the steps to thin liquidity. But real purpose of that is protect the investment-grade credit rating and protect the dividend as we go through that. But we\u2019re going to come out of this on the other side of this, as I \u2013 so as I think about $6 billion to $7 billion of cash flow at mid-cycle, and I acknowledge we\u2019re certainly not mid-cycle today. So we always start with the sustaining capital. That\u2019s the first dollar. That\u2019s a billion dollars a year and our dividend is second, at $1.6 billion. And then, we\u2019ve kind of guided to $2 billion to $2.5 billion of share repurchase, $1 billion to $2.5 billion of growth capital. But as I look at all the CapEx cuts that I\u2019m seeing in the upstream business, 30%, in that range or higher for some, I think that the midstream investable opportunities are going to be challenged in 2021. And so, well, we\u2019re a long way to December, when we would normally set our capital budget. Today, I would tell you, we would probably guide to the low-end of that, and just in terms of the organic investable opportunities, that meet our hurdle rates. And then, as you think about that, if we\u2019re \u2013 we think as we get into 2021, we\u2019re back towards more mid-cycle conditions for the most part in terms of refining margins, chemical margins, et cetera. So, cash, certainly generation will improve. So we\u2019ll probably pay down some debt, have the opportunity to restart the share repurchase program. As I think about the dividend today at [$1.06] [ph], it\u2019s very affordable for us. In our normal cycle, we would look at probably increasing the dividend in kind of midyear. And this is certainly the prerogative of the Board. But as you think about it, we\u2019re 3 times the 10-year average dividend yield, of S&P 100. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a necessity for us to do something immediately. Because we get in the back half the year, we\u2019ll have a lot opportunities to think about what we do with the dividend in terms of increasing it in the back-half. To your question around M&A or acquisitions, so first point is never try to catch a falling knife, obviously. And as I think about TSX and how we\u2019re positioned, great diverse portfolio, strong balance sheet. We\u2019re well positioned to do what we need to do. The best thing is we don\u2019t have to do anything on the M&A front. We have great opportunities to create value for our shareholders, so we can be highly selective. There\u2019s a lot of examples out there today of folks that have done the M&A side of it. And it\u2019s really hard to create value doing that. And so, while I do think that there will be consolidation that comes both in upstream and midstream, through the balance of this year into 2021, just given the stress levels that people have, so there could be opportunities to pick up the assets of not even whole companies. And so, I think you\u2019ll see us look at everything. So we\u2019ll be very, very careful and very selective about what we might do, Doug.\nDoug Terreson: Okay, good framework, Greg. Thanks a lot.\nGreg Garland: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from BfA. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks, everyone. I am a bit reticent. I want to check you can hear me okay.\nGreg Garland: Yes.\nDoug Leggate: [indiscernible] having been some\u2026\nGreg Garland: You\u2019re coming through clear, Doug.\nDoug Leggate: Yeah, I think Chevron cut their IT budget it seems. But anyway \u2013 so, I just got a couple of questions. I guess, first of all, Greg, when you look at what\u2019s happening to gasoline and distillate, they\u2019ve got kind of contrasting fortunes right now. Valero made a comment on their call the other day that they expect the market or the industry to move quickly to rebalance the distillate set of the equation. I just wonder if you could offer your thoughts as to what Phillips thinks of that situation and how you might try and address it at your level. And I\u2019ve got a follow up, please.\nGreg Garland: Yeah, let me just make some overarching comments, and then Brian or Jeff can come in. I actually think that \u2013 you think about the energy space and energy sector, Doug, I actually think refining may well leave that space out of this. And I suspect in the U.S. it\u2019s is going to be around gasoline. People been cooped up. They want to drive. I think they\u2019re going to be reluctant to go get in the middle seat on an airplane at first. And I think that will come. We saw that certainly after 9/11, and people took a while to get back in the space. I think being in quarantine and being cooped up and just going crazy in the house, people are going to want to get out. And that should actually bring gasoline demand back pretty good. And indeed, we\u2019ve seen gasoline prices move up and not quite on parity with distillate. But then as the company starts to pick up, my view is that distillate demand is also going to pick up as we get the economy moving again. And so, I mean the real answer to the dilemma that we\u2019re facing today in energy impact for many companies, is we\u2019ve got to get demand going again. So Brian or Jeff, do you want to comment on top of that, please do.\nBrian Mandell: So I would say too, Doug, if to take a look at refinery yields between January and April in the U.S., you could see a gasoline was down from 50% to 44%, jet was down from 11% to 5%, half as much jet made, and distillate was up 9%, 29% to 38%. So, lot of the jet into the distillate. Refiners move from a gasoline economy to a distillate economy. And as a refiner, we continue to watch the cracks. As an example, now gasoline is over distillate in the West Coast. So we think about that and when we think about opportunities to move our refineries to make the products that people want. And I think you\u2019ll also see some gasoline come out of storage now and you\u2019ll see some distillate go into storage as demand starts to continue to increase distillate. If you take a look at the distillate contango and the crude contango, it\u2019s about the same, from prompt to December. So there\u2019s an incentive to store distillate as well. And I think you\u2019ll see some storage as well.\nDoug Leggate: That\u2019s really helpful color. Thank you. I guess my follow up is, we\u2019ve all been asking, at least in those who have reported so far, the E&Ps how they respond to price signals in terms of how quickly they go back to putting rigs back to work and all the rest of it. And I realize that\u2019s a longer-dated question. But I wanted to ask you the same question about refinery utilization, because the export market has obviously been a big sink for, I guess, excess product for a number of years now. So given the uncertainty in the global market, whether you\u2019ve got maybe a more specific issue here in the U.S., how do you think about \u2013 I mean, would you \u2013 when you see margins rebound, how quickly do you think you\u2019ll move your utilization up? Would you also be a little bit more paced or measured in the way that you respond to allow those margins to maybe get themselves a little stability at a higher level before you start moving to a higher level? I just want to think of behavioral \u2013 from a behavioral standpoint, how you guys are anticipating coming out the other side of this.\nGreg Garland: Maybe I\u2019ll continue out. I mean, first of all, the margins will lead us where we\u2019ll go, Doug. I mean, it will tell us where we need to increase rates or not. You want to just increase rates, increase rates, I think. Maybe it\u2019d be good, Bob, if you had thought \u2013 we\u2019ve really prepared the refineries to bring them back if we need to. And you may want to talk a little bit about that, and then I\u2019ll let Jeff come in over-the-top and then talk. But Bob, if you would?\nRobert Herman: Yeah. So as we\u2019ve ramped our refineries down, we actually found ways to get down to lower utilization than we would have ever imagined, I think, going into this, Doug. And we\u2019ve been pretty careful about how we park the units that we\u2019ve shutdown completely, and we do have some FCCs down and reformers to unmake gasoline in the list, but we\u2019ve kept our subject matter experts busy, making sure that we\u2019re ready to run when the signals are there. I think we\u2019re going to be pretty careful, though, about not bringing capacity back on too quickly because the last thing we or anybody else wants to do is starting it up and then shut it down a week later, or a couple of weeks later. So I think we\u2019re going to look for a pretty strong and a pretty stable demand signal from the market, before we start ramping up units that might be idled right now.\nJeff Dietert: Yeah. I think as we think about demand, it\u2019s really the combination of domestic demand and exports into the international market. So it\u2019s a combination of both. And as you know, China kind of had the COVID first and it\u2019s recovering. We\u2019re seeing that 80%, 90% back up so strong recovery in China. Europe and then the U.S. kind of got hit next, and those are starting \u2013 markets are starting to improve. Latin America, Central America, we\u2019re the last ones to get hit with the COVID impact. And so we\u2019re seeing a little bit of weakness there. But it\u2019s really a holistic approach to demand overall that we\u2019re using as a guide to run our refineries at the rate that matches that recovery.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRoger Read: Yeah, thanks. Good morning.\nGreg Garland: Hi, Roger.\nRoger Read: Just kind of following up a little bit on Doug\u2019s question there about how things come back and all that. Do you have a feeling for what is the inventory overage as you think about it from the refining down to the retail level? I mean, obviously, we get the gasoline stats every week. But would your view be that that\u2019s a stack full of inventory as everything else we look at, or that that might be a little bit better? I\u2019m just trying to think of the timing of recovery here as demand slowly starts to pick back up.\nJeff Dietert: Yeah. I think as we look at inventories as a percent of shale capacity, crude inventories running at a higher percentage than products. And especially at Cushing, there\u2019s about 92 million barrels a day of shale capacity there. If you look historically, Cushing inventories have kind of maxed out about 75% of shale, so that would be about 70 million barrels at Cushing, and we\u2019re currently at 63 million barrels. So that\u2019s an area where crude inventories are high relative to the capacity that\u2019s available. Gasoline distillate, some of the products, lower utilization of shale capacity at this point. But obviously, regional and local dynamics are extremely important. And we\u2019re factoring that into how we run the refineries to meet demand and the infrastructure that\u2019s available there.\nBrian Mandell: We have the addition of a flywheel for gasoline, because PADD 1 is an import market, Roger. And if you take a look at just the last DOEs, 160,000 barrels of gasoline came into PADD 1. That\u2019s about 25% at this time of year that less \u2013 or 75% less, 25% of what typically comes in, in PADD 1. So that\u2019s kind of the flywheel as we think about gasoline demand in the U.S. But I think the bottom line is refiners will produce just what demand is. We won\u2019t overproduce and that will keep us from filling up. We\u2019re far from filling up now globally or U.S.-wide. So we don\u2019t have any concerns on clean products.\nRoger Read: Okay, great. Thanks. And then, Greg, this question is probably for you. The performance of Chemical utilization in Q1, the guidance for a pretty strong Q2. Can you give us an idea of what\u2019s driving that? Why Chemicals has been managed or is managing to stay a lot stronger on the demand side than what we\u2019re seeing across most of the rest of the business ops?\nGreg Garland: Yeah. I think you kind of just start with a geographically diverse sales mix for CPChem and the fact that the high-density products that they make go into more consumer type markets. A lot of the chemical peers have a lot more exposure in automotive and automotive has been hit really hard. But if you think about detergent bottles and bleach bottles and hand sanitizer bottles, those things are flying off the shelf, and those are the kinds of things that CPChem makes. And then you\u2019re seeing a resurgence of disposable packaging as communities ban reusable bags and go back to the disposable bags. And so \u2013 I mean, that\u2019s been \u2013 and I think that one of the things we\u2019ve seen is really strong demand across all segments of all geographies. So good demand in Asia, good demand in Europe and good demand in the U.S. So it\u2019s really product portfolio driven.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPhil Gresh: Yes. Hi there.\nGreg Garland: Hey Phil.\nPhil Gresh: First question I have is probably best for Kevin. I just want to get some of your thoughts on the moving pieces here in the first quarter on cash flow. Free cash flow was negative in the quarter. There were some line items in CFO that looked negative there that didn\u2019t really have much of a description to them. But also then, as I think about the underlying performance, the Refining capture rates pretty varied depending on the region. So just any underlying color you could give on the performance in the quarter there.\nKevin Mitchell: Yeah, Phil. It\u2019s \u2013 so Q1 is usually a weak cash generation quarter anyway. And you\u2019re right that on the cash flow statement, if you dig into the details, so deferred taxes was a use of cash and normally that\u2019s an add back. That is specifically associated with the DCP impairment. And so if you sort of normalize for that, you would have had a sort of modest $200 million inflow on cash on that particular line item. So there are certain details like that that have an impact on the overall. But I would say, I think we\u2019re pretty pleased that from a working capital standpoint, typically a use of cash in the first quarter, it was this time but probably less than what we\u2019ve historically seen. Some of that\u2019s a function of \u2013 you may remember, in fourth quarter, we did not recover all of our 2019 working capital the way we had anticipated. And the reality is a lot of the inventory drawdown in the fourth quarter rolled into Q1 of this year from a cash standpoint just based on the timing of when those barrels were sold. We\u2019ve also been pretty aggressive in looking at other opportunities to sort of optimize around working capital. And then the other comment, just from an overall standpoint, we announced actions to reduce capital, reduce costs. But in the context of the first quarter, our spending really was \u2013 those activities were already sort of set in place and very little ability to directly influence capital. So it\u2019s on a \u2013 if you annualize our capital number for 1Q, you\u2019ll get quite a higher number than what we expect the full year to be. And there\u2019s no doubt, we did consume cash. We issued $1.2 billion of debt over the quarter and we ended the quarter with less cash than we started. So that is the reality of the environment. It was a tough environment. And of course, the high Refining turnaround costs are a drag as well. That you typically don\u2019t have in a normal steady state quarter. So I think I\u2019ll leave it at that.\nPhil Gresh: Okay. No, that\u2019s helpful. My second question is on Chemicals. Probably for Greg, given your experience in this business for a long period of time. We\u2019ve clearly seen oil prices come down, naphtha feedstocks getting more competitive. You announced that you\u2019re deferring the decision on the 2 crackers to 2021. But is there anything about this situation that you think has structurally changed in any way that the feedstock advantage of your facilities vis-\u00e0-vis naphtha-based facilities longer term? And as we look at the current environment, how do you think about trough fundamentals for Chemicals for your business? Are essentially there at this point? Thanks.\nGreg Garland: Yeah, so first of all, there\u2019s no question as crude prices have come down, that spread between, let\u2019s say, natural gas and crude has certainly diminished for LPG crackers such as CPChem, and that\u2019s true, Middle East or U.S. Gulf Coast. I would also say $20 crude is not sustainable in our view. And we think crude will ultimately normalize, and then we\u2019ll see that spread opportunity capture come back to us. And today, our view is, there\u2019s certainly sufficient NGLs to crack. But when you look at the cracks play today, naphtha is pretty competitive in that crack space. The C5, C4s are very competitive in that crack space. One of the things that we\u2019re seeing in Chemicals today though, that\u2019s unusual is given the automotive downturn, we\u2019re not consuming tires. And so making the butadiene go away is becoming a bigger and bigger issue. And as you know, naphtha makes a lot of co-products, of which butadiene is one of them. And so industry is looking \u2013 the tanks are full, industry is looking at co-cracking butadiene now just to make it go away. And so that will ultimately start to impact the economics of naphtha in that mix, because it\u2019s so highly dependent on the value of the co-products. So I would suggest that for the balance this year, you should expect the feedstocks in that chemicals chain to be quite volatile. But they\u2019ve all kind of converged around that same space. There\u2019s still 1 million barrels a day probably of ethane in rejection. And so we\u2019re still highly confident that this next wave of crackers coming on, there\u2019s going to be plenty of LPG feedstocks, albeit that they\u2019re going to be competing head on head with naphtha, at least through the balance of this year until crude gets back to a normal. Robert, you\u2019ve had a lot of experience in chemicals also. You want to add anything to that?\nRobert Herman: No, I think you\u2019ve got it, Greg. I think this is \u2013 we\u2019re at a moment, but I think it\u2019s just a moment. Crude has to \u2013 I think it\u2019s going to work its way back up. And you\u2019ll get that typical normal delta will come back from an advantaged feedstock.\nJeff Dietert: Phil, one thing I would say is we\u2019re starting to see delays in the construction of new capacity, both domestically and in Asia, so pushing out the start-up of planned capacity. Secondly, I\u2019d just say the polyethylene chain margin that we reported in our supplement was $0.178 per pound in 1Q. The April index is about $0.14 a pound. So that\u2019s kind of where we are today.\nGreg Garland: It could go single digits. So we\u2019ve seen it there before. And so I think we\u2019ll just have to watch as we go through the year. The fortunate thing is that demand has really held up well across that chain and that should be good.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPaul Cheng: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nGreg Garland: Good morning.\nPaul Cheng: 2 questions. Greg, if I look beyond just this year and next year, say, go into, say, 2022, 2023, in the post-COVID world, is there in energy front that change your investment criteria and your outlook for the logistics? And then when we argue that the budget cuts on the Upstream company probably, say, going to see at least 2 million barrels a day of the oil production drop, except the excess between late last year to end of next year. And we probably won\u2019t get back to early this year production level until maybe 2024 or even 2025. So is that a change in your view about that business at all?\nGreg Garland: Yeah. So we probably look at exit over exit in a 2 million to 3 million barrel range, Paul. We\u2019re probably maybe a little north of you on 2 million of where we see the exit rates. We do think that we\u2019re in a recovery phase. It\u2019s probably less investable opportunities in Midstream. And I think that forces us to rethink our Midstream growth opportunities. But you\u2019ve seen us do this before. In 2015, we were circa $6 billion of consolidated capital. And in 2017, we cut that to $1.8 billion. And so we\u2019re certainly willing to do that again if that\u2019s what the market tells us to do and we can\u2019t find investable opportunities, Paul. But longer term, I think, we get \u2013 we keep coming back. This pandemic will be over. There could be another one in the future we just don\u2019t know about. But the last one was 1917. So, the odds are good that we\u2019re going to get back on a growth trajectory here. There\u2019s still literally hundreds of millions of people that are coming into the middle class. There are going to be consumers, there are going to be petrochemicals, there are going to be consumers of energy. I think directionally, that should be positive for a return to growth. What we don\u2019t know is, does the growth go back to where it was or do we start growing from where we\u2019re at today? So I think that\u2019s the real question that is to be answered in front of us. Jeff, I don\u2019t know if you want to come in. As you\u2019re thinking about out in 2023 and 2024, you\u2019re seeing anything different?\nJeff Dietert: No, I think that was well said.\nPaul Cheng: And the second question is for Kevin, that you guys always have a conservative balance sheet. But after the COVID-19, as we\u2019re looking out, again, there\u2019s not so much about this year, next year, but on a longer term. Is your financial parameter, whether it\u2019s on the debt level, asset capital ratio or anything, or even that how you deal the PSXP as a vehicle for you, how those \u2013 is there any shape or pumping change?\nKevin Mitchell: Yeah, Paul, I don\u2019t think, long-term we would change our view on expectations around the balance sheet and leverage. We have historically talked about, at the PSX level, a leverage ratio, sort of 30% debt-to-cap ratio, 25% to 30%. And obviously, we\u2019re higher than that right now. And we\u2019ve been working both sides of that equation between the writedowns, had an impact on the denominator. And obviously, we\u2019ve added some debt and so we\u2019re sitting above that. But one of the reasons why we target what a lot would consider a very conservative leverage is so that when we come into times like this, we have the ability, the capacity to issue some incremental debt, weather the storm, come through that the other end and not have a detrimental impact on credit ratings and our ability to access debt markets. And so I think we feel very good that our financial strategy has really played out the way we would expect in times like this. I do think that as cash flow improves, we will have short-term debt coming out of this. Greg mentioned earlier, we will put priority on eliminating that debt. And we would expect that over time, we would get leverage back to within its \u2013 our sort of target level range.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nManav Gupta: Hey guys, some time back maybe 4 or 5 years, you sold a refining asset on the East Coast, which was then specifically reconfigured to produce jet fuel. I\u2019m trying to understand what happens to these assets across the world, which were specifically designed to produce jet fuel in the current environment in which we are?\nGreg Garland: Yeah, we\u2019re all looking at each other. Who wants to answer that question? So I guess I\u2019ll lead off. I\u2019m glad we sold it when we did. It\u2019s really hard, and Bob may want to comment, but it\u2019s really hard to move that configuration a lot, to produce jet fuel. I\u2019m not sure that the refinery is running that much different in terms of its output today or yield structure than \u2013 at least at the margins.\nRobert Herman: Yeah. I think if you just look at it over time, they\u2019ve prioritized making jet fuel, even when maybe the margins didn\u2019t drive them to do that, because of their ownership structures. But there\u2019s only so many kerosene molecules in a barrel of oil, and it\u2019s hard to get anything else than that done and they trade away the rest of the products for jet fuel, and that\u2019s kind of their business model. So we don\u2019t have any insight to what they\u2019re doing today when nobody \u2013 when they don\u2019t want the jet fuel, their parent company doesn\u2019t want the jet fuel, and nobody wants to trade them for jet fuel.\nManav Gupta: Okay. A quick follow-up is, we were monitoring global capacity additions for the next 2, 3 years. And I think, Jeff mentioned this on the Chemical side. Is there a probability that some of these refinery expansions also get delayed, postponed or just completely scrapped off, because of the credit crunch and other issues that we are seeing on the Refining side?\nJeff Dietert: Yeah. I think that\u2019s right. Typically, even in a profitable market with open financial markets, those projects \u2013 new projects tend to get delayed and start-up periods tend to be longer than anticipated. But that\u2019s especially the case with COVID activities impacting labor forces and construction, and the financial markets not quite as generous as what they have been. So we would definitely expect to see refining projects get pushed out. This year, we\u2019re expecting something comfortably under 1 million barrels a day of capacity adds and probably trending lower at this point. So yeah, I think you\u2019ve got a good point that both on the Refining side and the Chemicals side, new capacity additions are getting pushed out.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrad Heffern: Hey, good morning, everyone. Obviously, April was a crazy month in the crude markets that play on the physical side. I was just curious if you could talk about how Phillips, how much you guys were able to sort of capture those discounts, both in terms of the sort of regional basis and then also in terms of the contango that we\u2019ve seen? And then how long you think that that sort of thing can go on for?\nBrian Mandell: Well, I\u2019ll say that one of the great things we did and we talked about it at Investor Day, as part of Vantage 66, we had a group called the Value Chain Strategy and Optimization group, 36 employees, best and the brightest from around our different segments. And they were able to, really during this period of time, it was very fortuitous that we had them in place, think about how to optimize the entire system. So I\u2019ll give you an example. When prices for crude really fell, we were able to push barrels around into the refinery, use storage in the refinery that we might not have used new storage, third-party storage, and take advantage of really strong contango in the market. So contango is good for refiners. There are other things that are in play when you\u2019re analyzing value for refiners. But we were able to take advantage of a lot of the opportunities. We also have midstream assets where we can store product when there is a large contango. So it was good for us.\nJeff Dietert: Brad, I might just add, contango is typically a benefit for refiners on crude purchases. But we do have a number of different domestic crude contracts that impact or reflect the impact of contango and backwardation. But there is a number of other variables that impact pricing and margins. The timing of crude purchases versus product sales, location and transportation differentials, quality differentials and product placement options all influence market capture relative to the 3:2:1 benchmark cracks that you guys follow. So there are number of complexities to consider.\nBrad Heffern: Okay, got it, thank you. And then you guys touched some oil export barrels. I\u2019m just curious on how you think the outlook for that looks, both in terms of the demand for U.S. crude, given the obviously weakness in global product demand, but also sort of what happens if we see significant shut-in volumes? Thanks.\nGreg Garland: Well, obviously, if we see a lot of shut-in, we\u2019re seeing probably 30% shut-in right now. There\u2019ll be less exports. We think there will be less exports, probably in the 2.5 million barrels a day range going forward. But our crude\u2019s still needed. And as Jeff mentioned, Asia\u2019s starting to come back, and particularly China, South Korea, Japan and Thailand. So I think you\u2019ll see barrels continue to be exported. We export some of our light crudes, Bakken crudes and others overseas. I think you\u2019ll see that continue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair from Tudor, Pickering. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nGreg Garland: Good morning, Matthew.\nOperator: Matthew Blair, your line is open. Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gabelman from Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJason Gabelman: Good morning. How is everyone doing?\nGreg Garland: Well. Thank you\nJeff Dietert: Good. Good morning.\nJason Gabelman: Great. I wanted to ask a question first about the potential recovery in refinery margins. As investors try to figure out how long that takes, I think a useful corollary is prior recessions and downturns. And in the past few recessions, it\u2019s taken a couple of years for refining margins, global margins to really come off their lows based off the data we\u2019re looking at. So can you just discuss some of maybe the similarities and differences between the current situation we\u2019re in and past recessions, and how that\u2019s going to impact the recovery in refining margins? Thanks.\nJeff Dietert: Yeah. So I think it will be a factor of demand recovery and how rapidly demand recovers. In a number of previous cycles, there\u2019s been an oil price spike in front of the recessionary period that\u2019s really had a big and long-lasting impact on demand, whereas this has been much more around the COVID impact. And so, I think as businesses get back to work and consumers drive to and from work, that we\u2019ll see demand recover. And that will really drive the margin environment. We\u2019re likely to be in a supply long environment for a period of time, which is supportive of positive demand elasticity as well as low cost of goods sold for refiners. So I think there are some reasons for optimism in this cycle relative to previous cycles.\nJason Gabelman: Okay, understood.\nRobert Herman: I think maybe one thing I\u2019d add on that.\nJason Gabelman: Yeah.\nRobert Herman: Maybe one thing I\u2019d add on that too, just if you think about refining margins, it\u2019s in a $30 crude environment, a $15 margin is a lot more advantageous to refiners than it was maybe in past times when we came out and we had $80 crude or $100 crude, just because of the co-product impacts. So I think you could see refining margins rebound quickly.\nJason Gabelman: Fair, thanks. And then, just moving over to the marketing business, it was touched upon earlier in the Q&A. But we don\u2019t really have good visibility into what margins are doing right now. Clearly, the first quarter was very strong, given the rapid decline in crude prices, but how are refining margins trending now as oil prices have stabilized? And then, also if you could extend the comments to how volumes are doing relative to what you\u2019ve discussed in terms of overall demand destruction? Thanks.\nBrian Mandell: So was your question on marketing margins or refining margins?\nJason Gabelman: On marketing margins, yeah.\nBrian Mandell: So the margins in Western Europe are still very, very strong. We expect them to remain relatively strong. In the U.S., the margins are starting to stabilize some, but we still see them as being relatively good. Now, remember, in the U.S., a lot of our volume is wholesale volume and wholesale margins are smaller than the retail margins overseas. But we would expect demand to continue to increase and the margins to come off in the U.S., and that\u2019s it.\nJeff Dietert: David, do we have anyone else in the queue?\nOperator: We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.\nJeff Dietert: All right. Thank you very much for your interest in Phillips 66. We appreciate your time and interest. If you have further questions, please contact Brent or me. Thank you.",

            "name": "Robert Herman",
            "content": "Yeah. So as we've ramped our refineries down, we actually found ways to get down to lower utilization than we would have ever imagined, I think, going into this, Doug. And we've been pretty careful about how we park the units that we've shutdown completely, and we do have some FCCs down and reformers to unmake gasoline in the list, but we've kept our subject matter experts busy, making sure that we're ready to run when the signals are there. I think we're going to be pretty careful, though, about not bringing capacity back on too quickly because the last thing we or anybody else wants to do is starting it up and then shut it down a week later, or a couple of weeks later. So I think we're going to look for a pretty strong and a pretty stable demand signal from the market, before we start ramping up units that might be idled right now. No, I think you've got it, Greg. I think this is \u2013 we're at a moment, but I think it's just a moment. Crude has to \u2013 I think it's going to work its way back up. And you'll get that typical normal delta will come back from an advantaged feedstock. Yeah. I think if you just look at it over time, they've prioritized making jet fuel, even when maybe the margins didn't drive them to do that, because of their ownership structures. But there's only so many kerosene molecules in a barrel of oil, and it's hard to get anything else than that done and they trade away the rest of the products for jet fuel, and that's kind of their business model. So we don't have any insight to what they're doing today when nobody \u2013 when they don't want the jet fuel, their parent company doesn't want the jet fuel, and nobody wants to trade them for jet fuel. I think maybe one thing I'd add on that. Maybe one thing I'd add on that too, just if you think about refining margins, it's in a $30 crude environment, a $15 margin is a lot more advantageous to refiners than it was maybe in past times when we came out and we had $80 crude or $100 crude, just because of the co-product impacts. So I think you could see refining margins rebound quickly."

            "name": "Brian Mandell",
            "content": "Hi, Neil, thanks for the question. We have line of sight in Western Europe where we have stores and also in the U.S. So we'll start with Western Europe. At the worst of the demand destruction, we were down about 70%. We've seen things come back to about 50% now. In Germany and Austria, they're starting to open up those communities a little bit, bigger stores can now open. If you come over to the U.S. we were seeing 50% demand destruction depending on rural or urban areas. Now, that's up to about 35%. So things are getting better. In terms of refinery utilization, we are matching our utilization with demand. So as demand moves up, we are moving up our utilization as well. We got down to about 65% utilization when demand was at its worst. Morning. So I would say too, Doug, if to take a look at refinery yields between January and April in the U.S., you could see a gasoline was down from 50% to 44%, jet was down from 11% to 5%, half as much jet made, and distillate was up 9%, 29% to 38%. So, lot of the jet into the distillate. Refiners move from a gasoline economy to a distillate economy. And as a refiner, we continue to watch the cracks. As an example, now gasoline is over distillate in the West Coast. So we think about that and when we think about opportunities to move our refineries to make the products that people want. And I think you'll also see some gasoline come out of storage now and you'll see some distillate go into storage as demand starts to continue to increase distillate. If you take a look at the distillate contango and the crude contango, it's about the same, from prompt to December. So there's an incentive to store distillate as well. And I think you'll see some storage as well. We have the addition of a flywheel for gasoline, because PADD 1 is an import market, Roger. And if you take a look at just the last DOEs, 160,000 barrels of gasoline came into PADD 1. That's about 25% at this time of year that less \u2013 or 75% less, 25% of what typically comes in, in PADD 1. So that's kind of the flywheel as we think about gasoline demand in the U.S. But I think the bottom line is refiners will produce just what demand is. We won't overproduce and that will keep us from filling up. We're far from filling up now globally or U.S.-wide. So we don't have any concerns on clean products. Well, I'll say that one of the great things we did and we talked about it at Investor Day, as part of Vantage 66, we had a group called the Value Chain Strategy and Optimization group, 36 employees, best and the brightest from around our different segments. And they were able to, really during this period of time, it was very fortuitous that we had them in place, think about how to optimize the entire system. So I'll give you an example. When prices for crude really fell, we were able to push barrels around into the refinery, use storage in the refinery that we might not have used new storage, third-party storage, and take advantage of really strong contango in the market. So contango is good for refiners. There are other things that are in play when you're analyzing value for refiners. But we were able to take advantage of a lot of the opportunities. We also have midstream assets where we can store product when there is a large contango. So it was good for us. So was your question on marketing margins or refining margins? So the margins in Western Europe are still very, very strong. We expect them to remain relatively strong. In the U.S., the margins are starting to stabilize some, but we still see them as being relatively good. Now, remember, in the U.S., a lot of our volume is wholesale volume and wholesale margins are smaller than the retail margins overseas. But we would expect demand to continue to increase and the margins to come off in the U.S., and that's it."

            "name": "Kevin Mitchell",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Hello, everyone. Starting with an overview on Slide 4, we summarize our financial results. We reported a first quarter loss of $2.5 billion. We had special items amounting to an after-tax loss of $2.9 billion. This includes a $1.8 billion impairment of Refining segment goodwill, and a $1.2 billion pre-tax impairment of the company's investment in DCP Midstream. After excluding special items, adjusted earnings were $450 million or $1.02 per share. Operating cash flow was $736 million, excluding working capital. Adjusted capital spending for the quarter was $900 million, including $644 million for growth projects. We returned $839 million to shareholders through $396 million of dividends, and $443 million of share repurchases. We ended the quarter with 437 million shares outstanding. Moving to Slide 5. This slide highlights the change in pre-tax income by segment from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. During the period, adjusted earnings decreased $239 million, driven by lower results in Refining. The first quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 4%. The lower rate was primarily due to a higher proportion of income attributable to non-controlling interests and foreign operations relative to domestic results in a low earnings environment. Our rate was further reduced by impacts from state taxes and recent tax changes under the CARES Act. Slide 6 shows our Midstream results. First quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $460 million, an increase of $55 million from the previous quarter. Transportation adjusted pre-tax income was $200 million, down $50 million from the previous quarter. The decrease was due to lower equity affiliate earnings, largely reflecting reduced volume commitments on the REX Pipeline. In addition, decreased refinery utilization impacted volumes on our pipelines and terminals. On April 1, the Gray Oak Pipeline began the full operation of West Texas service, and later in April, the Eagle Ford segment came online. The pipeline is now fully operational. NGL and Other delivered record adjusted pre-tax income of $179 million. The $59 million increase from the prior quarter was due to propane and butane trading activity, as well as record margins at the Sweeny Hub. The Freeport LPG export facility averaged 13 cargoes per month and the fractionator ran at 114% utilization. DCP Midstream adjusted pre-tax income of $81 million was up $46 million from the previous quarter. The increase reflects hedging gains driven by lower commodity prices as well as lower operating costs. In response to the challenging environment, DCP Midstream is reducing costs, reducing growth capital by 75%, and recently cut the quarterly distribution by 50%. Turning to Chemicals on Slide 7. First quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $193 million, up to $20 million from the fourth quarter. Olefins and Polyolefins adjusted pre-tax income was $193 million. The $39 million increase from the previous quarter is due to higher polyethylene sales volumes, reflecting increased demand in the first quarter, primarily for food packaging and medical supplies, following lower seasonal fourth quarter demand. Global O&P utilization was 98%. Adjusted pre-tax income for SA&S decreased $23 million due to low margins and higher turnaround activity. During the first quarter, we received $33 million in cash distributions from CPChem. CPChem is taking steps to reduce 2020 capital by $600 million and operating costs by $300 million. Turning to Refining on Slide 8. Refining first quarter adjusted pre-tax loss was $401 million, down from adjusted pre-tax income of $345 million last quarter. Across our system, the weaker results were largely due to lower realized margins and volumes as well as higher turnaround costs. Realized margins for the quarter decreased by 25% to $7.11 per barrel. Crude utilization was 83% compared with 97% last quarter. The first quarter was impacted by significant turnaround activity, economic run cuts as well as unplanned downtime. We completed turnarounds at the Alliance, Sweeny and Los Angeles refineries. In addition, we had outages at the Bayway and Ponca City refineries. Pre-tax turnaround costs were $329 million, an increase of $97 million from the previous quarter. The first quarter clean product yield was 82%, a decrease from the prior quarter due to downtime on secondary units. Slide 9 covers market capture. The 3:2:1 market crack for the first quarter was $9.82 per barrel compared to $12.45 per barrel in the fourth quarter. Realized margin was $7.11 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 72%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 76%. Market capture is impacted by refining \u2013 refinery configuration, we make less gasoline and more distillate than premise in the 3:2:1 market crack. During the quarter, the distillate crack decreased approximately $4 per barrel, and the gasoline crack declined by almost $2 per barrel. Losses from secondary products of $1.32 per barrel improved $1.03 per barrel from the previous quarter due to falling crude prices. Losses from feedstock were $0.21 per barrel. Feedstock advantage declined $1.23 per barrel from the prior quarter. The decrease is primarily due to timing of crude purchases relative to crude runs. The other category reduced realized margins by $0.17 per barrel. This was an improvement of $0.37 per barrel from the prior quarter driven by clean product price realizations. Moving to Marketing and Specialties on Slide 10. Adjusted first quarter pre-tax income was $488 million, $201 million higher than the fourth quarter. Marketing and Other increased $197 million from higher realized margins, reflecting the impact of falling refined products spot prices, partly offset by lower volumes. Specialties increased $4 million due to higher finished lubricant margins. We reimaged 250 domestic branded sites during the first quarter bring the total to approximately 4,440 since the start of the program. In our international marketing business, we reimaged 11 European sites, bringing the total to approximately 90, since the program's inception. Refined product exports in the first quarter were 160,000 barrels per day compared with 157,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter. On Slide 11, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted pre-tax cost of $197 million, an improvement of $14 million from the prior quarter. The decrease is primarily due to lower employee related expenses, partially offset by higher charitable contributions. Slide 12 shows the change in cash during the quarter. We started the year with $1.6 billion in cash on our balance sheet. Cash from operations was $736 million, excluding working capital. There was a working capital use of $519 million. Consolidated debt increased by $1.2 billion. We funded $900 million of adjusted capital spending and returned $839 million to shareholders, including $443 million through share repurchases. On March 18, we suspended our share repurchase program. Our ending cash balance was $1.2 billion. We are focused on conserving cash and maintaining strong liquidity in the current environment. At March 31, we had $6.9 billion of liquidity, reflecting $1.2 billion of consolidated cash, a $5 billion revolving credit facility at Phillips 66 and the $750 million revolving credit facility at Phillips 66 Partners. Phillips 66 has a commercial paper program for short-term funding needs. In April, we paid off $525 million of maturing debt, executed $1 billion in bond issuances, and secured $1 billion of incremental term-loan capacity, which is currently undrawn. S&P and Moody's reaffirmed Phillips 66's investment-grade credit ratings of BBB+ and AAA respectively. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In Chemicals, we expect the second quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90%s. In Refining, crude utilization will be adjusted according to market conditions. In April, utilization was in the high 60% range. We expect second quarter pre-tax turnaround expenses to be between $45 million and $70 million. We anticipate second quarter corporate and other costs to come in between $200 million and $220 million pre-tax. With that, we'll now open the line for questions. Yeah, Phil. It's \u2013 so Q1 is usually a weak cash generation quarter anyway. And you're right that on the cash flow statement, if you dig into the details, so deferred taxes was a use of cash and normally that's an add back. That is specifically associated with the DCP impairment. And so if you sort of normalize for that, you would have had a sort of modest $200 million inflow on cash on that particular line item. So there are certain details like that that have an impact on the overall. But I would say, I think we're pretty pleased that from a working capital standpoint, typically a use of cash in the first quarter, it was this time but probably less than what we've historically seen. Some of that's a function of \u2013 you may remember, in fourth quarter, we did not recover all of our 2019 working capital the way we had anticipated. And the reality is a lot of the inventory drawdown in the fourth quarter rolled into Q1 of this year from a cash standpoint just based on the timing of when those barrels were sold. We've also been pretty aggressive in looking at other opportunities to sort of optimize around working capital. And then the other comment, just from an overall standpoint, we announced actions to reduce capital, reduce costs. But in the context of the first quarter, our spending really was \u2013 those activities were already sort of set in place and very little ability to directly influence capital. So it's on a \u2013 if you annualize our capital number for 1Q, you'll get quite a higher number than what we expect the full year to be. And there's no doubt, we did consume cash. We issued $1.2 billion of debt over the quarter and we ended the quarter with less cash than we started. So that is the reality of the environment. It was a tough environment. And of course, the high Refining turnaround costs are a drag as well. That you typically don't have in a normal steady state quarter. So I think I'll leave it at that. Yeah, Paul, I don't think, long-term we would change our view on expectations around the balance sheet and leverage. We have historically talked about, at the PSX level, a leverage ratio, sort of 30% debt-to-cap ratio, 25% to 30%. And obviously, we're higher than that right now. And we've been working both sides of that equation between the writedowns, had an impact on the denominator. And obviously, we've added some debt and so we're sitting above that. But one of the reasons why we target what a lot would consider a very conservative leverage is so that when we come into times like this, we have the ability, the capacity to issue some incremental debt, weather the storm, come through that the other end and not have a detrimental impact on credit ratings and our ability to access debt markets. And so I think we feel very good that our financial strategy has really played out the way we would expect in times like this. I do think that as cash flow improves, we will have short-term debt coming out of this. Greg mentioned earlier, we will put priority on eliminating that debt. And we would expect that over time, we would get leverage back to within its \u2013 our sort of target level range."

            "name": "Greg Garland",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before addressing the quarter, we want to comment on the current environment. First and foremost, our focus continues to be on the wellbeing of our employees and their families, our communities, maintaining safe and reliable operations, and ensuring the financial and operational strength of our company. Our business is essential and we're focused on providing critical energy products and services for our customers. The safety and health of our workforce is our top priority. Phillips 66 has implemented appropriate steps to protect our workforce that are consistent with CDC, national, state and local directives. We've limited our operating facilities to business critical staff, and implemented strict protocols to prevent introduction and spread of the Coronavirus. In our Houston and Bartlesville offices, over 95% of our employees are working remotely. Our employees have stepped up to the challenge during these unprecedented times and are adopting new ways of working to ensure business continuity. Our plan today for our company, we have them in place to ensure a safe return to our normal operations. We contributed $3 million to COVID-19 relief efforts in the communities where we live and operate. The funds will provide essential support for first responders, food banks, healthcare, and other critical organizations serving vulnerable populations. We recently announced actions in response to the challenging business environment. We're focused on conserving cash and maintaining strong liquidity to manage through this unprecedented down-cycle. We secured a $2 billion term loan facility and issued $1 billion of senior unsecured notes. We suspended share repurchases in March. We've taken action to reduce cost by $500 million this year. Organization is doing a great job of identifying opportunities and efficiencies. And we're leveraging our [Vantage 66] [ph] initiatives to achieve these cost savings. We're reducing consolidated capital spending by $700 million. This reduction will be partly offset by $400 million increase as DCP Midstream will not be exercising its option to participate in Sweeny Fracs 2 and 3 this year, In Midstream, we've deferred the Red Oak Pipeline and Sweeny Frac 4 projects. Phillips 66 Partners has also deferred Liberty Pipeline and postponed final investment decision on the ACE Pipeline. In Refining, we're deferring and canceling certain discretionary projects. We continue to fund sustaining capital to ensure safe and reliable operations. And we're executing the in-flight projects that are nearing completion. We deferred some turnarounds until later this year and also into 2021. We've reduced refinery runs across the system in response to lower product demand and margins. In April, our crude capacity utilization was in the high 60% range. These steps provide additional liquidity and flexibility, as we navigate this global crisis. By doing so, we're protecting the company, the security of the dividend and our strong investment grade credit rating. We remain focused on disciplined capital allocation and creating long-term value for our shareholders. In the first quarter total adjusted earnings were $450 million, or $1.02 per share. We generated $217 million of operating cash flow or $736 million, excluding working capital. We returned $839 million to our shareholders. During the quarter, we achieved strong safety performance. We continue to strive toward a zero incident, zero accident workplace. We're executing our strategy and progressing major growth projects. The Gray Oak Pipeline commenced full operations of West Texas service on April 1; and more recently, the Eagle Ford segment of the pipeline starting operations, marking completion of the project. At the Beaumont Terminal, we added 2.2 million barrels of fully contracted crude oil storage, increasing the terminal's total crude and product stores capacity to 16.8 million barrels. We continue to advance midstream growth projects scheduled for completion this year, including Sweeny Fracs 2 and 3, Beaumont dock 4, as well as PSXP's Clemens Caverns expansion and the South Texas Gateway Terminal. These projects are progressing well as planned. In Chemicals, CPChem and Qatar Petroleum are jointly pursuing development of petrochemical facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Qatar. CPChem continued front-end engineering design for its U.S. Gulf Coast project and advanced joint venture discussions with its partner. CPChem has deferred a final investment decision on the Gulf Coast project. In Refining, we completed the FCC unit upgrade at the Sweeney Refinery to increase production of higher-value petrochemical products and higher-octane gasoline. The project was completed on time and within budget. In Marketing, our West Coast retail joint venture is expected to close on the acquisition of approximately 100 sites in the second quarter of 2020 as previously announced. The joint venture enables increased long-term placement of our refinery production and increases exposure to retail margins. In closing, we're honored that 5 of our refineries were recently recognized by AFPM for their 2019 safety performance. Our Ferndale, Santa Maria, Borger, Lake Charles and Bayway refineries received Distinguished Safety Awards. This is the highest annual safety award in our industry, and the fourth year in a row that our refineries have received this honor. AFPM also recognized CPChem's Borger, Conroe, Orange and Port Arthur facilities for exemplary 2019 safety performance. So congratulations to all those facilities. We're proud of you, really well done. And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin to go through the financials. Okay. Brian? So, Neil, as you think about gasoline demand, consumer-driven, roughly 35% of gasoline demand is driving to and from work. And recent statistics show over 90% of the U.S. population under some form of lockdown. And the pace of recovery is going to be driven by the impact of COVID-19 and the relief from these policies. About 16 states have scheduled to lift stay-at-home policies and public opinion starting to rally towards restarting the economy. As people come back to work and start driving, they'll be greeted with lower gasoline prices, down about 40% year-on-year at retail and support from $6 trillion stimulus package, which should support recovery as well. Thanks, Neil. Certainly marketing speaks to the benefit of diversity in our portfolio. And as you might know, in Europe, where we had very, very strong margins, we have \u2013 about 80% of our stores in Western Europe are retail-owned, company-owned stores. So we get the benefit of the retail margin in that segment. And the retail margin was very, very strong. I'll say for the first quarter, until about mid-March, when COVID hit, we were running above volumes, budget volumes. And when COVID hit, we came off. But for the quarter, probably about 90% of volumes, but margins 2 to 3 times what we had budgeted for margins, so very, very strong margins. Typical of falling flat price, so really did a good job there. And in the U.S. where most of our stores are jobber-owned or wholesale-owned stores, still decent volumes in the U.S. and margin not as good as overseas, but we had good margins in the U.S. too with falling prices. Hey, Doug. Sure. Thanks, Doug. Well, this is 40 years for me in the business. This is my first global pandemic. I've been through several economic crisis, so. And what I always tell people is that, single point in time forecasts in the middle of a crisis are always dangerous and often wrong. And that was true if crude was $100 and crude is $20. And we always view our business through the lens of mid-cycle, Doug. We think that's appropriate way to do it. We've had this 60/40 allocation framework, 60% kind of reinvested back in our business and 40% return to shareholders. We still think that's a good framework. Obviously, there's times when you're going to be on the other side of that, like in the current crisis liquidity is king. You've seen us take the steps to thin liquidity. But real purpose of that is protect the investment-grade credit rating and protect the dividend as we go through that. But we're going to come out of this on the other side of this, as I \u2013 so as I think about $6 billion to $7 billion of cash flow at mid-cycle, and I acknowledge we're certainly not mid-cycle today. So we always start with the sustaining capital. That's the first dollar. That's a billion dollars a year and our dividend is second, at $1.6 billion. And then, we've kind of guided to $2 billion to $2.5 billion of share repurchase, $1 billion to $2.5 billion of growth capital. But as I look at all the CapEx cuts that I'm seeing in the upstream business, 30%, in that range or higher for some, I think that the midstream investable opportunities are going to be challenged in 2021. And so, well, we're a long way to December, when we would normally set our capital budget. Today, I would tell you, we would probably guide to the low-end of that, and just in terms of the organic investable opportunities, that meet our hurdle rates. And then, as you think about that, if we're \u2013 we think as we get into 2021, we're back towards more mid-cycle conditions for the most part in terms of refining margins, chemical margins, et cetera. So, cash, certainly generation will improve. So we'll probably pay down some debt, have the opportunity to restart the share repurchase program. As I think about the dividend today at [$1.06] [ph], it's very affordable for us. In our normal cycle, we would look at probably increasing the dividend in kind of midyear. And this is certainly the prerogative of the Board. But as you think about it, we're 3 times the 10-year average dividend yield, of S&P 100. I don't think there's a necessity for us to do something immediately. Because we get in the back half the year, we'll have a lot opportunities to think about what we do with the dividend in terms of increasing it in the back-half. To your question around M&A or acquisitions, so first point is never try to catch a falling knife, obviously. And as I think about TSX and how we're positioned, great diverse portfolio, strong balance sheet. We're well positioned to do what we need to do. The best thing is we don't have to do anything on the M&A front. We have great opportunities to create value for our shareholders, so we can be highly selective. There's a lot of examples out there today of folks that have done the M&A side of it. And it's really hard to create value doing that. And so, while I do think that there will be consolidation that comes both in upstream and midstream, through the balance of this year into 2021, just given the stress levels that people have, so there could be opportunities to pick up the assets of not even whole companies. And so, I think you'll see us look at everything. So we'll be very, very careful and very selective about what we might do, Doug. Thank you. Yes. You're coming through clear, Doug. Yeah, let me just make some overarching comments, and then Brian or Jeff can come in. I actually think that \u2013 you think about the energy space and energy sector, Doug, I actually think refining may well leave that space out of this. And I suspect in the U.S. it's is going to be around gasoline. People been cooped up. They want to drive. I think they're going to be reluctant to go get in the middle seat on an airplane at first. And I think that will come. We saw that certainly after 9/11, and people took a while to get back in the space. I think being in quarantine and being cooped up and just going crazy in the house, people are going to want to get out. And that should actually bring gasoline demand back pretty good. And indeed, we've seen gasoline prices move up and not quite on parity with distillate. But then as the company starts to pick up, my view is that distillate demand is also going to pick up as we get the economy moving again. And so, I mean the real answer to the dilemma that we're facing today in energy impact for many companies, is we've got to get demand going again. So Brian or Jeff, do you want to comment on top of that, please do. Maybe I'll continue out. I mean, first of all, the margins will lead us where we'll go, Doug. I mean, it will tell us where we need to increase rates or not. You want to just increase rates, increase rates, I think. Maybe it'd be good, Bob, if you had thought \u2013 we've really prepared the refineries to bring them back if we need to. And you may want to talk a little bit about that, and then I'll let Jeff come in over-the-top and then talk. But Bob, if you would? Hi, Roger. Yeah. I think you kind of just start with a geographically diverse sales mix for CPChem and the fact that the high-density products that they make go into more consumer type markets. A lot of the chemical peers have a lot more exposure in automotive and automotive has been hit really hard. But if you think about detergent bottles and bleach bottles and hand sanitizer bottles, those things are flying off the shelf, and those are the kinds of things that CPChem makes. And then you're seeing a resurgence of disposable packaging as communities ban reusable bags and go back to the disposable bags. And so \u2013 I mean, that's been \u2013 and I think that one of the things we've seen is really strong demand across all segments of all geographies. So good demand in Asia, good demand in Europe and good demand in the U.S. So it's really product portfolio driven. Hey Phil. Yeah, so first of all, there's no question as crude prices have come down, that spread between, let's say, natural gas and crude has certainly diminished for LPG crackers such as CPChem, and that's true, Middle East or U.S. Gulf Coast. I would also say $20 crude is not sustainable in our view. And we think crude will ultimately normalize, and then we'll see that spread opportunity capture come back to us. And today, our view is, there's certainly sufficient NGLs to crack. But when you look at the cracks play today, naphtha is pretty competitive in that crack space. The C5, C4s are very competitive in that crack space. One of the things that we're seeing in Chemicals today though, that's unusual is given the automotive downturn, we're not consuming tires. And so making the butadiene go away is becoming a bigger and bigger issue. And as you know, naphtha makes a lot of co-products, of which butadiene is one of them. And so industry is looking \u2013 the tanks are full, industry is looking at co-cracking butadiene now just to make it go away. And so that will ultimately start to impact the economics of naphtha in that mix, because it's so highly dependent on the value of the co-products. So I would suggest that for the balance this year, you should expect the feedstocks in that chemicals chain to be quite volatile. But they've all kind of converged around that same space. There's still 1 million barrels a day probably of ethane in rejection. And so we're still highly confident that this next wave of crackers coming on, there's going to be plenty of LPG feedstocks, albeit that they're going to be competing head on head with naphtha, at least through the balance of this year until crude gets back to a normal. Robert, you've had a lot of experience in chemicals also. You want to add anything to that? It could go single digits. So we've seen it there before. And so I think we'll just have to watch as we go through the year. The fortunate thing is that demand has really held up well across that chain and that should be good. Good morning. Yeah. So we probably look at exit over exit in a 2 million to 3 million barrel range, Paul. We're probably maybe a little north of you on 2 million of where we see the exit rates. We do think that we're in a recovery phase. It's probably less investable opportunities in Midstream. And I think that forces us to rethink our Midstream growth opportunities. But you've seen us do this before. In 2015, we were circa $6 billion of consolidated capital. And in 2017, we cut that to $1.8 billion. And so we're certainly willing to do that again if that's what the market tells us to do and we can't find investable opportunities, Paul. But longer term, I think, we get \u2013 we keep coming back. This pandemic will be over. There could be another one in the future we just don't know about. But the last one was 1917. So, the odds are good that we're going to get back on a growth trajectory here. There's still literally hundreds of millions of people that are coming into the middle class. There are going to be consumers, there are going to be petrochemicals, there are going to be consumers of energy. I think directionally, that should be positive for a return to growth. What we don't know is, does the growth go back to where it was or do we start growing from where we're at today? So I think that's the real question that is to be answered in front of us. Jeff, I don't know if you want to come in. As you're thinking about out in 2023 and 2024, you're seeing anything different? Yeah, we're all looking at each other. Who wants to answer that question? So I guess I'll lead off. I'm glad we sold it when we did. It's really hard, and Bob may want to comment, but it's really hard to move that configuration a lot, to produce jet fuel. I'm not sure that the refinery is running that much different in terms of its output today or yield structure than \u2013 at least at the margins. Well, obviously, if we see a lot of shut-in, we're seeing probably 30% shut-in right now. There'll be less exports. We think there will be less exports, probably in the 2.5 million barrels a day range going forward. But our crude's still needed. And as Jeff mentioned, Asia's starting to come back, and particularly China, South Korea, Japan and Thailand. So I think you'll see barrels continue to be exported. We export some of our light crudes, Bakken crudes and others overseas. I think you'll see that continue. Good morning, Matthew. Well. Thank you"

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jeff Dietert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Jeff, you may begin.\nJeff Dietert: Good morning, And welcome to Phillips 66 fourth quarter earnings conference call. Participants on today\u2019s call will include Greg Garland, Chairman and CEO; Mark Lashier, President and COO; Kevin Mitchell, EVP and CFO; Bob Herman, EVP, Refining; Brian Mandell, EVP, Marketing and Commercial; and Tim Roberts, EVP, Midstream. Today\u2019s presentation material can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website, along with supplemental financial and operating information. Slide two contains our Safe Harbor statement. We will be making forward-looking statements during today\u2019s presentation and our Q&A session. Actual results may differ materially from today\u2019s comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here, as well as in our SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to Greg.\nGreg Garland: Okay, Jeff. Thank you. Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today. In the fourth quarter, we had adjusted earnings of $1.3 billion or $2.94 per share. For the year, adjusted earnings were $2.5 billion or $5.70 per share. We delivered record results in Midstream, Chemicals, and Marketing and Specialties, demonstrating the strength of our diversified portfolio. For the third quarter in a row, we saw improved Refining performance. Looking ahead, we are optimistic about the outlook for our business. In 2021, our employees exemplified the company\u2019s values of safety, honor and commitment. Our 2021 combined workforce total recordable rate of 0.12 was more than 25 times better than U.S. manufacturing average. Last year, our strong cash flow generation allowed us to invest $1.9 billion back into the business, returned $1.6 billion to shareholders and paid down $1.5 billion of debt. The 2022 capital program of $1.9 billion reflects our commitment to capital discipline. Approximately 45% of our growth capital this year will support lower carbon opportunities, including Rodeo Renewed. As cash flow improves further, we will prioritize shareholder returns and debt repayment. In October, we increased the quarterly dividend to $0.92 per share. We remain committed to a secure, competitive and growing dividend. We would like to resume share repurchases this year and on our path towards getting back to pre-COVID debt levels over the next couple of years. We are taking steps to position Phillips 66 for the long-term competitiveness. Across our businesses we are assessing opportunities for permanent cost reactions. Mark and Kevin are leading this initiative, and we will provide additional details on the first quarter call in April. We are committed to a lower carbon future, while continuing to deliver our vision of providing energy and improving lives around the globe. We announced targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity last year. By 2030, we plan to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 30%, and Scope 3 emissions by 15% compared to 2019 levels. So, with that, I will turn the call over to Mark to provide some more details.\nMark Lashier: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we had strong earnings from Midstream, Chemicals and Marketing and Specialties, and we saw continued recovery in Refining profitability. We made progress advancing our growth projects, as well as taking strategic actions to position Phillips 66 for the future. In Midstream, we began commercial operations of Phillips 66 Partners, C2G Pipeline at the Sweeny Hub construction of Frac 4 is 50% complete and we expect to begin operations in the fourth quarter of this year. CPChem is investing in a portfolio of high-return projects growing its asset base, as well as optimizing its existing operations. This includes growing its normal alpha olefins business with a second world-scale unit to produce 1-hexene, a critical component in high-performance polyethylene. CPChem is also expanding its propylene splitting capacity by 1 billion pounds per year with a new unit located at its Cedar Bayou facility, both projects are expected to start up in 2023. CPChem continues to develop two world-scale petrochemical facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Ras Laffan, Qatar. In addition, CPChem completed its first commercial sales of Marlex Anew Circular Polyethylene, which uses advanced recycling technology to convert difficult to recycle plastic waste into high quality raw materials. CPChem successfully processed pyrolysis oil in a certified commercial-scale trial and is targeting annual production of 1 billion pounds of circular polyethylene by 2030. During the year, we began renewable diesel production at the San Francisco Refinery and continued to progress Rodeo Renewed, which is expected to be completed in early 2024 subject to permitting and approvals. Upon completion, Rodeo will initially have over 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuel production capacity. The conversion will reduce emissions from the facility and produce lower carbon transportation fuels. In Marketing, we acquired a commercial fleet fueling business in California providing further placement opportunities for Rodeo renewable diesel production to end-use customers. Additionally, our retail marketing joint venture in the Central region acquired 85 sites in December, bringing the total to approximately 200 sites acquired in 2021. These sites support long-term product placement and extend our participation in the retail value chain. Our Emerging Energy Group is advancing opportunities in renewable fuels, batteries, carbon capture and hydrogen. We recently signed a technical development agreement with NOVONIX to accelerate the development of next-generation materials for the U.S. battery supply chain. We own a 16% stake in the company, extending our presence in the battery value chain. In December, we entered into a multiyear agreement with British Airways to supply sustainable aviation fuel produced by our Humber Refining -- Refinery beginning this year. For 2022, we will execute our strategy with a focus on operating excellence and cost management. We will do our part to advance the lower carbon future, while maintaining discipline capital allocation and an emphasis on returns. Now, I will turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results.\nKevin Mitchell: Thank you, Mark, and hello, everyone. Starting with an overview on Slide 4, we summarize our financial results for the year. Adjusted earnings were $2.5 billion or $5.70 per share. We generated $6 billion of operating cash flow or $3.9 billion, excluding working capital. These results reflect our highest annual earnings for the Midstream, Chemicals, and Marketing and Specialties segments. Cash distributions from equity affiliates totaled $3 billion, including a record $1.6 billion from CPChem. We ended 2021 with a net debt to capital ratio of 34%. Our adjusted after-tax return on capital employed for the year was 9%. Slide 5 shows the change in cash during the year. We started the year with $2.5 billion in cash. Cash from operations was $6 billion. This included a working capital benefit of $2.1 billion, mainly due to the receipt of tax refunds, as well as the impact of rising prices on our net payable position. During the year, we paid down $1.5 billion of debt. In November, both S&P and Moody\u2019s revised their outlooks from negative to stable. We are committed to further deleveraging as we continue to prioritize our strong investment-grade credit ratings. We funded $1.9 billion of capital spending and returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through dividends. Our ending cash balance increased to $3.1 billion. Slide 6 summarizes our fourth quarter results. Adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion or $2.94 per share. We generated operating cash flow of $1.8 billion, including a working capital benefit of $412 million and cash distributions from equity affiliates of $757 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $597 million, $265 million was for growth projects, which included approximately $100 million for retail investments in the Marketing business. We paid $403 million in dividends. Moving to Slide 7, this slide highlights the change in adjusted results from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, a decrease of $105 million. Our adjusted effective income tax rate was 20% for the fourth quarter. Slide 8 shows our Midstream results. Fourth quarter adjusted pretax income was $668 million, an increase of $26 million from the previous quarter. Transportation contributed adjusted pretax income of $273 million, up $19 million from the prior quarter. The increase mainly reflects the recognition of deferred revenue. NGL and other adjusted pretax income was $284 million, compared with $357 million in the third quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower unrealized investment gains related to NOVONIX, partially offset by higher volumes at Sweeny Hub and favorable inventory impacts. Our investment in NOVONIX is mark-to-market at the end of each reporting period. The total value of the investment, including foreign exchange impacts increased $146 million in the fourth quarter, compared to an increase of $224 million in the third quarter. The fractionators at the Sweeny Hub averaged a record 417,000 barrels per day and the Freeport LPG export facility loaded a record 45 cargoes in the fourth quarter. DCP Midstream adjusted pretax income of $111 million, was up $80 million from the previous quarter, mainly due to favorable hedging impacts in the fourth quarter, compared to negative hedge results in the third quarter. The actual hedge benefit recognized in the fourth quarter amounted to approximately $50 million. Turning to Chemicals on Slide 9. Chemicals fourth quarter adjusted pretax income of $424 million was down $210 million from the third quarter. Olefins and Polyolefins adjusted pretax income was $405 million. The $208 million decrease from the previous quarter was primarily due to lower polyethylene margins, reduced sales volumes, as well as increased utility costs. Global O&P utilization was 97% for the quarter. Adjusted pretax income for SA&S was $37 million, compared with $36 million in the third quarter. During the fourth quarter, we received $479 million in cash distributions from CPChem. Turning to Refining on Slide 10. Refining fourth quarter adjusted pretax income was $404 million, an improvement of $220 million from the third quarter, driven by higher realized margins and improved volumes. This was partially offset by higher costs. Realized margins for the quarter increased by 35% to $11.60 per barrel. Impacts from lower market crack spreads were more than offset by lower RIN costs from a reduction in our estimated 2021 compliance year obligation and lower RIN prices. In addition, we had favorable inventory impacts and improved clean product differrentials. Refining adjusted results reflect approximately $230 million related to the EPA\u2019s proposed reduction of the RVO, of which about 75% applies to the first three quarters of the year. Pretax turnaround costs were $106 million, up from $81 million in the prior quarter. Crude utilization was 90% in the fourth quarter and clean product yield was 86%. Slide 11 covers market capture. The 3:2:1 market crack for the fourth quarter was $17.93 per barrel, compared to $19.44 per barrel in the third quarter. Realized margin was $11.60 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 65%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 44%. Market capture is impacted by the configuration of our refineries. Our refineries are more heavily weighted toward distillate production and the market indicator. During the quarter, the distillate crack increased $3.10 per barrel and the gasoline crack decreased $3.76 per barrel. Losses from secondary products of $1.88 per barrel improved $0.10 per barrel from the previous quarter, due to increased butane blending into gasoline. Our feedstock advantage of $0.18 per barrel improved by $0.17 per barrel from the prior quarter. The other category reduced realized margins by $2.02 per barrel. This category includes RINs, freight costs, clean product realizations and inventory impacts. Moving to Marketing and Specialties on Slide 12. Adjusted fourth quarter pretax income was $499 million, compared with $547 million in the prior quarter. Marketing and other decreased $52 million from the prior quarter. This was primarily due to lower marketing fuel margins and volumes, as well as higher costs. Specialties generated fourth quarter adjusted pretax income of $97 million, up from $93 million in the prior quarter. On Slide 13, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted pretax costs of $245 million, an increase of $15 million from the prior quarter. This was primarily due to higher employee-related costs and net interest expense. Slide 14 shows the change in cash during the fourth quarter. We had another strong quarter for cash. This is the third consecutive quarter that our operating cash flow enabled us to return cash to shareholders, invest in the business, pay down debt, while increasing our cash balance. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I will cover a few outlook items for the first quarter and the full year. In Chemicals, we expect the first quarter Global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the first quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the high-80s and pretax turnaround expenses to be between $120 million and $150 million. We anticipate first quarter Corporate and Other costs to come in between $230 million and $250 million pretax. For 2022, we plan full year turnaround expenses to be between $800 million and $900 million pretax. We expect Corporate and Other costs to be in the range of $900 million to $950 million pretax for the year. We anticipate full year D&A of about $1.4 billion, and finally, we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the 20% to 25% range. Now, we will open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, team. Greg, good morning. Greg and Kevin, first question for you on, how you are thinking about normalized cash flow? If I look at the back half of 2021, ex working capital, you put up almost $3 billion of cash flow, so annualized, close to $6 billion. I think a lot of us use $5 billion to $6 billion of sort of that normalized cash flow range. But Greg, you have been clear that you think it\u2019s kind of closer to $6 billion to $7 billion. And so just your thoughts on whether that\u2019s still how you are thinking about mid-cycle and the underlying buildup to that $6 billion to $7 billion, if you can kind of walk through the world of your different segments of how you get there would be great.\nGreg Garland: I will be happy to do that. I mean, I don\u2019t think we really changed from our view of $6 billion to $7 billion. Of course, it\u2019s nice to see $6 billion of cash last year. It just happened to occur in different buckets that you might expect from a traditional cycle. So I think we have been signaling in the last couple of months. We are pretty constructive on the Refining business coming into 2022. And if you think about the rest of the businesses, they have actually performed at or better than mid-cycle all through the pandemic in 2020 and into 2021. We remain pretty constructive on those businesses coming into 2022 at all. So really, for us, a wildcard has really been Refining and when has Refining recovered back to something approaching a mid-cycle. But just to remember how it all builds up on an EBITDA basis kind of $4-ish billion in Refining, kind of $2 billion in Midstream, $2 billion in Chemicals and $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion in Marketing and Specialties, it pushes you to something like $9-ish billion of EBITDA, which translates to $6 billion to $7 billion of cash. And so I think we are pretty comfortable that we are kind of still in that range. Obviously, we have had some outperformance. I mean, last year, all driven by great operations, fundamentally good control of their costs and then super margins. Our Marketing and Specialties businesses, which we typically would say is, a $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion business was $2 billion. And of course, we have been investing in adding retail our joint ventures. But I think it\u2019s really great execution on the operations side, particularly in the U.S., but also in our European operations, where we saw good volumes, good margins across that. And so I would say that we are probably on the upside of that. So given $6 billion to $7 billion of cash flow, our first dollar is always going to go to sustaining capital, that\u2019s $1 billion, dividend is $1.6 billion and then that leaves room for us. We can signal that the capital budget is going to be $2 billion or less, so we are $1.9 billion for this year. That\u2019s a deliberate signaling that for this year or next year, we are going to be very constrained on capital, that frees us up to pursue some debt repayment and get back to share repurchases, while doing a little bit of growth. And so I think we make that all balance as we think about that. Now Kevin or Jeff, if you want to add to that, please step in or more\u2026\nKevin Mitchell: No. I think you covered it all.\nGreg Garland: Okay. Good.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, Greg. And that\u2019s the logical follow-up for me, which is how you are thinking about share repurchases, again the focus has been to get the debt level lower. Looks like the ratings agencies are giving you the - all clear at least that things are moving in the right direction. So what are the gating factors for you to begin a share repurchase program and how do you think about sizing it?\nGreg Garland: Well, we have always said the gating factor is getting cash flows back to something approaching a mid-cycle and making a dent in the debt repayment. So I think coming into April, we are going to pay another $1.5 billion-ish of debt off in April as it comes due. So that\u2019s $3 billion of the $4 billion. We have made a big dent in that. So I think that kind of post-April, that\u2019s why I said that, I would be disappointed if by midyear, we are not back in a share repurchase mode at our company.\nNeil Mehta: Perfect. Thanks, Greg.\nGreg Garland: Sure.\nOperator: The next question will come from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nPhil Gresh: Yes. Hello. My first question, just on one of the guidance items here on the Refining maintenance, $800 million to $900 million, just looking back, it looks like it\u2019s the highest in the history of the company. And I was just curious, I mean, is there anything unique we should be thinking about there, I didn\u2019t think 2020 or 2021 were too far below the historical norms? And then I guess bigger picture, when I think about your maintenance and what others have said, it seems like the industry might be kind of capped in terms of what utilization can be this year. So is this an environment where we are just going to see margins get pressured higher to keep up with demand?\nGreg Garland: So let me just take a high level and then I will let Bob come in and talk about it since it\u2019s his business. But if you look 2012 through 2019, we kind of averaged about $5.25 billion in terms of total turnaround expense. And there\u2019s -- we did push some of 2020 and 2021 into 2022. I think probably a lot of the people did that in the industry as we were trying to conserve cash and protecting the balance sheet. So it\u2019s a big number, Phil, there\u2019s no question. But I will let Bob speak to the specifics and what we are doing there.\nBob Herman: Yeah. I think, Greg, hit on it pretty good. The last couple of years were going to be lower turnaround years anyway with this 2022 always going to be a bit of a larger turnaround. We have got two refineries, both Ferndale and Billings, and when they take their turnaround their entire facility turnaround, they are coming, you see -- you kind of got to go back five years to find them in the cycle. So that causes a little bit of lumpiness in it. And then, to your second question, I really -- we would agree that a lot of people managed their turnarounds and maintenance work out of 2020 and 2021. Some of that\u2019s running the lower utilizations. We made our catalyst in hydro traders and hydrocrackers that last longer, so were able to stretch those runs. We put a lot of work into making sure we could do it from a mechanical integrity standpoint. But now those things are coming due, right? You can\u2019t do that forever, and for us this year, it\u2019s a pretty heavy lift across the system. And I suspect we are not the only ones that are going to see that.\nPhil Gresh: Okay. Great. Thanks. Thanks for that color. Just one more on the Refining business, Needle Coke is a unique business to Phillips 66 versus the other refiners. I was curious it\u2019s a bit of an opaque market, but could you talk about what you are seeing in the fundamentals of that business, kind of how it finished out 2021 and how you see it progressing in 2022 and beyond? Thanks.\nBob Herman: Sure. So, as you may know, Needle Coke is used to make graphite electrodes, which internally is used production of steel, electric arc furnaces, which are actually a cleaner technology than blast furnaces and we use Needle Coke also to make anodes for lithium-ion batteries. The past two years, we have seen a weaker Needle Coke market with steel producers running off high inventories. But we do see some slow strengthening last this -- end of this year, last year and this year as well. If you listen to steel production, which is a leading indicator, they had a record year last year, even as Needle Coke markets lagged, because of the high inventories. The market seems to have mixed opinions about steel production this year. Some steel producers think it will continue to increase, some think it will come off. Either way, we have seen good demand from both steel producers and anode producers, and we expect that market to continue to gradually increase. We think with the refinery utilization coming back up and lower graphite electrodes that it will be a slightly strengthening market.\nPhil Gresh: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nRoger Read: Yeah. Thank you and good morning.\nGreg Garland: Good morning, Roger.\nMark Lashier: Hi, Roger.\nRoger Read: Good morning. I\u2019d like to start off kind of on your comments about the -- getting back to share repos. Maybe what are some of the markers you would want to see and kind of tagging on with Phil\u2019s question about maybe a little higher spending on the turnaround side? Is there a timing issue with those turnarounds where you would want to get past a certain level or is it bigger picture on the balance sheet for and overall cash flows when you will feel comfortable?\nGreg Garland: Yeah. Well, I think, we are kind of back to the question on Refining and when does Refining get to mid-cycle cracks? I mean, in 4Q, we are 11.60 realized cracks. So, I mean, that\u2019s the highest quarterly crack that we have seen in Refining since the fourth quarter of 2018. So there are some things that are in that number, obviously. But as we look coming into 2022, where constructive supply and demand, there\u2019s been a lot of supply that\u2019s come off the market, we think there\u2019s new supply coming on, but it\u2019s going to be staged. It\u2019s not all going to hit when people think it\u2019s going to hit because it always takes longer to come on. So from that standpoint, we are constructive on the demand side. What we see with each successive wave of COVID, the impacts to demand are less and less, and so I am not sure when that moment in time as we transition from pandemic to endemic, but that could happen next year. But regardless, we see the demand impacts less and less from each successive wave of COVID. Prior to the current variant, we were seeing gasoline demand kind of back at 2019 levels. There\u2019s disciplined demand above 2019 levels. Jet was recovering nicely. So as we move into 2022, we are constructive around the demand side. We talked about the turnaround activity and what impact that could have ultimately on utilizations and so we just see everything balancing out towards -- we get back towards more of a mid-cycle crack in Refining. And so, once we get Refining there, I think, we feel pretty comfortable that we are going to have sufficient cash flow, cover our sustaining capital, our dividend, pay down some debt, get back share repurchases and fund the growth program that we have this year, which is about $900 million in growth. Kevin, if you want to add anything to that.\nKevin Mitchell: No. I think that\u2019s very complete. Just in terms of the debt pay down detail, we have a $450 million term loan maturity in April. We have $1 billion notes maturing in April and we intend to take care of both of those at maturity, and then what happens after that, we just have flexibility. We still have other callable debt available if we need to. But we will -- with that taken care of and if cash flows back at mid-cycle levels, we would have a lot of flexibility.\nGreg Garland: I think we paid $3 billion of the $4 billion that we borrowed during 2020 down. I think that demonstrates our commitment to paying down debt and returning the balance sheet over a couple of year period to something that resembles kind of pre-COVID levels, let\u2019s say, $12 billion on a consolidated basis. So, I think, we are pretty comfortable in that construct, Roger.\nRoger Read: Okay. Appreciate it. Other question I had sort of the unrelated follow-up. As you look at setting everything up on the renewable diesel side, any progress or increased comfort level in terms of the feedstock side of that, I mean, that seems to be one of the biggest questions we get coming in is, what is our comfort level that each of the companies will be able to supply what you need to maintain a healthy margin in that business and the returns that you are targeting?\nBrian Mandell: Hey, Roger. It\u2019s Brian. We don\u2019t see any issue with the feedstock availability. Although, it may be challenging for those that maybe are less commercial, have less logistics experience. We think between increased acreage and yield, switching from biodiesel, better aggregation of used cooking oil, we will have plenty of feedstock to produce renewable diesel. Prices may vary over time and that\u2019s to be expected. At Rodeo, we are on the water so we have access to both domestic and foreign feedstock. And we also sit on the U.S.\u2019 greatest demand center in California. So feel good there. Our commercial organization has been working on feedstock for quite a while. We have offices around the world. We have storage in Asia and Europe and in U.S. We have good relationships with vegetable oil producers. You heard our announcement in our investment in Shell Rock Soy processing. We purchased for the startup of Rodeo. We purchased soybean oil, canola oil, distilled corn oil since last April. We have strong relationships with producers and aggregators of used cooking oil. In fact, with used cooking oil, we have been in that market for over four years supplying Humber used cooking oil from around the world, currently 12 different countries. So I think Rodeo Renewed will have a maximum optionality in its system and then we will use a linear program to decide what the best and most cost effective feedstock is based on not just CI, but price, credit generation to the sales market and logistics.\nRoger Read: It sounds like its open for an MLP there. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nRyan Todd: Hi. Thanks. Maybe one on European Refining, as a refiner with some exposure to European refining, can you talk about the impact of high nat gas prices that you are seeing on Refining economics over there and in a broader sense in that part of the world. Do you expect high nat gas prices to impact European utilization rates to the benefit of U.S. refiners this year?\nBob Herman: Yeah. This is Bob. I think that\u2019s absolutely right. We look at what goes on in our operations and we have got a very complex and strong refinery over there in the impact of high natural gas prices on us and then we translate that to some of the simpler refineries in Central Europe. It\u2019s got to be really tough for them to be making money right now and I am sure we are going to see that. We know that clean product yield out of a bunch of those refineries is down, because they are not buying hydrogen or buying natural gas to make hydrogen to hydrotreat, because we see the high sulfur stuff showing up in the market, which is somewhat good for us. It\u2019s putting pressure on the sour crudes, which will be good for us in the long-term. So I think high natural gas prices are going to continue for a while in Europe and it is really going to strain kind of that bottom quartile of refiners that are left.\nGreg Garland: As Bob pointed out, if the Europeans are running more sweet crude, it kind of widens that sour sweet dip, which is beneficial to us. The utilization comes off on those refineries because they can\u2019t afford to run. That\u2019s good for the U.S. as well, because we will be able to export products to Europe. So it would be good for our businesses as well.\nRyan Todd: Great. Thanks. And then maybe a follow-up on the last question before this, I mean, you now have a couple of quarters under your belt producing renewables you saw there in California at a pretty decent level. I mean, can you talk about what you have learned from your operations, both in product placement, as well as feedstock acquisition there, as you think about preparation for the -- for kind of the full project completion later on? And then as we have seen feedstock spreads narrow in the back half of year and headline, how about spreads has [ph] improved. Any comment on what you have seen in the profitability of your production there?\nGreg Garland: Well, the profitability between Q3 and Q4 has strengthened. There\u2019s a lot of things to think about when you are thinking about the renewable diesel margins, you have to think about feedstock, the renewable diesel price, the credits. You have to think about logistics. So there\u2019s a lot of pieces to it. We will have a linear program for renewables as well. The key to renewable production is finding as many feedstocks, as many suppliers as you can and having the logistics to get it to the plant, which is what we have been working on. We have set up a global organization to do that and we are working hard. In renewable diesel, the key for us is getting the renewable diesel to the end-user. That\u2019s the key to keep more of the margin that way. So in part, our purchase of our commercial fleet fueling business was enabled that to -- for us to get some of that product to end users. You will continue to see those type of things. We have taken all the stores in California that we have, and we have converted those renewable diesel as well. So we are going to have much renewable diesel as we can to the end-user and we are going to have as bigger feedstock slate as we can for the plant and we will optimize through our linear program.\nBob Herman: I might add to that that being able to operate 250 out there on renewable feedstocks instead of hydrocarbon-based feedstocks has really given us a good opportunity to -- for the operators and staff to learn, because it is very different and it runs different than there are different characteristics to handling it and getting it in the unit and dealing with it. So it\u2019s been a great warm-up for us for the Rodeo Renewed project that\u2019s yet to come and just, I think, raises our confidence level and our ability to be able to run really hard right out of the gate with that unit.\nGreg Garland: You want to talk about the pathways, the CI approval, et cetera?\nBob Herman: Yeah. So we started up the unit after the last turnaround on basically clean soybean oil. And since, and Brian mentioned it earlier, we have been able to establish pathways. So in California, you run new feedstocks, you get provisional CI number for them and then you have to go through, I\u2019d say, a pretty lengthy bureaucratic process to qualify your other feedstock. So since we have done that, we have been able to qualify not only the soybean oil, but the distillers corn oil, we are working on. We have gotten a pathway on canola oil. I think that\u2019s yet -- that process will keep repeating itself as we find more and more feedstocks ahead of Rodeo Renewed coming up in 2024 or early 2024, that really allow us to take advantage of the lower CI material right away.\nGreg Garland: I guess, just another key learning is how you get through that process and navigate that process in California.\nBob Herman: Like everything else, you get better at it the second time.\nGreg Garland: Right.\nRyan Todd: Perfect. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: The next question will come from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks, guys. I have got two questions that I hope can add some color for everybody. I guess my first one, Kevin, is on the balance sheet. I was looking back at your share price, it seems like a horrible memory now. But your share price pretty much got cut in half twice last and during the 2020 period, and obviously, you did not buy back stock when that happened, given the circumstances. So my question is why carry $10 billion of net debt rather than work the balance sheet down to a level where we know these corrections are going to happen occasionally in this business to allow you to take advantage of that? What\u2019s the philosophy behind the buybacks in the recovery versus building the balance sheet during the recovery and buying back during corrections?\nKevin Mitchell: Yeah. Doug, I think, it\u2019s really a -- it is a bit of a balancing, trying to meet multiple priorities. So we think about an optimum capital structure in terms of cost of capital, right? So too little debt is increasing cost of capital and so you have got that component to it. We have got other opportunities that we want to be able to fund. And bear in mind also that, as we are growing the business and we are seeing that in the non-Refining segments, as we are growing the business, we are actually, we are effectively strengthening our overall financial condition, because on a debt-to-EBITDA basis, we are continuing to improve from that standpoint. And obviously, we don\u2019t like the fact that we weren\u2019t buying shares at $40, but that was -- we were not in a position to do so and so we had to just accept that. And so it\u2019s really around finding that optimum capital structure that will give us sufficient flexibility through the cycle, albeit you have always got more flexibility. The lower the debt balance, obviously, that provides added flexibility. But at what cost is that? And so it\u2019s having the optimum structure to where we have got adequate flexibility. We can be -- stick with our sort of capital allocation framework, so 60% reinvestment in the business, 40% cash returns to shareholders between the dividend and buybacks over an extended time period, recognizing that year-over-year that will fluctuate. So it\u2019s really just trying to balance through all of that. I am not sure going too much further down on debt than our sort of stated objectives, is going to bias a whole lot in that context. So I still feel pretty good with how we are laying out our objectives.\nDoug Leggate: I appreciate the answer. I guess, it\u2019s more of a net debt question, because obviously, its 2020 hindsight is perfect, but it kind of gets back to this. I wonder if COVID has reset everybody\u2019s view of what volatility looks like. So, but I appreciate the answer. My follow-up is, something I really value from you guys periodically is your view on the net capacity outlook. And I guess, my question is, are we getting to a point now where the mid-cycle Refining outlook has been reset higher, much like it did in the mid-2000s? I don\u2019t want to say golden age, but something of that nature. And here\u2019s my point, gas prices are up, that\u2019s probably structural for international players, net additions disclosures like demand with IMO. I am just wondering, are you guys thinking along those lines? How do you see the net additions, price additions and subtractions in terms of impacting that mid-cycle view?\nBob Herman: Yeah. Doug, I think, we have seen a total of about 4.5 million barrels a day of Refining rationalization that\u2019s been announced and much of that has already occurred. When you look at last year, it was the first year in at least 30 years where there was more capacity rationalized out of the global fleet than there was capacity added and so we are seeing that benefit. As we look forward, there\u2019s still pressure with higher natural gas prices in Europe on that -- those unit\u2019s profitability. So we see that continuing to occur. We have also seen COVID delays, challenges getting labor into execute new capacity additions, so they are getting spread out. We have seen a reduction of capital spending and concerns over energy transition. So it\u2019s definitely impacting the supply side of the equation and we are seeing demand come back. As Greg mentioned, gasoline was above 2019 levels before this recent COVID hit, diesel comfortably above, jet\u2019s been coming back aggressively and so we think jet demand by late this year could be back at 2019 levels as well. So the demand\u2019s still in the system and the supply is more constrained than what we have seen historically.\nOperator: The next question is from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTheresa Chen: Hi, there. Thanks for taking my question. First, Kevin, I just wanted to follow-up on your comment about the adjustments from the lower RVO for 2021 out of the Refining results. So just to be clear, the $404 million of adjusted EBT, did that include the $230 million?\nKevin Mitchell: Yes. It does, Theresa. So the $404 million includes the $230 million. It applies to the full year. And so if you think about my additional comment was, if you think about that in terms of the quarter, as you could say, three quarters of that $230 million would apply to the first three quarters of the year and if you are doing any kind of normalization around that.\nTheresa Chen: Okay. So, that you presumably would not get that revaluation over and over again, so the clean number for the quarter would be $174 million?\nKevin Mitchell: If you -- yes. If you back out the full $230 million. Yeah.\nTheresa Chen: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, I also wanted to follow-up on one of Brian\u2019s comments about the fuel fleet that you bought in California as you seek to place barrels to the end user for all of your renewable diesel production. Is this something that you expect to grow in terms of your footprint and the vertical integration as incremental renewable diesel will hit the state over time to insulate your position there or is it something that you were thinking of doing all along? I would love to understand your strategy more here.\nBrian Mandell: Yeah. Theresa, that\u2019s exactly right. Our goal is to be able, at some point, to get the entire 50,000 barrels of diesel that we make to the end-user. That may not be possible but we will see. We may export some of that depending on markets, but this is just one step. As I said, we upgraded all the stores to renewable diesel. We are looking at a lot of different opportunities to also get diesel to the end-user. But the goal is to get it to the end-user that way. We keep all of the margin and we think that\u2019s the best path.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question is from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nManav Gupta: Hi guys. This is a question, which we get a lot of investors, so don\u2019t shoot the messenger. Your partner has gone ahead and made a statement that they don\u2019t really want to be in the business of JV Refining. You have a very profitable JV, which has worked very well for you over the years and that has resulted in a lot of speculation. If you keep one refinery they keep one, they sell you both, you sell them both. There are multiple scenarios there or just keep the status quo, if you could comment a little on that situation?\nGreg Garland: Take that Bob. Yeah, actually\u2026\nBob Herman: Yeah. And we are seeing. I -- all I can tell you is, we continue to work really well with our partner on our joint venture, WRB for Wood River and Border. As you pointed out, it\u2019s been a very good partnership since 2007, stood the test of time. They seem to like us as an operator. They have been a great partner to work with and give us good insights on things and their world has changed. But for now, we continue to work together to run WRB and invest in those two facilities as needed both of them.\nManav Gupta: Perfect. And my follow-up quick question is when you look at the segments here, the Gulf Coast operating cost was a little higher and so was the DD&A. I am assuming these are just like one-times and as the refinery closes, your op costs will actually trend down sequentially, not up and so for the DD&A. If you could just comment on that one-times, I mean, they look like one-times from the alliance on the Gulf Coast results?\nGreg Garland: Yeah. You are exactly right. There\u2019s a lot of noise in 4Q and it is -- there are -- we still have all the people in the fourth quarter, because we worked through redeploying some and all that. So we had costs in the fourth quarter, and obviously, no volume to go in the first quarter. So we will see those costs trend off very quickly in the first quarter. On a dollar per basis -- barrel basis in the Gulf Coast, all our refineries are on base costs, ex-turnarounds are about the same cost per barrel. So you won\u2019t see a big change in that metric. But the absolute cost, controllable costs in the Gulf Coast will go down.\nKevin Mitchell: Hi, Manav. It\u2019s Kevin. Just on the D&A, we did as you suspected, associated with the alliance conversion, we impaired some assets that flows through the D&A line. So that is one-time in nature.\nManav Gupta: Thank you so much for taking my questions and a great quarter.\nOperator: The next question will come from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nPaul Cheng: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nGreg Garland: Good morning Paul.\nKevin Mitchell: Good morning.\nPaul Cheng: Two questions for you. I think the first one is for Kevin. I think in your prepared remarks you talked about the inventory benefit in NGL and also the refining that help the quarter. Can you quantify how to get those number? And also I believe that the deferred tax -- deferred revenue you recognize in the transportation, if you can quantify that also? Maybe that -- after that then I asked the second question.\nKevin Mitchell: Yeah. Paul, on the deferred revenue, it\u2019s basically the variance quarter-over-quarter equates to the deferred revenue essentially. So that is the way to think about it. But I would say, with deferred revenue, that is no, I don\u2019t think of that as a sort of one-time item, because the nature of those contracts on the pipelines, we are either going to get the volumes and the revenues recognized as you get the volumes or if there\u2019s a shortfall in volumes, we still collect the cash and then we have makeup rights, or ultimately, recognize the deferred revenue. So that\u2019s a phenomena that you see going period-to-period. So it\u2019s not a -- I don\u2019t think it as a true inventory impacts both in the midst -- we have inventory impacts every period. And that\u2019s not something we typically quantify unless it was excessively large in terms of the impact. So we typically don\u2019t quantify those.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. That\u2019s fine. And that at least that in Refining, which region is the inventory impact?\nKevin Mitchell: No. It\u2019s going to show up across all areas.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. The second question, Greg, just I think before the pandemic, I think, in the past that you are sort of looking at long-term CapEx in the range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion kind of range, that talking about $1 billion to $2 billion of the -- maybe the growth CapEx. Now since then, of course, the outlook for the investment opportunity in the Midstream has changed, so you are probably not going to spend that much money. So once that your debt is back to a comfortable level and you start to be more in the growth phase, what is the capital allocation we should look at on the longer term basis? And also, maybe on a side question on PCP, is there any way to restructure that structure, I mean, you say $35 million, $40 million a quarter business. It seems like, yes, not causing you a problem, but it\u2019s also not adding a lot of value. I mean, does it really fit into a long-term portfolio for you?\nGreg Garland: Okay. Paul, I think, you are up to five questions now, but I will try my best to -- at least I will answer one by one, how about that? So, first of all, we -- I mean, historically, we have used $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion is growth CapEx. So I think that for many reasons, the need to be structured around debt repayment and get back to share repurchases. We purposely signaled total CapEx budgets of $2 billion or less for this year and kind of next year. We will see what happens going forward. But I do think we want to get the balance sheet back to something over the next two years approaching pre-COVID, so call it, $12 billion. We are going to get back to share repurchases. I mean, we have been on share repurchases and it\u2019s time to step back into those. And so, I think, for all the right reasons, we want to keep capital constrained across the portfolio over the next couple of years. And to your [Audio Gap] we just don\u2019t think those investable opportunities that will hit our return hurdles are going to be there in the next two years in the Midstream business. And we will see where renewables goes and where renewables takes us. But right now, the biggest project in front of us is Rodeo Renewed circa $850 million project. So, I mean, that in itself is almost a megaproject by any standard. So I think there\u2019s still big things going on around the portfolio in terms of growth and then you add on CPChem and the two megaprojects they are looking at. So there are certainly lots of growth still around the portfolio, allows us to be very structured about how we think about capital allocation. But to your point, the whole idea is to free up more cash for debt repayment and getting back into share repurchases. Kevin, if you want to take DCP, I will let you take it.\nKevin Mitchell: Thanks. So, Paul, I mean, you are right that with DCP, we are looking at, you take out all the hedging noise, you are probably a $50 million, $60 million per quarter of earnings generation and a pretty consistent distribution that comes along with that. While you could say, we are structurally challenged. It\u2019s been a JV we have had in place for over 20 years. It\u2019s been a very successful JV. The ownership has changed with -- as the owners -- with the M&A type activity over that time period. But nonetheless, it has continued to be successful for us. It does give us some nice integration through our own Midstream business. So DCP volumes, we jointly own the Santel SunHills pipelines with DCP and NGL volumes through that system come into Sweeny and into our fracs and so we have the benefit of that integration. So while a different structure might be a more efficient way of looking at that business, it\u2019s not something that we have to get done. There\u2019s nothing compelling that tells us we must have a different solution. And the reality is when you get into these kind of arrangements that have been placed for a long period of time, it can be pretty hard to exit for any party when you look at the tax considerations and all of that. So it\u2019s a little bit like the Synovus question earlier. We actually feel that the JV has been very successful. It does what we want it to do and we will take it from there. We are always open to alternatives as we are with most of our portfolio, but it\u2019s continued to work well for us.\nOperator: The next question is from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead. \nMatthew Blair: Hey. Good morning. Could you shed some more light on this British Airways SAS deal? How should we think about the economic impact to PSX here? Is it like a take-or-pay arrangement or maybe something else? And then, also, why do you think we are seeing these offtake deals in SAS, but not really in RD?\nMark Lashier: So I will take the shot at the first one. So the Humber Refinery entered into this deal to supply sustainable aviation fuel to British Airways. It\u2019s a small volume. We don\u2019t run a lot of renewable feedstock at Humber yet. We are working on a lot of things in Humber to reduce the carbon intensity of the fuels that come from that plant. So we entered into this with British Airways really to get the partnership going and to understand their needs and they can understand what we can do and we can grow this business over time and be a good supplier. We are supplier to British Airways anyway. So this just kind of extends our reach there. So it\u2019s not large and material yet, but it really signals that in Europe with British Airways that we are going to expand that business as we expand our ability to run used cooking oils and other renewable feedstocks in Humber.\nBob Herman: Yeah. I think that maybe, and Mark, if you want to add on to this, but if you think about Humber, and even once we get Rodeo Renewed. There is a certain part of the yield that\u2019s going to be sustainable aviation fuel and I think the challenge for us is how do we think about that yield, how we push that yield structure to make more sustainable aviation fuel in the future.\nMark Lashier: Yeah. I think the big difference is, there\u2019s not the regulatory incentives there for SAS yet. We think they will come, but we also see airlines making commitments and so there\u2019s a demand pull for SAS out there that we will work to supply. But to shift that optimization wholesale away from renewable diesel into SAS there has to be a financial incentive, but it is sort of a co-product at this point that we can make commitments on.\nBob Herman: And the only difference is in overseas in our Hamburg plant, the reason we were able to make that deal is because that scheme, the European scheme is different from the U.S. scheme, which treats renewable diesel, renewable gasoline and renewable jet fuel the same. So that was why that deal was done there and that\u2019s why deals haven\u2019t been done in the United States yet. But we expect that as part of the Build Back Better plan, that we will get some incentive and over time, we will either get more incentive or airlines we will make commitments to pay more for the SAF.\nMark Lashier: Yeah. And I think it\u2019s just the nature of how the market is going to work. When you think about the airline business, I mean, their only option today to decarbonize the sustainable aviation fuel. We don\u2019t think hydrogen is going to work in planes. Batteries aren\u2019t going to work in long-haul planes. And so, I think, they are anxious to work with the industry in developing sustainable aviation fuels and I think what you are going to see is going to be contractual relationships developed so that they have access to the molecules that are going to be there.\nMatthew Blair: Thanks for all the color. I will leave it there.\nOperator: The next question is from Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJason Gabelman: Yeah. Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about the build diversify and M&A outlook on the Marketing and Chemicals business segments. Midstream, given that you are going to be consolidating PSXP, do you expect to be selling some of those non-core assets or are you in a stronger position to acquire Midstream assets now that you have this larger portfolio? And the Chemicals build versus buy question, in light of the fact that you are still evaluating two world-scale crackers. And then my second question is just, I think you mentioned Rodeo CapEx is going to be $850 million, if I heard you correctly, which is a bit higher than what you previously guided to. I think you had previously said something like $750 million. I just want to confirm that\u2019s correct. Thanks.\nGreg Garland: Okay. Do you want to start?\nBob Herman: Sure. I think on the build versus buy in Chemicals, I think, that we at CPChem level, they have always scanned the horizon, looking for opportunities to acquire assets, but it\u2019s an environment that\u2019s tough to acquire. Things are really highly valued and they have got a long history of organic growth through true partnerships and been very successful in doing that. And that\u2019s what\u2019s driving both the U.S. Gulf Coast II project and the ROPP project. And we are looking forward to an FID on U.S. Gulf Coast II mid-summer, late summer timeframe this year. We are taking a tough look at the economics to make sure that it meets the economic hurdles that we have in place, but we are optimistic that it well -- will, but we are working with EPC contractors now to develop that whole package to bring forward. And then the ROPP project is about a year later. It\u2019s already cleared front-end engineering design and so it\u2019s well on its way to an FID sometime next year. So we continue to see opportunities organic that are more attractive than any acquisition opportunities in the Chemical space.\nGreg Garland: Yeah. I might just comment on the Marketing and Specialties. That business is consolidating, particularly the retail marketing in the U.S. And we are seeing many of our long time business partners. They may be second generation or third generation businesses and for family estate planning. They want to exit or maybe the current generation doesn\u2019t want to take over. And so it\u2019s creating those opportunities. So we ensure that we continue to have access to those markets long-term and so that\u2019s what\u2019s driving a lot of what we are thinking. I think Brian did a really nice job of talking about renewable diesel and making sure we are capturing all the value we can. I think one of the things we have been frustrated with RINs is, we have never been able to explain what we think is some value leakage in the RINs and so we want to make sure that we are going to capture that full value chain around the new diesel side of that. So, I think that maybe is an important point as you think about what we are trying to do in the Marketing and Specialties space around that. We always look at buy versus build. I think that certainly is an opportunity to think about that, particularly in businesses that are going to consolidate, for instance, like Midstream. I still think Midstream will have some consolidation. And to your point, as we roll out PSXP, we have a full suite of assets kind of within our control, then I think we have the chance to really think about how we optimize our Midstream and particularly, our NGL-oriented portfolio around that. Tim, if you want to add anything on that on Midstream, please?\nTim Roberts: Greg, I mean, you covered at the high level. We are all about creating value. So we are always going to look at that portfolio and how we maximize that value. That can include buying, building or divesting. But that\u2019s just part of stewarding the capital that we have got in the business that we are running.\nOperator: We have reached the end of today\u2019s conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.\nJeff Dietert: Thank you, Sia. And we thank all of you for your interest in Phillips 66. If you have further questions on today\u2019s call, please call Shannon or me. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

            "content": "Hey, Roger. It's Brian. We don't see any issue with the feedstock availability. Although, it may be challenging for those that maybe are less commercial, have less logistics experience. We think between increased acreage and yield, switching from biodiesel, better aggregation of used cooking oil, we will have plenty of feedstock to produce renewable diesel. Prices may vary over time and that's to be expected. At Rodeo, we are on the water so we have access to both domestic and foreign feedstock. And we also sit on the U.S.' greatest demand center in California. So feel good there. Our commercial organization has been working on feedstock for quite a while. We have offices around the world. We have storage in Asia and Europe and in U.S. We have good relationships with vegetable oil producers. You heard our announcement in our investment in Shell Rock Soy processing. We purchased for the startup of Rodeo. We purchased soybean oil, canola oil, distilled corn oil since last April. We have strong relationships with producers and aggregators of used cooking oil. In fact, with used cooking oil, we have been in that market for over four years supplying Humber used cooking oil from around the world, currently 12 different countries. So I think Rodeo Renewed will have a maximum optionality in its system and then we will use a linear program to decide what the best and most cost effective feedstock is based on not just CI, but price, credit generation to the sales market and logistics. Yeah. Theresa, that's exactly right. Our goal is to be able, at some point, to get the entire 50,000 barrels of diesel that we make to the end-user. That may not be possible but we will see. We may export some of that depending on markets, but this is just one step. As I said, we upgraded all the stores to renewable diesel. We are looking at a lot of different opportunities to also get diesel to the end-user. But the goal is to get it to the end-user that way. We keep all of the margin and we think that's the best path."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Bob Herman",
            "content": "Yeah. I think, Greg, hit on it pretty good. The last couple of years were going to be lower turnaround years anyway with this 2022 always going to be a bit of a larger turnaround. We have got two refineries, both Ferndale and Billings, and when they take their turnaround their entire facility turnaround, they are coming, you see -- you kind of got to go back five years to find them in the cycle. So that causes a little bit of lumpiness in it. And then, to your second question, I really -- we would agree that a lot of people managed their turnarounds and maintenance work out of 2020 and 2021. Some of that's running the lower utilizations. We made our catalyst in hydro traders and hydrocrackers that last longer, so were able to stretch those runs. We put a lot of work into making sure we could do it from a mechanical integrity standpoint. But now those things are coming due, right? You can't do that forever, and for us this year, it's a pretty heavy lift across the system. And I suspect we are not the only ones that are going to see that. Sure. So, as you may know, Needle Coke is used to make graphite electrodes, which internally is used production of steel, electric arc furnaces, which are actually a cleaner technology than blast furnaces and we use Needle Coke also to make anodes for lithium-ion batteries. The past two years, we have seen a weaker Needle Coke market with steel producers running off high inventories. But we do see some slow strengthening last this -- end of this year, last year and this year as well. If you listen to steel production, which is a leading indicator, they had a record year last year, even as Needle Coke markets lagged, because of the high inventories. The market seems to have mixed opinions about steel production this year. Some steel producers think it will continue to increase, some think it will come off. Either way, we have seen good demand from both steel producers and anode producers, and we expect that market to continue to gradually increase. We think with the refinery utilization coming back up and lower graphite electrodes that it will be a slightly strengthening market. Yeah. This is Bob. I think that's absolutely right. We look at what goes on in our operations and we have got a very complex and strong refinery over there in the impact of high natural gas prices on us and then we translate that to some of the simpler refineries in Central Europe. It's got to be really tough for them to be making money right now and I am sure we are going to see that. We know that clean product yield out of a bunch of those refineries is down, because they are not buying hydrogen or buying natural gas to make hydrogen to hydrotreat, because we see the high sulfur stuff showing up in the market, which is somewhat good for us. It's putting pressure on the sour crudes, which will be good for us in the long-term. So I think high natural gas prices are going to continue for a while in Europe and it is really going to strain kind of that bottom quartile of refiners that are left. I might add to that that being able to operate 250 out there on renewable feedstocks instead of hydrocarbon-based feedstocks has really given us a good opportunity to -- for the operators and staff to learn, because it is very different and it runs different than there are different characteristics to handling it and getting it in the unit and dealing with it. So it's been a great warm-up for us for the Rodeo Renewed project that's yet to come and just, I think, raises our confidence level and our ability to be able to run really hard right out of the gate with that unit. Yeah. So we started up the unit after the last turnaround on basically clean soybean oil. And since, and Brian mentioned it earlier, we have been able to establish pathways. So in California, you run new feedstocks, you get provisional CI number for them and then you have to go through, I'd say, a pretty lengthy bureaucratic process to qualify your other feedstock. So since we have done that, we have been able to qualify not only the soybean oil, but the distillers corn oil, we are working on. We have gotten a pathway on canola oil. I think that's yet -- that process will keep repeating itself as we find more and more feedstocks ahead of Rodeo Renewed coming up in 2024 or early 2024, that really allow us to take advantage of the lower CI material right away. Like everything else, you get better at it the second time. Yeah. Doug, I think, we have seen a total of about 4.5 million barrels a day of Refining rationalization that's been announced and much of that has already occurred. When you look at last year, it was the first year in at least 30 years where there was more capacity rationalized out of the global fleet than there was capacity added and so we are seeing that benefit. As we look forward, there's still pressure with higher natural gas prices in Europe on that -- those unit's profitability. So we see that continuing to occur. We have also seen COVID delays, challenges getting labor into execute new capacity additions, so they are getting spread out. We have seen a reduction of capital spending and concerns over energy transition. So it's definitely impacting the supply side of the equation and we are seeing demand come back. As Greg mentioned, gasoline was above 2019 levels before this recent COVID hit, diesel comfortably above, jet's been coming back aggressively and so we think jet demand by late this year could be back at 2019 levels as well. So the demand's still in the system and the supply is more constrained than what we have seen historically. Yeah. And we are seeing. I -- all I can tell you is, we continue to work really well with our partner on our joint venture, WRB for Wood River and Border. As you pointed out, it's been a very good partnership since 2007, stood the test of time. They seem to like us as an operator. They have been a great partner to work with and give us good insights on things and their world has changed. But for now, we continue to work together to run WRB and invest in those two facilities as needed both of them. Yeah. I think that maybe, and Mark, if you want to add on to this, but if you think about Humber, and even once we get Rodeo Renewed. There is a certain part of the yield that's going to be sustainable aviation fuel and I think the challenge for us is how do we think about that yield, how we push that yield structure to make more sustainable aviation fuel in the future. And the only difference is in overseas in our Hamburg plant, the reason we were able to make that deal is because that scheme, the European scheme is different from the U.S. scheme, which treats renewable diesel, renewable gasoline and renewable jet fuel the same. So that was why that deal was done there and that's why deals haven't been done in the United States yet. But we expect that as part of the Build Back Better plan, that we will get some incentive and over time, we will either get more incentive or airlines we will make commitments to pay more for the SAF. Sure. I think on the build versus buy in Chemicals, I think, that we at CPChem level, they have always scanned the horizon, looking for opportunities to acquire assets, but it's an environment that's tough to acquire. Things are really highly valued and they have got a long history of organic growth through true partnerships and been very successful in doing that. And that's what's driving both the U.S. Gulf Coast II project and the ROPP project. And we are looking forward to an FID on U.S. Gulf Coast II mid-summer, late summer timeframe this year. We are taking a tough look at the economics to make sure that it meets the economic hurdles that we have in place, but we are optimistic that it well -- will, but we are working with EPC contractors now to develop that whole package to bring forward. And then the ROPP project is about a year later. It's already cleared front-end engineering design and so it's well on its way to an FID sometime next year. So we continue to see opportunities organic that are more attractive than any acquisition opportunities in the Chemical space."

            "name": "Greg Garland",
            "content": "Okay, Jeff. Thank you. Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today. In the fourth quarter, we had adjusted earnings of $1.3 billion or $2.94 per share. For the year, adjusted earnings were $2.5 billion or $5.70 per share. We delivered record results in Midstream, Chemicals, and Marketing and Specialties, demonstrating the strength of our diversified portfolio. For the third quarter in a row, we saw improved Refining performance. Looking ahead, we are optimistic about the outlook for our business. In 2021, our employees exemplified the company's values of safety, honor and commitment. Our 2021 combined workforce total recordable rate of 0.12 was more than 25 times better than U.S. manufacturing average. Last year, our strong cash flow generation allowed us to invest $1.9 billion back into the business, returned $1.6 billion to shareholders and paid down $1.5 billion of debt. The 2022 capital program of $1.9 billion reflects our commitment to capital discipline. Approximately 45% of our growth capital this year will support lower carbon opportunities, including Rodeo Renewed. As cash flow improves further, we will prioritize shareholder returns and debt repayment. In October, we increased the quarterly dividend to $0.92 per share. We remain committed to a secure, competitive and growing dividend. We would like to resume share repurchases this year and on our path towards getting back to pre-COVID debt levels over the next couple of years. We are taking steps to position Phillips 66 for the long-term competitiveness. Across our businesses we are assessing opportunities for permanent cost reactions. Mark and Kevin are leading this initiative, and we will provide additional details on the first quarter call in April. We are committed to a lower carbon future, while continuing to deliver our vision of providing energy and improving lives around the globe. We announced targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity last year. By 2030, we plan to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 30%, and Scope 3 emissions by 15% compared to 2019 levels. So, with that, I will turn the call over to Mark to provide some more details. I will be happy to do that. I mean, I don't think we really changed from our view of $6 billion to $7 billion. Of course, it's nice to see $6 billion of cash last year. It just happened to occur in different buckets that you might expect from a traditional cycle. So I think we have been signaling in the last couple of months. We are pretty constructive on the Refining business coming into 2022. And if you think about the rest of the businesses, they have actually performed at or better than mid-cycle all through the pandemic in 2020 and into 2021. We remain pretty constructive on those businesses coming into 2022 at all. So really, for us, a wildcard has really been Refining and when has Refining recovered back to something approaching a mid-cycle. But just to remember how it all builds up on an EBITDA basis kind of $4-ish billion in Refining, kind of $2 billion in Midstream, $2 billion in Chemicals and $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion in Marketing and Specialties, it pushes you to something like $9-ish billion of EBITDA, which translates to $6 billion to $7 billion of cash. And so I think we are pretty comfortable that we are kind of still in that range. Obviously, we have had some outperformance. I mean, last year, all driven by great operations, fundamentally good control of their costs and then super margins. Our Marketing and Specialties businesses, which we typically would say is, a $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion business was $2 billion. And of course, we have been investing in adding retail our joint ventures. But I think it's really great execution on the operations side, particularly in the U.S., but also in our European operations, where we saw good volumes, good margins across that. And so I would say that we are probably on the upside of that. So given $6 billion to $7 billion of cash flow, our first dollar is always going to go to sustaining capital, that's $1 billion, dividend is $1.6 billion and then that leaves room for us. We can signal that the capital budget is going to be $2 billion or less, so we are $1.9 billion for this year. That's a deliberate signaling that for this year or next year, we are going to be very constrained on capital, that frees us up to pursue some debt repayment and get back to share repurchases, while doing a little bit of growth. And so I think we make that all balance as we think about that. Now Kevin or Jeff, if you want to add to that, please step in or more... Okay. Good. Well, we have always said the gating factor is getting cash flows back to something approaching a mid-cycle and making a dent in the debt repayment. So I think coming into April, we are going to pay another $1.5 billion-ish of debt off in April as it comes due. So that's $3 billion of the $4 billion. We have made a big dent in that. So I think that kind of post-April, that's why I said that, I would be disappointed if by midyear, we are not back in a share repurchase mode at our company. Sure. So let me just take a high level and then I will let Bob come in and talk about it since it's his business. But if you look 2012 through 2019, we kind of averaged about $5.25 billion in terms of total turnaround expense. And there's -- we did push some of 2020 and 2021 into 2022. I think probably a lot of the people did that in the industry as we were trying to conserve cash and protecting the balance sheet. So it's a big number, Phil, there's no question. But I will let Bob speak to the specifics and what we are doing there. Good morning, Roger. Yeah. Well, I think, we are kind of back to the question on Refining and when does Refining get to mid-cycle cracks? I mean, in 4Q, we are 11.60 realized cracks. So, I mean, that's the highest quarterly crack that we have seen in Refining since the fourth quarter of 2018. So there are some things that are in that number, obviously. But as we look coming into 2022, where constructive supply and demand, there's been a lot of supply that's come off the market, we think there's new supply coming on, but it's going to be staged. It's not all going to hit when people think it's going to hit because it always takes longer to come on. So from that standpoint, we are constructive on the demand side. What we see with each successive wave of COVID, the impacts to demand are less and less, and so I am not sure when that moment in time as we transition from pandemic to endemic, but that could happen next year. But regardless, we see the demand impacts less and less from each successive wave of COVID. Prior to the current variant, we were seeing gasoline demand kind of back at 2019 levels. There's disciplined demand above 2019 levels. Jet was recovering nicely. So as we move into 2022, we are constructive around the demand side. We talked about the turnaround activity and what impact that could have ultimately on utilizations and so we just see everything balancing out towards -- we get back towards more of a mid-cycle crack in Refining. And so, once we get Refining there, I think, we feel pretty comfortable that we are going to have sufficient cash flow, cover our sustaining capital, our dividend, pay down some debt, get back share repurchases and fund the growth program that we have this year, which is about $900 million in growth. Kevin, if you want to add anything to that. I think we paid $3 billion of the $4 billion that we borrowed during 2020 down. I think that demonstrates our commitment to paying down debt and returning the balance sheet over a couple of year period to something that resembles kind of pre-COVID levels, let's say, $12 billion on a consolidated basis. So, I think, we are pretty comfortable in that construct, Roger. As Bob pointed out, if the Europeans are running more sweet crude, it kind of widens that sour sweet dip, which is beneficial to us. The utilization comes off on those refineries because they can't afford to run. That's good for the U.S. as well, because we will be able to export products to Europe. So it would be good for our businesses as well. Well, the profitability between Q3 and Q4 has strengthened. There's a lot of things to think about when you are thinking about the renewable diesel margins, you have to think about feedstock, the renewable diesel price, the credits. You have to think about logistics. So there's a lot of pieces to it. We will have a linear program for renewables as well. The key to renewable production is finding as many feedstocks, as many suppliers as you can and having the logistics to get it to the plant, which is what we have been working on. We have set up a global organization to do that and we are working hard. In renewable diesel, the key for us is getting the renewable diesel to the end-user. That's the key to keep more of the margin that way. So in part, our purchase of our commercial fleet fueling business was enabled that to -- for us to get some of that product to end users. You will continue to see those type of things. We have taken all the stores in California that we have, and we have converted those renewable diesel as well. So we are going to have much renewable diesel as we can to the end-user and we are going to have as bigger feedstock slate as we can for the plant and we will optimize through our linear program. You want to talk about the pathways, the CI approval, et cetera? I guess, just another key learning is how you get through that process and navigate that process in California. Right. Take that Bob. Yeah, actually... Yeah. You are exactly right. There's a lot of noise in 4Q and it is -- there are -- we still have all the people in the fourth quarter, because we worked through redeploying some and all that. So we had costs in the fourth quarter, and obviously, no volume to go in the first quarter. So we will see those costs trend off very quickly in the first quarter. On a dollar per basis -- barrel basis in the Gulf Coast, all our refineries are on base costs, ex-turnarounds are about the same cost per barrel. So you won't see a big change in that metric. But the absolute cost, controllable costs in the Gulf Coast will go down. Good morning Paul. Okay. Paul, I think, you are up to five questions now, but I will try my best to -- at least I will answer one by one, how about that? So, first of all, we -- I mean, historically, we have used $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion is growth CapEx. So I think that for many reasons, the need to be structured around debt repayment and get back to share repurchases. We purposely signaled total CapEx budgets of $2 billion or less for this year and kind of next year. We will see what happens going forward. But I do think we want to get the balance sheet back to something over the next two years approaching pre-COVID, so call it, $12 billion. We are going to get back to share repurchases. I mean, we have been on share repurchases and it's time to step back into those. And so, I think, for all the right reasons, we want to keep capital constrained across the portfolio over the next couple of years. And to your [Audio Gap] we just don't think those investable opportunities that will hit our return hurdles are going to be there in the next two years in the Midstream business. And we will see where renewables goes and where renewables takes us. But right now, the biggest project in front of us is Rodeo Renewed circa $850 million project. So, I mean, that in itself is almost a megaproject by any standard. So I think there's still big things going on around the portfolio in terms of growth and then you add on CPChem and the two megaprojects they are looking at. So there are certainly lots of growth still around the portfolio, allows us to be very structured about how we think about capital allocation. But to your point, the whole idea is to free up more cash for debt repayment and getting back into share repurchases. Kevin, if you want to take DCP, I will let you take it. Okay. Do you want to start? Yeah. I might just comment on the Marketing and Specialties. That business is consolidating, particularly the retail marketing in the U.S. And we are seeing many of our long time business partners. They may be second generation or third generation businesses and for family estate planning. They want to exit or maybe the current generation doesn't want to take over. And so it's creating those opportunities. So we ensure that we continue to have access to those markets long-term and so that's what's driving a lot of what we are thinking. I think Brian did a really nice job of talking about renewable diesel and making sure we are capturing all the value we can. I think one of the things we have been frustrated with RINs is, we have never been able to explain what we think is some value leakage in the RINs and so we want to make sure that we are going to capture that full value chain around the new diesel side of that. So, I think that maybe is an important point as you think about what we are trying to do in the Marketing and Specialties space around that. We always look at buy versus build. I think that certainly is an opportunity to think about that, particularly in businesses that are going to consolidate, for instance, like Midstream. I still think Midstream will have some consolidation. And to your point, as we roll out PSXP, we have a full suite of assets kind of within our control, then I think we have the chance to really think about how we optimize our Midstream and particularly, our NGL-oriented portfolio around that. Tim, if you want to add anything on that on Midstream, please?"

            "content": "Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we had strong earnings from Midstream, Chemicals and Marketing and Specialties, and we saw continued recovery in Refining profitability. We made progress advancing our growth projects, as well as taking strategic actions to position Phillips 66 for the future. In Midstream, we began commercial operations of Phillips 66 Partners, C2G Pipeline at the Sweeny Hub construction of Frac 4 is 50% complete and we expect to begin operations in the fourth quarter of this year. CPChem is investing in a portfolio of high-return projects growing its asset base, as well as optimizing its existing operations. This includes growing its normal alpha olefins business with a second world-scale unit to produce 1-hexene, a critical component in high-performance polyethylene. CPChem is also expanding its propylene splitting capacity by 1 billion pounds per year with a new unit located at its Cedar Bayou facility, both projects are expected to start up in 2023. CPChem continues to develop two world-scale petrochemical facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Ras Laffan, Qatar. In addition, CPChem completed its first commercial sales of Marlex Anew Circular Polyethylene, which uses advanced recycling technology to convert difficult to recycle plastic waste into high quality raw materials. CPChem successfully processed pyrolysis oil in a certified commercial-scale trial and is targeting annual production of 1 billion pounds of circular polyethylene by 2030. During the year, we began renewable diesel production at the San Francisco Refinery and continued to progress Rodeo Renewed, which is expected to be completed in early 2024 subject to permitting and approvals. Upon completion, Rodeo will initially have over 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuel production capacity. The conversion will reduce emissions from the facility and produce lower carbon transportation fuels. In Marketing, we acquired a commercial fleet fueling business in California providing further placement opportunities for Rodeo renewable diesel production to end-use customers. Additionally, our retail marketing joint venture in the Central region acquired 85 sites in December, bringing the total to approximately 200 sites acquired in 2021. These sites support long-term product placement and extend our participation in the retail value chain. Our Emerging Energy Group is advancing opportunities in renewable fuels, batteries, carbon capture and hydrogen. We recently signed a technical development agreement with NOVONIX to accelerate the development of next-generation materials for the U.S. battery supply chain. We own a 16% stake in the company, extending our presence in the battery value chain. In December, we entered into a multiyear agreement with British Airways to supply sustainable aviation fuel produced by our Humber Refining -- Refinery beginning this year. For 2022, we will execute our strategy with a focus on operating excellence and cost management. We will do our part to advance the lower carbon future, while maintaining discipline capital allocation and an emphasis on returns. Now, I will turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results. Hi, Roger. So I will take the shot at the first one. So the Humber Refinery entered into this deal to supply sustainable aviation fuel to British Airways. It's a small volume. We don't run a lot of renewable feedstock at Humber yet. We are working on a lot of things in Humber to reduce the carbon intensity of the fuels that come from that plant. So we entered into this with British Airways really to get the partnership going and to understand their needs and they can understand what we can do and we can grow this business over time and be a good supplier. We are supplier to British Airways anyway. So this just kind of extends our reach there. So it's not large and material yet, but it really signals that in Europe with British Airways that we are going to expand that business as we expand our ability to run used cooking oils and other renewable feedstocks in Humber. Yeah. I think the big difference is, there's not the regulatory incentives there for SAS yet. We think they will come, but we also see airlines making commitments and so there's a demand pull for SAS out there that we will work to supply. But to shift that optimization wholesale away from renewable diesel into SAS there has to be a financial incentive, but it is sort of a co-product at this point that we can make commitments on. Yeah. And I think it's just the nature of how the market is going to work. When you think about the airline business, I mean, their only option today to decarbonize the sustainable aviation fuel. We don't think hydrogen is going to work in planes. Batteries aren't going to work in long-haul planes. And so, I think, they are anxious to work with the industry in developing sustainable aviation fuels and I think what you are going to see is going to be contractual relationships developed so that they have access to the molecules that are going to be there."

            "name": "Kevin Mitchell",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark, and hello, everyone. Starting with an overview on Slide 4, we summarize our financial results for the year. Adjusted earnings were $2.5 billion or $5.70 per share. We generated $6 billion of operating cash flow or $3.9 billion, excluding working capital. These results reflect our highest annual earnings for the Midstream, Chemicals, and Marketing and Specialties segments. Cash distributions from equity affiliates totaled $3 billion, including a record $1.6 billion from CPChem. We ended 2021 with a net debt to capital ratio of 34%. Our adjusted after-tax return on capital employed for the year was 9%. Slide 5 shows the change in cash during the year. We started the year with $2.5 billion in cash. Cash from operations was $6 billion. This included a working capital benefit of $2.1 billion, mainly due to the receipt of tax refunds, as well as the impact of rising prices on our net payable position. During the year, we paid down $1.5 billion of debt. In November, both S&P and Moody's revised their outlooks from negative to stable. We are committed to further deleveraging as we continue to prioritize our strong investment-grade credit ratings. We funded $1.9 billion of capital spending and returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through dividends. Our ending cash balance increased to $3.1 billion. Slide 6 summarizes our fourth quarter results. Adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion or $2.94 per share. We generated operating cash flow of $1.8 billion, including a working capital benefit of $412 million and cash distributions from equity affiliates of $757 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $597 million, $265 million was for growth projects, which included approximately $100 million for retail investments in the Marketing business. We paid $403 million in dividends. Moving to Slide 7, this slide highlights the change in adjusted results from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, a decrease of $105 million. Our adjusted effective income tax rate was 20% for the fourth quarter. Slide 8 shows our Midstream results. Fourth quarter adjusted pretax income was $668 million, an increase of $26 million from the previous quarter. Transportation contributed adjusted pretax income of $273 million, up $19 million from the prior quarter. The increase mainly reflects the recognition of deferred revenue. NGL and other adjusted pretax income was $284 million, compared with $357 million in the third quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower unrealized investment gains related to NOVONIX, partially offset by higher volumes at Sweeny Hub and favorable inventory impacts. Our investment in NOVONIX is mark-to-market at the end of each reporting period. The total value of the investment, including foreign exchange impacts increased $146 million in the fourth quarter, compared to an increase of $224 million in the third quarter. The fractionators at the Sweeny Hub averaged a record 417,000 barrels per day and the Freeport LPG export facility loaded a record 45 cargoes in the fourth quarter. DCP Midstream adjusted pretax income of $111 million, was up $80 million from the previous quarter, mainly due to favorable hedging impacts in the fourth quarter, compared to negative hedge results in the third quarter. The actual hedge benefit recognized in the fourth quarter amounted to approximately $50 million. Turning to Chemicals on Slide 9. Chemicals fourth quarter adjusted pretax income of $424 million was down $210 million from the third quarter. Olefins and Polyolefins adjusted pretax income was $405 million. The $208 million decrease from the previous quarter was primarily due to lower polyethylene margins, reduced sales volumes, as well as increased utility costs. Global O&P utilization was 97% for the quarter. Adjusted pretax income for SA&S was $37 million, compared with $36 million in the third quarter. During the fourth quarter, we received $479 million in cash distributions from CPChem. Turning to Refining on Slide 10. Refining fourth quarter adjusted pretax income was $404 million, an improvement of $220 million from the third quarter, driven by higher realized margins and improved volumes. This was partially offset by higher costs. Realized margins for the quarter increased by 35% to $11.60 per barrel. Impacts from lower market crack spreads were more than offset by lower RIN costs from a reduction in our estimated 2021 compliance year obligation and lower RIN prices. In addition, we had favorable inventory impacts and improved clean product differrentials. Refining adjusted results reflect approximately $230 million related to the EPA's proposed reduction of the RVO, of which about 75% applies to the first three quarters of the year. Pretax turnaround costs were $106 million, up from $81 million in the prior quarter. Crude utilization was 90% in the fourth quarter and clean product yield was 86%. Slide 11 covers market capture. The 3:2:1 market crack for the fourth quarter was $17.93 per barrel, compared to $19.44 per barrel in the third quarter. Realized margin was $11.60 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 65%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 44%. Market capture is impacted by the configuration of our refineries. Our refineries are more heavily weighted toward distillate production and the market indicator. During the quarter, the distillate crack increased $3.10 per barrel and the gasoline crack decreased $3.76 per barrel. Losses from secondary products of $1.88 per barrel improved $0.10 per barrel from the previous quarter, due to increased butane blending into gasoline. Our feedstock advantage of $0.18 per barrel improved by $0.17 per barrel from the prior quarter. The other category reduced realized margins by $2.02 per barrel. This category includes RINs, freight costs, clean product realizations and inventory impacts. Moving to Marketing and Specialties on Slide 12. Adjusted fourth quarter pretax income was $499 million, compared with $547 million in the prior quarter. Marketing and other decreased $52 million from the prior quarter. This was primarily due to lower marketing fuel margins and volumes, as well as higher costs. Specialties generated fourth quarter adjusted pretax income of $97 million, up from $93 million in the prior quarter. On Slide 13, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted pretax costs of $245 million, an increase of $15 million from the prior quarter. This was primarily due to higher employee-related costs and net interest expense. Slide 14 shows the change in cash during the fourth quarter. We had another strong quarter for cash. This is the third consecutive quarter that our operating cash flow enabled us to return cash to shareholders, invest in the business, pay down debt, while increasing our cash balance. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I will cover a few outlook items for the first quarter and the full year. In Chemicals, we expect the first quarter Global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the first quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the high-80s and pretax turnaround expenses to be between $120 million and $150 million. We anticipate first quarter Corporate and Other costs to come in between $230 million and $250 million pretax. For 2022, we plan full year turnaround expenses to be between $800 million and $900 million pretax. We expect Corporate and Other costs to be in the range of $900 million to $950 million pretax for the year. We anticipate full year D&A of about $1.4 billion, and finally, we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the 20% to 25% range. Now, we will open the line for questions. No. I think you covered it all. No. I think that's very complete. Just in terms of the debt pay down detail, we have a $450 million term loan maturity in April. We have $1 billion notes maturing in April and we intend to take care of both of those at maturity, and then what happens after that, we just have flexibility. We still have other callable debt available if we need to. But we will -- with that taken care of and if cash flows back at mid-cycle levels, we would have a lot of flexibility. Yeah. Doug, I think, it's really a -- it is a bit of a balancing, trying to meet multiple priorities. So we think about an optimum capital structure in terms of cost of capital, right? So too little debt is increasing cost of capital and so you have got that component to it. We have got other opportunities that we want to be able to fund. And bear in mind also that, as we are growing the business and we are seeing that in the non-Refining segments, as we are growing the business, we are actually, we are effectively strengthening our overall financial condition, because on a debt-to-EBITDA basis, we are continuing to improve from that standpoint. And obviously, we don't like the fact that we weren't buying shares at $40, but that was -- we were not in a position to do so and so we had to just accept that. And so it's really around finding that optimum capital structure that will give us sufficient flexibility through the cycle, albeit you have always got more flexibility. The lower the debt balance, obviously, that provides added flexibility. But at what cost is that? And so it's having the optimum structure to where we have got adequate flexibility. We can be -- stick with our sort of capital allocation framework, so 60% reinvestment in the business, 40% cash returns to shareholders between the dividend and buybacks over an extended time period, recognizing that year-over-year that will fluctuate. So it's really just trying to balance through all of that. I am not sure going too much further down on debt than our sort of stated objectives, is going to bias a whole lot in that context. So I still feel pretty good with how we are laying out our objectives. Yes. It does, Theresa. So the $404 million includes the $230 million. It applies to the full year. And so if you think about my additional comment was, if you think about that in terms of the quarter, as you could say, three quarters of that $230 million would apply to the first three quarters of the year and if you are doing any kind of normalization around that. If you -- yes. If you back out the full $230 million. Yeah. Hi, Manav. It's Kevin. Just on the D&A, we did as you suspected, associated with the alliance conversion, we impaired some assets that flows through the D&A line. So that is one-time in nature. Good morning. Yeah. Paul, on the deferred revenue, it's basically the variance quarter-over-quarter equates to the deferred revenue essentially. So that is the way to think about it. But I would say, with deferred revenue, that is no, I don't think of that as a sort of one-time item, because the nature of those contracts on the pipelines, we are either going to get the volumes and the revenues recognized as you get the volumes or if there's a shortfall in volumes, we still collect the cash and then we have makeup rights, or ultimately, recognize the deferred revenue. So that's a phenomena that you see going period-to-period. So it's not a -- I don't think it as a true inventory impacts both in the midst -- we have inventory impacts every period. And that's not something we typically quantify unless it was excessively large in terms of the impact. So we typically don't quantify those. No. It's going to show up across all areas. Thanks. So, Paul, I mean, you are right that with DCP, we are looking at, you take out all the hedging noise, you are probably a $50 million, $60 million per quarter of earnings generation and a pretty consistent distribution that comes along with that. While you could say, we are structurally challenged. It's been a JV we have had in place for over 20 years. It's been a very successful JV. The ownership has changed with -- as the owners -- with the M&A type activity over that time period. But nonetheless, it has continued to be successful for us. It does give us some nice integration through our own Midstream business. So DCP volumes, we jointly own the Santel SunHills pipelines with DCP and NGL volumes through that system come into Sweeny and into our fracs and so we have the benefit of that integration. So while a different structure might be a more efficient way of looking at that business, it's not something that we have to get done. There's nothing compelling that tells us we must have a different solution. And the reality is when you get into these kind of arrangements that have been placed for a long period of time, it can be pretty hard to exit for any party when you look at the tax considerations and all of that. So it's a little bit like the Synovus question earlier. We actually feel that the JV has been very successful. It does what we want it to do and we will take it from there. We are always open to alternatives as we are with most of our portfolio, but it's continued to work well for us."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session. Please note that -- note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jeff Dietert, Vice President Investor Relations. Jeff, you may begin.\nJeffrey Dietert : Good morning, and welcome Phillips 66, third quarter earnings conference call. Participants on today's call will include Greg Garland, Chairman and CEO. Mark Lashier President and CEO. Kevin Mitchell, EVP and CFO, Bob Herman, EVP refining. Brian Mandell, EVP marketing and commercial. And Tim Roberts, EVP midstream. Today's presentation material can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website, along with supplemental financial and operating information. Slide 2 contains our safe harbor statement. We will be making forward-looking statements during today's presentation and our Q&A session. Actual results may differ materially from today's comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here, as well as in our SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to Greg.\nGreg Garland : Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. In the third quarter, we had adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion. We generated operating cash flow of 2.2 billion, which meaningfully exceeded our capital spending and dividends during the quarter. We returned $394 million to shareholders through dividends and in October, we increased the quarterly dividend to $0.92 per share. We believe in the secure, competitive, and growing dividend. Since we formed as a Company, we've returned approximately $29 billion to shareholders and we remain committed to discipline capital allocation. We're seeing signs of sustainable cash-generations improvement. We've made good progress on debt repayment, reducing our debt balance by $1 billion so far this year. We're on a path to pre -pandemic level of debt, strengthening our Balance Sheet, and supporting our strong investment grade credit ratings. Earlier this week, we announced an agreement to acquire all the publicly held units of Phillips 66 Partners. Your equity transaction simplifies our corporate structure and positions us to drive greater value for Phillips 66 shareholders and Phillips 66 partners unit holders. We continue to advance the Company wide transformation efforts that we began in 2019. We believe that strengthening our cost position is necessary for long-term competitiveness. We recently initiated an effort to identify opportunities to significantly reduce costs across our portfolio. We're in the process of scoping these reductions and look forward to updating you early next year on our progress. Recently, we announced greenhouse gas targets to reduce the carbon emissions intensity from our operations by 2030. Our targets demonstrate our commitment to sustainability and to meeting the world's energy needs today and in the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark to provide some additional comments.\nMark Lashier : Thanks, Greg. Good morning. In the third quarter, we saw significant improvement in earnings and cash generation. In refining, we captured a meaningful improvement in realized margins. Midstream had strong earnings in the quarter and chemicals, the Olefins and Polyolefins business reported record quarterly earnings and marketing and specialties, had its second best quarter ever. In Midstream, we continue to advance Frac 4 at the Sweeny hub with construction approximately 1/3 complete and about 70% of the capital already spent. Additionally, we recently completed construction of Phillips 66 partners C2G Pipeline. CP Chem continues to pursue development of 2 world-scale petrochemical facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast, and in Ras Laffan Qatar. In addition, CP Chem is expanding its Olefins business with a world-scale unit to produce 1 - hexene. The Alliance Refineries sustained significant impacts from Hurricane Ida and will remain shutdown through the end of this year. We continue to assess future strategic options for the refinery. We continue to progress Rodeo renewed, which is expected to be completed in early 2024, subject to permitting and approvals. Upon completion, Rodeo will have over 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuel production capacity. The conversion will reduce emissions from the facility and produce lower-carbon transportation fuels. In marketing, we're converting 600 branded retail sites in California to sell renewable diesel produced by Rodeo facility. Our emerging energy group is advancing opportunities in renewable fuels, batteries, carbon capture, and hydrogen. With our recent investment in Novonix, we're expanding our presence in the battery value chain. Additionally, we recently announced the collaboration with Plug Power to identify and advance green hydrogen opportunities. We'll continue to focus on lower carbon initiatives that generate strong returns. We're excited about our participation in this dynamic energy transition, and combined with our commitment to disciplined capital allocation and strong returns. We're well-positioned for the future. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results.\nKevin Mitchell : Thank you, Mark. Hello, everyone. Starting with an overview on Slide four, we summarize our third quarter results. We reported earnings of $402 million. Special items during the quarter amounted to an after-tax loss of $1 billion, which was largely comprised of an impairment of the Alliance Refinery. Excluding special items, we had adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion or $3.18 per share. We generated operating cash flow of $2.2 billion, including a working capital benefit of $776 million and cash distributions from equity affiliates of $905 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $552 million. $311 million, was for growth project, including a $150 million investment in Novonix. We paid $394 million in dividends. Moving to Slide 5. This slide shows the change in adjusted results from the second quarter to the third quarter. An increase of $1.1 billion with a substantial improvement in refining and continued strong contributions from Midstream, Chemicals and Marketing and Specialties. Our adjusted effective income tax rate was 16%. Slide 6 shows our midstream results. Third quarter adjusted pre -tax income was $642 million, an increase of $326 million from the previous quarter. Transportation contributed adjusted pre -tax income of $254 million, up $30 million from the prior quarter. The increase was driven by higher equity earnings from the Bakken and Gray Oak pipelines. NGL and other adjusted pre -tax income was $357 million, compared with $83 million in the second quarter. The increase was primarily due to a $224 million unrealized investment gain related to Novonix, as well as inventory impacts. In September, we acquired a 16% interest in Novonix. Our investment will be mark-to-market at the end of each reporting period. Sweeny Fractionation Complex, averaged their record, 383 thousand barrels per day in the Freeport LPG Export facility, loaded 41 cargoes in the third quarter. DCP midstream adjusted pre -tax income of $31 million, was up $22 million from the previous quarter, mainly due to improved margins and hedging impacts. Turning to chemicals on Slide 7. We delivered another strong quarter in chemicals with adjusted pre -tax income of $634 million down $23 million from the second quarter. Olefins and Polyolefins had record adjusted pre -tax income of $613 million. The $20 million increase from the previous quarter was primarily due to higher polyethylene sales volumes driven by continued strong demand, partially offset by higher utility costs. Global O&P utilization was 102% for the quarter. Adjusted pre -tax income for SA&S decreased $45 million compared to the second quarter, driven by lower margins, which began to normalize following tight market conditions. During the third quarter, we received $632 million in cash distributions from CPChem. Turning to refining on Slide eight, refining third quarter adjusted pre -tax income was $184 million, an improvement of $890 million from the second quarter, driven by higher realized margins across all regions. Realized margins for the quarter increased by 119% to $8.57 per barrel, primarily due to higher market crack spreads, lowering costs, and improved product differentials. Pre -tax turnaround costs were $81 million, down from $118 million in the prior quarter. Crude utilization was 86%, compared with 88% in the second quarter. Lower utilization reflects downtime at the Alliance Refinery, which was safely shutdown on August 28th in advance of Hurricane Ida. The third quarter clean product yield was 84% up 2% from last quarter, supported by improved FCC operations. Slide 9 covers market capture. The 3:2:1 market crack for the third quarter was $19.44 per barrel compared to $17.76 per barrel in the second quarter. Realized margin was $8.57 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 44%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 22%. Market capture is impacted by the configuration of our refineries. Our refineries are more heavily weighted towards distillate production than the market indicator. During the quarter of the distillate crack increased $1.55 per barrel in the gasoline crack improved $1.92 per barrel. Losses from secondary products of $1.98 per barrel improved. $0.40 per barrel from the previous quarter as NGL prices strengthened. Our feedstock advantage of $0.01 per barrel declined by $0.26 per barrel from the prior quarter. The other category reduced realized margins by $5.01 per barrel. This category includes RIN s, freight costs, lean product realizations, and inventory impacts. Moving to marketing and specialties on Slide 10, adjusted third quarter pre -tax income was $547 million compared with $479 million in the prior quarter. Our marketing business realized continued strong margins and so increasing demand for products. Marketing and other increased $62 million from the prior quarter this is primarily due to higher international margins and volumes driven by the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. Refined product exports in the third quarter were 209 thousand barrels per day. Specialties generated third quarter adjusted pre -tax income of $93 million up from $87 million in the prior quarter, largely due to improved base oil margins. On Slide 11, the corporate and other segment had adjusted pre -tax costs of $230 million, an improvement of $14 million from the prior quarter. This was primarily due to lower costs, related to the timing of environmental and employee-related expenses, partially offset by higher net interest expense. Slide 12 shows the change in cash for the quarter. We started the quarter with a $2.2 billion cash balance. Cash from operations was $2.2 billion. Excluding a working capital benefit of $776 million, our cash from operations was $1.4 billion, which covered $552 million of capital spend, $394 million for the dividend, and $500 million of early debt repayment. Our ending cash balance was $2.9 billion. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I will cover a few outlook items. In chemicals we expect the fourth-quarter global O and P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In refining, we expect the fourth quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low-80s. We expect the Alliance Refinery to remain shutdown for the full quarter. We expect fourth-quarter pretax turnaround expenses to be between $110 and $140 million. We anticipate fourth quarter corporate and other costs to come in between $240 and $250 million, pretax. Now we will open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. As we open the call for questions, as a courtesy to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nRoger Read: Good morning.\nGreg Garland : Morning, Roger.\nKevin Mitchell : Good morning.\nRoger Read: I guess let's take the first one just as the decision to buy in PSXP. I mean, I don't think it should be a huge shot, but I mean one of the questions we've gotten is why now? So maybe you kind of help us on that and then I'm just curious, at least at a high level, how it might change, how the Company reports going forward.\nGreg Garland : Okay. Well, I'll take a stab at that, and then Kevin, Mark, Tim can help. First of all, I think probably, we all acknowledge that, this can roll in growing our Midstream business. If you look back on the pre - PSXP, so pre -2013, [Indiscernible] Midstream. The business generated about $500 million EBITDA, more than half of that is that the AMMO. Did a nice job in helping us build and grow a substantial Midstream. The market just doesn't refuel MLP at this point in time. Consider trading at a 9% yield, we've seen institutional ownership drop from the 90s into the low 70s. And then from our perspective, cost of capital is [Indiscernible] so it doesn't really provide an attractive [Indiscernible]. And then I will also say it -- provide a clear line of sight to valuation of our Midstream business from some of the parts basis. I'm not sure if that really applies today. So you think about, these are high-quality Midstream assets. We know them really well. We're able to acquire them for essentially a nine - ish multiple and trade it up into a 10 times multiple as we created from a sum-of-the-parts basis. And then, I think -- as we think about the future of Midstream and potential consolidation in Midstream. I think rolling up the PSXP gives us more degrees of freedom to create value with those assets. For a long time a lot of the strength, the MLP was a diversity of assets you think about crude oil pipelines and terminals and products pipelines as an NGL assets and we think that by bifurcating those, we'll be able to take those apart and discrete in the future, Kevin or Mark, if you want to add onto that, you are certainly welcome to do that.\nKevin Mitchell: No, I think you've covered it all up. Follow-up around reporting on a go-forward basis, as you know, as a fully consolidated entity, what you see today in our Midstream results reflects all of the MLP. Anyway, that's fully reflected in our Midstream segment results. But we have the cutback down below in non-controlling interest for the third-party public ownership. And so I want to -- once this transaction is closed, you will eliminate that non-controlling interest deduct from our bottom line results. So that's really how it's going to impact the reporting.\nRoger Read: Okay. Thanks for that. And then I think my next question is for Bob if he's on, but I've been plug-in Jeff about what's going on with renewable diesel conversion and Rodeo and some of the -- I don't know if I call it pushback, but let's say some of the regulatory issues there. And so I was hoping we could get a little clarity on some of the things we've seen in the press in terms of the size of the project maybe being scaled back, or whether or not that's an accurate depiction.\nMark Lashier : Okay. Yeah. Thanks for that question, Roger. I think, so the critical path on the whole project is a land-use permit in Contra Costa County, and that's -- there's -- in California, you get the opportunity to apply for lots of permits to build something, but this is the big one in a most difficult path through. So we've been working it since we announced the project and I would say overall it's going really well. The environmental impact statement that's part of obtaining that land use permit, was released for public comment about the middle of October. So that's a 60-day comment period. So that's when you saw in there that they identified, and opportunity to reduce the environmental impact to the project, is to make the project smaller. We actually took that as a good sign because by law, the planning commission staff has to identify lower impact alternatives to the project. And the fact that, the only thing that was put in there was, where you could just make it smaller to reduce the environmental impact. It reflected to us that they agreed with us. We had taken every environmental step around, reduction of emissions from the plant, shutting down of the carbon plant, everything we can do to reduce the emissions and the greenhouse gas footprint of the future the project, and that's really all that's left. We take that as, by no means that, they are advocating or that anyone will advocate for a smaller project being built there. This is the project that makes sense, it's the one that uses the equipment that's on the ground and it's very cost efficient to go on convert. So we're in the middle of public comment period At some point the county will start releasing the comments to us, and we'll respond to those, and the period will close in mid-December. It'll take [Indiscernible] the quarter to work its way through those, and we'll be responsive to those. And we still anticipate getting this thing permitted sometime probably late 1Q. And then that frees us up to go start construction.\nRoger Read: Very clear and I'm glad you did that for us because I don't speak government ease, but good to know you're still on the right direction. Thank you.\nMark Lashier: You got it.\nOperator: The next question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNeil Mehta : The team and Greg, I guess the first question is on 22 capital spending, typically we get that update. Here over the next couple of weeks, but you've been in relative maintenance spend mode outside of renewable. Just how, how should we think about the cadence of capex? Is the focus still on deleveraging the business, and therefore, we should assume capex close to sustaining levels or are you thinking about toggling some growth into the business?\nGreg Garland : Yeah. Well, we've come to big period of build in Midstream, I'd say. We've finished up C2G, [Indiscernible] will finish up essentially this year going into next year, so there's no big spend in front of us in Midstream. Obviously, we have the Rodeo renewed project and we're anxious to get started on that next year. But I think that all fits within the guidance we've consistently given here over the last couple of quarters of $2 billion or less for 2022. If you actually go to our board for approval of the capital budget in December timeframe. But that's, in my own numbers, that's the numbers that we're looking at for 2022. I think that, certainly cash-generation is improving as you can see the results from this quarter, I think we're probably more optimistic today that we're moving towards more of a mid-cycle earnings profile on our refining business. Our marketing specialties has been performing really, really strong this whole year. Kansas has been really strong this year. Midstream has been really strong this year. So as we get refining back to something approaching more mid-cycle, then they increased more optionality around the cash. What we do with the cash, but clearly, we're on a glide slope to pay down debt. We want to get back to that $12 billion pre -pandemic level. And as we've mentioned in the opening comments, we paid a billion down so far this year of that. So we're on a glide slope to do that. But I think the rule mileposts for us as we start thinking about, capital allocation. That first dollar is always going to go to our sustaining capital next dollar goes to dividend. And then when we think about debt reduction, and then hopefully we'll get to a point where we can start working share repurchases back in. So Kevin, if you want to add anything to that.\nKevin Mitchell : No, I think you covered it all. I would say on debt reduction, we are anticipating doing another reduction between now and the end of the year, probably in the order of another $0.5 billion that we'll get in before the end of the year.\nNeil Mehta : Thanks, Greg and Kevin. The follow-up is just on the refining environment, strong set of refining results this quarter. Can you just talk about how you're seeing the momentum going into Q4. We've seen distillate start to perform a little bit WCS widen now. Could that translate into numbers? And then if you could take a moment to talk about differentials, one of the things that has surprised I think market participants as how tight the spread between Brent and WTI is which matters for Mid-Con refining. Do you think that's a structural? Or do you think this widens out as U.S. production comes back?\nGreg Garland : I'll take a step at that. So we're optimistic going forward and the market setting up, well, setting up for our kit as well too, as you know, we're distillate heavy versus gasoline in the U.S. distillate is over gasoline in every market now, but Chicago, we think better will continue through the winter. You've seen a WCS diffs come off. a few reasons why we are finding problems in the Mid-Con barrels, WCS barrels got to the Gulf Coast, weaken the dip and the Canadian dips followed. And also there were some pipeline issues just this past weekend in Canada, which also helped weaken the dip. We think that dip will strengthen a bit going forward, but we -- we're happy where it is now. In terms of Brent TI s, the Brent TI needs to stay relatively tight as you've seen,\nKevin Mitchell : Cushing inventory. When that happens, we need to keep crude in the U.S. and the best way to do that is to tighten the WTI - Brent differential. So we think it will stay in the $2 to $3 range going forward. So, we think by and large the market's setting up for a good Q4 and is certainly a good 2022.\nGreg Garland : I think I would add that as OPEC puts more barrels into the market, those are going to be medium and heavy sour barrels and should result in a wider heavy sour discount, which are kit (ph) is disproportionately benefits from.\nOperator: The next question is from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTheresa Chen : Hi, thank you for taking my questions. First, just on the PSXP transaction itself. Just out of curiosity, will PSXP electing to take a step-up in PSXP 's tax basis. And do you have an expectation of what that step-up will be and just more generally speaking, what will be the net tax effect for PSX, once taking into account the fact that all of your Midstream earnings will be subject to tax, post MLP rolling?\nKevin Mitchell : Yes, Theresa, it's Kevin. So PSX, we'll be taking a step-up in basis for tax purposes, which will result in additional tax depreciation. We actually get to benefit from bonus depreciation on that also. And so the net cash effect will be about $300 million in 2022 of -- think of it as reduced cash taxes paid. And then about another $100 million the following year. So in aggregate, it's about a $400 million cash benefit to Phillips 66. From an ongoing basis, the primary impact from a tax standpoint, excluding the impact of the step-up in basis, is going to be the tax that we will recognize on that, what today is shown as non-controlling interest, that becomes -- those become our earnings. They're taxable to us, and so we'll be taxed on that -- on the -- on those earnings that we get from the formerly -- the units formerly owned by the public.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you for that clear and detailed answer. Maybe if you could talk about your near-term outlook for your European assets, both on the marketing as well as the refining front. Clearly demand continues to rebound as mobility restrictions ease, benefiting [Indiscernible] but energy costs or hydrocrackers specifically. How do you see this situation evolving and how does it impact not only your European assets, but also at a read root to had won in the U.S. and the cost finish for U.S. Gulf Coast assets that place products on the water for export?\nGreg Garland : go ahead and start on the marketing assets to recent. And Bob can jump in on the refining assets. In terms of marketing, we continue to build retail in Europe. We've had -- if you listened to Kevin's comments, that was part of the reason why marketing had its second best quarter ever. As people come back in overseas, we're seeing demands, which in the 2019 -- percent, but it's coming back as well. And we continue to re-image and update our stores over there, that's giving us about 2% increase in demand as well. And then, we're looking for some emerging energy opportunities. We've been building hydrogen stores in Switzerland and we're looking for some more opportunities to put in electric pumps and some other things over in the near future.\nRobert Herman : Yeah, and on the refining side, you have to think about our Humber Refinery. It's actually the most efficient refinery we have in the fleet. And then you add to that the fact that it's got a pretty large cat cracker and then we got 3 cokers there and all those are fuel gas generating units. And so at the end of the day, the Humber Refinery does not by a lot of natural gas to run the refinery. We see additional costs come through in power purchases and steam that we, [Indiscernible] that's operated by a third-party next door. There is a cost impact, but I think about the overall refining complex in Europe, right? Margins have to rise, or the highest cost producer online. And so everybody -- that floats all boats and Humber will be I think the recipient of them and we've seen that with [Indiscernible] over at Humber. So it's a headwind, but it's not a large headwind by any means, for Humber.\nGreg Garland : I think as we look at the impact on demand, it's the high natural gas prices especially New York and Asia are an incremental $0.5 million barrel a day demand to perhaps as much as a million barrels a day of incremental demand globally. So nice increase on the product side as well.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Philip Gresh with JPMorgan, please go ahead.\nPhilip Gresh : Good afternoon. Cash flow before working capital, maybe it's a little bit less than I would have expected relative to the strength of the earnings, and there's some deferred tax and other things in there. Kevin, is there anything unique in the quarter around that, that drove that?\nKevin Mitchell : Yeah, Phil there is. There is actually an offset between working capital, accounts receivable and that deferred tax. So there's a re-classification on tax receivables, either short-term and into deferred. And so in effect, we've -- inflated the working capital benefits at the expense of, reducing the pre -working capital cash flow. That's in the order of $0.5 billion and so on a -- you can do the math on what that really looks like. Because in my mind, I think about the working -- the real working capital benefit being, inventory of about $300 million and then the rest is offset within the Cash Flow Statement.\nPhilip Gresh : Got it. That's helpful. And just one question on refining. If I look at the Central Corridor results, much improved look at the bridges that you provide, the other part of the bridge was an area of huge improvement, sequentially. I was just wondering if you could -- sustainability of the 3Q results there.\nKevin Mitchell : Yeah. So I think one of the real issues 2Q to 3Q and [Indiscernible] freeze effects and turnaround. [Indiscernible] so we had Ponca down for about 3 weeks because of the freeze. That was a significant hit to us last [Indiscernible] the outage at Wood River, which was another impairment to that. So a lot of that been [Indiscernible] When you start doing the math, when you don't run a lot of barrels last quarter, it tends to kind of, [Indiscernible] in-flight to some extent, on the other -- there's a RIN effect, obviously, in the other, also all combined. So a lot of additive things hit us all at once in the second quarter, in the Mid-Con that just aren't there now and I would classify our third quarter in Mid-Con as we ran well, and we ran normal.\nGreg Garland : I would say, also, the market really set up for us in the third quarter. We had an early harvest season. It started early September, which is atypical, no weather delays. Some of our competitors had issues during the third quarter to help us out. We had low distillate inventories as well, and that favors our kit. And we talked about the WCS steps, which we're also wider. So all those things helped us in.\nOperator: The next question is from Douglas Leggate with Bank of America, please go ahead.\nDouglas Leggate : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Guys, I wonder if I could start with refining on the Alliance write-down. I'm looking specifically at the utilization guidance for the fourth quarter. And I guess we're -- I don't football this fall here, but are we at the point where we're seeing a recovery trajectory for refining? And if so, is that utilization rate so low because it's still including Alliance in the denominator? I'm just curious about how you see that playing out. Maybe you could give us an update on how you think what the next steps are for long at this point, what kind of follow-up?\nRobert Herman : Okay. I'll take the first part, I'll let Kevin talk about the write-down, so your two part question there. As we said, we don't anticipate with Alliance running in the fourth quarter. So you can think about that as, about a 10% utilization on a normal basis if we would have been running during the quarter, so we would've been guiding. A little bit of turnaround activity in 4Q, not too heavy. So I would characterize it. We're kind of back to running our system in a normal condition. And so we'll run as the economics dictate and particularly with heavy crude coming, the diffs coming wider, that usually incense us to run several of our assets harder. But then yeah, we keep Alliance in the denominator until it's not in the denominator.\nKevin Mitchell : Yeah, Doug, specifically on the impairment. So with the hurricane and the damage sustained by the hurricane that gave us [Indiscernible] due a fair value analysis around that. And so as a result of that work and that analysis, we took a $1.3 billion pre -tax resulting carrying value of about 200 once we have taken that impairment and that reflects the mission that's in today.\nDouglas Leggate : I don't want to labor the point Kevin. [Indiscernible] required for repairs or [Indiscernible] do you see a [Indiscernible] future for aligns in your hands on someone else's hand back at [Indiscernible] Is it going to operate again or is a diamond so much at this point? This are things unlikely to restart than you think?\nKevin Mitchell : Yeah. I think on their point, we continue, [Indiscernible] particularly significant electrical system that hit it, and we have been painstakingly working our way through the assessment of how do you restore operations there. So that will continue as we continue to, as we announced before, seek buyers for the facility. And then we continue to work with those third parties to see what the actual outcome the Alliance Refinery is. It is too soon to make that call as to will it operate as a refinery again or in some other capacity, either for us or somebody else.\nDouglas Leggate : Thank you. My follow-up, guys, is just a quick one on PSXP. I don't know the numbers are going to be terribly meaningful here. But just wonder if you could talk us through. Are there any incremental synergies coming out of the consolidation of bringing it back. And obviously, you don't have the accounting function and so on. And I wonder if I could just tag on to that? Again, not a big number, but how should we think about the targets for the combined or consolidated Company leverage that targets going forward now that you've fully got my consent. Thanks.\nKevin Mitchell : How many questions was that? In terms of the synergies associated with the rollout, it's pretty small in the big scheme of things. Now coming clearly, there are some there's some corporate costs, there's the fact that PSXP as a public entity and all the associated costs that go with that will disappear, and so there will be a modest impact, but it's not anything that's going to move the needle when you step back and look at our consolidated financial results. From the standpoint of leverage and debt levels, we already had all of that MLP debt on our consolidated balance sheet. And so as Greg talked, pre -pandemic debt levels that we're trying -- included PSXP, that as well. Until it [Indiscernible] really change anything, in terms of how we think about our go-forward leverage objectives. The roll-up does give us a little bit more flexibility though, because one, we have access to all of the cash, that previously either was distributed to the LP [Indiscernible] Distributions or was excess cash, excess coverage cash becomes available to us for debt reduction, and we also have the PSXP debt available as we think of the options around paying dying debt we have the PSXP debt to consider in that context as well. So just give us a bit more flexibility.\nOperator: The next question is from Paul Cheng with Scotia, please go ahead.\nPaul Cheng : Hey, guys. Good morning. Maybe that the first one is for Bob. That -- can you -- I know that you're saying in Humber that you have not a lot of -- you don't consume a lot of natural gas, but can you give us an overall in U.S and in Europe. For every $1 per MCF change towards the intact on the optics and your defining margin capture on a dollar per barrel basis. Any plan to change it and become more engaged and own your own store, given the energy transition that we're seeing? People that is the -- I mean, some of your bigger customers become more aggressive in owning the stations. Building the UV charger and all that. Is that -- and to some degree, you are doing it in Europe. So is that -- something that you were also trying to replicate, the wholesale capital-light model?\nRobert Herman : Nothing changed.\nKevin Mitchell: I'll take [Indiscernible]. Brian talked about retail plans. So we provided for every dollar change in million BTU net gas price, about $150 million a year across our [Indiscernible] fleet. And you can think about that as about $100 million of that is pure natural gas, and the other $50 million comes through in electricity and steam purchases. Of the 100 million, then it's about global cost line and in the third quarter it is in cost of goods sold, primarily natural gas that we buy to turn into hydrogen. So that's without any mitigating steps within the refining system. Obviously, a lot of refineries have the ability to fuel propane and a little bit of butane and really, the economics to the day we'll drive what we decide to do there. We've also got the novel of turning up severity on cat cracker and making more gas. So there's a lot of moving parts into that sensitivity, but the simplest way to think about it is just 1 block is a $150 million a year. So we can call that $35 million or so a quarter.\nBrian Mandell: And Paul, on the retail -- U.S. retail side, we had a small retail joint venture in Oklahoma City, three dozen storage few years ago. In 2019 we stated that, we want to be more in the retail business, especially in markets where you're less opportunities export, markets like the Mid-Con. So we will have, by the end of the year, about 800 retail joint venture stores in the U.S., we're continuing to find stores and buy stores in Middle America, where we're going to integrate those stores with our refinery complex to make sure we have the pull-through. Particularly, as gasoline demand wanes in the U.S. So it will still remain -- retail will remain a small portion of the whole for us in the U.S. But it's a market that we're actively pursuing.\nOperator: The next question is from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse, please go ahead.\nManav Gupta : Hi, everybody. If you could give us some idea of this NVX deal. You're taking 16% interest in them. How did it come out? Stepping into battery is something. We haven't seen you do before or any refiner to -- I mean, what I'm trying to get to is we know you make Melee (ph) Corp, you won't tell us how much you make or what the price is, but we know it's there and I'm trying to understand if they're some synergies between that Melee (ph) Corp and NVX deal that you did.\nRobert Herman : I will take that. I'll jump in. Novonix that we've identified 4 key areas that we want to focus on in renewables to generate strong returns that's renewables, batteries, hydrogen, and carbon capture. And so this particularly opportunity falls into the battery filler. And as you noted, we've got a very good feedstock that can be used to generate synthetic graphite to go into anodes, and we went through a screening process, these anode producers are looking at ways to provide -- shorter supply chain options for those that need their services like those that are building electric vehicles and Novonix rose to the top of that screening process in North America, and we liked the team, we liked the technologies they were employing. They've got a low carbon intensity technology to produce the synthetic graphite. They're locating in a place where they can get low carbon electricity, and it's a great way for us to move up the value chain in battery manufacturing and supporting the growth in electric vehicles?\nBrian Mandell: I think maybe the other thing I might add is, we know a lot about the specialty coat that goes into the anodes and how to tailor that, and make properties around that. But the further up the value chain we get, the more we can understand the, how we can make those properties special, right? And so that we can drive more value creation, and, at the end of the day, better batteries. And so that's part of what's driving this -- it seek to understand the ultimate customers in this market. So we can help drive performance.\nJeffrey Dietert : I think the other thing I'd add is, there is an increased focus on local content within the U.S. and in Europe. And the advantage of having U.S. facilities serving that market.\nManav Gupta : Thanks Jeff for that. My one quick follow-up here is, look, we understand the chemical margins were off $0.68 of what would not last, but in your opinion, has pandemic fundamentally changed the demand for disposable plastics, which means the mid-cycle could be 5 or 10 or whatever number, over the standard $0.20 to $0.25 per pound. So just trying to understand your outlook for the mid-cycle margins in the chemical space, maybe before the next 2 or 3 years as we see some capacity expansion.\nMark Lashier : We have a mid-cycle margins that there may have been, I think that clearly the plastics industry benefited during the pandemic. I think as there may be some residual effects there, with respect to personal protective equipment and things like that. But I think as the world moves beyond the pandemic, we see things going back to a more normal supply and demand and situation. And I think it contributed to the strong growth that we've seen, And but we don't see it a [Indiscernible]\nManav Gupta : Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Matt Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Blair : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question here. CP Chem could you share your a thin outlook over the next, I don't know call it a year. So we do have some new crackers starting up [Indiscernible] ramp of ethane exports. Do you see that incremental demand being covered by incremental production or do we need to pull from either, I guess projection or just overall inventory levels?\nTimothy Roberts : Yes. Matt, this is Tim Roberts, and a couple of things on that. 1 is -- there's a couple of drivers that are happening in there. First of all, you still have about a million barrels being rejected, so you've got a sufficient pool that's sitting there that's obviously got to be incented to come out. And so up to this last quarter, it actually was incented to come out. We've seen that flip a little bit here recently. There will be a little bit of pull with a couple of new crackers coming on stream here in the next -- over the next two quarters. But fundamentally, we actually feel that the supply is going to be there. And so it will be sufficient. There's also quite an incentive for people to get out there and make sure they're maximizing gas, production, and then you are seeing, folks out there continue to maintain production. We're seeing NGL is coming off of the crude side, the natural gas side, and then with the rejection that's going on, it feels very sufficient here.\nMatthew Blair: Got it, and then on the renewable side, are there any prospects for using renewable hydrogen for your plant and Rodeo? And if so, would that be something potentially near-term or just like much further out?\nRobert Herman: Yes. There is a possibility to do that and we continue to explore those avenues, it is not part of the project today. And in fact, we're running mostly third party hydrogen there. So it's really a question for them. But there are opportunities in California to recover renewable natural gas that could find its way to being run by the hydrogen supplier and then that would lower that actually the overall carbon intensity of the diesel we will eventually make.\nMatthew Blair : Sounds good. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.\nRyan Todd: Yeah, thanks. Maybe the Balance Sheet Cash Flow question. I mean, in very rough terms here, you're exporting capital cash flow this quarter, roughly when. In equal amounts in the capex dividend and debt reduction. I know you talked about another $500 million in debt reduction before or likely during the fourth quarter. I mean, as we think about your balance sheet that would have you down to about $14.5 billion versus I guess your $12 billion pre -pandemic target. As we think about uses of cash in 2022, and you need to get the balance sheet down about $12 billion level before. So at what point does the potential for buybacks kind of become a part of the excess cash flow?\nKevin Mitchell : Yeah, Ryan, Kevin. What we're trying to balance here is first priority is to protect the credit ratings of the A3 BBB-plus credit ratings, strong investment grade. We want to maintain those ratings. And part of getting there is, in the Balance Sheet back to where it was, but it's also a function of cash-generation at mid-cycle or thereabouts levels. And so I think that once we are -- as we're already making good progress on debt reduction. And when we're in that position of we're clearly back in a mid-cycle type environment. We're generating mid-cycle cash flow. There's a very clear line of sight to the ability to continue to reduce debt down to the levels we want to get to. We should have more flexibility to start thinking about the [Indiscernible] The way to $12 billion before we think about alternatives, as long as the cash-generation is there that we can clearly see our ability to deliver continue to deliver, and consider some of the alternatives around capital allocation.\nRyan Todd: Thanks, and then maybe, I guess maybe as a follow-up to that. As you -- mid-cycle environment for the refining business, one of your large peers who reported earlier talked about their prior expectations for 2022 being below mid-cycle and now they see it as potentially being an above mid-cycle year and refining. When you look at overall supply demand dynamics and various trends in the industry, you see 2022, where do you see it on the refining side in terms of relative to kind of mid-cycle expectations?\nKevin Mitchell : It's always hard to call because we -- invariably, when we make a prediction, we get it wrong. But things seem to be shaping up to be somewhere at least close to mid-cycle. And I think the 1 composition that's not there right now are the crude differentials. So we're still lagging on heavy crude differentials. But there's some light at the end of the tunnel on that as well as we start to see OPEC putting more barrels back into the market. So we could see that start to come back in our favor. But that is probably what's keeping us being a little -- maybe a little bit behind mid-cycle at this point in time, but I opened up to --\nBrian Mandell: I would say with low inventories across all products with jet-fuel starting to come back, the government opening up international travel to vaccinated travelers by November 8, I think we'll continue to see the light, heavy DIBS expand. We've seen MEH and also Dubai Brent both expand quite a bit from late July to now, so I think we'll continue to see that expansion. Part of that is, this drive to use more sweet crude even overseas, where people -- where hydrogen is costly, so desulfurization is costly. So people want to switch to -- probably want to switch to more light crude diet. So I think that, things are setting up for a good 2022. We hear we'll call it, an average year for us. But it may be better than that depending on, if inventories continue to decrease.\nGreg Garland : Look at realized crack, 12 to 19, 3, 2, 1 RIN adjusted. It's $10-$50 a barrel give or take. And we're $8.50- ish in this quarter. So we're not quite back to a mid-cycle crack, but to the point that you raised earlier, I think -- well, I don't think we're bullish. We had time to grow orange yet, but I do think that we're probably more constructive today on 2022 in refining and moving towards mid-cycle margins than we were any time in the past 19 months, I would say.\nOperator: The next question is from Jason Gabelman with Cowen, please go ahead.\nJason Gabelman: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. First, wanted to ask about this other refining bucket in that margin waterfall chart, it's been volatile the past couple quarters. I think was as high as $8 a barrel last quarter, back down to 5 this quarter. Is that difference mostly related to range or are there other things going on and where do you see that trending over the next coming quarters. And then secondly, I just wanted to ask about NGL exposure across the business. NGL prices right now are pretty high, propane inventories are low. Do you have an ability to capture some of that price strength in the Midstream, but business and conversely? Is there an impact to your refining business in the winter due to butane blending and any ability to quantify that would help. Thanks.\nRobert Herman : I'll take a shot at a couple of pieces of that. You're right, the other category is our most volatile category and we call it other because everything that isn't straightforward is in there, so you've got renefex in there, you've got inventory effects in there. We've also got product differential effects in there, so on -- particularly in the Atlantic basin when European cracks really disconnect from the Atlantic Coast. We'll see, the plus or minus in that category, inventory accounting can move numbers in there quite a bit and there's a few steady things in there, like freight to get our products to market and those sorts of things are pretty steady, but the volatility really comes product dish and that also includes the timing of our realizations for the products we move up corneal pipeline to the East Coast. That can be very volatile month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter. The RIN Inventories, and then just overall market structure in between, the places that we buy themselves our product. It's hard to say that the volatility will slow down. It's kind of always there. The bucket is just outsized right now because of the severe RIN impact that we show in the other [Indiscernible] quarters. On the NGL, [Indiscernible]. Butane blending into gasoline. You run a fair amount. We want to do it if it's economic. So if NGLs prices run up and it doesn't make sense to put it in the gasoline, we won't. Overall in refining as part of our secondary products, we make 4%, 5% NGLs off the refining complexes. So the higher the price for NGLs, the better off we are and lowers that, usually a negative to our income. So overall, we store a lot of our own butane every year to bring back and blend in gasoline but quite frankly, we will sell it into the market if that makes more sense.\nTimothy Roberts : On the -- piece, with regard to more along the lines of exposure, taking advantage of the opportunity. You're right, composite barrel's been pretty active. I mean, it's effectively tripled in price here in the last year. But what we do with our system, were predominantly, we're not exposed significantly in commodity cycle there. So we really are fee-based business the way we are structured. Now, what we do, do much like we do with the refining kit is, we have assistant, we're managing around. So as we are buying and selling barrels to optimize our kit, there are opportunities for us to create around this asset and capture and clip a couple of the corners in that process. But it's really to manage and optimize our system to make sure, our barrels as we buy them from the well head, all the way to the point they end up in the market place, That's how we try to position those barrels and we play in that. So we don't have a lot of commodity exposure. It a little bit on our LPG, but that was by design. LPG exports, excuse me. Map was a little bit of that's by design, but most of that business has turned up as well, which should be considered a fee-based business.\nOperator: The final question is from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.\nConnor Lynagh: Thank you. I had a couple of questions on federal policy and I know things are early days, but the first is around sustainable aviation fuel, if the incremental credit at or Blenders Credit as discussed right now or it's going to affect how would that alter your thinking around how you're going to configure the Rodeo plant between renewable diesel and Aviation fuel?\nRobert Herman : Yes. So today that the design is done, the permit's in so that the opportunity currently to reconfigure what we plan to do there is really not there at this point. But having said that, the refinery itself will make 8% to 10% yield of sustainable aviation fuel that the blenders tax credit as envisioned today, may or may not incent us to do that. It's fairly close. So it will depend on everything else that goes into the margin at that point, whether we actually want to make sustainable aviation fuel or make renewable diesel. And like everything else in the commodity business, we'll let the economics dictate. I think there's plenty of opportunity, as sustainable aviation fuel develops and the market develops for that\nRobert Herman : over time to come back and do a de - bottlenecking or add a little bit of kit at Rodeo renewed to make more sustainable aviation fuel is there, and we'll probably make sense, but it's probably going to take more than a $1.5 that the government is anticipating putting out there to make that happen.\nConnor Lynagh: [Indiscernible] a couple. The others on carbon capture. And I know you guys have discussed, study and carbon capture as an opportunity. You've got these new target out there for reducing your carbon intensity. So how are you thinking about that? And certainly it would seem that the enhanced incentives if passed would increase third-party developers willingness to build systems. So how are you thinking about it just broadly in terms of the opportunity set for you? And If you were to pursue some largest Gulf projects, would you use your balance sheet? Would you rely on others? How do you think that would look?\nTimothy Roberts : I mean, look, this is still evolving as we move forward in this. But we do think carbon capture is going to be key piece of the overall transition and being able to meet some of the targets and goals that have been set out there, whether by 2030 to 2050. It's current capture to maybe key piece of that. I mean, it's already in play currently, just not in a large scale. But we certainly do participate in that. And so a big key piece of that is going to be having a concentration of carbon to capture. I mean, you've got to have areas where there's heavy concentration. You've heard some of the stuff about Houston. And there are other metro areas or industrialized areas, where there may be opportunities to do that as well. We certainly think with our assets and our structure and the products and processes that we do that, it does make sense. Now, the next challenge is, does it make economic sense? We're going to work both sides to that equation, with regard to see, what makes sense and what fits? Whether it's organic, whether it's with a partner, whether it's equity relationships, whether it's technology partnerships. I think at this point in time, we're not going to single in on one way. We're going to find out what the opportunity is and what value is and then determine what's the best path to maximize and optimize values.\nOperator: We have reached the end of today's call. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.\nJeffrey Dietert: Thank you Tim. Thank you all for your interest in Phillips 66. If you have questions after today's call, please contact Shannon or me. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Robert Herman",
            "content": "Yeah, and on the refining side, you have to think about our Humber Refinery. It's actually the most efficient refinery we have in the fleet. And then you add to that the fact that it's got a pretty large cat cracker and then we got 3 cokers there and all those are fuel gas generating units. And so at the end of the day, the Humber Refinery does not by a lot of natural gas to run the refinery. We see additional costs come through in power purchases and steam that we, [Indiscernible] that's operated by a third-party next door. There is a cost impact, but I think about the overall refining complex in Europe, right? Margins have to rise, or the highest cost producer online. And so everybody -- that floats all boats and Humber will be I think the recipient of them and we've seen that with [Indiscernible] over at Humber. So it's a headwind, but it's not a large headwind by any means, for Humber. Okay. I'll take the first part, I'll let Kevin talk about the write-down, so your two part question there. As we said, we don't anticipate with Alliance running in the fourth quarter. So you can think about that as, about a 10% utilization on a normal basis if we would have been running during the quarter, so we would've been guiding.

It's fairly close. So it will depend on everything else that goes into the margin at that point, whether we actually want to make sustainable aviation fuel or make renewable diesel. And like everything else in the commodity business, we'll let the economics dictate. I think there's plenty of opportunity, as sustainable aviation fuel develops and the market develops for that over time to come back and do a de - bottlenecking or add a little bit of kit at Rodeo renewed to make more sustainable aviation fuel is there, and we'll probably make sense, but it's probably going to take more than a $1.5 that the government is anticipating putting out there to make that happen."

            "content": "And Paul, on the retail -- U.S. retail side, we had a small retail joint venture in Oklahoma City, three dozen storage few years ago. In 2019 we stated that, we want to be more in the retail business, especially in markets where you're less opportunities export, markets like the Mid-Con. So we will have, by the end of the year, about 800 retail joint venture stores in the U.S., we're continuing to find stores and buy stores in Middle America, where we're going to integrate those stores with our refinery complex to make sure we have the pull-through. Particularly, as gasoline demand wanes in the U.S. So it will still remain -- retail will remain a small portion of the whole for us in the U.S. But it's a market that we're actively pursuing. I think maybe the other thing I might add is, we know a lot about the specialty coat that goes into the anodes and how to tailor that, and make properties around that. But the further up the value chain we get, the more we can understand the, how we can make those properties special, right? And so that we can drive more value creation, and, at the end of the day, better batteries. And so that's part of what's driving this -- it seek to understand the ultimate customers in this market. So we can help drive performance. I would say with low inventories across all products with jet-fuel starting to come back, the government opening up international travel to vaccinated travelers by November 8, I think we'll continue to see the light, heavy DIBS expand. We've seen MEH and also Dubai Brent both expand quite a bit from late July to now, so I think we'll continue to see that expansion. Part of that is, this drive to use more sweet crude even overseas, where people -- where hydrogen is costly, so desulfurization is costly. So people want to switch to -- probably want to switch to more light crude diet. So I think that, things are setting up for a good 2022. We hear we'll call it, an average year for us. But it may be better than that depending on, if inventories continue to decrease."

            "name": "Greg Garland",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. In the third quarter, we had adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion. We generated operating cash flow of 2.2 billion, which meaningfully exceeded our capital spending and dividends during the quarter. We returned $394 million to shareholders through dividends and in October, we increased the quarterly dividend to $0.92 per share. We believe in the secure, competitive, and growing dividend. Since we formed as a Company, we've returned approximately $29 billion to shareholders and we remain committed to discipline capital allocation. We're seeing signs of sustainable cash-generations improvement. We've made good progress on debt repayment, reducing our debt balance by $1 billion so far this year. We're on a path to pre -pandemic level of debt, strengthening our Balance Sheet, and supporting our strong investment grade credit ratings. Earlier this week, we announced an agreement to acquire all the publicly held units of Phillips 66 Partners. Your equity transaction simplifies our corporate structure and positions us to drive greater value for Phillips 66 shareholders and Phillips 66 partners unit holders. We continue to advance the Company wide transformation efforts that we began in 2019. We believe that strengthening our cost position is necessary for long-term competitiveness. We recently initiated an effort to identify opportunities to significantly reduce costs across our portfolio. We're in the process of scoping these reductions and look forward to updating you early next year on our progress. Recently, we announced greenhouse gas targets to reduce the carbon emissions intensity from our operations by 2030. Our targets demonstrate our commitment to sustainability and to meeting the world's energy needs today and in the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark to provide some additional comments. Morning, Roger. Okay. Well, I'll take a stab at that, and then Kevin, Mark, Tim can help. First of all, I think probably, we all acknowledge that, this can roll in growing our Midstream business. If you look back on the pre - PSXP, so pre -2013, [Indiscernible] Midstream. The business generated about $500 million EBITDA, more than half of that is that the AMMO. Did a nice job in helping us build and grow a substantial Midstream. The market just doesn't refuel MLP at this point in time. Consider trading at a 9% yield, we've seen institutional ownership drop from the 90s into the low 70s. And then from our perspective, cost of capital is [Indiscernible] so it doesn't really provide an attractive [Indiscernible]. And then I will also say it -- provide a clear line of sight to valuation of our Midstream business from some of the parts basis. I'm not sure if that really applies today. So you think about, these are high-quality Midstream assets. We know them really well. We're able to acquire them for essentially a nine - ish multiple and trade it up into a 10 times multiple as we created from a sum-of-the-parts basis. And then, I think -- as we think about the future of Midstream and potential consolidation in Midstream. I think rolling up the PSXP gives us more degrees of freedom to create value with those assets. For a long time a lot of the strength, the MLP was a diversity of assets you think about crude oil pipelines and terminals and products pipelines as an NGL assets and we think that by bifurcating those, we'll be able to take those apart and discrete in the future, Kevin or Mark, if you want to add onto that, you are certainly welcome to do that. Yeah. Well, we've come to big period of build in Midstream, I'd say. We've finished up C2G, [Indiscernible] will finish up essentially this year going into next year, so there's no big spend in front of us in Midstream. Obviously, we have the Rodeo renewed project and we're anxious to get started on that next year. But I think that all fits within the guidance we've consistently given here over the last couple of quarters of $2 billion or less for 2022. If you actually go to our board for approval of the capital budget in December timeframe. But that's, in my own numbers, that's the numbers that we're looking at for 2022. I think that, certainly cash-generation is improving as you can see the results from this quarter, I think we're probably more optimistic today that we're moving towards more of a mid-cycle earnings profile on our refining business. Our marketing specialties has been performing really, really strong this whole year. Kansas has been really strong this year. Midstream has been really strong this year. So as we get refining back to something approaching more mid-cycle, then they increased more optionality around the cash. What we do with the cash, but clearly, we're on a glide slope to pay down debt. We want to get back to that $12 billion pre -pandemic level. And as we've mentioned in the opening comments, we paid a billion down so far this year of that. So we're on a glide slope to do that. But I think the rule mileposts for us as we start thinking about, capital allocation. That first dollar is always going to go to our sustaining capital next dollar goes to dividend. And then when we think about debt reduction, and then hopefully we'll get to a point where we can start working share repurchases back in. So Kevin, if you want to add anything to that. I'll take a step at that. So we're optimistic going forward and the market setting up, well, setting up for our kit as well too, as you know, we're distillate heavy versus gasoline in the U.S. distillate is over gasoline in every market now, but Chicago, we think better will continue through the winter. You've seen a WCS diffs come off. a few reasons why we are finding problems in the Mid-Con barrels, WCS barrels got to the Gulf Coast, weaken the dip and the Canadian dips followed. And also there were some pipeline issues just this past weekend in Canada, which also helped weaken the dip. We think that dip will strengthen a bit going forward, but we -- we're happy where it is now. In terms of Brent TI s, the Brent TI needs to stay relatively tight as you've seen, I think I would add that as OPEC puts more barrels into the market, those are going to be medium and heavy sour barrels and should result in a wider heavy sour discount, which are kit (ph) is disproportionately benefits from. go ahead and start on the marketing assets to recent. And Bob can jump in on the refining assets. In terms of marketing, we continue to build retail in Europe. We've had -- if you listened to Kevin's comments, that was part of the reason why marketing had its second best quarter ever. As people come back in overseas, we're seeing demands, which in the 2019 -- percent, but it's coming back as well. And we continue to re-image and update our stores over there, that's giving us about 2% increase in demand as well. And then, we're looking for some emerging energy opportunities. We've been building hydrogen stores in Switzerland and we're looking for some more opportunities to put in electric pumps and some other things over in the near future. I think as we look at the impact on demand, it's the high natural gas prices especially New York and Asia are an incremental $0.5 million barrel a day demand to perhaps as much as a million barrels a day of incremental demand globally. So nice increase on the product side as well. I would say, also, the market really set up for us in the third quarter. We had an early harvest season. It started early September, which is atypical, no weather delays. Some of our competitors had issues during the third quarter to help us out. We had low distillate inventories as well, and that favors our kit. And we talked about the WCS steps, which we're also wider. So all those things helped us in. Look at realized crack, 12 to 19, 3, 2, 1 RIN adjusted. It's $10-$50 a barrel give or take. And we're $8.50- ish in this quarter. So we're not quite back to a mid-cycle crack, but to the point that you raised earlier, I think -- well, I don't think we're bullish. We had time to grow orange yet, but I do think that we're probably more constructive today on 2022 in refining and moving towards mid-cycle margins than we were any time in the past 19 months, I would say."

            "content": "Thanks, Greg. Good morning. In the third quarter, we saw significant improvement in earnings and cash generation. In refining, we captured a meaningful improvement in realized margins. Midstream had strong earnings in the quarter and chemicals, the Olefins and Polyolefins business reported record quarterly earnings and marketing and specialties, had its second best quarter ever. In Midstream, we continue to advance Frac 4 at the Sweeny hub with construction approximately 1/3 complete and about 70% of the capital already spent. Additionally, we recently completed construction of Phillips 66 partners C2G Pipeline. CP Chem continues to pursue development of 2 world-scale petrochemical facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast, and in Ras Laffan Qatar. In addition, CP Chem is expanding its Olefins business with a world-scale unit to produce 1 - hexene. The Alliance Refineries sustained significant impacts from Hurricane Ida and will remain shutdown through the end of this year. We continue to assess future strategic options for the refinery. We continue to progress Rodeo renewed, which is expected to be completed in early 2024, subject to permitting and approvals. Upon completion, Rodeo will have over 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuel production capacity. The conversion will reduce emissions from the facility and produce lower-carbon transportation fuels. In marketing, we're converting 600 branded retail sites in California to sell renewable diesel produced by Rodeo facility. Our emerging energy group is advancing opportunities in renewable fuels, batteries, carbon capture, and hydrogen. With our recent investment in Novonix, we're expanding our presence in the battery value chain. Additionally, we recently announced the collaboration with Plug Power to identify and advance green hydrogen opportunities. We'll continue to focus on lower carbon initiatives that generate strong returns. We're excited about our participation in this dynamic energy transition, and combined with our commitment to disciplined capital allocation and strong returns. We're well-positioned for the future. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results. Okay. Yeah. Thanks for that question, Roger. I think, so the critical path on the whole project is a land-use permit in Contra Costa County, and that's -- there's -- in California, you get the opportunity to apply for lots of permits to build something, but this is the big one in a most difficult path through. So we've been working it since we announced the project and I would say overall it's going really well. The environmental impact statement that's part of obtaining that land use permit, was released for public comment about the middle of October. So that's a 60-day comment period. So that's when you saw in there that they identified, and opportunity to reduce the environmental impact to the project, is to make the project smaller. We actually took that as a good sign because by law, the planning commission staff has to identify lower impact alternatives to the project. And the fact that, the only thing that was put in there was, where you could just make it smaller to reduce the environmental impact. It reflected to us that they agreed with us. We had taken every environmental step around, reduction of emissions from the plant, shutting down of the carbon plant, everything we can do to reduce the emissions and the greenhouse gas footprint of the future the project, and that's really all that's left. We take that as, by no means that, they are advocating or that anyone will advocate for a smaller project being built there. This is the project that makes sense, it's the one that uses the equipment that's on the ground and it's very cost efficient to go on convert. So we're in the middle of public comment period At some point the county will start releasing the comments to us, and we'll respond to those, and the period will close in mid-December. It'll take [Indiscernible] the quarter to work its way through those, and we'll be responsive to those. And we still anticipate getting this thing permitted sometime probably late 1Q. And then that frees us up to go start construction. You got it. We have a mid-cycle margins that there may have been, I think that clearly the plastics industry benefited during the pandemic. I think as there may be some residual effects there, with respect to personal protective equipment and things like that. But I think as the world moves beyond the pandemic, we see things going back to a more normal supply and demand and situation. And I think it contributed to the strong growth that we've seen, And but we don't see it a [Indiscernible]"

            "name": "Timothy Roberts",
            "content": "Yes. Matt, this is Tim Roberts, and a couple of things on that. 1 is -- there's a couple of drivers that are happening in there. First of all, you still have about a million barrels being rejected, so you've got a sufficient pool that's sitting there that's obviously got to be incented to come out. And so up to this last quarter, it actually was incented to come out. We've seen that flip a little bit here recently. There will be a little bit of pull with a couple of new crackers coming on stream here in the next -- over the next two quarters. But fundamentally, we actually feel that the supply is going to be there. And so it will be sufficient. There's also quite an incentive for people to get out there and make sure they're maximizing gas, production, and then you are seeing, folks out there continue to maintain production. We're seeing NGL is coming off of the crude side, the natural gas side, and then with the rejection that's going on, it feels very sufficient here. On the -- piece, with regard to more along the lines of exposure, taking advantage of the opportunity. You're right, composite barrel's been pretty active. I mean, it's effectively tripled in price here in the last year. But what we do with our system, were predominantly, we're not exposed significantly in commodity cycle there. So we really are fee-based business the way we are structured. Now, what we do, do much like we do with the refining kit is, we have assistant, we're managing around. So as we are buying and selling barrels to optimize our kit, there are opportunities for us to create around this asset and capture and clip a couple of the corners in that process. But it's really to manage and optimize our system to make sure, our barrels as we buy them from the well head, all the way to the point they end up in the market place, That's how we try to position those barrels and we play in that. So we don't have a lot of commodity exposure. It a little bit on our LPG, but that was by design. LPG exports, excuse me. Map was a little bit of that's by design, but most of that business has turned up as well, which should be considered a fee-based business. I mean, look, this is still evolving as we move forward in this. But we do think carbon capture is going to be key piece of the overall transition and being able to meet some of the targets and goals that have been set out there, whether by 2030 to 2050. It's current capture to maybe key piece of that. I mean, it's already in play currently, just not in a large scale. But we certainly do participate in that. And so a big key piece of that is going to be having a concentration of carbon to capture. I mean, you've got to have areas where there's heavy concentration. You've heard some of the stuff about Houston. And there are other metro areas or industrialized areas, where there may be opportunities to do that as well. We certainly think with our assets and our structure and the products and processes that we do that, it does make sense. Now, the next challenge is, does it make economic sense? We're going to work both sides to that equation, with regard to see, what makes sense and what fits? Whether it's organic, whether it's with a partner, whether it's equity relationships, whether it's technology partnerships. I think at this point in time, we're not going to single in on one way. We're going to find out what the opportunity is and what value is and then determine what's the best path to maximize and optimize values."

            "name": "Kevin Mitchell",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Hello, everyone. Starting with an overview on Slide four, we summarize our third quarter results. We reported earnings of $402 million. Special items during the quarter amounted to an after-tax loss of $1 billion, which was largely comprised of an impairment of the Alliance Refinery. Excluding special items, we had adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion or $3.18 per share. We generated operating cash flow of $2.2 billion, including a working capital benefit of $776 million and cash distributions from equity affiliates of $905 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $552 million. $311 million, was for growth project, including a $150 million investment in Novonix. We paid $394 million in dividends. Moving to Slide 5. This slide shows the change in adjusted results from the second quarter to the third quarter. An increase of $1.1 billion with a substantial improvement in refining and continued strong contributions from Midstream, Chemicals and Marketing and Specialties. Our adjusted effective income tax rate was 16%. Slide 6 shows our midstream results. Third quarter adjusted pre -tax income was $642 million, an increase of $326 million from the previous quarter. Transportation contributed adjusted pre -tax income of $254 million, up $30 million from the prior quarter. The increase was driven by higher equity earnings from the Bakken and Gray Oak pipelines. NGL and other adjusted pre -tax income was $357 million, compared with $83 million in the second quarter. The increase was primarily due to a $224 million unrealized investment gain related to Novonix, as well as inventory impacts. In September, we acquired a 16% interest in Novonix. Our investment will be mark-to-market at the end of each reporting period. Sweeny Fractionation Complex, averaged their record, 383 thousand barrels per day in the Freeport LPG Export facility, loaded 41 cargoes in the third quarter. DCP midstream adjusted pre -tax income of $31 million, was up $22 million from the previous quarter, mainly due to improved margins and hedging impacts. Turning to chemicals on Slide 7. We delivered another strong quarter in chemicals with adjusted pre -tax income of $634 million down $23 million from the second quarter. Olefins and Polyolefins had record adjusted pre -tax income of $613 million. The $20 million increase from the previous quarter was primarily due to higher polyethylene sales volumes driven by continued strong demand, partially offset by higher utility costs. Global O&P utilization was 102% for the quarter. Adjusted pre -tax income for SA&S decreased $45 million compared to the second quarter, driven by lower margins, which began to normalize following tight market conditions. During the third quarter, we received $632 million in cash distributions from CPChem. Turning to refining on Slide eight, refining third quarter adjusted pre -tax income was $184 million, an improvement of $890 million from the second quarter, driven by higher realized margins across all regions. Realized margins for the quarter increased by 119% to $8.57 per barrel, primarily due to higher market crack spreads, lowering costs, and improved product differentials. Pre -tax turnaround costs were $81 million, down from $118 million in the prior quarter. Crude utilization was 86%, compared with 88% in the second quarter. Lower utilization reflects downtime at the Alliance Refinery, which was safely shutdown on August 28th in advance of Hurricane Ida. The third quarter clean product yield was 84% up 2% from last quarter, supported by improved FCC operations. Slide 9 covers market capture. The 3:2:1 market crack for the third quarter was $19.44 per barrel compared to $17.76 per barrel in the second quarter. Realized margin was $8.57 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 44%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 22%. Market capture is impacted by the configuration of our refineries. Our refineries are more heavily weighted towards distillate production than the market indicator. During the quarter of the distillate crack increased $1.55 per barrel in the gasoline crack improved $1.92 per barrel. Losses from secondary products of $1.98 per barrel improved. $0.40 per barrel from the previous quarter as NGL prices strengthened. Our feedstock advantage of $0.01 per barrel declined by $0.26 per barrel from the prior quarter. The other category reduced realized margins by $5.01 per barrel. This category includes RIN s, freight costs, lean product realizations, and inventory impacts. Moving to marketing and specialties on Slide 10, adjusted third quarter pre -tax income was $547 million compared with $479 million in the prior quarter. Our marketing business realized continued strong margins and so increasing demand for products. Marketing and other increased $62 million from the prior quarter this is primarily due to higher international margins and volumes driven by the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. Refined product exports in the third quarter were 209 thousand barrels per day. Specialties generated third quarter adjusted pre -tax income of $93 million up from $87 million in the prior quarter, largely due to improved base oil margins. On Slide 11, the corporate and other segment had adjusted pre -tax costs of $230 million, an improvement of $14 million from the prior quarter. This was primarily due to lower costs, related to the timing of environmental and employee-related expenses, partially offset by higher net interest expense. Slide 12 shows the change in cash for the quarter. We started the quarter with a $2.2 billion cash balance. Cash from operations was $2.2 billion. Excluding a working capital benefit of $776 million, our cash from operations was $1.4 billion, which covered $552 million of capital spend, $394 million for the dividend, and $500 million of early debt repayment. Our ending cash balance was $2.9 billion. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I will cover a few outlook items. In chemicals we expect the fourth-quarter global O and P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In refining, we expect the fourth quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low-80s. We expect the Alliance Refinery to remain shutdown for the full quarter. We expect fourth-quarter pretax turnaround expenses to be between $110 and $140 million. We anticipate fourth quarter corporate and other costs to come in between $240 and $250 million, pretax. Now we will open the line for questions. Good morning. No, I think you've covered it all up. Follow-up around reporting on a go-forward basis, as you know, as a fully consolidated entity, what you see today in our Midstream results reflects all of the MLP. Anyway, that's fully reflected in our Midstream segment results. But we have the cutback down below in non-controlling interest for the third-party public ownership. And so I want to -- once this transaction is closed, you will eliminate that non-controlling interest deduct from our bottom line results. So that's really how it's going to impact the reporting. No, I think you covered it all. I would say on debt reduction, we are anticipating doing another reduction between now and the end of the year, probably in the order of another $0.5 billion that we'll get in before the end of the year. Cushing inventory. When that happens, we need to keep crude in the U.S. and the best way to do that is to tighten the WTI - Brent differential. So we think it will stay in the $2 to $3 range going forward. So, we think by and large the market's setting up for a good Q4 and is certainly a good 2022. Yes, Theresa, it's Kevin. So PSX, we'll be taking a step-up in basis for tax purposes, which will result in additional tax depreciation. We actually get to benefit from bonus depreciation on that also. And so the net cash effect will be about $300 million in 2022 of -- think of it as reduced cash taxes paid. And then about another $100 million the following year. So in aggregate, it's about a $400 million cash benefit to Phillips 66. From an ongoing basis, the primary impact from a tax standpoint, excluding the impact of the step-up in basis, is going to be the tax that we will recognize on that, what today is shown as non-controlling interest, that becomes -- those become our earnings. They're taxable to us, and so we'll be taxed on that -- on the -- on those earnings that we get from the formerly -- the units formerly owned by the public. Yeah, Phil there is. There is actually an offset between working capital, accounts receivable and that deferred tax. So there's a re-classification on tax receivables, either short-term and into deferred. And so in effect, we've -- inflated the working capital benefits at the expense of, reducing the pre -working capital cash flow. That's in the order of $0.5 billion and so on a -- you can do the math on what that really looks like. Because in my mind, I think about the working -- the real working capital benefit being, inventory of about $300 million and then the rest is offset within the Cash Flow Statement. Yeah. So I think one of the real issues 2Q to 3Q and [Indiscernible] freeze effects and turnaround. [Indiscernible] so we had Ponca down for about 3 weeks because of the freeze. That was a significant hit to us last [Indiscernible] the outage at Wood River, which was another impairment to that. So a lot of that been [Indiscernible] When you start doing the math, when you don't run a lot of barrels last quarter, it tends to kind of, [Indiscernible] in-flight to some extent, on the other -- there's a RIN effect, obviously, in the other, also all combined. So a lot of additive things hit us all at once in the second quarter, in the Mid-Con that just aren't there now and I would classify our third quarter in Mid-Con as we ran well, and we ran normal. Yeah, Doug, specifically on the impairment. So with the hurricane and the damage sustained by the hurricane that gave us [Indiscernible] due a fair value analysis around that. And so as a result of that work and that analysis, we took a $1.3 billion pre -tax resulting carrying value of about 200 once we have taken that impairment and that reflects the mission that's in today. Yeah. I think on their point, we continue, [Indiscernible] particularly significant electrical system that hit it, and we have been painstakingly working our way through the assessment of how do you restore operations there. So that will continue as we continue to, as we announced before, seek buyers for the facility. And then we continue to work with those third parties to see what the actual outcome the Alliance Refinery is. It is too soon to make that call as to will it operate as a refinery again or in some other capacity, either for us or somebody else. How many questions was that? In terms of the synergies associated with the rollout, it's pretty small in the big scheme of things. Now coming clearly, there are some there's some corporate costs, there's the fact that PSXP as a public entity and all the associated costs that go with that will disappear, and so there will be a modest impact, but it's not anything that's going to move the needle when you step back and look at our consolidated financial results. From the standpoint of leverage and debt levels, we already had all of that MLP debt on our consolidated balance sheet. And so as Greg talked, pre -pandemic debt levels that we're trying -- included PSXP, that as well. Until it [Indiscernible] really change anything, in terms of how we think about our go-forward leverage objectives. The roll-up does give us a little bit more flexibility though, because one, we have access to all of the cash, that previously either was distributed to the LP [Indiscernible] Distributions or was excess cash, excess coverage cash becomes available to us for debt reduction, and we also have the PSXP debt available as we think of the options around paying dying debt we have the PSXP debt to consider in that context as well. So just give us a bit more flexibility. I'll take [Indiscernible]. Brian talked about retail plans. So we provided for every dollar change in million BTU net gas price, about $150 million a year across our [Indiscernible] fleet. And you can think about that as about $100 million of that is pure natural gas, and the other $50 million comes through in electricity and steam purchases. Of the 100 million, then it's about global cost line and in the third quarter it is in cost of goods sold, primarily natural gas that we buy to turn into hydrogen. So that's without any mitigating steps within the refining system. Obviously, a lot of refineries have the ability to fuel propane and a little bit of butane and really, the economics to the day we'll drive what we decide to do there. We've also got the novel of turning up severity on cat cracker and making more gas. So there's a lot of moving parts into that sensitivity, but the simplest way to think about it is just 1 block is a $150 million a year. So we can call that $35 million or so a quarter. Yeah, Ryan, Kevin. What we're trying to balance here is first priority is to protect the credit ratings of the A3 BBB-plus credit ratings, strong investment grade. We want to maintain those ratings. And part of getting there is, in the Balance Sheet back to where it was, but it's also a function of cash-generation at mid-cycle or thereabouts levels. And so I think that once we are -- as we're already making good progress on debt reduction. And when we're in that position of we're clearly back in a mid-cycle type environment. We're generating mid-cycle cash flow. There's a very clear line of sight to the ability to continue to reduce debt down to the levels we want to get to. We should have more flexibility to start thinking about the [Indiscernible] The way to $12 billion before we think about alternatives, as long as the cash-generation is there that we can clearly see our ability to deliver continue to deliver, and consider some of the alternatives around capital allocation. It's always hard to call because we -- invariably, when we make a prediction, we get it wrong. But things seem to be shaping up to be somewhere at least close to mid-cycle. And I think the 1 composition that's not there right now are the crude differentials. So we're still lagging on heavy crude differentials. But there's some light at the end of the tunnel on that as well as we start to see OPEC putting more barrels back into the market. So we could see that start to come back in our favor. But that is probably what's keeping us being a little -- maybe a little bit behind mid-cycle at this point in time, but I opened up to --"

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jeff Dietert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Jeff, you may begin.\nJeff Dietert: Good afternoon and welcome to Phillips 66 Partners Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Participants on today's call will include Kevin Mitchell, Vice President and CFO; Tim Roberts, Vice President and COO and Casey Gorder, General Manager, Operations. Today's presentation materials can be found on the Events section of the Phillips 66 Partners website, along with supplemental financial and operating information. Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement. We will be making forward-looking statements during today's presentations and our Q&A session. Actual results may differ materially from today's comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here as well as in our SEC filings. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin.\nKevin Mitchell: Thank you, Jeff and good afternoon, everyone. In the second quarter, Phillips 66 Partners delivered solid financial results and reliable operating performance across the business. Our earnings reflect higher throughput on our wholly owned and joint venture assets. During the quarter we advanced our capital program, to continue construction of the C2G pipeline connecting the Clemens storage Caverns to petrochemical facilities in the Corpus Christi area. The pipeline is expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of this year. The Bakken pipeline optimization project continues to progress with the next phase of incremental capacity commencing service this month. The C2G pipeline and the Bakken pipeline are both supported by long term commitments. In July, the Board of Directors approved the second quarter distribution of $0.875 per common unit, unchanged from the first quarter of 2021. Phillips 66 Partners remains committed to safe, reliable operations, a strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation. Moving to slide 4 to discuss financial results. Phillips 66 Partners reported second quarter earnings of $225 million compared with a first quarter loss of $18 million. Our first quarter results include a $198 million impairment resulting from the partnerships decision to exit the Liberty pipeline project. Adjusted EBITDA was $337 million this quarter, an increase of $48 million from the prior quarter. The improvement in earnings and adjusted EBITDA reflect higher volumes and lower utility costs following the first quarter winter storms, as well as higher pipeline and terminal volumes due to increase utilization Phillips 66 operated refineries. Second quarter of distributable cash flow was $267 million, up $34 million from the prior quarter. The increase reflects improved earnings, which are partly offset by higher maintenance capital in the second quarter. Slide 5 highlights our financial flexibility and liquidity. We ended the second quarter with $2 million of cash and $734 million available under our revolving credit facility. We funded $44 million of growth capital during the quarter. This included spends on the C2G pipeline and funding for the Bakken pipeline optimization project. The debt to EBITDA ratio on a revolver covenant basis was 3.0, which is consistent with a target to remain below 3.5. Our distribution coverage ratio was 1.34. In April, repaid $60 million of tax exempt bonds and borrowed $450 million under a new term loan agreement. Proceeds were primarily used to repay amounts borrowed under the partnerships revolving credit facility. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse.\nSpiro Dounis: Hey, Anthony and team. Kevin, you're generally not in the practice of providing firm guidance but was hoping maybe to help frame what the second half of the year might look like relative to the first half. We'll just be helpful to hear your thoughts on the macro environment. Maybe any specific drivers performance as we add here into the second half?\nKevin Mitchell: Yes, Spiro. I think Tim's going to make a few comments on that.\nTim Roberts: Yes. Spiro. With regard to the macros, I mean, obviously the first quarter was impacted by and one there's a seasonal element coupled with the fact that you had there winter storms. So as things were picked up and there is been a recovery in the overall market from COVID we've benefited clearly in 2Q with regard to refining utilization. And then also we've seen some increasing production out in the basins. I mean, nothing too extreme. But nonetheless, you are seeing a normalization going on as demand is picking up globally. We would expect that to continue through the third quarter. And then through the fourth quarter, obviously there are some elements that you see some seasonality. But generally speaking, second quarter moving into third quarter we feel very constructive, especially as demand continues to pick up globally.\nSpiro Dounis: Great, Kim, thanks for that. Second question is just around capital return. Seeing some peers now start to re commence distribution growth and formalize and buyback programs just given that that stabilization in the macro outlook. So I'm just curious how you guys are describe your capital return goals as we say here today, what you sort of need to see first, either reconvince distribution growth or initiate a buyback program and buyback specifically, we're seeing some peers buyback at ECF levels or yields of around 11%, PSXP, of course trading north of that right now, sort of imagine that scene is attractive, but I'm sure you've got duration there that will be helpful to sort of lay out.\nKevin Mitchell: Yes Spiro. As you look at the overall capital allocation priorities, it really all comes down to how we manage coverage and leverage. So from a, in terms of the committed outflows, we've got the maintenance capital which that's going to continue. So this year, I think that maintenance capital budget is $135 million or so. And I don't anticipate that being dramatically different as you look into future years, the growth capital this year, the budgets $165 million. That's as there's more limited opportunities than we've had historically or in the earlier years of the MLP and that probably continues to be relatively low compared to historical levels. But at the same time, you look at where we are from a coverage standpoint this quarter 1.34, which, for PSXP is quite strong. But in overall, the overall scheme of things that doesn't actually give you that much flexibility. I think, and one of the reasons it was strong in the second quarter is because we had a lower maintenance capital. So you can revert to some of the more normal maintenance capital in absolute dollar terms that's maybe $50 million, a quarter of coverage to basically fund growth capital and then whatever other discretionary uses of capital you may have out there. So I don't think there is a lot of room to do much for a period of time, at least beyond some modest amounts of growth capital within the sort of overall construct of the available cash that we have available.\nSpiro Dounis: Got it. That\u2019s a super covered. Thanks for that Kevin. All right, thanks.\nKevin Mitchell: Thanks Spiro.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum: Good afternoon. I want to maybe stay on these topics. Can you just maybe expand a little bit on your comments on growth capital? Do you see any either large or small potential projects on the horizon whether it kind of nature of those and if the answer is not really then I just love your latest thoughts on just how you view the MLP within the structure of Philips family if there really isn't a need to finance any growth in midstream. Thanks.\nKevin Mitchell: Yes. I think that you'll see continued, I'll call them optimization projects around the existing infrastructures. PSXP is a really nice portfolio of assets. And they will continue to be opportunities to invest around those. They tend to be relatively small projects, but they also tend to be very attractive economics. And so we'll continue to do that. Given where, if you just step back and look at the sort of macro midstream environment, where generally there is the sort of major pieces of infrastructure are already in place to feed the needs of the right there. So I think it's much less likely that you're going to see significant investment in organic growth projects. So I think it's going to be more continuation of some of these smaller optimization type projects from that standpoint. Tim do you have any other perspective on that?\nTim Roberts: I think you've covered it. To give us a little bit of context on the smaller projects, Michael is going to be at one of our sites, maybe on [indiscernible] and we may have to add 10 miles of pipe. We had a storage tank in some of our terminals, we may add truck racks. But that's the type of scope we're talking about as far as the incremental optimization opportunities.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Mackay with Goldman Sachs.\nJohn Mackay: Hey, everyone, thanks for the time. I just wanted to follow up on part of Michael's question that didn't quite get an answer there. I think just curious if you can spend a minute or two talking about how PSX is looking at PSXP from a strategic standpoint here and kind of what the outlook there could be?\nKevin Mitchell: Well, I think given that this is a PSXP call, I think all we can do is we iterate what we've said in the past and in reference to the 13-D filing that was done, I think must be coming up to a year ago. Now it was about a year ago. And that was basically gave PSX the flexibility to consider alternatives around the path forward for the MLP. But it certainly does not obligate any particular decisions or path forward. And I think we just leave it at that, those statements still hold true that the 13-D gives the PSX flexibility to consider alternatives. But there is really no more to say on that at this point.\nJohn Mackay: I think it feels like a year, that would have been like six months ago. But that's fine like on -- maybe just one smaller one, just in terms of the smaller projects that could come up. I'm just thinking in terms of messaging. Are these things that you guys expect to kind of keep talking about in releases or the kind of thing where, hey, if we don't start to see something in next couple of releases, maybe it looks like 2022 CapEx could be a lot lower?\nKevin Mitchell: Yes. Look, I think it does depend on the size of the project. It's hard for us with regard to a release to be talking about maybe a $3 million project. So I would say it depends on what the size of the project would be. I mean some of these, if you're adding a pipeline or pipe, some stub a lateral onto an existing pipe with some tanks. I mean, you can get up into the 10s of millions of dollars there, but not 100s of millions of dollars. So depending on where that is and it's hard for me to give you that cut off, it feels material that PSXP obviously, we would have some sort of release but certainly during earnings calls or even in our Qs we'll talk about projects that are underway or projects that most projects are underway or are being completed.\nJohn Mackay: That makes sense. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good afternoon.\nKevin Mitchell: Hi Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: I just want to start with the DAPL expansion there. Wondering if you might be able to provide some color as far as the first expansion come online, what was the cost for PSXP on that? What type of capacity was coming online with this first expansion here? And are there any regulatory approvals that are needed to put that capacity in service?\nKevin Mitchell: Yes, Jeremy, thanks. Good question. So yes the expansion takes capacity up to around 750,000 barrels a day. The spending relative to PSXP in 2021 is a little bit under $550 million. We think that through next year we'll be at kind of $325 million or so is kind of a capital number. That's where we kind of zero on the capital invested front.\nTim Roberts: And on the regulatory approvals, those have already been received. So nothing outstanding at this point in time.\nKevin Mitchell: Starting up this month. \nTim Roberts: Yes. That [indiscernible] capability and permissioning and it started --\nJeremy Tonet: That's very helpful. Thanks to that. And then with the C2G pipeline here being perspective is tied to the [indiscernible] cracker or just any other drivers to that timeline shift?\nKevin Mitchell: No, it's really weather related was the timeline shift. And we've said all along that the real kind of commercial in service date would be year end. And then there may be some potential to flow some barrels North bound between kind of mechanical completion and commercial in service at the end of the year. With weather delays that window for kind of North bound volumes has narrowed. But I think we said last quarter, we didn't expect those to be material anyway and still wouldn't expect them to be material. So no change to the ultimate in service date of the larger project or the NBCs underpinning that project.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks. And last one, if I could sneak it in. It seems like the midstream landscape has changed a bit. And there has been maybe a little bit more activity on the M&A side particularly as it relates to liquids, logistics, terminals, what have you. Just wondering, I guess PSXP's thoughts on consolidation, the midstream sector at all, if there's any thought you want to share there.\nKevin Mitchell: I think Jeremy, you've probably heard us say in the past that we do think that if you just take a sort of big picture, view that across [Technical Difficulty] and so there's a lot of players out there in midstream. And I think part of one of the impediments to more consolidation or at least easier consolidation is just the capital structure across the midstream space with so many of these MLPs with different governance models which I think precludes some of that potentially happening. But ultimately, I think for the mid stream business to compete well, it needs to be, there needs to be some consolidation, we drive efficiencies, shut down idle plants and leverage the infrastructure that's available and create some value that way.\nOperator: We have reached the end of today's call. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff. \nJeff Dietert: Thank you for your interest in Phillips 66 Partners. Please give Shannon or me a call if you have any follow up questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Jeff Dietert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Jeff, you may begin.\nJeff Dietert: Good afternoon and welcome to Phillips 66 Partners First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Participants on today's call will include Kevin Mitchell, Vice President and CFO; Tim Roberts, Vice President and COO and Casey Gorder, General Manager, Operations. Today's presentation materials can be found on the Events section of the Phillips 66 Partners website, along with supplemental financial and operating information. Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement. We will be looking, making forward-looking statements during today's presentations and our Q&A session. Actual results may differ materially from today's comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here as well as in our SEC filings. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin.\nKevin Mitchell: Thank you, Jeff and good afternoon, everyone. In the first quarter, Phillips 66 Partners delivered safe, reliable operations despite the challenging operating conditions. Our results reflect winter storm impacts and the partnership's decision to exit the Liberty Pipeline project. We continue to execute our capital program during the quarter. We advanced construction of the C2G Pipeline and the South Texas Gateway Terminal was completed. These assets are supported by long-term customer commitments. The Board of Directors approved a first quarter distribution of $0.875 per common unit unchanged from the fourth quarter 2020. Moving on to slide 4 to discuss financial results. Phillips 66 Partners reported a first quarter loss of $18 million compared with earnings of $104 million in the fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily due to $198 million impairment related to the partnership's decision to exit the Liberty Pipeline project, compared with impairments of $96 million in the prior quarter. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $289 million, down $29 million from the fourth quarter. The partnership's wholly owned and joint venture assets have reduced volumes and higher utility costs in the first quarter. This was largely due to the winter storms impacting the central and Gulf Coast regions. First quarter distributable cash flow was $233 million, down $7 million from the prior quarter. The decrease reflects lower earnings due to the winter storms, partially offset by lower maintenance CapEx in the first quarter. Slide 5 highlights our financial flexibility and liquidity. We ended the first quarter with $3 million of cash and $299 million available under our revolving credit facility. We funded $52 million of growth capital during the quarter. This included spend on the C2G Pipeline and investment in South Texas Gateway Terminal. The debt to EBITDA ratio on a revolver covenant basis was 3.2, which is consistent with our target to remain below 3.5. Our distribution coverage ratio was 1.17. On April 1st, we repaid $50 million of tax exempt bonds. Also in April, the partnership borrowed $450 million under a new term loan agreement. Proceeds were primarily used to repay amounts borrowed under the partnerships revolving credit facility. Before turning the call over to Casey, I'll provide an update on Dakota Access Pipeline. We recognized there is ongoing uncertainty associated with the litigation. The pipeline continues normal operations during the legal proceedings. At a hearing on April 9, the Army Corps of Engineers indicated that they will not seek a shutdown of the pipeline and instead will leave the matter to DC federal district court. That court is currently considering whether to grant the plaintiffs motion to shut down the pipeline, while the Corps completes its environmental impact statement. That decision could come at any time. The economic implications of any shutdown, while the legal process plays out extend beyond the pipeline owners to producers, Tribal Nations, customers, state and local governments, consumers and workers throughout the energy value chain. Dakota Access pipeline has a history of safe operations and we believe it should be allowed to operate while the litigation continues. Phillips 66 Partners remains focused on operating excellence, strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation. Now, Casey will provide an update on our growth projects.\nCasey Gorder: Thanks, Kevin and hello everyone. Moving on to slide 6, I'll provide an update on our major projects, which continued to progress during the quarter. The South Texas Gateway Terminal commissioned additional storage, bringing total capacity to 8.6 million barrels. This completes the final construction phase. In addition, the terminal has up to 800,000 barrels per day of export capacity. Phillips 66 Partners owns a 25% interest in the terminal. We continued construction of the C2G Pipeline connecting the Clemens storage Caverns to petrochemical facilities in the Corpus Christi area. We finished pipeline construction and the facilities construction is ongoing. The project is backed by long-term commitments and is expected to be completed in mid-2021. In addition, we continue to develop low capital, high return projects that optimize our existing portfolio of assets. These quick win opportunities enable us to meet customer demand, while maintaining capital discipline. This concludes our prepared remarks, we will now open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Theresa Chen from Barclays.\nTheresa Chen: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Kevin, I wanted to go back to your comments about Dakota Access and regarding the situation here. Can you just walk us through your expectations on the next steps in the legal process including the recent appeal to the Supreme Court and your expected timeline on this?\nKevin Mitchell: Yes, so the next steps here are that sort of Judge Forsberg issued an order asking the Army Corp Engineers to update its latest estimate for completion of the EIS. And also for the Corp to provide its position if it has one and whether an injunction should be issued. So the judge requested the Corp come back to the court next week on that. And so that's really the next potential for that to be some kind of new statement is from some point next week onwards. I think consistent with what we said in the past, I think regardless of the outcome of what happens next, we believe this legal process is just going to continue progressing. So I still think there's actually quite a bit of uncertainty around DAPL despite our views that it should continue to operate and we've been consistent in that from the beginning. I still think there's a fair amount of uncertainty around that. I think the appeal that you were referring to was the appeal by Dakota Access to the appellate court for a rehearing that was turned down. So that request for appeal was denied. And so really what we're left with is the Federal District Court Judge Forsberg and his request for the court to come back next week.\nTheresa Chen: Okay. I guess in relation to the updated language in their recent Schedule 13D, can you talk about your thought process about the partnership as a viable standalone entity over the long-term. And if this is contingent on the DAPL outcome or do you view these two events as completely independent of one another?\nKevin Mitchell: Yes. And so that's really a -- that was a PSXP filing, but really by PSX as an owner of PSXP. And if so from a sponsor standpoint what that filing does is provide PSX with flexibility to consider alternatives around its ownership and possible actions it may want to do and stay consistent within the SEC regulations. The previous 13B that was out there at [indiscernible] from IPO and so that's the first time that there has been a change in that status. And so really what it does, it just give PSX flexibility to consider alternatives around that. It doesn't mean to say anything is going to happen, but at least it provides that flexibility, but I do think that as you step back and look at the sort of MLP landscape, a lot has changed over the last seven, eight years or so, which is the duration of PSXP. And so we're now in a position where there is a lot less midstream growth opportunities out there in this environment we're in. You've also lost that cost of capital advantage that usually present at the MLP. And so the sort of ability to fund through equity is a lot more challenged and on a relative basis when the cost of capital advantage isn\u2019t there, it's just harder to justify projects at the MLP versus say the sponsor doing project themselves. So it just puts more of a question mark around that. I wouldn't really tie that to DAPL. DAPL is an added uncertainty for the MLP obviously, but I don't think that the DAPL on its own is going to drive any specific decisions around that.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse.\nSpiro Dounis: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Kevin, if you could maybe just pick up on that question a bit and maybe I'll ask it differently. I guess if we could imagine for a second that we're beyond Apple has been resolved, let's call it mostly back to normal. Just curious what your priorities are in that environment and where you think and you're focusing your time, you entered it a bit there, but just curious how important it is for PSXP to be a growth vehicle again here in the near-term. I think I heard on the PSX call, it sound like the focus for the next few years is going to be deleveraging, harvesting that cash flow, I think you mentioned obviously the environment is not conducive to growth right now. And so I'm just curious, is that more or less the sort of track that PSXP is going to follow as well?\nKevin Mitchell: Yes, I think it's natural to assume that what is being said at the PSX level around growth and growth in midstream is going to have a knock-on effect at the MLP. And so you look at where PSX today capital program, midstream has $300 million of growth capital, of which half of that is the MLP. And so compare that to the previous few years, that's a dramatic fall off and there is multiple reasons for that, but specifically the opportunities for a lot of those large-scale projects are no longer there. And so I just think that's going to shape the trajectory of the MLP into the future as well until we see some sort of dramatic change in the overall sector that will provide for attractive growth opportunities.\nSpiro Dounis: Understood. Appreciate the color there. Second one just on C2G, looks like start-up still on track for mid-2021, but I know you guys have mentioned in the past that the contract, cash flows, they really don't start to show up until early 2022, as I realize there is something hard to guide to, but is there anything stopping you from marketing [indiscernible] pipeline until the contract commences?\nCasey Gorder: Yes, this is Casey. No, there's not and there may be some volumes in advance of that beginning of 2022 start-up of the kind of major contract on the asset, but we expect them to be hugely material either.\nSpiro Dounis: Understood. That's all I had. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Mackay with Goldman Sachs.\nJohn Mackay: Hey, everyone. Thanks for the time. Just wanted to circle up on that growth question. Understand growth coming down across the space, also understand the kind of cost of capital headwind for PSXP, we also had PSX kind of announcing it starting to move forward, they got on track for, just curious if that's something that if you guys are thinking about moving down to the partnership at any point?\nKevin Mitchell: Yes, I don't think so at this point. You will see that Frac 1 sits at the MLP over the course of the last two years or so PSX has completed Fracs 2 and 3. And I know originally a Frac 4 was as a quick follow on behind those two. We -- PSX made the decision to suspend that given all the uncertainty last year in terms of trying to reduce its capital spending outlays and made the statement this morning that we'd anticipate going back to that second half of this year, but I think at this point it's reasonable to assume that's where it's going to reside, PSX will.\nJohn Mackay: All right. Got it. Thank you. Maybe just one follow-up. Curious on the term loan, so matures in a year, it's a little bit different from what we normally see from you, just curious of that getting a little bit more liquidity ahead of a DAPL announcement or if there is anything else going on there?\nKevin Mitchell: Yes, the primary objective there was, we had been running, we've been doing in and out of the revolver up to that sort of $400 million, $500 million level periodically. And so we decided to term some of that out, although still relatively short term, which gives us plenty of flexibility and it frees up liquidity on the revolver for whatever means we might need it. It's just when you have a revolver that's a $750 million revolver and if you're periodically getting into sort of two-third of that capacity, then you're dramatically reducing the available liquidity potentially at times when you might need it the most. And so we just felt it was the prudent thing to do to recreate that liquidity capacity.\nJohn Mackay: Understood. That's it from me. Thank you.\nOperator: We have reached the end of today's call. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.\nJeff Dietert: Thank you for your interest in Phillips 66 Partners. If you have any further questions, please call Shannon or me. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Jeff and good afternoon, everyone. In the first quarter, Phillips 66 Partners delivered safe, reliable operations despite the challenging operating conditions. Our results reflect winter storm impacts and the partnership's decision to exit the Liberty Pipeline project. We continue to execute our capital program during the quarter. We advanced construction of the C2G Pipeline and the South Texas Gateway Terminal was completed. These assets are supported by long-term customer commitments. The Board of Directors approved a first quarter distribution of $0.875 per common unit unchanged from the fourth quarter 2020. Moving on to slide 4 to discuss financial results. Phillips 66 Partners reported a first quarter loss of $18 million compared with earnings of $104 million in the fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily due to $198 million impairment related to the partnership's decision to exit the Liberty Pipeline project, compared with impairments of $96 million in the prior quarter. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $289 million, down $29 million from the fourth quarter. The partnership's wholly owned and joint venture assets have reduced volumes and higher utility costs in the first quarter. This was largely due to the winter storms impacting the central and Gulf Coast regions. First quarter distributable cash flow was $233 million, down $7 million from the prior quarter. The decrease reflects lower earnings due to the winter storms, partially offset by lower maintenance CapEx in the first quarter. Slide 5 highlights our financial flexibility and liquidity. We ended the first quarter with $3 million of cash and $299 million available under our revolving credit facility. We funded $52 million of growth capital during the quarter. This included spend on the C2G Pipeline and investment in South Texas Gateway Terminal. The debt to EBITDA ratio on a revolver covenant basis was 3.2, which is consistent with our target to remain below 3.5. Our distribution coverage ratio was 1.17. On April 1st, we repaid $50 million of tax exempt bonds. Also in April, the partnership borrowed $450 million under a new term loan agreement. Proceeds were primarily used to repay amounts borrowed under the partnerships revolving credit facility. Before turning the call over to Casey, I'll provide an update on Dakota Access Pipeline. We recognized there is ongoing uncertainty associated with the litigation. The pipeline continues normal operations during the legal proceedings. At a hearing on April 9, the Army Corps of Engineers indicated that they will not seek a shutdown of the pipeline and instead will leave the matter to DC federal district court. That court is currently considering whether to grant the plaintiffs motion to shut down the pipeline, while the Corps completes its environmental impact statement. That decision could come at any time. The economic implications of any shutdown, while the legal process plays out extend beyond the pipeline owners to producers, Tribal Nations, customers, state and local governments, consumers and workers throughout the energy value chain. Dakota Access pipeline has a history of safe operations and we believe it should be allowed to operate while the litigation continues. Phillips 66 Partners remains focused on operating excellence, strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation. Now, Casey will provide an update on our growth projects. Yes, so the next steps here are that sort of Judge Forsberg issued an order asking the Army Corp Engineers to update its latest estimate for completion of the EIS. And also for the Corp to provide its position if it has one and whether an injunction should be issued. So the judge requested the Corp come back to the court next week on that. And so that's really the next potential for that to be some kind of new statement is from some point next week onwards. I think consistent with what we said in the past, I think regardless of the outcome of what happens next, we believe this legal process is just going to continue progressing. So I still think there's actually quite a bit of uncertainty around DAPL despite our views that it should continue to operate and we've been consistent in that from the beginning. I still think there's a fair amount of uncertainty around that. I think the appeal that you were referring to was the appeal by Dakota Access to the appellate court for a rehearing that was turned down. So that request for appeal was denied. And so really what we're left with is the Federal District Court Judge Forsberg and his request for the court to come back next week. Yes. And so that's really a -- that was a PSXP filing, but really by PSX as an owner of PSXP. And if so from a sponsor standpoint what that filing does is provide PSX with flexibility to consider alternatives around its ownership and possible actions it may want to do and stay consistent within the SEC regulations. The previous 13B that was out there at [indiscernible] from IPO and so that's the first time that there has been a change in that status. And so really what it does, it just give PSX flexibility to consider alternatives around that. It doesn't mean to say anything is going to happen, but at least it provides that flexibility, but I do think that as you step back and look at the sort of MLP landscape, a lot has changed over the last seven, eight years or so, which is the duration of PSXP.

DAPL is an added uncertainty for the MLP obviously, but I don't think that the DAPL on its own is going to drive any specific decisions around that. Yes, I think it's natural to assume that what is being said at the PSX level around growth and growth in midstream is going to have a knock-on effect at the MLP. And so you look at where PSX today capital program, midstream has $300 million of growth capital, of which half of that is the MLP. And so compare that to the previous few years, that's a dramatic fall off and there is multiple reasons for that, but specifically the opportunities for a lot of those large-scale projects are no longer there. And so I just think that's going to shape the trajectory of the MLP into the future as well until we see some sort of dramatic change in the overall sector that will provide for attractive growth opportunities. Yes, I don't think so at this point. You will see that Frac 1 sits at the MLP over the course of the last two years or so PSX has completed Fracs 2 and 3. And I know originally a Frac 4 was as a quick follow on behind those two.

            "content": "Thanks, Kevin and hello everyone. Moving on to slide 6, I'll provide an update on our major projects, which continued to progress during the quarter. The South Texas Gateway Terminal commissioned additional storage, bringing total capacity to 8.6 million barrels. This completes the final construction phase. In addition, the terminal has up to 800,000 barrels per day of export capacity. Phillips 66 Partners owns a 25% interest in the terminal. We continued construction of the C2G Pipeline connecting the Clemens storage Caverns to petrochemical facilities in the Corpus Christi area. We finished pipeline construction and the facilities construction is ongoing. The project is backed by long-term commitments and is expected to be completed in mid-2021. In addition, we continue to develop low capital, high return projects that optimize our existing portfolio of assets. These quick win opportunities enable us to meet customer demand, while maintaining capital discipline. This concludes our prepared remarks, we will now open the line for questions. Yes, this is Casey. No, there's not and there may be some volumes in advance of that beginning of 2022 start-up of the kind of major contract on the asset, but we expect them to be hugely material either."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.  I will now turn the call over to Jeff Dieter, Vice President of Investor Relations. Jeff, you may begin.\nJeff Dietert : Good morning, and welcome to Phillips 66 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Participants on today's call will include Mark Lashier, President and CEO; Kevin Mitchell, CFO; and Brian Mandell, Marketing and Commercial; Tim Roberts, Midstream and Chemicals; and Rich Harbison, Refining. Today's presentation material can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website, along with supplemental financial and operating information. Slide 2 contains our safe harbor statement. We will be making forward-looking statements during today's call. Actual results may differ materially from today's comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here as well as in our SEC filings.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Lashier : Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. In the fourth quarter, we had adjusted earnings of $1.9 billion or $4 per share. We generated $4.8 billion in operating cash flow. For the year, adjusted earnings were $8.9 billion or $18.79 per share. Our diversified integrated portfolio generated strong earnings and cash flow in 2022, supported by a favorable market environment and solid operations. Our cash flow generation allowed us to strengthen our financial position by repaying debt and resuming our share repurchase program. We returned $3.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.  We continue to focus on operating excellence and advancing our strategic priorities to deliver on our vision of providing energy and improving lives as we meet global demand. In Midstream, we continue integrating DCP Midstream to unlock significant synergies and growth opportunities across our NGL wellhead to market value chain. Additionally, we completed Frac 4 at the Sweeny Hub, adding 150,000 barrels per day. Our total Sweeny Hub fractionation capacity is 550,000 barrels per day, making it the largest fraction -- or the second largest fractionation hub in the U.S. In Chemicals, CPChem is pursuing a portfolio of high-return projects, enhancing its asset base as well as optimizing its existing operations. This includes construction of a second world scale unit to produce one hexene in Old Ocean, Texas, and the expansion of propylene splitting capacity at its Cedar buying facility. Both projects are expected to start up in the second half of 2023. CPChem and Qatar Energy announced final investment decisions to construct petrochemical facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast Ras Laffan, Qatar. CPChem will have a 51% interest in the $8.5 billion integrated polymers facility on the U.S. Gulf Coast. The Golden Triangle Polymers facility will include a 4.6 billion pounds per year ethane cracker and two high-density polyethylene units with a combined capacity of 4.4 billion pounds per year. Operations are expected to begin in 2026.  In January, the Ras Laffan petrochemical project was approved. CPChem will own a 30% interest in the $6 billion integrated Polymers complex. The plant will include a 4.6 billion pounds per year ethane cracker and two high-density polyethylene units with a total capacity of 3.7 billion pounds per year. Start-up is expected in late 2026.  In Refining, we're converting our San Francisco refinery into one of the world's largest renewable fuels facilities. The Rodeo Renewed project is on track to begin commercial operations in the first quarter of 2024. Upon completion, Rodeo will have over 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuels production capacity. At our Investor Day, we announced priorities to reward Phillips 66 shareholders now and in the future. We're holding ourselves accountable, and we know that you are as well.  Slide 4 summarizes our progress. We are delivering returns to shareholders. Since July 2022, we've returned $2.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We're on track to meet our target return of $10 billion to $12 billion by year-end 2024. In January, we reached an agreement to acquire all of the publicly held common units of DCP Midstream.  We expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2023, at which point, we will have an 87% economic interest in DCP Midstream. The increase in our economic interest from 28%, prior to the third quarter transaction, is expected to generate an incremental $1.3 billion of adjusted EBITDA, including commercial and operating synergies.  We're executing our business transformation. The team achieved savings in excess of $500 million on an annualized basis at the end of 2022, setting us up well for 2023. This includes cost reductions of over $300 million, mostly related to reducing headcount by over 1,100 positions during the year as we redesigned and streamlined our organization.  In addition, our 2023 capital program includes a $200 million reduction of sustaining capital. We're transforming to a sustainable lower cost business model and expect to deliver $1 billion of annualized savings by year-end 2023. We're laser-focused on executing these strategic priorities to deliver returns and increase distributions in a competitive and sustainable way. We look forward to updating you on our progress.  Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results.\nKevin Mitchell : Thank you, Mark. Starting with an overview on Slide 5, we summarize our financial results for the year. Adjusted earnings were $8.9 billion or $18.79 per share. The $442 million decrease in the fair value of our investment in NOVONIX reduced earnings per share by $0.71. We generated $10.8 billion of operating cash flow. Cash distributions from equity affiliates were $1.7 billion, including $574 million from CPChem. We ended 2022 with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 24%. Our adjusted after-tax return on capital employed for the year was 22%.  Slide 6 shows the change in cash during the year. We started the year with $3.1 billion in cash and generated record cash flow during the year. Cash from operations was $10.8 billion. We received net loan repayments from equity affiliates of $590 million. During the year, we paid down $2.4 billion of debt. This includes $430 million of debt paid down by DCP Midstream since we began consolidating effective August '18. We funded $2.2 billion of capital spending and returned $3.3 billion to shareholders, including $1.5 billion of share repurchases. The other category includes the redemption of DCP Midstream's Series A preferred units of $500 million. Our ending cash balance increased by $3 billion to $6.1 billion.  Slide 7 summarizes our fourth quarter results. Adjusted earnings were $1.9 billion, or $4 per share. The $11 million decrease in the fair value of our investment in NOVONIX reduced earnings per share by $0.02. We generated operating cash flow of $4.8 billion, including a working capital benefit of $2.1 billion and cash distributions from equity affiliates of $261 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $713 million, including $310 million for growth projects. We returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through $456 million of dividends and $753 million of share repurchases. We ended the quarter with 466 million shares outstanding. Moving to Slide 8. This slide highlights the change in adjusted results by segment from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. During the period, adjusted earnings decreased $1.2 billion mostly due to lower results in Refining and Marketing and Specialties.  In the fourth quarter, we made certain changes to the composition and reporting of our operating segment results. Our slides reflect these changes and prior period results have been recast for comparative purposes. The 2022 and 2021 quarterly information has been recast and is included in our supplemental information.  Slide 9 shows our Midstream results. Fourth quarter adjusted pretax income was $674 million compared with $608 million in the previous quarter. Transportation contributed to adjusted pretax income of $237 million, up $8 million from the prior quarter. NGL and Other adjusted pretax income was $448 million compared to $412 million in the third quarter. The increase was primarily due to record fractionation volumes as well as a full quarter of consolidating DCP Midstream, Sand Hills Pipeline and Southern Hills pipeline. The fractionators at the Sweeny Hub averaged a record 565,000 barrels per day, reflecting the start-up of Frac 4 at the end of the third quarter. The Freeport LPG export facility loaded a record 271,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter.  Our NOVONIX investment is mark-to-market each quarter. The fair value of the investment, including foreign exchange impacts, decreased $11 million in the fourth quarter compared with a decrease of $33 million in the third quarter. Turning to Chemicals on Slide 10. Chemicals at fourth quarter adjusted pretax income of $52 million compared with $135 million in the previous quarter. The decrease was mainly due to lower margins and volumes partially offset by decreased utility costs and the impact of legal accruals in the third quarter. Global olefins and polyolefins utilization was 83% for the quarter, reflecting planned turnaround activities and the impact of the winter storm in December. Turning to Refining on Slide 11. Refining fourth quarter adjusted pretax income was $1.6 billion, down from $2.9 billion in the third quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower realized margins. Our realized margins decreased by 27% to $19.73per barrel, while the composite 3 to 1 re-adjusted market crack decreased by 16%. Turnaround costs were $236 million. Crude utilization was 91% in the fourth quarter and clean product yield was 86%.  Slide 12 covers market capture. We are now using a composite 3 to 1 in adjusted market crack to be more consistent with peers and more comparable to our realized margin. The 3 to 1 rent-adjusted market crack for the fourth quarter was $23.50 per barrel compared to $28.18 per barrel in the third quarter. Realized margin was $19.73 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 84%.  Market capture in the previous quarter was 95%. Market capture is impacted by the configuration of our refineries. We have a higher distillate yield and lower gasoline yield than the 3 to 1 market indicator. During the fourth quarter, the distillate crack increased $8 per barrel, and the gasoline crack decreased $10 per barrel. Losses from secondary products of $3.59 per barrel were $0.09 per barrel higher than the previous quarter. Our feedstock loss of $0.03 per barrel was $1.45 per barrel improved compared to the third quarter due to more favorable crude differentials. The other category improved realized margins by $0.46 per barrel. This category includes freight costs, clean product realizations and inventory impacts. Fourth quarter was $6.66 per barrel less than the previous quarter, primarily due to lower clean product realizations and inventory timing.  Moving to Marketing and Specialties on Slide 13. Adjusted fourth quarter pretax income was $539 million compared with $828 million in the prior quarter, mainly due to lower domestic and international marketing margins. On Slide 14, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted pretax costs of $280 million, $34 million higher than the prior quarter. The increase was mainly due to higher net interest expense as well as a transfer tax related to a foreign entity reorganization and higher employee-related expenses. Slide 15 shows the change in cash during the fourth quarter. We had another strong quarter of cash generation. We started the quarter with a $3.7 billion cash balance. Cash from operations was $2.7 billion, excluding working capital. There was a working capital benefit of $2.1 billion, mainly reflecting a reduction in inventory and a decrease in our net accounts receivable position. We received a loan repayment from an equity affiliate of $426 million. During the quarter, we repaid $500 million of senior notes due April 2023 and funded $713 million of capital spending. We returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Additionally, the other category includes the redemption of DCP Midstream's Series A preferred units of $500 million. Our ending cash balance was $6.1 billion.  This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items for the first quarter and the full year. In Chemicals, we expect the first quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the first quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the mid-80s and turnaround expenses to be between $240 million and $270 million. We anticipate first quarter corporate and other costs to come in between $230 million and $260 million. For 2023, Refining turnaround expenses are expected to be between $550 million and $600 million. We expect Corporate and Other costs to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion for the year. We anticipate full year D&A of about $2 billion. And finally, we expect the effective income tax rate to be between 20% and 25%.  Now we will open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, Neil. Your line is open.\nNeil Mehta : Yeah. Good morning, good afternoon, guys. I guess the first question I have is around refining. And if I try to isolate what the market is reacting to today, I think it's the capture rate, surprised folks relative to a lot of your large-cap peers. And so maybe you can simplify it for us and talk about what you're seeing in the system. Is there anything that you feel was more temporary versus structural? And give us confidence that that capture rate is going to continue to improve as we think about the progression through the year?\nRich Harbison : Hey, Rich here. Yeah, that's a really good question. When I look at that capture rate for the fourth quarter, the three simple things that stand out to me are really the impact of our turnaround activity. That's the first one. It was centric in the Gulf Coast and the Pacific Northwest. And the Pacific Northwest was an actual entire refinery shutdown that shouldered the third and fourth quarter of the year. So I look at those as temporaries.  There was also some product differentials that played out across our system the Atlantic, the difference between the European distillate price and the New York Harbor price is reflective in that market capture. There was a significant reduction in diesel price there in Europe as well as the turnaround effect in the Pacific Northwest and also Northern California product prices were dislocated from the Los Angeles market as well.  And the third influence in fourth quarter capture was really centric around the Keystone shutdown of the pipeline as well as the winter storm events in there. So that's -- when I look at those three effects, there's the majority of the impact associated with the capture rate in the fourth quarter.\nJeff Dietert : I might just add, the turnaround activity occurred in October and early November, which was the highest margin part of the quarter.\nNeil Mehta : Thanks for that. And the follow-up to that is just as we think about Q1, how some of these dynamics potentially reverse especially given it's going to be a pretty heavy turnaround quarter, it looks like, with the utilization guides in the mid-80s? Or do we really see that improvement materialize potentially more Q2 through balance of the year?\nMark Lashier : Well, I'll start with the turnaround guidance part of that and then kick it over to Brian, you can talk about the market outlook a little bit there for the first quarter. So our first quarter turnaround, you can tell by our guidance there that Kevin provided our annual guidance is in the 550 to 600 range. And our first quarter is a majority of that spend. So we are heavy centric first quarter on our turnaround. And those are primarily related in just a couple of sites. So I don't -- I see that as really impactful to our Atlantic coastal operations there as the biggest part of that impact on the turnarounds. There is also some Gulf Coast turnaround activity as well that is less impactful. So although there is a heavy spend, it's centric really in one primary facility.\nBrian Mandell : And I would add in talking about European to New York distillate prices and Pacific Northwest and Bay prices to L.A., they should both normalize. We saw New York is over Europe. That's unusual. Europe imported a lot of Russian distillate prior to the price gap next week. And New York, because of the winter storm, didn't get all the barrels that it needs. So the reason why New York is over Europe now it's a prompt issue. And if you look at Colonial Pipeline, it's running at full rates now. New York will get fed back and then Europe will be over -- or under -- or over New York rather going forward.  And the Pacific Northwest versus and Bay versus L.A. that was -- that's a temporary issue as well. Our pad refineries ran really well in November, December, we saw inventories really build across the markets. And given the oversupply, the markets needed to price to incentivize exports and the infrastructure for exports is in the Bay and Pacific Northwest. So that's where the exports came from.  And also, we need to aggregate barrels for the exports. So some of the barrels that normally went to L.A. didn't go to L.A. at that time. So that increased the L.A. price, decreased the Pacific Northwest and Bay price. But going forward with heavy Pacific Northwest turnarounds and work in the Bay, we'd expect inventories to moderate as we get back to seasonal demand spreads between the north and south will come back into normal areas.\nNeil Mehta : Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. \nJeff Dietert : Thanks Neil. \nOperator: Our next question today comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Please go ahead, Doug. \nDoug Leggate : Well, thank you. Good morning everyone. I wonder if you wouldn't mind, I'm going to try -- I'd like to build on Neil's question, if I may, but ask it a little differently. Is there any way, Kevin that you can quantify the lost opportunity cost in the fourth quarter to help us kind of reconcile that capture rate question? Is that possible?\nKevin Mitchell : Yeah. Doug, that's -- we've historically not done that in terms of what we've put out there into the market. We've talked about the kind of areas where that has shown up and Rich walk you through that. But it is a -- in any given period, there's invariably some element of LP component. And certainly, what we saw in the fourth quarter was quite a bit higher than what I would consider. I mean, ideally, you don't want any of it, but there's usually some degree of that. It was significantly higher than that. So not something we've historically given out.  But I guess, to give you some some help, it's probably -- the number is probably in the order of $100 million to $200 million of LPO in the quarter.\nDoug Leggate : Okay. I guess -- thank you for that. I know it's a top tricky one to answer. So my follow-up is really more of a kind of an outlook question. And speaks to your comments about Northeast. I realize everyone is probably pushing product up to the Northeast during the winter because of all the noise around heating oil margins. But it occurs to us that, that was probably the first normal winter without Philadelphia Energy Solutions in 2019 when fire hasn't come back since. So we think about what does the Northeast look like in a normal summer driving season without Philadelphia Energy Solutions? And I'm just curious if you have -- given any thought, given that you did push product up to the Northeast, how you're thinking about what the gasoline market could look like in the summertime in the U.S.?\nBrian Mandell : Yeah, I think we -- it's always an import market for gasoline typically up to 800,000 barrels a day. We do expect that to continue being an import market. The imports may come from different locations in the future, but we would expect that we still need to import gasoline about that level.\nDoug Leggate : I guess what I'm asking is, do you see the risk of an outside spike in gasoline the way we saw an outside spike in heating oil in the Northeast?\nBrian Mandell : I would say any market that is short needs resupply and the resupply comes from some distance away, has that opportunity for volatility. The same thing that happens on the West Coast, West Coast that we supplied is further away four weeks away. And then in -- and just in the Pad 1, but any time resupply is in close, you have that opportunity volatility.\nJeff Dietert : I think the other thing I'd add is you look at gasoline, diesel and jet inventories, they're all below five-year ranges and it looks to us as though we've got an above-average industry refining turnaround period plan for the spring. So it looks tight from our vantage point.\nDoug Leggate : That's kind of what we're thinking. Thanks so much guys. That was a tricky one to answer. Appreciate your perspective. \nJeff Dietert : Thank you, Doug.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, Roger. \nRoger Read : Good morning, everybody. I guess I'll continue with the theme of hammering on capture and expectations of capture. Just curious why this quarter did change the index that you're using? And then I know you explained the gasoline and the diesel aspect. So configuration, I guess, makes sense. What maybe went on with secondary products? And is that something that we might see carry through to '23 here?\nKevin Mitchell : So Roger, when you say index you're referring to the market crack, the adjusted market crack change?\nRoger Read : Yeah, your market indicator, yeah.\nKevin Mitchell : Yeah. Really, it's -- we're setting up for -- we've talked about this for a while, and we're setting up for 2023 and the cleanest way to make that change is to do it in the fourth quarter, and that enables us to restate or recast in our supplemental information, the prior 2021 and 2022 all on that same basis. And then the first results we report for 2023 will be on that same basis. And so it's just the cleanest timing to make a change like that. It's something we've considered for a little while, but we thought it was the appropriate thing to do.\nJeff Dietert : Yeah. And then the secondary products, I'll kick that off and then turn it over to Brian maybe for some outlook on it. But third quarter to fourth quarter, in refining, we see those relatively flat actually. There are some puts and takes associated with that, asphalts and fuel oils drop off in price and volume, but butane picks up and offsets a lot of that. So the overall impact of our secondary products was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter.\nBrian Mandell : I'd say we continue to think that high sulfur fuel oil will remain weak, just with all the Russian cargoes coming on the market, both high-sulfur fuel oil and heavy crude cargoes coming out in the market. So I think we'll continue to see that in the market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Royall of JPMorgan. Please go ahead, John. \nJohn Royall : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So just hoping for a little more color on the DCP synergies that you called out in your press release, I think $300 million. I think you've probably been pretty anxious to speak about those numbers. And so any buckets you can speak to and anything on timing and how that should trade in?\nMark Lashier : Yeah. I think, John, the $300 million really falls into two categories. Operating synergies that we're actively pursuing upfront now even before the close of the roll-up of the publicly held units. And then there's, I think, even more prolific commercial synergies that we can capture as we combine -- or as we roll the business into our own. Tim, you can provide a little more color there.\nTim Roberts : Yeah. At this point, Mark is correct. Look, we're looking at this. It's going to probably over a time frame, we came out with $300 million. We think it's probably about third with regard to costs. You got two third on the commercial side. We're anticipating this is going to take us around two years to fully capture this. It's like anything else, once you get into it further and deeper, we're hoping there's more there and initial indications are that they're likely are. And hopefully, I can update you another call later to validate or confirm that, but we do see the commercial side is probably driving that. It just makes sense.  When you look at the integrated value chain, you put these two entities together, we, in effect, now have gas processing in the key regions. We now have fractionation capacity at Conway, Mont Belvieu, also at Sweeny and long-haul pipelines coming in out of the DJ and coming out of the Permian. When you look at those, there are tremendous opportunities to make sure the barrel gets the right place. And in our world, the right place means where it creates the most value.  So, as we dig further on that, like I said, we're looking forward to giving you more details going forward. \nJohn Royall : Okay. That's helpful. And then just looking at the chemicals market, do you expect that we've seen a bottom there? And how does China reopening impact the future of that market? And then let's just say hypothetically, the market doesn't improve from here. Is there any risk of CPChem's ability to self-fund the two growth projects?\nMark Lashier : Yeah. I think, John, that you've seen at the ethane -- that the polyethylene value chain margins kind of hit bottom. Those producers that were really squeezed pulled back on production. So you can see that clearly -- we've hit a point where there's great discipline and nobody is going to operate while they're bleeding cash, and we've kind of passed through that period. Margins have modestly ticked up, and you'll continue to see as the capacity that's coming online in North America gets digested, we'll be at that bottom for some time, but then start to work our way out because demand globally continues to increase.  And China is certainly an upside and there are number of signs that China is coming back. We're not going to call at their back. I think it could come in fits and starts, but certainly, the noise coming out of China is productive directionally.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead, Ryan.\nRyan Todd : Great. Thanks. Maybe starting out with one on shareholder returns. The buyback was strong this quarter. As we think about 2023 going forward, you've provided guidance at the recent Analyst Day that would suggest something on the order of $500 million to $700 million a quarter of buyback in a mid-cycle environment.  We're clearly above the mid-cycle environment. You were at the high end of the guided pace this quarter. How should we think about the use of that excess cash? Should the backdrop remain very constructive? And how aggressive might you look to be on shareholder returns versus building more cash on the balance sheet?\nKevin Mitchell : Yeah, Ryan, it's Kevin. So, you're right, we did the high end of the range in the fourth quarter, and I think it's reasonable to assume that we would continue somewhere round about that level. We're also -- we're sitting on a decent healthy cash end of the year just over $6 billion. And just to give some context to the overall balance sheet condition relative to where we were before the pandemic.  Over the pandemic, we added $4 billion and I'm ignoring the impact of BCP debt consolidation here. We added $4 billion over the pandemic. We subsequently paid off 3.5 of that but we've improved our cash position by $4.5 million since the end of 2019. So net-net, we've enhanced the balance sheet by $4 billion from where we were going into the the pandemic. And so that gives us a lot of flexibility. But we've also got the DCP roll-up to take care of, which we expect to be sometime in the second quarter.  So that's a $3.8 billion transaction. And while we won't use all cash for that, we want to make sure that we retain plenty of flexibility as we go into that and close on that rollout. But I do think what it all speaks to we continue to see these above mid-cycle conditions, we will have some good flexibility to -- I would tell you really do a bit of all of it. We'll want to pay off some incremental debt, especially as we think about the impact of the DCP roll-up, but we should also be positioned to look at the cash returns to shareholders, both in the context of the dividend, we would expect to increase the dividend. This year, we remain committed to a secure, competitive growing dividend.  And we'll look at the buyback pace. We're clearly at a very healthy level today, but there's potential flexibility on that. And so, we -- it's something that we'll prioritize and keep very focused on. But in the near term, we're probably pretty comfortable with where we are given that we've got the DCP transaction out there ahead of us.\nRyan Todd : Excellent. And then maybe shifting gears somewhere else. I wonder if you could discuss a little bit about what you're seeing and what you expect going forward in European refining. There's some big moving pieces in recent months, the natural gas spread between Europe and the U.S. has declined significantly and you've got an upcoming Russian product ban going into effect. What are you seeing in the market right now? And any thoughts on expectations in the coming months?\nBrian Mandell : I think with natural gas coming off some. We're not -- I mean Rich can talk about the natural gas issues at the plant.\nRich Harbison : So, natural gas for us, certainly has some impact on our operations, primarily for the purchase of electricity, but we see that really not as a disadvantage to our peers either. So, the competitive nature of refining will continue to be there with some cost impacts associated with higher natural gas and that's the numbers we put out in the past are still in play today as well.  The challenge for that will be the continued impact of the Russian supply scenarios and then the resupply are that will set the really the minimum price for those marketplaces, and we'll see that shapes up here as the market moves forward.\nMark Lashier : I'd like to circle back. I don't think I covered one of the questions that John asked around Chems and that's the risk -- the market risk of CPChem generating enough cash to self-fund these two projects. Both of those projects, they own 30% of the Ras Laffan project, 51% of the U.S.-based project, both will be off-balance sheet project finance, mitigating their cash outflows, substantially mitigating our exposure there. So you can never predict that there is no risk, but I think it's highly mitigated because of the debt structuring they're going to undertake to support those projects.\nOperator: The next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPaul Cheng : Hi, guys. Good morning. Maybe for Kevin, can you go back into the CPC with the two major cracker is going to be under construction? How is the CPC distribution to [Indiscernible] for the next several years we should assume? So we assume that it's going to be quite minimum and that they will build up their own financing and also some cash in the year given that there's a heavy spending ahead? Or that do you think that the decision is that they will just use more of that capacity and continue to payout?\nMark Lashier : If you look -- again, if you look at those projects and if you look at the assumptions on project financing, I think we had talked about earlier, maybe even at Investor Day, that our exposure to foregone dividends is really probably about 10% of the aggregate capital spend if you look at those two projects combined. And that's spread out over four years. So it's not a major impact on our ability to generate cash overall. Kevin, do you want to -- \nKevin Mitchell : Yeah. So just to expand on that a little bit. The -- when Mark talks about off-balance sheet financing, he is specifically referring to project level financing. So financing those projects at the Ras Laffan Petrochemical project level and at the Golden Triangle Polymers project level. So that's not on CPChem's balance sheet, and we're not anticipating that CPChem would have to go to its own balance sheet to fund its equity contributions into those joint ventures to fund those projects. And in fact, we'll still be able to do that and continue making distributions to the owners.  Obviously, there is a dependency on what the overall market environment looks like. But based on what we're seeing, we still expect to be receiving distributions from CPChem through this period. Clearly, there's an impact. Anything -- any discretionary spend by CPChem into a capital investment is cash that's not available for distribution out, but it's all pretty manageable within the overall expectation of where their cash flows will be.\nPaul Cheng : Kevin, do you have any rough estimate whether you expect CPC to sensory pay out to earn 100% or 50% or 75% or any estimate that you have?\nKevin Mitchell : Yeah. Well, you would expect it to be less than 100% because they do have the capital projects underway. So there's the two big ones that we've been talking about, and then there's a slate of smaller projects, several of which will actually finish this year. So it's going to be less than 100%. We've never given specific guidance on what we expect the distributions to be. And our history has actually been pretty strong with regard to cash coming back from CPChem.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Please go ahead, Jason. Your line is open.\nJason Gabelman : Hey, good afternoon. I wanted to first ask on M&A in midstream. And I know when you rolled up PSXP part of the rationale was to have more flexibility across the whole portfolio, and you've, obviously, brought in DCP. So I wonder on the other side, is there any desire to reoptimize some of the midstream assets that you have in the portfolio that may not be core at this point?  And then my second question is just on the marketing business, which has continued to perform pretty well. I was wondering if there were any dynamics in your markets that continue to support margins. And is there an outlook that, that margins can maybe be above mid-cycle in that business for 2023? Thanks.\nTim Roberts : Yeah. Jason, this is Tim Roberts. I'll handle that front end hand it off to Brian. I think it's important, you're right. We did talk about simplifying our overall structure. And you have PSXP done in the process of completing DCP. We do think we'll be in a much cleaner position with regard to ownership levels and just had a cleaner side work from. We do recognize as well that this market is evolving. There is some consolidation going on in the industry, producers are consolidating. You'll see some of the midstream infrastructure guys doing that too.  So we're going to pay attention to that. And what's happening out there, if there is opportunities, but I think it's probably going to be real clear as we've got a task at hand. Our task at hand right now is to get DCP integrated and integrated well. We want to be successful at it. It's going to take us, we believe somewhere towards the end of the year. It may leak into 2024, but our expectation is get it done by the end of this year and deliver synergies. You drove most along those and that's pretty impactful with regard to value of the company.  So we ant to do that, but do rest assured, not that we're out on any spending spree, we always have an eye open, what's going on out there and what can create value for our shareholders. And if there's something that's truly compelling, we'll talk about it and see if it makes sense. But right now, it's being integrated successfully.\nBrian Mandell : On the marketing business, I'd say that we will continue to perform well, perhaps not as well as 2022. That was a record year. But with increased volatility in the market, that generally drives better business. We also had a joint venture retail record year last year, and we continue to grow our retail joint venture in the U.S., and that continues to perform. Also, there are issues in the European market that have helped us, even things like expanding our credit card business has been helpful to growing our business. So I think we'll continue to grow the business. You'll see the earnings strong, but perhaps not quite as strong as 2022.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matthew Blair of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Blair : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the WCS discounts, so they're pretty favorable. Could you talk about what's driving that? And will you be able to capitalize on these wide WCS discounts in Q1 in the Central Corridor? And then finally, how do you think the Trans Mountain expansion might affect these discounts? Thanks.\nBrian Mandell : Well, we'll start with WCS differentials. There were a number of things that we're kind of pushing and pulling on supply and demand. Inventories north of the board in Canada have been very high, and you had Keystone off the market for 22 days, which was 10 million barrels off the market. North of the border, you had about 4 million barrels of production off the market in December, another 0.5 million barrels off the market in January. And then you had the winter storm where refiners shut down. There was 27 million barrels of crude backed out, not all that's heavy crude, but refiners weren't pulling as much of the WCS. So all of that -- if you kind of add all that up, it meant that WCS dips were weaker than they have been.  TMX provided an update in early January that they said that their 75% of the pipe is now in the ground. They haven't changed their in-service date for the fourth quarter of this year. Our internal expectations are that start-up will slip into 2024 and full rates won't be achieved immediately. We don't think you need another pipeline to exit the product that is in Canada. So we don't see it doing much.  The first call for those barrels will always be Pad 2 and Pad 3 before they go to China or anywhere overseas, so they'll have to price to get into those markets.\nMatthew Blair : Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Next, we have a follow-up question from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nPaul Cheng : Hey, guys. Just real quick. Because of the keystone downtime, can you share that how much is the WCS that you run in the fourth quarter? And then what do you expect you're going to one year in the first quarter? And also, I believe with -- after the turnaround actually has been running at a pretty depressed way. I think at one point, about 60%, 65% and where are we in the Wood River?\nMark Lashier: So we generally don't, for commercial reasons, talk about what we run into refineries and how much we run. But of course, Wood River had some hiccups. In Q4, we ran less WCS in our system than normally. We are the largest importer of Canadian crude to the U.S. We expect, as Wood River comes back up, we'll run more, Rich, maybe you can talk about where we are in Wood River.\nBrian Mandell : Yeah. So Wood River, there was an unplanned event incident that occurred at Wood River and -- let me start by saying our thoughts go out for the affected employees, contractors and their families that were associated with that event.  But there was an incident there. We are working diligently right now to increase the utilization that was affected by this, and we expect that utilization to continue to increase through the first quarter and returned to normal operations early second quarter is our current outlook on that, Paul.\nPaul Cheng : Okay. Can you tell us that what's the current runway of Wood River?\nTim Roberts : Do we normally give guidance by plant?\nBrian Mandell : Not that specific.\nMark Lashier : Yeah. Unfortunately, Paul, we don't give that type of guidance by plant as to what our current run rates are.\nOperator: We have now reached the end of today's call. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.\nJeff Dietert : Thanks, Emily. Thank all of you for your interest in Phillips 66. If you have questions after today's call, please call me or Owen Simpson. Thanks for your time.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brian Mandell",
            "content": "And I would add in talking about European to New York distillate prices and Pacific Northwest and Bay prices to L.A., they should both normalize. We saw New York is over Europe. That's unusual. Europe imported a lot of Russian distillate prior to the price gap next week. And New York, because of the winter storm, didn't get all the barrels that it needs. So the reason why New York is over Europe now it's a prompt issue. And if you look at Colonial Pipeline, it's running at full rates now. New York will get fed back and then Europe will be over -- or under -- or over New York rather going forward.  And the Pacific Northwest versus and Bay versus L.A. that was -- that's a temporary issue as well. Our pad refineries ran really well in November, December, we saw inventories really build across the markets. And given the oversupply, the markets needed to price to incentivize exports and the infrastructure for exports is in the Bay and Pacific Northwest. So that's where the exports came from.  And also, we need to aggregate barrels for the exports. So some of the barrels that normally went to L.A. didn't go to L.A. at that time. So that increased the L.A. price, decreased the Pacific Northwest and Bay price. But going forward with heavy Pacific Northwest turnarounds and work in the Bay, we'd expect inventories to moderate as we get back to seasonal demand spreads between the north and south will come back into normal areas. Yeah, I think we -- it's always an import market for gasoline typically up to 800,000 barrels a day. We do expect that to continue being an import market. The imports may come from different locations in the future, but we would expect that we still need to import gasoline about that level. I would say any market that is short needs resupply and the resupply comes from some distance away, has that opportunity for volatility. The same thing that happens on the West Coast, West Coast that we supplied is further away four weeks away. And then in -- and just in the Pad 1, but any time resupply is in close, you have that opportunity volatility. I'd say we continue to think that high sulfur fuel oil will remain weak, just with all the Russian cargoes coming on the market, both high-sulfur fuel oil and heavy crude cargoes coming out in the market. So I think we'll continue to see that in the market. I think with natural gas coming off some. We're not -- I mean Rich can talk about the natural gas issues at the plant. On the marketing business, I'd say that we will continue to perform well, perhaps not as well as 2022. That was a record year. But with increased volatility in the market, that generally drives better business.

            "name": "Rich Harbison",
            "content": "Hey, Rich here. Yeah, that's a really good question. When I look at that capture rate for the fourth quarter, the three simple things that stand out to me are really the impact of our turnaround activity. That's the first one. It was centric in the Gulf Coast and the Pacific Northwest. And the Pacific Northwest was an actual entire refinery shutdown that shouldered the third and fourth quarter of the year. So I look at those as temporaries.  There was also some product differentials that played out across our system the Atlantic, the difference between the European distillate price and the New York Harbor price is reflective in that market capture. There was a significant reduction in diesel price there in Europe as well as the turnaround effect in the Pacific Northwest and also Northern California product prices were dislocated from the Los Angeles market as well.  And the third influence in fourth quarter capture was really centric around the Keystone shutdown of the pipeline as well as the winter storm events in there. So that's -- when I look at those three effects, there's the majority of the impact associated with the capture rate in the fourth quarter. So, natural gas for us, certainly has some impact on our operations, primarily for the purchase of electricity, but we see that really not as a disadvantage to our peers either. So, the competitive nature of refining will continue to be there with some cost impacts associated with higher natural gas and that's the numbers we put out in the past are still in play today as well.  The challenge for that will be the continued impact of the Russian supply scenarios and then the resupply are that will set the really the minimum price for those marketplaces, and we'll see that shapes up here as the market moves forward."

We generated $4.8 billion in operating cash flow. For the year, adjusted earnings were $8.9 billion or $18.79 per share. Our diversified integrated portfolio generated strong earnings and cash flow in 2022, supported by a favorable market environment and solid operations. Our cash flow generation allowed us to strengthen our financial position by repaying debt and resuming our share repurchase program. We returned $3.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.

In Midstream, we continue integrating DCP Midstream to unlock significant synergies and growth opportunities across our NGL wellhead to market value chain. Additionally, we completed Frac 4 at the Sweeny Hub, adding 150,000 barrels per day. Our total Sweeny Hub fractionation capacity is 550,000 barrels per day, making it the largest fraction -- or the second largest fractionation hub in the U.S. In Chemicals, CPChem is pursuing a portfolio of high-return projects, enhancing its asset base as well as optimizing its existing operations. This includes construction of a second world scale unit to produce one hexene in Old Ocean, Texas, and the expansion of propylene splitting capacity at its Cedar buying facility. Both projects are expected to start up in the second half of 2023. CPChem and Qatar Energy announced final investment decisions to construct petrochemical facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast Ras Laffan, Qatar. CPChem will have a 51% interest in the $8.5 billion integrated polymers facility on the U.S. Gulf Coast. The Golden Triangle Polymers facility will include a 4.6 billion pounds per year ethane cracker and two high-density polyethylene units with a combined capacity of 4.4 billion pounds per year. Operations are expected to begin in 2026.  In January, the Ras Laffan petrochemical project was approved. CPChem will own a 30% interest in the $6 billion integrated Polymers complex. The plant will include a 4.6 billion pounds per year ethane cracker and two high-density polyethylene units with a total capacity of 3.7 billion pounds per year. Start-up is expected in late 2026.  In Refining, we're converting our San Francisco refinery into one of the world's largest renewable fuels facilities. The Rodeo Renewed project is on track to begin commercial operations in the first quarter of 2024. Upon completion, Rodeo will have over 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuels production capacity. At our Investor Day, we announced priorities to reward Phillips 66 shareholders now and in the future. We're holding ourselves accountable, and we know that you are as well.  Slide 4 summarizes our progress. We are delivering returns to shareholders. Since July 2022, we've returned $2.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We're on track to meet our target return of $10 billion to $12 billion by year-end 2024. In January, we reached an agreement to acquire all of the publicly held common units of DCP Midstream.  We expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2023, at which point, we will have an 87% economic interest in DCP Midstream. The increase in our economic interest from 28%, prior to the third quarter transaction, is expected to generate an incremental $1.3 billion of adjusted EBITDA, including commercial and operating synergies.  We're executing our business transformation. The team achieved savings in excess of $500 million on an annualized basis at the end of 2022, setting us up well for 2023. This includes cost reductions of over $300 million, mostly related to reducing headcount by over 1,100 positions during the year as we redesigned and streamlined our organization.  In addition, our 2023 capital program includes a $200 million reduction of sustaining capital. We're transforming to a sustainable lower cost business model and expect to deliver $1 billion of annualized savings by year-end 2023. We're laser-focused on executing these strategic priorities to deliver returns and increase distributions in a competitive and sustainable way. We look forward to updating you on our progress.  Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results. Well, I'll start with the turnaround guidance part of that and then kick it over to Brian, you can talk about the market outlook a little bit there for the first quarter. So our first quarter turnaround, you can tell by our guidance there that Kevin provided our annual guidance is in the 550 to 600 range. And our first quarter is a majority of that spend. So we are heavy centric first quarter on our turnaround. And those are primarily related in just a couple of sites. So I don't -- I see that as really impactful to our Atlantic coastal operations there as the biggest part of that impact on the turnarounds. There is also some Gulf Coast turnaround activity as well that is less impactful. So although there is a heavy spend, it's centric really in one primary facility. Yeah. I think, John, the $300 million really falls into two categories. Operating synergies that we're actively pursuing upfront now even before the close of the roll-up of the publicly held units. And then there's, I think, even more prolific commercial synergies that we can capture as we combine -- or as we roll the business into our own. Tim, you can provide a little more color there. Yeah. I think, John, that you've seen at the ethane -- that the polyethylene value chain margins kind of hit bottom. Those producers that were really squeezed pulled back on production. So you can see that clearly -- we've hit a point where there's great discipline and nobody is going to operate while they're bleeding cash, and we've kind of passed through that period. Margins have modestly ticked up, and you'll continue to see as the capacity that's coming online in North America gets digested, we'll be at that bottom for some time, but then start to work our way out because demand globally continues to increase.  And China is certainly an upside and there are number of signs that China is coming back. We're not going to call at their back. I think it could come in fits and starts, but certainly, the noise coming out of China is productive directionally. I'd like to circle back. I don't think I covered one of the questions that John asked around Chems and that's the risk -- the market risk of CPChem generating enough cash to self-fund these two projects. Both of those projects, they own 30% of the Ras Laffan project, 51% of the U.S.-based project, both will be off-balance sheet project finance, mitigating their cash outflows, substantially mitigating our exposure there. So you can never predict that there is no risk, but I think it's highly mitigated because of the debt structuring they're going to undertake to support those projects. If you look -- again, if you look at those projects and if you look at the assumptions on project financing, I think we had talked about earlier, maybe even at Investor Day, that our exposure to foregone dividends is really probably about 10% of the aggregate capital spend if you look at those two projects combined. And that's spread out over four years. So it's not a major impact on our ability to generate cash overall. Kevin, do you want to -- So we generally don't, for commercial reasons, talk about what we run into refineries and how much we run. But of course, Wood River had some hiccups. In Q4, we ran less WCS in our system than normally. We are the largest importer of Canadian crude to the U.S. We expect, as Wood River comes back up, we'll run more, Rich, maybe you can talk about where we are in Wood River. Yeah. Unfortunately, Paul, we don't give that type of guidance by plant as to what our current run rates are."

            "name": "Kevin Mitchell",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Starting with an overview on Slide 5, we summarize our financial results for the year. Adjusted earnings were $8.9 billion or $18.79 per share. The $442 million decrease in the fair value of our investment in NOVONIX reduced earnings per share by $0.71. We generated $10.8 billion of operating cash flow. Cash distributions from equity affiliates were $1.7 billion, including $574 million from CPChem. We ended 2022 with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 24%. Our adjusted after-tax return on capital employed for the year was 22%.  Slide 6 shows the change in cash during the year. We started the year with $3.1 billion in cash and generated record cash flow during the year. Cash from operations was $10.8 billion. We received net loan repayments from equity affiliates of $590 million. During the year, we paid down $2.4 billion of debt. This includes $430 million of debt paid down by DCP Midstream since we began consolidating effective August '18. We funded $2.2 billion of capital spending and returned $3.3 billion to shareholders, including $1.5 billion of share repurchases. The other category includes the redemption of DCP Midstream's Series A preferred units of $500 million. Our ending cash balance increased by $3 billion to $6.1 billion.  Slide 7 summarizes our fourth quarter results. Adjusted earnings were $1.9 billion, or $4 per share. The $11 million decrease in the fair value of our investment in NOVONIX reduced earnings per share by $0.02. We generated operating cash flow of $4.8 billion, including a working capital benefit of $2.1 billion and cash distributions from equity affiliates of $261 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $713 million, including $310 million for growth projects. We returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through $456 million of dividends and $753 million of share repurchases. We ended the quarter with 466 million shares outstanding. Moving to Slide 8. This slide highlights the change in adjusted results by segment from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. During the period, adjusted earnings decreased $1.2 billion mostly due to lower results in Refining and Marketing and Specialties.  In the fourth quarter, we made certain changes to the composition and reporting of our operating segment results. Our slides reflect these changes and prior period results have been recast for comparative purposes. The 2022 and 2021 quarterly information has been recast and is included in our supplemental information.  Slide 9 shows our Midstream results. Fourth quarter adjusted pretax income was $674 million compared with $608 million in the previous quarter. Transportation contributed to adjusted pretax income of $237 million, up $8 million from the prior quarter. NGL and Other adjusted pretax income was $448 million compared to $412 million in the third quarter. The increase was primarily due to record fractionation volumes as well as a full quarter of consolidating DCP Midstream, Sand Hills Pipeline and Southern Hills pipeline. The fractionators at the Sweeny Hub averaged a record 565,000 barrels per day, reflecting the start-up of Frac 4 at the end of the third quarter. The Freeport LPG export facility loaded a record 271,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter.  Our NOVONIX investment is mark-to-market each quarter. The fair value of the investment, including foreign exchange impacts, decreased $11 million in the fourth quarter compared with a decrease of $33 million in the third quarter. Turning to Chemicals on Slide 10. Chemicals at fourth quarter adjusted pretax income of $52 million compared with $135 million in the previous quarter. The decrease was mainly due to lower margins and volumes partially offset by decreased utility costs and the impact of legal accruals in the third quarter. Global olefins and polyolefins utilization was 83% for the quarter, reflecting planned turnaround activities and the impact of the winter storm in December. Turning to Refining on Slide 11. Refining fourth quarter adjusted pretax income was $1.6 billion, down from $2.9 billion in the third quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower realized margins. Our realized margins decreased by 27% to $19.73per barrel, while the composite 3 to 1 re-adjusted market crack decreased by 16%. Turnaround costs were $236 million. Crude utilization was 91% in the fourth quarter and clean product yield was 86%.  Slide 12 covers market capture. We are now using a composite 3 to 1 in adjusted market crack to be more consistent with peers and more comparable to our realized margin. The 3 to 1 rent-adjusted market crack for the fourth quarter was $23.50 per barrel compared to $28.18 per barrel in the third quarter. Realized margin was $19.73 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 84%.  Market capture in the previous quarter was 95%. Market capture is impacted by the configuration of our refineries. We have a higher distillate yield and lower gasoline yield than the 3 to 1 market indicator. During the fourth quarter, the distillate crack increased $8 per barrel, and the gasoline crack decreased $10 per barrel. Losses from secondary products of $3.59 per barrel were $0.09 per barrel higher than the previous quarter. Our feedstock loss of $0.03 per barrel was $1.45 per barrel improved compared to the third quarter due to more favorable crude differentials. The other category improved realized margins by $0.46 per barrel. This category includes freight costs, clean product realizations and inventory impacts. Fourth quarter was $6.66 per barrel less than the previous quarter, primarily due to lower clean product realizations and inventory timing.  Moving to Marketing and Specialties on Slide 13. Adjusted fourth quarter pretax income was $539 million compared with $828 million in the prior quarter, mainly due to lower domestic and international marketing margins. On Slide 14, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted pretax costs of $280 million, $34 million higher than the prior quarter. The increase was mainly due to higher net interest expense as well as a transfer tax related to a foreign entity reorganization and higher employee-related expenses. Slide 15 shows the change in cash during the fourth quarter. We had another strong quarter of cash generation. We started the quarter with a $3.7 billion cash balance. Cash from operations was $2.7 billion, excluding working capital. There was a working capital benefit of $2.1 billion, mainly reflecting a reduction in inventory and a decrease in our net accounts receivable position. We received a loan repayment from an equity affiliate of $426 million. During the quarter, we repaid $500 million of senior notes due April 2023 and funded $713 million of capital spending. We returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Additionally, the other category includes the redemption of DCP Midstream's Series A preferred units of $500 million. Our ending cash balance was $6.1 billion.  This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items for the first quarter and the full year. In Chemicals, we expect the first quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the first quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the mid-80s and turnaround expenses to be between $240 million and $270 million. We anticipate first quarter corporate and other costs to come in between $230 million and $260 million. For 2023, Refining turnaround expenses are expected to be between $550 million and $600 million. We expect Corporate and Other costs to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion for the year. We anticipate full year D&A of about $2 billion. And finally, we expect the effective income tax rate to be between 20% and 25%.  Now we will open the line for questions. Yeah. Doug, that's -- we've historically not done that in terms of what we've put out there into the market. We've talked about the kind of areas where that has shown up and Rich walk you through that. But it is a -- in any given period, there's invariably some element of LP component. And certainly, what we saw in the fourth quarter was quite a bit higher than what I would consider. I mean, ideally, you don't want any of it, but there's usually some degree of that. It was significantly higher than that. So not something we've historically given out.  But I guess, to give you some some help, it's probably -- the number is probably in the order of $100 million to $200 million of LPO in the quarter. So Roger, when you say index you're referring to the market crack, the adjusted market crack change? Yeah. Really, it's -- we're setting up for -- we've talked about this for a while, and we're setting up for 2023 and the cleanest way to make that change is to do it in the fourth quarter, and that enables us to restate or recast in our supplemental information, the prior 2021 and 2022 all on that same basis. And then the first results we report for 2023 will be on that same basis. And so it's just the cleanest timing to make a change like that. It's something we've considered for a little while, but we thought it was the appropriate thing to do. Yeah, Ryan, it's Kevin. So, you're right, we did the high end of the range in the fourth quarter, and I think it's reasonable to assume that we would continue somewhere round about that level. We're also -- we're sitting on a decent healthy cash end of the year just over $6 billion. And just to give some context to the overall balance sheet condition relative to where we were before the pandemic.  Over the pandemic, we added $4 billion and I'm ignoring the impact of BCP debt consolidation here. We added $4 billion over the pandemic. We subsequently paid off 3.5 of that but we've improved our cash position by $4.5 million since the end of 2019. So net-net, we've enhanced the balance sheet by $4 billion from where we were going into the the pandemic. And so that gives us a lot of flexibility. But we've also got the DCP roll-up to take care of, which we expect to be sometime in the second quarter.  So that's a $3.8 billion transaction. And while we won't use all cash for that, we want to make sure that we retain plenty of flexibility as we go into that and close on that rollout. But I do think what it all speaks to we continue to see these above mid-cycle conditions, we will have some good flexibility to -- I would tell you really do a bit of all of it. We'll want to pay off some incremental debt, especially as we think about the impact of the DCP roll-up, but we should also be positioned to look at the cash returns to shareholders, both in the context of the dividend, we would expect to increase the dividend. This year, we remain committed to a secure, competitive growing dividend.  And we'll look at the buyback pace. We're clearly at a very healthy level today, but there's potential flexibility on that. And so, we -- it's something that we'll prioritize and keep very focused on. But in the near term, we're probably pretty comfortable with where we are given that we've got the DCP transaction out there ahead of us. Yeah. So just to expand on that a little bit. The -- when Mark talks about off-balance sheet financing, he is specifically referring to project level financing. So financing those projects at the Ras Laffan Petrochemical project level and at the Golden Triangle Polymers project level. So that's not on CPChem's balance sheet, and we're not anticipating that CPChem would have to go to its own balance sheet to fund its equity contributions into those joint ventures to fund those projects. And in fact, we'll still be able to do that and continue making distributions to the owners.  Obviously, there is a dependency on what the overall market environment looks like. But based on what we're seeing, we still expect to be receiving distributions from CPChem through this period. Clearly, there's an impact. Anything -- any discretionary spend by CPChem into a capital investment is cash that's not available for distribution out, but it's all pretty manageable within the overall expectation of where their cash flows will be. Yeah. Well, you would expect it to be less than 100% because they do have the capital projects underway. So there's the two big ones that we've been talking about, and then there's a slate of smaller projects, several of which will actually finish this year. So it's going to be less than 100%. We've never given specific guidance on what we expect the distributions to be. And our history has actually been pretty strong with regard to cash coming back from CPChem."

Our third quarter results reflect the continued favorable market environment and our strong operating performance. We ran at high rates during the summer driving season to meet peak demand for critical transportation fuels. Our Refining business delivered improved market capture this quarter, supported by strong distillate cracks and wider discounts for heavy sour crudes. In the third quarter, we had adjusted earnings of $3.1 billion or $6.46 per share. We generated $3.1 billion in operating cash flow. We're committed to strong shareholder distributions. During the quarter, we ramped up share repurchases in a meaningful way, purchasing almost $700 million of common stock. Including dividends, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders. During the quarter, we continued to focus on operating excellence and advancing our strategic priorities. Our enterprise-wide business transformation is underway. The team is implementing key initiatives to deliver results. We look forward to providing more details at our Investor Day next week. In Midstream, we realigned our economic and governance interest in DCP Midstream, LP and Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC. Our economic interest in DCP Midstream increased to 43%, and our economic interest in Gray Oak Pipeline decreased to 6.5%. At the same time, we made an offer to acquire all publicly-held common units of DCP Midstream, LP. Our increased interest in DCP Midstream allows for further integration and optimization across our NGL business. The wellhead to market value chain structure will allow us to capture new commercial opportunities and optimize costs. Additionally, we started up Frac 4 at the Sweeny Hub on time and under budget. In October, Frac 4 achieved full run rates, bringing our total Sweeny Hub fractionation capacity to 550,000 barrels per day. CPChem is pursuing a portfolio of high-return projects, enhancing its asset base as well as optimizing its existing operations. This includes growing its normal alpha olefins business with a second world-scale unit to produce 1-hexene, a critical component in high-performance polyethylene. The unit is being constructed at CPChem's Old Ocean, Texas facility and will produce 586 million pounds per year. CPChem is also building a new propylene splitter at its Cedar Bayou facility, which will expand its capacity by 1 billion pounds per year. Both the 1-hexene and propylene splitter projects are expected to start up in the second half of 2023. CPChem continues to develop two world-scale petrochemical facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Ras Laffan, Qatar. A final investment decision for the U.S. Gulf Coast project is expected before the end of this year. In Refining, we're converting our San Francisco refinery into one of the world's largest renewable fuels facilities. The Rodeo Renewed project is expected to cost approximately $850 million and begin commercial operations in the first quarter of 2024. Upon completion, Rodeo will have over 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuels production capacity.  Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results.\nKevin Mitchell : Thank you, Mark, and hello, everyone. Before I talk about the financials, let me begin by summarizing the accounting impacts of DCP Midstream. On August 17, we completed the merger of DCP Midstream, LLC and Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC. In connection with the transaction, we were delegated governance rights over DCP Midstream, LP and its general partner entities as well as DCP Sand Hills Pipeline, LLC and DCP Southern Hills Pipeline, LLC. Effective August 18, our financial results reflect the consolidation of these entities. So starting with an overview on Slide 4, we summarize these financial results. We reported third quarter earnings of $5.4 billion. We had special items amounting to an after-tax gain of $2.3 billion, including the net gain related to the consolidation of DCP Midstream, Sand Hills Pipeline and Southern Hills Pipeline and the transfer of interest in Gray Oak Pipeline. Excluding special items, adjusted earnings were $3.1 billion or $6.46 per share. The $33 million decrease in the fair value of our investment in NOVONIX reduced earnings per share by $0.05. We generated $3.1 billion of operating cash flow. Capital spending for the quarter was $735 million, including the company's $306 million investment in DCP Midstream, LLC associated with the merger, net of cash acquired. We returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through $466 million of dividends and $694 million of share repurchases. We ended the quarter with 473 million shares outstanding. Moving to Slide 5. This slide highlights the change in adjusted results by segment from the second quarter to the third quarter, including the impact of consolidating DCP Midstream, Sand Hills Pipeline and Southern Hills Pipeline effective August 18. The Midstream segment, Corporate and Other, income taxes and noncontrolling interests are impacted by the consolidations. The higher noncontrolling interest reflects the portion of these entities not owned by Phillips 66. During the period, adjusted earnings decreased $163 million, mostly due to lower results in Refining and Chemicals, partially offset by higher Midstream and Marketing and Specialties results. Slide 6 shows our Midstream results. Third quarter adjusted pretax income was $645 million compared with $292 million in the previous quarter. The consolidation of DCP Midstream results are now reported within NGL and Other. Transportation contributed adjusted pretax income of $229 million, down $21 million from the prior quarter. The decrease was mainly due to lower equity earnings from the Gray Oak Pipeline resulting from the merger. NGL and Other adjusted pretax income was $449 million compared with $282 million in the second quarter. The increase was primarily due to the consolidation of DCP Midstream, Sand Hills Pipeline and Southern Hills Pipeline effective August 18. The fractionators at the Sweeny Hub averaged 429,000 barrels per day, and the Freeport LPG export facility loaded 249,000 barrels per day in the third quarter. Our NOVONIX investment is marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period. The fair value of the investment, including foreign exchange impacts, decreased $33 million in the third quarter compared with a decrease of $240 million in the second quarter. Turning to Chemicals on Slide 7. Chemicals had third quarter adjusted pretax income of $135 million compared with $273 million in the previous quarter. Olefins and Polyolefins adjusted pretax income was $105 million. The $111 million decrease from the previous quarter was primarily due to lower margins resulting from a sharp decline in polyethylene prices. This was partially offset by lower turnaround costs. Global O&P utilization was 90% for the quarter. Adjusted pretax income for SA&S was $60 million, in line with the second quarter. The higher costs in Other mainly reflect legal contingencies. During the third quarter, we received $41 million in cash distributions from CPChem. Turning to Refining on Slide 8. Refining third quarter adjusted pretax income was $2.8 billion, down from $3.1 billion in the second quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower realized margins, partially offset by higher volumes. Our realized margins decreased by 6% to $26.58 per barrel, while the composite global 3:2:1 market crack decreased by 22%. Pretax turnaround costs were $225 million, in line with the previous quarter. Crude utilization was 91% in the third quarter and clean product yield was 85%. Slide 9 covers market capture. Our composite global 3:2:1 market crack for the third quarter was $36.29 per barrel compared to $46.72 per barrel in the second quarter. Realized margin was $26.58 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 73%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 61%. Market capture is impacted by the configuration of our refineries. We have a higher distillate yield and lower gasoline yield than the 3:2:1 market indicator. During the third quarter, the distillate crack decreased $8.14 per barrel, and the gasoline crack decreased $11.84 per barrel. Losses from secondary products of $3.50 per barrel or $0.47 per barrel higher than the previous quarter. Our feedstock loss of $1.48 per barrel was in line with the previous quarter. Feedstock advantage from widening heavy sour crude differentials was offset by the impact of higher feedstock costs relative to dated Brent in the Atlantic Basin. The other category reduced realized margins by $1.29 per barrel. This category includes RINs, freight costs, in-product realizations and inventory impacts. Moving to Marketing and Specialties on Slide 10. Adjusted third quarter pretax income was $847 million compared with $765 million in the prior quarter. Marketing and Other adjusted pretax income was $717 million, up $61 million from the second quarter. The improvement reflects higher international margins, partially offset by lower domestic results, including inventory impacts. Specialties generated third quarter adjusted pretax income of $130 million. The $21 million increase was largely due to improved base oil margins. On Slide 12, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted pretax costs of $246 million, $11 million higher than the prior quarter. The increase was mainly due to consolidating DCP Midstream interest expense of $34 million, partially offset by higher interest income. Slide 12 shows the change in cash during the third quarter. We started the quarter with a $2.8 billion cash balance. Cash from operations was $3.1 billion. During the quarter, we funded $735 million of capital spending, including the company's $306 million investment in DCP Midstream, LLC associated with the merger, net of cash acquired. We returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our ending cash balance was $3.7 billion. We ended the quarter with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 29%, including the consolidation of DCP Midstream. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In Chemicals, we expect the fourth quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the fourth quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low to mid-90s and pretax turnaround expenses to be between $180 million and $220 million. As a result of strong turnaround execution and timing, we expect full year turnaround expenses to be lower than our original $800 million to $900 million of guidance. We anticipate fourth quarter Corporate and Other costs to come in between $300 million and $325 million pretax, reflecting a full quarter of DCP Midstream interest expense.  Now we will open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question will be from Doug Leggate at Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate : Kevin, I wonder if I could just ask you about your thoughts on the balance sheet going forward. I mean, clearly, you're back to, I guess -- on a capitalization basis, you're back to pre-COVID levels pretty much. But the absolute debt, now you have DCP is still about 30% up on where it was before the downturn. So how are you thinking about where you want the balance sheet to be going forward and how that might play into your cash return strategy?\nKevin Mitchell : Yes, Doug, thanks. It's a good question. So we feel pretty good that even with consolidation of DCP, that debt-to-capital ratio, net of cash, is sub-30%. So we feel good about the metric from that standpoint. And also, if you just look at debt-to-EBITDA metrics, they're still very strong. But the reality is it's $17.8 billion, circa $18 billion of debt on a fully consolidated basis. And so I think given the overall financial position we're in, the cash generation that we have, you'll see us continue to do some debt reduction. Bear in mind, we haven't yet funded the buy-in of the public, so that puts more pressure on the balance sheet regardless of how we actually execute on that funding between debt and cash. And so we'll continue to want to make some debt reductions. But the difference now between where we were over the last couple of years, where we're trying to get rid of the pandemic debt that we had added is, we don't need to make debt reduction the #1 priority for discretionary cash. Cash generation, cash balances are sufficient that we'll be able to do some -- gradually chip away at the debt balance and, at the same time, continue to return a healthy amount of cash to shareholders.\nDoug Leggate : I'm trying hard, Kevin, not to ask anything that I know you won't answer, given that you've got the Analyst Day. So I'm avoiding some of the obvious things, but I do want to try 1 that really came up in the last -- the call that preceded this one with Marathon. And it's the issue about the industry or senior management's view of mid-cycle. And Marathon were quite clear to say, look, in mid-cycle has moved up. You guys used to talk about, I guess, $6 billion to $7 billion of mid-cycle cash flow. Again, not preempting next week but can you maybe offer, whether Mark or anyone else, how you feel about the go-forward outlook for mid-cycle earnings for this business, of the Refining business?\nMark Lashier : Yes, Doug, we are going to cover that a bit next week. I think that there's two things to take into consideration there. What -- as the market mid-cycle moves, it has our ability to generate EBITDA move. And certainly, the piece that we control, we know we'll be moving and we'll provide details next week. And as far as the market, we're still watching that to see how that evolves. But we'll be more focused on what we're doing to drive our mid-cycle going forward.\nDoug Leggate : I understand. We'll wait until next week.\nOperator: Next question will be from Neil Mehta at Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta : Yes. I wanted to start off on the waterfall on Slide 20 of the deck in the Central Corridor. Really exceptional capture rates in that region. And I was wondering if there's anything unusual in there if there's something structural that we should capitalize, as I know that other bucket can be -- move around a bunch. And how much did WCS help this quarter? Or given the fact that it typically comes in at a lag, is that more of a 4Q tailwind?\nMark Lashier : Yes, Neil, we're very pleased with the Central Corridor performance. There are a number of factors that differentiated the second quarter to the third quarter and a number of things that happened in the third quarter. I'll let Rich dive into the details around that.\nRich Harbison : Okay, Mark. Neil, good question. And yes, the Mid-Con Central Corridor had a very good quarter. Let me start by resetting the basis for the second quarter. Second quarter for us was a heavy turnaround in this region. So a lot of the difference you're seeing is the lack of turnarounds in the third quarter. Our mechanical availability during the third quarter was very good. We had high utilizations sitting at around 93% and strong clean product yields sitting at 88% for the corridor. So good performance on both of those. Of course, those directly relate to increased volumes. And with the lack of turnarounds, we had a lot lower operating expense for the quarter as well. As you indicated as well, Neil, the market conditions were quite favorable for our kit. We saw widening Canadian spreads which are quite favorable for us as well as a very strong distillate crack in the region. And that also plays well for our kit, which is a strong distillate producer. So I think what you're seeing here is a strong operating performance in favorable market conditions playing out for us in the third quarter.\nNeil Mehta : Yes. And maybe we could stay on that point around Western Canadian crude. It has been pretty wide here and it's widened out in the curve for '23 as well. So would love your guys' perspective on what you think is going on there. And given it does tend to come in at a lag, should we see a disproportionate impact of that tailwind in Q4?\nBrian Mandell : Neil, this is Brian. I'll start by saying that WCS started weakening with unplanned maintenance. WCS was forced into the Gulf Coast and then forced to compete with SPR barrels. We've released about 180 million barrels of SPR crude. Most of that has been sour so we competed with WCS. High sulfur fuel oil has also been weak and it competes as well, given weaker bunker demand and the end of summer utility burn. And also, generally, WCS is purchased by Asia and India, and they were out buying euros, Russian crude, so they weren't buying as much.  And finally, WCS has a high naphtha cut, and that naphtha has been very, very weak because of the Chemicals business. So that also caused some pressure. So currently, WCS is at about $30 differential. Q4, if you look at the forward curve is at $26 off and next year is about $23 off. So we assume that it will continue to be weak and the market players also feel the same way.\nOperator: Next question is from Roger Read at Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read : I guess I'd like to maybe take a shot here at the Chemicals side of things. So obviously, kind of the softer results and coming off what was an impressive sort of '21, early '22 run. You mentioned FID for the Gulf Coast and then also the Ras Laffan opportunity. Does the weakness in Chemicals here at all imperil your timing on decision of FID? Or does it have any impact whatsoever?\nMark Lashier : Thanks, Roger. That's a great question. I think that CPChem has a long history of focusing on the long-term fundamentals. And they never tried to time any particular cyclic movements to drive their growth plans. They've always focused on capturing advantaged feedstocks and maintain their global market presence. And that's what they're doing here as well. Frankly, if you look back in history, the projects that have just happened to be countercyclical, where the investments made when there was a downturn, they tend to come online when things are turning back up and that's beneficial to the economics, then we -- it looks like that may be the case here. You can never predict when things will turn around, but it will take about four years to execute each of those projects. And so yes, it will be what does the crystal ball say in that time frame. But we focus on those long-term fundamentals and what we see as kind of a mid-cycle margin for those opportunities.\nRoger Read : That makes sense. And then my other question on the Marketing business. You had an exceptional Q2 and now in an even more exceptional Q3. Any kind of background on what's going on there? And are the fundamentals that created the last two quarters showing any signs of reversing here?\nBrian Mandell : Sure, Roger. Brian again. Maybe I'll start by saying that our diverse geographic portfolio with business both here in the U.S. and in Western Europe and our diverse channels of trade. We have unbranded, branded and retail help us when we think about our Marketing business. But Q3, a number of things that we saw that helped the business. In Germany, it was a tax holiday starting in January 1 and ending at the end of August. Also overseas, the low Rhine and the one Austrian refinery down actually helped us and generally helps us. We have alternative supply at MiRO Refinery there in the South of Germany, which helps us particularly in the south of Germany. And our exchange agreement terms also give us a competitive advantage. We had the general falling of spot prices, which helped us. Shortage of Russian distillate in the market as well helped us internationally. And then I would say, conversely, in the U.S., we actually saw margins come off in Q3 from Q2. But overall, we had a very good quarter.\nOperator: Next question will be from Ryan Todd at Piper Sandler.\nRyan Todd : Maybe if I could ask one on kind of Atlantic Basin dynamics. European refining, you're exposed to European refining, spent a lot of volatility in recent months there with natural gas prices. The systems have had to adjust and have adjusted a decent amount. Looking forward, you've got a crude import ban that's about to go into effect and then potentially a product import ban early next year. Any thoughts as you look forward to how these dynamics play out both for your asset and the region overall and how this may impact Atlantic Basin balances over the next six months?\nMark Lashier : Yes. This is Mark. I'll come in at a high level, then I'll let Rich and Brian follow up. But I think generally, those are constructive for us. It's -- I think it could strengthen our position, particularly around distillates and it's going from strength to strength. But I will let Brian and Rich comment on the details.\nBrian Mandell : Maybe I'll start with the macro and Rich can talk more about our assets. But clearly, the market around the world is tight, particularly on distillates. In the U.S., we're under 2015 to 2019 ranges by 22% inventories. That's -- that was a very, very weak inventories, given that we're starting to go into the winter season. Refineries around the world are making diesel over gasoline currently. So there are a lot of things that may take some of the edge off and alleviate some of the stress on the market. First around the world, we're coming back from turnarounds here in the U.S. and elsewhere. The Chinese have increased their quotas so you'll see more gasoline and diesel on the market in Asia. The French refinery strikes are coming to an end, so those refineries will be back up. And then we're seeing kind of moderate weather forecast for both the U.S. and Europe. So why we'd expect the margins to remain strong, and I think the ultimate moderator for those margins will be demand.\nRich Harbison : Yes, I don't -- this is Rich. I really don't have much to add to that other than from a Refining perspective, of course, the natural gas price will drive up our operating expenses. And we will see higher feedstock costs as this market evolves here into the future and these sanctions go into play. So how that all sails out will be interesting.\nRyan Todd : Great. And then I don't -- this may step into what you plan on talking about next week, but regarding the buy-in of the remainder of DCP, I don't know if you have any comment on potential timing for closure deal there. But beyond that, can you -- maybe a reminder of how you're thinking about the incremental benefits of the kind of the consolidated position there, either from a financial free cash flow point of view or operational synergies that come along with closure of that deal? And how that may impact your ability to buy back stock in the near term and the longer term?\nMark Lashier : At a high level, Ryan, that -- the process is underway. We are negotiating with independent directors that represent the unitholders. And I will just say that we need to let that process play out. It's better to get the right number than to get a quick number. And as far as the strategic dynamics, Tim can talk more about that, but it really is about driving this wellhead to market strategy that we really believe will create a lot of long-term value and opportunity for Phillips 66. Tim, do you want to comment on that?\nTim Roberts : Yes, I think that's right. We -- Mark, thanks. Exactly right. I think there's a couple of things and I want to make a point is that we do believe in integration, no different than what we see in our integration on our Refining, Marketing, Commercial business and Midstream. We see the same thing in the NGL natural gas space. So this allows us to set up that framework to do that, especially in key basins, namely the Permian and DJ. So we really like that, but I think it's probably also worth commenting on that, yes, we want to get the buy-in done and get that behind us and really capture that full value. Really the important part for us, and we've already started the integration, so we are starting the integration, and we are pushing down the road as well to identify what the opportunities are going to be that really are going to position this both from a cost standpoint as well as the ability to compete and create more value, which we're -- as soon as we get the buy-in done, we can talk a lot more about what that potential is going to be.\nOperator: Next question will be from John Royall at JPMorgan.\nJohn Royall : So on the buyback, I think we'll probably have to wait until post DCP to have a real kind of go-forward framework. But for now, you did have a pretty big number in 3Q that I think surprised some people. And so can you talk about the short-term kind of push-pull between the buyback and then maybe conserving cash for the upcoming deal with DCP and how you think about that?\nMark Lashier : At a high level, John, we are committed to buybacks. We had to hold back in the second quarter due to a blackout period. And so that kind of held us back for a bit. But what you saw last quarter is just a signal that we are serious about buybacks. And I'll let Kevin talk about the balance between what it will require to execute the roll-up of DCP versus share repurchases. But we have got a solid plan. And like a broken record, I'll say you'll hear more about it at Investor Day.\nKevin Mitchell : Yes, John. So in terms of the DCP roll-up, our expectation is that will be a combination of debt issuance and cash on hand we'll use to fund that. And to my earlier comments, I feel pretty confident that with where the balance sheet sits with the cash position we have, with the cash generation we have, we'll be able to manage that in terms of -- yes, we will want to subsequently reduce debt. But with the overall cash position, we should be in a position to continue to return significant amounts of cash to shareholders. So I'm not too concerned that the DCP transaction is going to negatively impact our ability to buy back shares.\nJohn Royall : Okay. And then apologies to repeat a prior question, but I was just thinking through your commentary on the strength in Central Corridor. And correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm not sure if the things you guys talked about necessarily address the Other bar, flipping from negative 8 to positive 4.50 going from 2Q to 3Q. So apologies if I missed this, but if you could go through the dynamics in that Other bar specifically, that would be really helpful.\nTim Roberts : Okay, let's see. In the Other bar in the Atlantic or in the Central Coast area, we're really looking at some RIN costs in there and some inventory timing issues are the two primary drivers of that, that bar there, John.\nOperator: Next question will be from Matthew Blair at TPH.\nMatthew Blair : Your Chems results came down but they really outperformed peers in the third quarter. Is this just as simple as you don't have Europe exposure and pretty much all your peers do? Was there anything else that we should look at? And I guess what's your outlook for Q4?\nMark Lashier : Yes. Thanks, Matt. That's a great question. We've talked to the folks at CPChem about that. I think part of it is that lack of European capacity though. Though we do, the Middle East assets do supply a lot of volume into Europe but they continue to perform well. The interesting thing is others have had to cut back production in North America, CPChem continued strong production. They had some unplanned outage but no intentional cutbacks. And I think that reflects their cost position. They didn't have to cut back to contain inventory. They didn't have to cut back due to economics. They had -- they ran strong and were profitable. And part of that is they're heavy into high-density polyethylene and the dynamics there are a little different than linear low-density polyethylene. And those that were cutting back were more exposed to that segment of the market. So I think they're -- while no one's having any fun in that environment right now, they are positioned a little -- to be a little more productive during this difficult time. And then as far as the fourth quarter, fourth quarter is typically soft and we continue to see this new capacity that's coming online being digested. Margins have gone down. Marker margins have gone down to just about the breakpoint. So I think as you see people that have cut back, as you see them signaling to the market that they need prices to go up and polyethylene to continue to provide what is needed in the marketplace, it's sounding feeling like it's kind of hit bottom. We'll probably see it hit bottom in the fourth quarter and then slowly recover. It will take a couple more quarters to really -- to see a lot of movement upward, but I think you're seeing those signs of bottoming out.\nMatthew Blair : Sounds good. And then could you talk about octane spreads? They have been really quite strong recently. Is this just a function of Tier 3 impacts rolling through the market? And could you also remind me on what Phillips' exposure to premium gasoline is?\nBrian Mandell : Yes. Generally, when you have weak naphtha, Matt, you have high or large octane spreads, and naphtha's been very, very weak so gasoline blenders need the octane to blend into the gasoline to make finished grade. And I would say that like most marketers, we're about 11% or 12% on our premium in our Marketing business.\nOperator: Next question will be from Paul Cheng at Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng : Two questions, please. First, with the latest news from Biden talking about the oil industry with the windfall profit tax, just wondering that your people in D.C., when they talk to the senator, what's your guess is whether there will be sufficient vote in the Senate for them to pass that, if the President does propose one? The second question is that, want to see what is your R&D strategy, renewable diesel strategy beyond the retail conversion that you're currently doing? I mean, that over -- I mean, it was -- the first phase will come onstream soon and then full completion probably in 2024. And so wanted to see that beyond that, that is going to be one-off or let's say, more maybe that strategy going forward on that?\nMark Lashier : Yes. Thanks, Paul. This is Mark. Your first question, we've been, along with the rest of our peers in the industry, engaged with the Biden administration around the challenges that they see in the marketplace. And it's earnings season, a lot of integrated oils are coming out with very, very solid results. And I think that's the target of the President's latest comments. Our view is when we get off of the public rhetoric and engage with them to address the issues of inventories and supply and cost and price. It's been constructive. And they know that they have to proceed with caution because things that they try to do could disrupt the markets even more. And they are listening and they are taking into account the advice that we've been giving them along with our peers. You have to remember that there's an election next week, and I think that there's going to be a lot of rhetoric right up to that point in time.\nOperator: Next question will be...\nMark Lashier : Oh, I'm sorry, Paul. I was so focused on that first question, I forgot to answer your second question, Paul. Renewable diesel strategy. Yes. Obviously, the first step is the successful execution and commissioning of the Rodeo Renewed project. We've -- we put our toe in the water there with a small unit at the San Francisco refinery. We call it Unit 250. That's been quite successful in the marketplace. We are involved in aggregating feedstocks, both in preparation for Rodeo as well as our Humber facility. We're producing renewable fuels there, including sustainable aviation fuel. Rodeo will provide some sustainable aviation fuel as well. And so we kind of look at that business as renewable fuels, not just renewable diesel. And we're taking a hard look at options around sustainable aviation fuel. Certainly, the IRA Act was supportive of SAF. And we've got some thoughts there that we're looking at. Bottom line is we're going to -- whatever we do, we're going to be incredibly disciplined, and we've got to ensure that we've got a competitive advantage when we go off in these directions, that we've got line of sight on feedstocks and that we've got the right capital cost when we execute these projects. So that's the primary focus, not just getting bigger but being better in every one of those things that we do.\nOperator: Our last question is from Jason Gabelman at Cowen.\nJason Gabelman : I just wanted to ask on the cash flow since you didn't provide some of the detail that you typically do on the cash flow walk. Can you just discuss some of the items that impacted your cash from operations, working capital and otherwise that could have impacted cash conversion? And then secondly, there were some -- and this maybe front-running something that you may discuss next week, but there were some reports about reducing headcount and optimizing the workforce. Can you just discuss any plans that you have around doing that and improvement in cost as a result?\nMark Lashier : Yes, Kevin will touch on the cash flow detail. I'll talk about those reports on headcount.\nKevin Mitchell : Yes, Jason. In terms of operating cash flow, that detail will be available next week at the time -- early next week when we file the 10-Q. But what I would say, I know there's a lot of interest in working capital and we're still finalizing that level of detail. But what I would say is, based on everything we've seen to date, we don't think that working capital was a very significant component of operating cash flow. So there'll be a working capital impact, but it will be pretty minor relative to some of the other numbers that you have seen out there. And I'll just leave it at that.\nMark Lashier : Yes. On the -- Jason, on the headcount issue, yes, we've been focused on our business transformation for well over a year now, and this is a facet of that work, and we've been executing that portion of the work. It's material. We will provide more details next week at Investor Day. I think though, it's a clear signal of our commitment to lower our cost, to eliminate unnecessary work, to have an optimal organization to go forward in what is an ever-changing volatile environment that we did execution reduction in force during the best two quarters in our history.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference -- sorry, question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the call back over to Jeff.\nJeff Dietert : We thank all of you for your interest in Phillips 66. If you have questions on today's call, please call Shannon and me. And we look forward to seeing many of you at the Investor Day next week. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. You may now begin -- you may now disconnect your lines. Thank you.",

            "content": "Thanks, Jeff. Our third quarter results reflect the continued favorable market environment and our strong operating performance. We ran at high rates during the summer driving season to meet peak demand for critical transportation fuels. Our Refining business delivered improved market capture this quarter, supported by strong distillate cracks and wider discounts for heavy sour crudes. In the third quarter, we had adjusted earnings of $3.1 billion or $6.46 per share. We generated $3.1 billion in operating cash flow. We're committed to strong shareholder distributions. During the quarter, we ramped up share repurchases in a meaningful way, purchasing almost $700 million of common stock. Including dividends, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders. During the quarter, we continued to focus on operating excellence and advancing our strategic priorities. Our enterprise-wide business transformation is underway. The team is implementing key initiatives to deliver results. We look forward to providing more details at our Investor Day next week. In Midstream, we realigned our economic and governance interest in DCP Midstream, LP and Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC. Our economic interest in DCP Midstream increased to 43%, and our economic interest in Gray Oak Pipeline decreased to 6.5%. At the same time, we made an offer to acquire all publicly-held common units of DCP Midstream, LP. Our increased interest in DCP Midstream allows for further integration and optimization across our NGL business. The wellhead to market value chain structure will allow us to capture new commercial opportunities and optimize costs. Additionally, we started up Frac 4 at the Sweeny Hub on time and under budget. In October, Frac 4 achieved full run rates, bringing our total Sweeny Hub fractionation capacity to 550,000 barrels per day. CPChem is pursuing a portfolio of high-return projects, enhancing its asset base as well as optimizing its existing operations. This includes growing its normal alpha olefins business with a second world-scale unit to produce 1-hexene, a critical component in high-performance polyethylene. The unit is being constructed at CPChem's Old Ocean, Texas facility and will produce 586 million pounds per year. CPChem is also building a new propylene splitter at its Cedar Bayou facility, which will expand its capacity by 1 billion pounds per year. Both the 1-hexene and propylene splitter projects are expected to start up in the second half of 2023. CPChem continues to develop two world-scale petrochemical facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Ras Laffan, Qatar. A final investment decision for the U.S. Gulf Coast project is expected before the end of this year. In Refining, we're converting our San Francisco refinery into one of the world's largest renewable fuels facilities. The Rodeo Renewed project is expected to cost approximately $850 million and begin commercial operations in the first quarter of 2024. Upon completion, Rodeo will have over 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuels production capacity.  Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results. Yes, Doug, we are going to cover that a bit next week. I think that there's two things to take into consideration there. What -- as the market mid-cycle moves, it has our ability to generate EBITDA move. And certainly, the piece that we control, we know we'll be moving and we'll provide details next week. And as far as the market, we're still watching that to see how that evolves. But we'll be more focused on what we're doing to drive our mid-cycle going forward. Yes, Neil, we're very pleased with the Central Corridor performance. There are a number of factors that differentiated the second quarter to the third quarter and a number of things that happened in the third quarter. I'll let Rich dive into the details around that. Thanks, Roger. That's a great question. I think that CPChem has a long history of focusing on the long-term fundamentals. And they never tried to time any particular cyclic movements to drive their growth plans. They've always focused on capturing advantaged feedstocks and maintain their global market presence. And that's what they're doing here as well. Frankly, if you look back in history, the projects that have just happened to be countercyclical, where the investments made when there was a downturn, they tend to come online when things are turning back up and that's beneficial to the economics, then we -- it looks like that may be the case here. You can never predict when things will turn around, but it will take about four years to execute each of those projects. And so yes, it will be what does the crystal ball say in that time frame. But we focus on those long-term fundamentals and what we see as kind of a mid-cycle margin for those opportunities. Yes. This is Mark. I'll come in at a high level, then I'll let Rich and Brian follow up. But I think generally, those are constructive for us. It's -- I think it could strengthen our position, particularly around distillates and it's going from strength to strength. But I will let Brian and Rich comment on the details. At a high level, Ryan, that -- the process is underway. We are negotiating with independent directors that represent the unitholders. And I will just say that we need to let that process play out. It's better to get the right number than to get a quick number. And as far as the strategic dynamics, Tim can talk more about that, but it really is about driving this wellhead to market strategy that we really believe will create a lot of long-term value and opportunity for Phillips 66. Tim, do you want to comment on that? At a high level, John, we are committed to buybacks. We had to hold back in the second quarter due to a blackout period. And so that kind of held us back for a bit. But what you saw last quarter is just a signal that we are serious about buybacks. And I'll let Kevin talk about the balance between what it will require to execute the roll-up of DCP versus share repurchases. But we have got a solid plan. And like a broken record, I'll say you'll hear more about it at Investor Day. Yes. Thanks, Matt. That's a great question. We've talked to the folks at CPChem about that. I think part of it is that lack of European capacity though. Though we do, the Middle East assets do supply a lot of volume into Europe but they continue to perform well. The interesting thing is others have had to cut back production in North America, CPChem continued strong production. They had some unplanned outage but no intentional cutbacks. And I think that reflects their cost position. They didn't have to cut back to contain inventory. They didn't have to cut back due to economics. They had -- they ran strong and were profitable. And part of that is they're heavy into high-density polyethylene and the dynamics there are a little different than linear low-density polyethylene. And those that were cutting back were more exposed to that segment of the market. So I think they're -- while no one's having any fun in that environment right now, they are positioned a little -- to be a little more productive during this difficult time. And then as far as the fourth quarter, fourth quarter is typically soft and we continue to see this new capacity that's coming online being digested. Margins have gone down. Marker margins have gone down to just about the breakpoint. So I think as you see people that have cut back, as you see them signaling to the market that they need prices to go up and polyethylene to continue to provide what is needed in the marketplace, it's sounding feeling like it's kind of hit bottom. We'll probably see it hit bottom in the fourth quarter and then slowly recover. It will take a couple more quarters to really -- to see a lot of movement upward, but I think you're seeing those signs of bottoming out. Yes. Thanks, Paul. This is Mark. Your first question, we've been, along with the rest of our peers in the industry, engaged with the Biden administration around the challenges that they see in the marketplace. And it's earnings season, a lot of integrated oils are coming out with very, very solid results. And I think that's the target of the President's latest comments. Our view is when we get off of the public rhetoric and engage with them to address the issues of inventories and supply and cost and price. It's been constructive. And they know that they have to proceed with caution because things that they try to do could disrupt the markets even more. And they are listening and they are taking into account the advice that we've been giving them along with our peers. You have to remember that there's an election next week, and I think that there's going to be a lot of rhetoric right up to that point in time. Oh, I'm sorry, Paul. I was so focused on that first question, I forgot to answer your second question, Paul. Renewable diesel strategy. Yes. Obviously, the first step is the successful execution and commissioning of the Rodeo Renewed project. We've -- we put our toe in the water there with a small unit at the San Francisco refinery. We call it Unit 250. That's been quite successful in the marketplace. We are involved in aggregating feedstocks, both in preparation for Rodeo as well as our Humber facility. We're producing renewable fuels there, including sustainable aviation fuel. Rodeo will provide some sustainable aviation fuel as well. And so we kind of look at that business as renewable fuels, not just renewable diesel. And we're taking a hard look at options around sustainable aviation fuel. Certainly, the IRA Act was supportive of SAF. And we've got some thoughts there that we're looking at. Bottom line is we're going to -- whatever we do, we're going to be incredibly disciplined, and we've got to ensure that we've got a competitive advantage when we go off in these directions, that we've got line of sight on feedstocks and that we've got the right capital cost when we execute these projects. So that's the primary focus, not just getting bigger but being better in every one of those things that we do. Yes, Kevin will touch on the cash flow detail. I'll talk about those reports on headcount. Yes. On the -- Jason, on the headcount issue, yes, we've been focused on our business transformation for well over a year now, and this is a facet of that work, and we've been executing that portion of the work. It's material. We will provide more details next week at Investor Day. I think though, it's a clear signal of our commitment to lower our cost, to eliminate unnecessary work, to have an optimal organization to go forward in what is an ever-changing volatile environment that we did execution reduction in force during the best two quarters in our history."

            "name": "Kevin Mitchell",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark, and hello, everyone. Before I talk about the financials, let me begin by summarizing the accounting impacts of DCP Midstream. On August 17, we completed the merger of DCP Midstream, LLC and Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC. In connection with the transaction, we were delegated governance rights over DCP Midstream, LP and its general partner entities as well as DCP Sand Hills Pipeline, LLC and DCP Southern Hills Pipeline, LLC. Effective August 18, our financial results reflect the consolidation of these entities. So starting with an overview on Slide 4, we summarize these financial results. We reported third quarter earnings of $5.4 billion. We had special items amounting to an after-tax gain of $2.3 billion, including the net gain related to the consolidation of DCP Midstream, Sand Hills Pipeline and Southern Hills Pipeline and the transfer of interest in Gray Oak Pipeline. Excluding special items, adjusted earnings were $3.1 billion or $6.46 per share. The $33 million decrease in the fair value of our investment in NOVONIX reduced earnings per share by $0.05. We generated $3.1 billion of operating cash flow. Capital spending for the quarter was $735 million, including the company's $306 million investment in DCP Midstream, LLC associated with the merger, net of cash acquired. We returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through $466 million of dividends and $694 million of share repurchases. We ended the quarter with 473 million shares outstanding. Moving to Slide 5. This slide highlights the change in adjusted results by segment from the second quarter to the third quarter, including the impact of consolidating DCP Midstream, Sand Hills Pipeline and Southern Hills Pipeline effective August 18. The Midstream segment, Corporate and Other, income taxes and noncontrolling interests are impacted by the consolidations. The higher noncontrolling interest reflects the portion of these entities not owned by Phillips 66. During the period, adjusted earnings decreased $163 million, mostly due to lower results in Refining and Chemicals, partially offset by higher Midstream and Marketing and Specialties results. Slide 6 shows our Midstream results. Third quarter adjusted pretax income was $645 million compared with $292 million in the previous quarter. The consolidation of DCP Midstream results are now reported within NGL and Other. Transportation contributed adjusted pretax income of $229 million, down $21 million from the prior quarter. The decrease was mainly due to lower equity earnings from the Gray Oak Pipeline resulting from the merger. NGL and Other adjusted pretax income was $449 million compared with $282 million in the second quarter. The increase was primarily due to the consolidation of DCP Midstream, Sand Hills Pipeline and Southern Hills Pipeline effective August 18. The fractionators at the Sweeny Hub averaged 429,000 barrels per day, and the Freeport LPG export facility loaded 249,000 barrels per day in the third quarter. Our NOVONIX investment is marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period. The fair value of the investment, including foreign exchange impacts, decreased $33 million in the third quarter compared with a decrease of $240 million in the second quarter. Turning to Chemicals on Slide 7. Chemicals had third quarter adjusted pretax income of $135 million compared with $273 million in the previous quarter. Olefins and Polyolefins adjusted pretax income was $105 million. The $111 million decrease from the previous quarter was primarily due to lower margins resulting from a sharp decline in polyethylene prices. This was partially offset by lower turnaround costs. Global O&P utilization was 90% for the quarter. Adjusted pretax income for SA&S was $60 million, in line with the second quarter. The higher costs in Other mainly reflect legal contingencies. During the third quarter, we received $41 million in cash distributions from CPChem. Turning to Refining on Slide 8. Refining third quarter adjusted pretax income was $2.8 billion, down from $3.1 billion in the second quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower realized margins, partially offset by higher volumes. Our realized margins decreased by 6% to $26.58 per barrel, while the composite global 3:2:1 market crack decreased by 22%. Pretax turnaround costs were $225 million, in line with the previous quarter. Crude utilization was 91% in the third quarter and clean product yield was 85%. Slide 9 covers market capture. Our composite global 3:2:1 market crack for the third quarter was $36.29 per barrel compared to $46.72 per barrel in the second quarter. Realized margin was $26.58 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 73%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 61%. Market capture is impacted by the configuration of our refineries. We have a higher distillate yield and lower gasoline yield than the 3:2:1 market indicator. During the third quarter, the distillate crack decreased $8.14 per barrel, and the gasoline crack decreased $11.84 per barrel. Losses from secondary products of $3.50 per barrel or $0.47 per barrel higher than the previous quarter. Our feedstock loss of $1.48 per barrel was in line with the previous quarter. Feedstock advantage from widening heavy sour crude differentials was offset by the impact of higher feedstock costs relative to dated Brent in the Atlantic Basin. The other category reduced realized margins by $1.29 per barrel. This category includes RINs, freight costs, in-product realizations and inventory impacts. Moving to Marketing and Specialties on Slide 10. Adjusted third quarter pretax income was $847 million compared with $765 million in the prior quarter. Marketing and Other adjusted pretax income was $717 million, up $61 million from the second quarter. The improvement reflects higher international margins, partially offset by lower domestic results, including inventory impacts. Specialties generated third quarter adjusted pretax income of $130 million. The $21 million increase was largely due to improved base oil margins. On Slide 12, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted pretax costs of $246 million, $11 million higher than the prior quarter. The increase was mainly due to consolidating DCP Midstream interest expense of $34 million, partially offset by higher interest income. Slide 12 shows the change in cash during the third quarter. We started the quarter with a $2.8 billion cash balance. Cash from operations was $3.1 billion. During the quarter, we funded $735 million of capital spending, including the company's $306 million investment in DCP Midstream, LLC associated with the merger, net of cash acquired. We returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our ending cash balance was $3.7 billion. We ended the quarter with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 29%, including the consolidation of DCP Midstream. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In Chemicals, we expect the fourth quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the fourth quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low to mid-90s and pretax turnaround expenses to be between $180 million and $220 million. As a result of strong turnaround execution and timing, we expect full year turnaround expenses to be lower than our original $800 million to $900 million of guidance. We anticipate fourth quarter Corporate and Other costs to come in between $300 million and $325 million pretax, reflecting a full quarter of DCP Midstream interest expense.  Now we will open the line for questions. Yes, Doug, thanks. It's a good question. So we feel pretty good that even with consolidation of DCP, that debt-to-capital ratio, net of cash, is sub-30%. So we feel good about the metric from that standpoint. And also, if you just look at debt-to-EBITDA metrics, they're still very strong. But the reality is it's $17.8 billion, circa $18 billion of debt on a fully consolidated basis. And so I think given the overall financial position we're in, the cash generation that we have, you'll see us continue to do some debt reduction. Bear in mind, we haven't yet funded the buy-in of the public, so that puts more pressure on the balance sheet regardless of how we actually execute on that funding between debt and cash. And so we'll continue to want to make some debt reductions. But the difference now between where we were over the last couple of years, where we're trying to get rid of the pandemic debt that we had added is, we don't need to make debt reduction the #1 priority for discretionary cash. Cash generation, cash balances are sufficient that we'll be able to do some -- gradually chip away at the debt balance and, at the same time, continue to return a healthy amount of cash to shareholders. Yes, John. So in terms of the DCP roll-up, our expectation is that will be a combination of debt issuance and cash on hand we'll use to fund that. And to my earlier comments, I feel pretty confident that with where the balance sheet sits with the cash position we have, with the cash generation we have, we'll be able to manage that in terms of -- yes, we will want to subsequently reduce debt. But with the overall cash position, we should be in a position to continue to return significant amounts of cash to shareholders. So I'm not too concerned that the DCP transaction is going to negatively impact our ability to buy back shares. Yes, Jason. In terms of operating cash flow, that detail will be available next week at the time -- early next week when we file the 10-Q. But what I would say, I know there's a lot of interest in working capital and we're still finalizing that level of detail. But what I would say is, based on everything we've seen to date, we don't think that working capital was a very significant component of operating cash flow. So there'll be a working capital impact, but it will be pretty minor relative to some of the other numbers that you have seen out there. And I'll just leave it at that."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jeff Dietert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Jeff, you may begin.\nJeff Dietert: Good morning, and welcome to Phillips 66 second quarter earnings conference call. Participants on today's call will include Mark Lashier, President and CEO; Kevin Mitchell, EVP and CFO; Brian Mandell, EVP, Marketing and Commercial; Tim Roberts, EVP, Midstream; and Rich Harbison, SVP, Refining. Today's presentation materials can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website, along with supplemental financial and operating information. Slide 2 contains our safe harbor statement. We will be making forward-looking statements during today's call. Actual results may differ materially from today's comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here as well as in our SEC filings. Before we begin our discussion, I would like to highlight that we will be hosting an Investor Day in New York on November 9. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark.\nMark Lashier: Thanks, Jeff. It's great to be here with you today as President and CEO. As I shared with our employees, it's an honor and a privilege to be taking on this role. And I'm happy to be a part of the strong leadership team and humbled by the opportunity to lead such a great company. I'd also like to introduce Rich Harbison, our new Senior Vice President of Refining. Rich has over 30 years of experience in a variety of leadership roles across our refining, pipeline and terminal organizations. Most recently, he was Vice President of the San Francisco Refinery, where he oversaw the Rodeo Renewed project. Our second quarter results reflect the strong market environment driven by a tight global supply and demand balance. We're focused on reliably providing critical energy products, including transportation fuels to meet demand. We've maintained strong operations in successfully completing our spring turnaround activities early in the second quarter. Even with global refineries running near max capacities, gasoline and distillate inventories remain low, supporting elevated refining margins. In the second quarter, we had adjusted earnings of $3.3 billion or $6.77 per share. We generated $1.8 billion in operating cash flow. Excluding working capital, operating cash flow was $3.6 billion. We returned $533 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We resumed our share repurchase program in the second quarter and remain committed to a secure, competitive and growing dividend. In May, we raised our dividend 5% to $0.97 per share. We've increased the dividend 11 times since our inception in 2012, resulting in an 18% compound annual growth rate. Our strategy remains consistent, supported by a strong foundation of operating excellence and a high-performing organization. We're focused on strategic return-enhancing growth investments in Midstream, Chemicals and Emerging Energy while selectively investing to increase returns in Refining and Marketing and Specialties. We continue to target a long-term capital allocation framework of 60% reinvestment in the business and 40% cash returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We've been successful in reducing pandemic debt, including paying down $1.5 billion of debt during the second quarter. In addition, we believe higher cash levels are prudent, given the current uncertain economic environment. We're executing an enterprise-wide business transformation to achieve sustained annual cost savings of at least $700 million. David Erfert, Senior Vice President and Chief Transformation Officer, has been leading the effort across our organization with engagement from over 1,000 employees. Initiatives are being implemented to position us for the future and ensure we remain competitive in any economic scenario. We look forward to sharing more details on our business transformation at our Investor Day in November. During the quarter, we continued to focus on operating excellence and advancing our strategic initiatives. In Midstream, at the Sweeny Hub, we expect Frac 4 to start up late this quarter. The total project cost for Frac 4 is expected to be approximately $525 million. CPChem is pursuing a portfolio of high-return projects, enhancing its asset base as well as optimizing its existing operations. CPChem's total capital budget for 2022 is $1.4 billion, of which $1 billion is for growth projects with average expected returns above 20%. This includes growing its normal alpha olefins business with a second world-scale unit to produce 1-hexene, a critical component of high-performance polyethylene. Construction is underway on the 586 million pounds per year unit located in Old Ocean, Texas. CPChem is also building a new propylene splitter at its Cedar Bayou facility, which will expand its capacity by 1 billion pounds per year. Both the 1-hexene and propylene splitter projects are expected to start up in the second half of 2023. Recently, CPChem announced plans to double its polyolefins capacity in Belgium to approximately 265 million pounds per year, with start-up expected in 2024. CPChem continues to develop 2 world-scale petrochemical facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Ras Laffan, Qatar. A final investment decision for the U.S. Gulf Coast project is expected this year. In Refining, we made a final investment decision to move forward with our Rodeo Renewed project to convert our San Francisco refinery into one of the world's largest renewable fuels facilities. The project is expected to cost approximately $850 million and begin commercial operations in the first quarter of 2024. Upon completion, Rodeo will have over 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuels production capacity. In addition, the conversion is projected to reduce life cycle carbon emissions by approximately 65% or the equivalent of permanently removing 1.4 million cars from California roads. In July, we formed JET H2 Energy Austria, a 50-50 joint venture with H2 Energy Europe to develop up to 250 retail hydrogen refueling stations across Germany, Austria and Denmark by 2026. Recently, we published our 2022 Sustainability Report, providing a comprehensive look at our actions to both prepare Phillips 66 to thrive in the energy future and deliver on our commitment to being one of the industry's best operators. The report includes a detailed analysis of the company's climate-related risks and opportunities as well as performance data on various environmental, social and governance matters. Before we review the financial results, we'd like to recognize our employees' commitment to operating excellence. We're honored that our Midstream business was awarded the American Petroleum Institute's Distinguished Pipeline Safety Award for large operators for the second consecutive year. In addition, Midstream received the Platinum Safety Award in the large company division from the International Liquid Terminals Association. Congratulations to all the people working at these facilities. Well done. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results.\nKevin Mitchell : Thank you, Mark, and hello, everyone. Starting with an overview on Slide 4, we summarize our financial results for the second quarter. Adjusted earnings were $3.3 billion or $6.77 per share. A $240 million decrease in the fair value of our investment in NOVONIX reduced earnings per share by $0.38. We generated $1.8 billion of operating cash flow, including a working capital use of $1.8 billion. Cash distributions from equity affiliates were $527 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $376 million, including $167 million for growth projects. We returned $533 million to shareholders through $460 million of dividends and $66 million of share repurchases. We ended the quarter with 481 million shares outstanding. Moving to Slide 5. This slide highlights the change in adjusted results by segment from the first quarter to the second quarter. During the period, adjusted earnings increased $2.7 billion with a substantial improvement in Refining. Slide 6 shows our Midstream results. Second quarter adjusted pretax income was $292 million compared with $242 million in the previous quarter. Transportation contributed adjusted pretax income of $250 million, down $28 million from the prior quarter. The decrease was mainly due to lower equity earnings, driven by reduced Bakken crude volumes associated with winter storm impacts. NGL and Other adjusted pretax income was $152 million compared with $91 million in the first quarter. The increase was primarily due to improved margins and volumes at the Sweeny Hub. The margin improvement includes unfavorable inventory impact in the previous quarter. In addition, we had higher Sand Hills Pipeline equity earnings in the second quarter. The fractionators at the Sweeny Hub averaged a record 441,000 barrels per day, and the Freeport LPG export facility loaded 240,000 barrels per day in the second quarter. DCP Midstream adjusted pretax income of $130 million was up $99 million from the previous quarter, mainly driven by improved gathering and processing results and hedging impacts. The hedge gain recognized in the second quarter was approximately $30 million compared with a hedge loss of approximately $50 million in the first quarter. Our NOVONIX investment is marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period. The fair value of the investment, including foreign exchange impacts, decreased $240 million in the second quarter compared to a decrease of $158 million in the first quarter. Turning to Chemicals on Slide 7. Chemicals second quarter adjusted pretax income of $273 million was down $123 million from the prior quarter. Olefins and polyolefins adjusted pretax income was $216 million. The $161 million decrease from the previous quarter was primarily due to lower margins resulting from higher feedstock costs as well as increased utility and turnaround costs. Global O&P utilization was 94% for the quarter. Adjusted pretax income for SA&S was $59 million, up $27 million from the prior quarter. The increase was mainly due to improved margins on benzene and specialty chemicals as well as improved styrene results. The $11 million improvement in Other mainly reflects lower employee-related expenses and higher capitalized interest related to growth projects. During the second quarter, we received $216 million in cash distributions from CPChem. Turning to Refining on Slide 8. Refining's second quarter adjusted pretax income was $3.1 billion, up from $140 million in the first quarter. The improvement was primarily due to higher realized margins across all regions. Realized margins increased by 168% to $28.31 per barrel. Pretax turnaround costs were $223 million, up from $102 million in the prior quarter. Crude utilization was 90% in the second quarter and clean product yield was 83%. Slide 9 covers market capture. Our composite global 3:2:1 market crack for the second quarter was $46.72 per barrel compared to $21.93 per barrel in the first quarter. Realized margin was $28.31 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 61%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 48%. Market capture is impacted by the configuration of our refineries. We have a higher distillate yield and a lower gasoline yield than the market indicator. During the quarter, the distillate crack was $61.38 per barrel, and the gasoline crack was $39.52 per barrel. The configuration impact as a percentage of the market crack was similar to first quarter. Losses from secondary products of $3.03 per barrel were in line with the prior quarter. Our feedstock loss of $1.46 per barrel declined $2.47 per barrel from the previous quarter due to narrowing Canadian crude differentials. The other category reduced realized margins by $7.48 per barrel. This category includes RINs, clean product realizations, freight costs and inventory impacts. Moving to Marketing and Specialties on Slide 10. Adjusted second quarter pretax income was $765 million compared with $316 million in the prior quarter. Marketing and Other increased $453 million from the first quarter. This was primarily due to higher realized fuel margins, including inventory impacts. Refined product exports in the second quarter were 153,000 barrels per day. Specialties generated second quarter adjusted pretax income of $109 million, in line with the previous quarter. Slide 11 shows the change in cash during the second quarter. We started the quarter with a $3.3 billion cash balance. Cash from operations was $3.6 billion, excluding working capital. There was a working capital use of $1.8 billion, mainly reflecting an increase in accounts receivable due to higher product prices and timing of sales. We repaid $1.5 billion of debt, lowering our net debt-to-capital ratio to below 30%, the lowest it has been since the fourth quarter of 2019. In addition, we funded $376 million of capital spending and returned $533 million to shareholders. Our ending cash balance was $2.8 billion. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In Chemicals, we expect the third quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In refining, we expect the third quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low to mid-90s and pretax turnaround expenses to be between $260 million and $290 million. We expect full year pretax turnaround expenses to be at the lower end of our $800 million to $900 million guidance. We anticipate third quarter corporate and other costs to come in between $210 million and $230 million pretax. Now we will open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs, please go ahead.\nNeil Mehta : I wanted to kick off with you, Mark, on your perspective as the new CEO, and congratulations to you, again, on the role. And one of the areas that you've talked about in the past that you think there is an opportunity gap around earnings is to improve the profitability of the Refining segment and some of that came through this quarter, for sure. So I just would love to hear how you're seeing the business transformation. What are the things that you're doing strategically on the ground? And how should we as an investment community evaluate that progress?\nMark Lashier : Thank you, Neil. And it's a great question and I appreciate that. There's a number of dimensions that we're looking at that. You mentioned our business transformation. At a high level, we've mentioned that we're targeting over $700 million in expense reduction, and we're quite confident in that number. There's probably a little upside there, but we're transitioning from analyzing what we can do identifying what we can do to executing. So we're launching into execution as we speak. When you think about Refining, cost is a big piece of what we're doing in Refining and it's a big piece of that whole $700 million. We're looking at things like standardizing across our Refining fleet, how we do things. We're looking at centralizing many of the support functions for our refineries all the way out to looking at how we do maintenance, how we operate and optimize using digital, things that we've implemented to do better maintenance at a lower cost to optimize more aggressively, to identify opportunities quicker. And when you think about the margin capture, it really boils down to utilization, yield, reliability, things like that. And we've got things in flight to address reliability, things to enhance the yields of what we produce and certainly maximize our ability to utilize those assets. All of that -- some of that was in flight before business transformation hit, but all of that will come through in business transformation. And beyond the cost element, we're really pushing the organization from the bottom up to identify opportunities. The folks out on the frontline have a big role in identifying the things that they think are inefficient in what we do and how we can capture those efficiencies and change the way we work. And when you layer on that, the digital things we're putting in place from Wi-Fi in our facilities to different kinds of sensors on our pumps and different processing equipment so we can better monitor them in real-time, it's all going to add up better utilization, pushing that operating envelope even further. And that will enhance our reliability and our yields as we go forward. So there's a number of dimensions that we're pressing on, Neil, and we think they'll all contribute to much stronger competitive performance in our Refining sector.\nNeil Mehta : And maybe the follow-up to that is a little bit more from your term question is how should we think about the refining market conditions right now impacting your 3Q profitability? You're guiding to crude utilization, which is pretty good, low to mid-90s, diesel is trading above gasoline, WCS is winding out. In theory, this should be a good opportunity set for your Refining business.\nMark Lashier : Yes, Neil, we're in alignment in that. We think the fundamentals are strong for our kit going forward and we need to operate very well. We will see some turnarounds come back into the picture later in the year, later in the quarter, but we see an opportunity to run strong. Our assets are in really good shape. And the crude diffs are certainly moving in our favor, and our ability to outperform on distillates versus gasoline will be strong. If you look at the fundamentals around the cost curve between the U.S. and Europe, if you look at the fundamentals around where inventories are, we just can't build any inventory with prompt demand where it is. We're bullish on that outlook as well.\nOperator: Doug Leggate from Bank of America, please go ahead.\nDouglas Leggate : And again, Mark, welcome to the hot seat. I guess it's an interesting time for you for sure.\nMark Lashier : Thanks, Doug.\nDouglas Leggate : This morning, I wonder if I can ask a macro question and a specific question to you on the quarter relating to the relative profitability of Europe compared to your U.S. business. So my macro question is that ExxonMobil this morning kind of laid out their prognosis for capacity additions over the next year or two. And I just wonder if you could offer the Phillips 66 perspective and [indiscernible] business. And I'm just curious if you could share your thoughts on how you see, if there is such a thing, a new normal for this business going forward.\nMark Lashier : You broke up a little bit, Doug. I think the first part of the question was about our view on capacity additions. I'm going to have Jeff address that. And then we may have you repeat the second half because you broke up a little bit.\nJeff Dietert : Yes. Doug, we have between 1.3 million and 1.5 million barrels a day of capacity growth per year in the '22, '23, '24 time frame. Now that will be offset by about half as much capacity that's announced rationalizations that will be coming out of the market, including our Rodeo Renewed that we're converting to a renewable diesel facility. So there will be some capacity growth, but the market is tight, as you know, from the cracks in the marketplace and the inventories today currently.\nDouglas Leggate : Okay. So Jeff, I want [indiscernible]...\nJeff Dietert : You're breaking up a little bit, Doug. Come at us again.\nDouglas Leggate : Okay, I apologize. My phone signal is not best. So I'll try my follow-up. I'm interested in the relative profitability of Humber relative to your U.S. business. I'm thinking specifically about the cost of natural gas in Europe is obviously lifting the cost of European refining. You've got a unique insight to that, I guess, along with [oil]. So I'm just wondering if you could share your perspective on how Humber is doing in this environment. And where you see [indiscernible] perhaps relative to the other European refiners?\nMark Lashier : Yes. I think at a high level, we're happy with Humber's performance. They're doing a number of things really well. They're profitable. I think Rich can provide a little more color on our competitive position there.\nRich Harbison : Yes, certainly. Thanks, Mark. And Doug, good question. And certainly, it's on the minds of a lot of folks right now. The price of natural gas in the European market has gone quite high. Fortunately, for us, the Humber facility has a very mature energy stewardship program. It's been in place for over 20 years in that marketplace. They're a very efficient operation, actually the lowest CO2 emitter in the UK refining systems. They're a very low consumer of purchased natural gas. And in a high natural gas price environment, obviously, there's some impact on their business, right, as far as electricity costs that are externally provided and chemical costs in those areas, which are consistent with the broader industry as well. But primarily, where Humber's advantage is in the operation is that fuel efficiency. And they buy very little to no natural gas for fuel gas supply to the facility.\nDouglas Leggate : And on hydrogen for hydrotreating?\nRich Harbison : Yes. And they consume a little bit of hydrogen but mostly self-generated inside the facility. And that hydrogen price will be impacted a little bit by the natural gas, that's right.\nDouglas Leggate : Also give your perspective on relative clearing costs for Europe versus the U.S., obviously, Humber's advantaged. But generically, how do you see the U.S. versus European trade-off as it relates to the incremental cost of supply, I guess, is what are we getting at.\nBrian Mandell: Generally, for most refiners, we think in somewhere in the $10 to $12 range, we're advantaged versus those refiners. Rich pointed out Humber and where that stands versus other refiners in the market.\nOperator: Roger Read from Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read : Mark, welcome to the role. Maybe to take in a little bit of a forward look, I mean, I know everybody worries about gasoline demand taking a hit. But as mentioned many times, diesel is a bigger part of your kit. And as we look towards the following winter, where do you think we are now in terms of broadly speaking, diesel production, sensitivity, if any, that you've seen on price? And then between either max diesel or max jet or max distillate first gasoline, how that setup looks for you?\nBrian Mandell : Well, thanks, Roger. Maybe I'll take that. This is Brian. It's hard to see a solver for distillate coming up in the winter. We're at low inventories. If you look in the U.S., we're at minus 20% versus 2015 to 2019 averages. We're heading into a turnaround season. Demand is strong. We've seen demand better than 2019 currently. Refiners are running now max distillate, and we have in every pad jet RIN adjusted over distillate prices. We're heading into harvest season. Cost to produce in Europe, as we just talked about, is expensive versus the U.S. so they're not going to be able to help much. We think there's about 150,000 barrels of Russian distillate off the market, which doesn't help much either. So I think as you pointed out, we're distillate-heavy in our system. I think that's going to be a good thing going forward, given our view of distillate.\nRoger Read : And then kind of also leaning into the overall European question. As you look across all of your different operations, so I'm kind of thinking catalysts and some of the specific, maybe metering or valves equipment, within the Refining segment, similar in parts and Midstream in terms of valves and measurement and some of that maybe in chemicals. Do you have any specific exposure to Northern European countries that could face some significant power constraints and thus, some industrial curtailment over the next several quarters, in such a way that it could affect any of your operations, long lead time items you might need for turnarounds? Just trying to sort of gauge the risk, given all the other supply chain and logistics issues we've seen over the last year or two.\nMark Lashier : So I think the question is, Roger, are there specific suppliers, specific manufacturers in Europe that we might have exposure to that could be disrupted as they cut back on natural gas and their ability to manufacture. Is that the question?\nRoger Read : Yes.\nMark Lashier : Rich, do you have a perspective on that?\nRich Harbison : Well, we're certainly seeing supply chain restrictions, lead times taking a little bit longer. But there's no specific supplier that we've identified at this point in time that has us concerned about our ability to continue to conduct our business. In some cases, maybe we're splitting suppliers and are moving to others. But we don't anticipate inside the Refining organization any significant supply chain issues at this point.\nMark Lashier : Yes. I don't think we have any single points of failure in securing any equipment that we might need to keep our operations going.\nOperator: Ryan Todd from Piper Sandler, please go ahead.\nRyan Todd : Maybe a follow-up on some earlier questions. I mean, as you think about kind of capture trends on the Refining side, there have been various things that have been varying degrees of overhang in the first half of the year. As you look into the third quarter, as you think about things like widening crude differentials, the trends in secondary product dynamics, backwardation, et cetera, how would you think about some of the backdrop in terms of Refining capture and where we're trending kind of 3Q versus 2Q and 1Q?\nRich Harbison : This is Rich Harbison here. Market capture in Refining, we had a nice bump over the first quarter, right? 61% market capture, certainly improved over the first quarter. We're working to continue this trajectory. We are -- we'll be subject to some planned maintenance on the backside of the next quarter, that has some potential to impact that market capture. But really, our key is focused on, as Mark indicated earlier in his opening comments, it's around the reliability programs that we're implementing and improving our utilization of the existing facilities, while we also focus on turning our products into the highest value, which are generally clean product yield improvements. So we think that's looking directionally good for us in the third quarter, and also the early indications of the widening light heavy crude differential are also a good tailwind for our kit.\nJeff Dietert : I think one of the things we identified in the first quarter was just some timing issues associated with the rapid increase in crude price. Crude price continued to increase in 2Q, so the direction of crude price could have some influence on market capture, depending on which direction it moves.\nRyan Todd : And maybe shifting gears a little bit on the Chemicals side. Any comments you can provide on kind of Chemicals macro environment? What are you seeing demand at the margin? The shutdowns in China have been an impact on the margin in terms of demand there. Globally, are you seeing any signs of kind of slowdown and demand for Chemicals products? And then obviously, you have some potential FID on a major expansion later this year. So as you think about the macro backdrop over the next couple of quarters, what does it look like to you? And then as you think over the next few years as a backdrop for potential investments, any thoughts on where we are in the chemical cycle there and how that will inform things going forward?\nMark Lashier : Yes, Ryan, I'll cover the macro then Tim Roberts, he sits on the CPChem Board of Directors, and they'll be looking at those FID opportunities. I'll ask him to provide color on the megaprojects. But from a macro perspective, CPChem is seeing, frankly, really strong demand for most of their products, in particularly polyethylene. The challenge in the polyethylene chain is with what's going on in the energy sector, their feedstock costs have gone up. And in spite of pretty significant increases in demand, there's more capacity -- new capacity coming on in North America and they continue to face export challenges. So North America demand has been strong. European demand has been very strong. And you see European producers doing quite well because North America is kind of bottled up on logistics getting into Europe to take advantage of that. So you're seeing that captured by European producers, by Middle East producers. Asia is still slow. If Asia comes back, that will add some upside to things in a number of dimensions. So if you look at their Specialty Chemicals business, their Performance Pipe business, they're having kind of record years. And even their Styrenics business, their exposure there, I think, is benefiting from relative lower abundant naphtha, abundant benzene driving better values in some of their aromatics products. So they're seeing pretty robust demand across the board for now. So with that, Tim, do you want to pick up on the major projects?\nTim Roberts : Yes. Sounds good. Thanks, Mark. From the standpoint of FID, we still anticipate, in the fourth quarter, making a decision on the project. As you -- probably we've said before, all the permitting is complete. All the typical you would consider AFD work, which is before pre-sanctioning has been underway. So some civil work has already started, along with long lead items, some compressors, extruders, some of those things, also in an effort to mitigate any inflationary issues that you may encounter. So overall, a big project and moving forward to a decision point here in the fourth quarter. So we feel good about that project. I will talk about ROPP just real quick that way when we cover that. So the two biggest items we've got. Awaiting EPC bids on that particular project, another -- again, that's a 30%-70% CPChem/Cutter Energy joint venture. And so that's moving along. And we anticipate a 2023 FID decision for that particular project, but it's also advancing as per the stage gauge we have on projects of this size.\nMark Lashier : Yes. Both those projects will be rural scale. If you think about Gulf Coast One, it was 1.5 million tons plus derivatives. These will be 2 million tons plus derivatives, and they're going to both leverage off of considerable advantaged infrastructure on the Gulf Coast and, of course, in Ras Laffan in Qatar. So they've got a substantial capital advantage, which lowers their exposure to any inflationary pressure. And they've done, as Tim referenced, things to mitigate that inflationary pressure. CPChem, along with Qatar Energy is -- and the owners of CPChem, have a very diligent, deliberate process to go through to ensure that we're mitigating those risks and positioning to take advantage in the best way, what the market -- the long-term market fundamentals will offer them. And both those projects will be off-balance sheet project financed. Kevin, you've got a perspective there. Why don't you talk about that?\nKevin Mitchell : Yes. I will because it's an important point. Two projects of that scale running. Obviously, that's a big capital outlay. But when you factor in both joint ventures, so CPChem is 51% of the Gulf Coast project, 30% of the Middle East project. And then both will be subject to project financing on the Gulf Coast 2 project. The financing is being actively worked at this point to get that ready for FID. But the expectation is if you think of about 50% project financing, combined with the fact that CPChem's ownership is at 51% on one and 30% on the other, that dramatically reduces the cash outlay that CPChem will have as they're funding the construction of those projects.\nOperator: Manav Gupta from Credit Suisse, please go ahead.\nManav Gupta : I'm just running back some data, and I noticed that traditionally, if you made $100 in your gas cost, you made probably 200 to 300 on your Central Corridor at least. So obviously, this quarter was -- seems like a heavy turnaround quarter for Central Corridor. And I'm just trying to understand, was it basically the turnaround because of which the Central Corridor was below the Gulf Coast? Or is there more to it because two regions where you do make needle coke are Atlantic Basin and Gulf Coast. So is needle coke pushing up the earnings of those two regions relative to Central Corridor where you actually maybe don't make needle coke? So if you could help us understand those dynamics.\nRich Harbison : This is Rich Harbison again. The primary difference between those two regions was driven by turnaround activity. It's really as simple as that. We were down for a good part of the quarter at a couple of facilities in the Mid-Continent area.\nManav Gupta : So as you run hardware in 3Q, the equation reverses to historical ratios roughly?\nRich Harbison : That would be our hope. Depends on what the market does but yes.\nManav Gupta : Okay. And a quick question here is I think you guys do want to build on your clean fuel or green energy or new energy business, and you have the balance sheet. And I'm just trying to understand, look, if the right opportunities arise, would you be open to more deals like NOVONIX where you become JV partners or partial owners and use your balance sheet to try and grow your green energy business? Or from this point on, mostly to be organic investments in that business?\nMark Lashier : Yes, Manav, that's a great question. We've got four pillars in that business that we're trying to establish ourselves. Of course, the nearest and the most actionable is around renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, converting assets that we have to produce things that are very, very close to us. We -- the longer-term things around batteries and carbon capture and hydrogen, you'll see us making more modest investments to learn how to take on those things. Across the whole spectrum of these things, we're going to take a very disciplined approach around capital investment. We've got good line of sight on Rodeo. It's a high-return project. It's going to be the lowest capital cost per gallon of any renewable diesel facility that we're aware of. We really like that project. It's in the right marketplace. It's got the right logistics and feedstock access. As you look further out in time, you look at the NOVONIX investment, it was a modest investment. We won't invest in a big way in assets in -- to chase batteries or to chase hydrogen until we see line of sight on good returns, returns that our investors will be happy with. But we do have to take steps now to understand how you can create value in those value chains. Where is the right position for us to establish a competitive advantage and bring the right products, the right energies to the market that needs them? So we are not adverse to doing inorganic things if it makes sense. And as we've demonstrated, we've entered into joint ventures to help explore these opportunities, or we'll go out organically on our own in areas that are very close to our wheelhouse that we believe we can establish and capture advantage and capture real value in.\nKevin Mitchell : And Manav, it's Kevin. Just to reinforce the point, we have a balance sheet but we are going to be very diligent in how we use that balance sheet. And so our expectation is that if we're putting our balance sheet to work, we're expecting returns that meet all of our typical thresholds as we've talked about in the past.\nOperator: Theresa Chen from Barclays, please go ahead.\nTheresa Chen : First, I wanted to touch on the Marketing segment. Just seeing that really strong contribution this quarter and the resilient demand reflected in the volumes, can you talk about what is happening in real time in that segment? And if this is a new run rate or were there discrete items that boosted contribution in second quarter?\nBrian Mandell : Theresa, this is Brian. I would start by saying that Marketing did do well in the quarter, in large part because of market volatility in all the markets that we market in. And also because of the seasonality, Q2 is typically, as you know, a better time for Marketing than Q1. And we benefit from having a diverse portfolio, both geographically. We have operations here in the U.S. and in Western Europe and by marketing to a number of customer channels, unbranded, branded and retail. But I would say, besides market volatility and seasonality, we saw strength in a number of areas across the portfolio. I'll give you some examples. In the U.S. branded business, we sell product to discount retailers who perform very well, given the current market. In Germany, volumes recovered in part through the benefit of a German tax holiday, which started at the beginning of June and will end at the end of August. Also, our Austrian marketing business benefited from supply constraints related to Austria's only refinery, which is currently running at 20%. We supply our marketing from alternative supply destinations. And I think finally, I'd say across the portfolio, retail, which we've been building in the U.S. and have overseas performed really well, including inside sales of convenience store products. So we saw a number of opportunities to help the business, including, of course, volatility and seasonality.\nKevin Mitchell : Theresa, it's Kevin. I would just also add that in the quarter, there's probably about $80 million of gains that are associated with inventory-related movements that we would expect that to come back in the second half of the year, realistically third quarter. So there's that component that is included in those results.\nTheresa Chen : Got it. And turning to Midstream. On the heels of a major fire in one of the key Mid-Con fractionators and your fractionation footprint on the Gulf Coast, can you tell us if this could potentially provide a tailwind for your frac volumes in the second half as those Y-grade barrels will likely need to be diverted elsewhere for fractionation?\nTim Roberts : Yes. Great question on that, Theresa. Yes, unfortunate incident up at Medford and at the Conway Hub. Probably let me context it this way is the answer is yes. But behind that, I would say that up in Conway, there's about 600,000 barrels of frac capacity out there currently. Of that, Medford is about 220,000 barrels of it, so a significant piece of that particular hub. So with that not operating, currently, that's put pressure on Conway, so Conway is effectively tight. There's no room for any more barrels there. So instead of moving purities from Conway down to the U.S. Gulf Coast, you're seeing Y-grade move down. So the Y-grade is looking for a home as well, both at Mont Belvieu and I would say our facility but we've been running full out. So we're really not going to get volume though because we may get some margin help because it's tight enough in Mont Belvieu and tight enough, obviously, in -- down at our shop. And at Conway, you'll see the tightening of the market will put some pressure on the system itself. Now what I will tell you is that this is a temporary moment in time because you've got 5 fracs coming on board in the next 18 months, about 700,000 barrels a day. Of that, 150,000 is our Frac 4, which will be coming onstream here late in the third quarter. And so that will relieve some pressure on the system that we're currently seeing because of that incident.\nOperator: Matthew Blair from Tudor, Pickering, Holt, please go ahead.\nMatthew Blair : Mark, as you look at the wide range of businesses that are under the PSX umbrella, are there any that stand out as perhaps not a long-term fit?\nMark Lashier : Yes. I think as we look at the businesses we're in, there's good integration across these businesses even as we add the Emerging Energy opportunities. If you think about needle coke going into batteries, as you think about our ability to produce and market and capture the full value chain around things like renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, the Midstream assets that are integrated, in many respects, into CPChem and our ability to see through there, I think that, that -- we're pretty comfortable with the integration opportunities there. There's always individual assets that we look at that may be able to create more value for someone else and we take a critical view at that consistently on our portfolio, if there's opportunities to do things around individual assets. We're always in optimization mode. But I think at a macro level, I think we like the businesses that we're in.\nJeff Dietert : And I think, as you know, Matthew, the work done at Rodeo and converting it to a renewable diesel facility and the conversion of Alliance to a terminal are examples of our searching for better opportunities for some of the existing assets.\nMatthew Blair : Got it. And then maybe sticking on Rodeo. You mentioned RD as a big part of your new energy growth strategy. I think that the capacity there is about 120 million gallons currently. Could you comment on the performance in the quarter from RD? What kind of utilization are you running at? And was that cash positive in the quarter?\nBrian Mandell : Unit 250.\nRich Harbison: Unit 250, the unit that we have running now, yes.\nBrian Mandell : Yes.\nRich Harbison : Yes. So I'll -- this is Rich, Matthew, and then I'll turn it over to Brian to add maybe some marketing color to it. But from an operating standpoint and utilization of the, what we call our Unit 250 that is currently producing renewable diesel, it's performing, I'd say, actually above expectations at this point in time. It's performing quite well. And the team out there that's running the unit has learned a lot while they're running it, but they've also been able to extend our anticipated run lengths. And so all in all, the unit is performing above expectations, I would say, at this time. On the market side, Brian?\nBrian Mandell : I would say on the marketing side, we've been running more low CI material through Unit 250, which has been helping us. If you take a look at the oil, the heating oil spread, it's the slowest in the past 1.5 years, in large part because heating oil has risen much quicker than the feedstock into the plant. That's a benefit to us. And the RINs, as you know, are very highly priced as well. So in terms of margin for Unit 250, it's very, very strong right now. We'd expect that to continue for some time.\nOperator: John Royall from JPMorgan, please go ahead.\nJohn Royall : So sticking with RD, can you speak to the potential extension of the BTC that's been in the news this week and how you think about returns on that project ex the BTC or with the BTC? And then any thoughts on LCFS price going forward, which has been on the weaker side recently but maybe some catalysts around the scoping process and the Canada program starting next year?\nBrian Mandell : I'll start with BTCs and then Rich can take LCFS. But I would say that we premised the project, Rodeo Renewed without the BTC. So that's an add-on to our economics. I think as you know, all the credits move together, so we wouldn't expect to see the full dollar but we'd expect to see some value of that in the economics going forward.\nRich Harbison : Yes. And John, it's Rich. As you alluded to there, the CARB, the California Resources Board, state agency that's responsible for managing the LCFS program, has been talking about the LCFS program and the scoping plan development in recent conversations in the Sacramento area. Just the conversation itself seems to have stabilized the LCFS credits over the last several weeks and that seems to be a good signal. However, we're still not clear as to where this whole discussion is going. There has been some talk about changing the required obligation side, which will likely result in increased credit demand. But more specifically, CARB's been discussing or proposed to discuss some changes to the CI reduction, carbon intensity reduction, that was originally targeted in 2030 as a 20% reduction. But now CARB's considering increasing that reduction to 25% to 30% by 2030. But this is all in conversation at this time. So let me emphasize that there's no certain path forward at this point. However, we do think the Rodeo Renewed project still is quite attractive. And it's -- that project is premised on lower carbon intensity feedstocks as Brian mentioned there. And with the installation of the pretreatment unit, it still puts us in quite a competitive position at the facility.\nJohn Royall : That's really helpful. And then the next one is back to Refining. Can you talk about the turnarounds coming in at the lower end of full year guidance, if I heard that correctly? Was there any deferral there? Were you able to execute on any of your turnarounds at lower-than-expected costs? Just looking for some color there. And then maybe -- not sure if you're going to answer this, but any early look into the kind of year you might expect in 2023 relative to this year, where presumably, I would think you have some catch-up?\nRich Harbison : Yes. So this is Rich again. One of the things I'll mention, I'm quite honored to follow behind some of our previous leaders who instituted some programs here that we're now really taking advantage of. And one of those programs has been to improve our predictability of our turnaround execution. And we -- those are really now starting to take shape. And we've been able to do that by improving our planning processes, execution, onboarding, all the fundamentals of executing a turnaround. And that's paying dividends for us now. And so that's the primary reason that we're working towards the lower end of our guidance on the annual spend is really our execution performance has been much better than we anticipated actually from that part.\nMark Lashier : Yes. I think as far as this year, you're right, this year has been a catch-up year. We caught up on a lot of turnaround activity that was deferred out of the heavy COVID season because it was too risky. And we were able to save some cash outlays during volatile times. So I think you'll see the turnaround activity much lower and more typical year in 2023.\nRich Harbison : Yes. So the guidance isn't driven by deferrals of turnarounds as we've been executing those turnarounds.\nOperator: Paul Cheng from Scotiabank, please go ahead.\nPaul Cheng: First, I want to also welcome and congratulate Mark to the -- your first conference call as the CEO.\nMark Lashier : Thank you, Paul.\nPaul Cheng : Two questions. I think the first one is for Rich and the second one is for Mark. For Rich, I mean, yes, the market conditions remain very robust. By the time come next year, is there an option that you can postpone the shutdown Rodeo or that you do need to shut it down because otherwise that you have to do a major maintenance or other reasons behind? If you can just give us some idea on that? Is there any flexibility? And the second question is for Mark. Mark, I think you touched on that. I think if we look back in last decade, the strategy for the company is quite clear. There's more Midstream, more Chemical and less Refining. And at one point early on in the decade, things that even maybe in the long-term future, Refining don't need to be part of the portfolio. And as you take on the seat, what is the new look that -- from you on the longer term, given that Midstream seems to us already over-invest. If you can, say, comment on those, that would be great.\nMark Lashier : Sure. I'll let Rich take his up and then I'll follow up.\nRich Harbison : Okay, yes. Thanks for the question, Paul. Early in the second quarter, we received the land use permit from Contra Costa County to execute the Rodeo Renewed project. That included also a certified environmental impact report. That has subsequently initiated preconstruction activities. And we're on a path to significantly reduce the on-site criteria pollutants and support California's objective of producing lower life cycle carbon intensive transportation fuels, while we continue to support family wage jobs there. So I think we're on a path to execute Rodeo Renewed. I don't see that changing at this point in time. Rodeo Renewed is a very capital-efficient project, which Mark mentioned earlier. It's roughly $1 a gallon investment versus other projects that have announced that are much higher in the $2 to $3-plus range. So we see Rodeo Renewed project remaining on track for start-up in Q1 of 2024.\nJeff Dietert : And we like the economics of Rodeo Renewed. We've talked earlier in the call about the strength in the distillate market and the diesel market. And so those economics look strong.\nRich Harbison : Yes. This project supports that.\nMark Lashier : Yes. As far as the portfolio and investments, I think that we always plan and have a strategy around investing where we can create the most value. I don't think we're talking about exiting Refining. I think that we see a long-term future in Refining, but we've got to make sure that we've got the right Refining assets to deliver what the market needs in the right locations. And I think that we've done a nice job of selectively investing in retail joint ventures that have helped capture the kinds of opportunities that you saw in the second quarter. Midstream certainly as the Permian, West Texas basins came on strong. There were opportunities to put Midstream assets in to capitalize on that as the growth in production there slowed down, as consolidation occurred in upstream players, that changes that landscape. But we certainly continue to look for the right opportunities to create value around our Midstream assets, whether it's participating in consolidation or finding some pieces here or there, we can invest in that's different. There's continued strong fundamentals, long-term fundamentals in petrochemicals that we want to participate in the above GDP growth. We'll do that primarily through CPChem, but if we see opportunities where we can produce chemicals out of some of our existing Refining assets, we'll take a good look at that. And then again, I mentioned in the opening comments that if we can find very targeted high-return, quick payout projects in Refining to improve our yield, to improve our utilization, to enhance our ability to capture what the market has to offer us, we'll make those in a very disciplined way as well. So I think that it's -- the overarching strategy is driven by disciplined capital investments, finding the right way to capture value for the markets that are available to us. And then we'll be building out our Emerging Energy business, too. And we're not going to invest, though, in emerging energy opportunities just to fly an emerging energy flag. It's going to be there to create value and capture value. So that's where we're headed.\nOperator: We have reached the end of today's call. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.\nJeff Dietert : Thanks. We greatly appreciate your time and interest in Phillips 66. If you have any questions following today's call, please contact Shannon or me. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

So overall, a big project and moving forward to a decision point here in the fourth quarter. So we feel good about that project. I will talk about ROPP just real quick that way when we cover that. So the two biggest items we've got. Awaiting EPC bids on that particular project, another -- again, that's a 30%-70% CPChem/Cutter Energy joint venture. And so that's moving along. And we anticipate a 2023 FID decision for that particular project, but it's also advancing as per the stage gauge we have on projects of this size. Yes. Great question on that, Theresa. Yes, unfortunate incident up at Medford and at the Conway Hub. Probably let me context it this way is the answer is yes. But behind that, I would say that up in Conway, there's about 600,000 barrels of frac capacity out there currently. Of that, Medford is about 220,000 barrels of it, so a significant piece of that particular hub. So with that not operating, currently, that's put pressure on Conway, so Conway is effectively tight. There's no room for any more barrels there. So instead of moving purities from Conway down to the U.S. Gulf Coast, you're seeing Y-grade move down. So the Y-grade is looking for a home as well, both at Mont Belvieu and I would say our facility but we've been running full out. So we're really not going to get volume though because we may get some margin help because it's tight enough in Mont Belvieu and tight enough, obviously, in -- down at our shop. And at Conway, you'll see the tightening of the market will put some pressure on the system itself. Now what I will tell you is that this is a temporary moment in time because you've got 5 fracs coming on board in the next 18 months, about 700,000 barrels a day. Of that, 150,000 is our Frac 4, which will be coming onstream here late in the third quarter. And so that will relieve some pressure on the system that we're currently seeing because of that incident."

            "name": "Brian Mandell",
            "content": "Generally, for most refiners, we think in somewhere in the $10 to $12 range, we're advantaged versus those refiners. Rich pointed out Humber and where that stands versus other refiners in the market. Well, thanks, Roger. Maybe I'll take that. This is Brian. It's hard to see a solver for distillate coming up in the winter. We're at low inventories. If you look in the U.S., we're at minus 20% versus 2015 to 2019 averages. We're heading into a turnaround season. Demand is strong. We've seen demand better than 2019 currently. Refiners are running now max distillate, and we have in every pad jet RIN adjusted over distillate prices. We're heading into harvest season. Cost to produce in Europe, as we just talked about, is expensive versus the U.S. so they're not going to be able to help much. We think there's about 150,000 barrels of Russian distillate off the market, which doesn't help much either. So I think as you pointed out, we're distillate-heavy in our system. I think that's going to be a good thing going forward, given our view of distillate. Theresa, this is Brian. I would start by saying that Marketing did do well in the quarter, in large part because of market volatility in all the markets that we market in. And also because of the seasonality, Q2 is typically, as you know, a better time for Marketing than Q1. And we benefit from having a diverse portfolio, both geographically. We have operations here in the U.S. and in Western Europe and by marketing to a number of customer channels, unbranded, branded and retail. But I would say, besides market volatility and seasonality, we saw strength in a number of areas across the portfolio. I'll give you some examples. In the U.S. branded business, we sell product to discount retailers who perform very well, given the current market. In Germany, volumes recovered in part through the benefit of a German tax holiday, which started at the beginning of June and will end at the end of August. Also, our Austrian marketing business benefited from supply constraints related to Austria's only refinery, which is currently running at 20%. We supply our marketing from alternative supply destinations. And I think finally, I'd say across the portfolio, retail, which we've been building in the U.S. and have overseas performed really well, including inside sales of convenience store products. So we saw a number of opportunities to help the business, including, of course, volatility and seasonality. Unit 250. Yes. I would say on the marketing side, we've been running more low CI material through Unit 250, which has been helping us. If you take a look at the oil, the heating oil spread, it's the slowest in the past 1.5 years, in large part because heating oil has risen much quicker than the feedstock into the plant. That's a benefit to us. And the RINs, as you know, are very highly priced as well. So in terms of margin for Unit 250, it's very, very strong right now. We'd expect that to continue for some time. I'll start with BTCs and then Rich can take LCFS. But I would say that we premised the project, Rodeo Renewed without the BTC. So that's an add-on to our economics. I think as you know, all the credits move together, so we wouldn't expect to see the full dollar but we'd expect to see some value of that in the economics going forward."

            "name": "Rich Harbison",
            "content": "Yes, certainly. Thanks, Mark. And Doug, good question. And certainly, it's on the minds of a lot of folks right now. The price of natural gas in the European market has gone quite high. Fortunately, for us, the Humber facility has a very mature energy stewardship program. It's been in place for over 20 years in that marketplace. They're a very efficient operation, actually the lowest CO2 emitter in the UK refining systems. They're a very low consumer of purchased natural gas. And in a high natural gas price environment, obviously, there's some impact on their business, right, as far as electricity costs that are externally provided and chemical costs in those areas, which are consistent with the broader industry as well. But primarily, where Humber's advantage is in the operation is that fuel efficiency. And they buy very little to no natural gas for fuel gas supply to the facility. Yes. And they consume a little bit of hydrogen but mostly self-generated inside the facility. And that hydrogen price will be impacted a little bit by the natural gas, that's right. Well, we're certainly seeing supply chain restrictions, lead times taking a little bit longer. But there's no specific supplier that we've identified at this point in time that has us concerned about our ability to continue to conduct our business. In some cases, maybe we're splitting suppliers and are moving to others. But we don't anticipate inside the Refining organization any significant supply chain issues at this point. This is Rich Harbison here. Market capture in Refining, we had a nice bump over the first quarter, right? 61% market capture, certainly improved over the first quarter. We're working to continue this trajectory. We are -- we'll be subject to some planned maintenance on the backside of the next quarter, that has some potential to impact that market capture. But really, our key is focused on, as Mark indicated earlier in his opening comments, it's around the reliability programs that we're implementing and improving our utilization of the existing facilities, while we also focus on turning our products into the highest value, which are generally clean product yield improvements. So we think that's looking directionally good for us in the third quarter, and also the early indications of the widening light heavy crude differential are also a good tailwind for our kit. This is Rich Harbison again. The primary difference between those two regions was driven by turnaround activity. It's really as simple as that. We were down for a good part of the quarter at a couple of facilities in the Mid-Continent area. That would be our hope. Depends on what the market does but yes. Unit 250, the unit that we have running now, yes. Yes. So I'll -- this is Rich, Matthew, and then I'll turn it over to Brian to add maybe some marketing color to it. But from an operating standpoint and utilization of the, what we call our Unit 250 that is currently producing renewable diesel, it's performing, I'd say, actually above expectations at this point in time. It's performing quite well. And the team out there that's running the unit has learned a lot while they're running it, but they've also been able to extend our anticipated run lengths. And so all in all, the unit is performing above expectations, I would say, at this time. On the market side, Brian? Yes. And John, it's Rich. As you alluded to there, the CARB, the California Resources Board, state agency that's responsible for managing the LCFS program, has been talking about the LCFS program and the scoping plan development in recent conversations in the Sacramento area. Just the conversation itself seems to have stabilized the LCFS credits over the last several weeks and that seems to be a good signal. However, we're still not clear as to where this whole discussion is going. There has been some talk about changing the required obligation side, which will likely result in increased credit demand. But more specifically, CARB's been discussing or proposed to discuss some changes to the CI reduction, carbon intensity reduction, that was originally targeted in 2030 as a 20% reduction. But now CARB's considering increasing that reduction to 25% to 30% by 2030. But this is all in conversation at this time. So let me emphasize that there's no certain path forward at this point. However, we do think the Rodeo Renewed project still is quite attractive. And it's -- that project is premised on lower carbon intensity feedstocks as Brian mentioned there. And with the installation of the pretreatment unit, it still puts us in quite a competitive position at the facility. Yes. So this is Rich again. One of the things I'll mention, I'm quite honored to follow behind some of our previous leaders who instituted some programs here that we're now really taking advantage of. And one of those programs has been to improve our predictability of our turnaround execution. And we -- those are really now starting to take shape. And we've been able to do that by improving our planning processes, execution, onboarding, all the fundamentals of executing a turnaround. And that's paying dividends for us now. And so that's the primary reason that we're working towards the lower end of our guidance on the annual spend is really our execution performance has been much better than we anticipated actually from that part. Yes. So the guidance isn't driven by deferrals of turnarounds as we've been executing those turnarounds. Okay, yes. Thanks for the question, Paul. Early in the second quarter, we received the land use permit from Contra Costa County to execute the Rodeo Renewed project. That included also a certified environmental impact report. That has subsequently initiated preconstruction activities. And we're on a path to significantly reduce the on-site criteria pollutants and support California's objective of producing lower life cycle carbon intensive transportation fuels, while we continue to support family wage jobs there. So I think we're on a path to execute Rodeo Renewed. I don't see that changing at this point in time. Rodeo Renewed is a very capital-efficient project, which Mark mentioned earlier. It's roughly $1 a gallon investment versus other projects that have announced that are much higher in the $2 to $3-plus range. So we see Rodeo Renewed project remaining on track for start-up in Q1 of 2024. Yes. This project supports that."

            "name": "Mark Lashier",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff. It's great to be here with you today as President and CEO. As I shared with our employees, it's an honor and a privilege to be taking on this role. And I'm happy to be a part of the strong leadership team and humbled by the opportunity to lead such a great company. I'd also like to introduce Rich Harbison, our new Senior Vice President of Refining. Rich has over 30 years of experience in a variety of leadership roles across our refining, pipeline and terminal organizations. Most recently, he was Vice President of the San Francisco Refinery, where he oversaw the Rodeo Renewed project. Our second quarter results reflect the strong market environment driven by a tight global supply and demand balance. We're focused on reliably providing critical energy products, including transportation fuels to meet demand. We've maintained strong operations in successfully completing our spring turnaround activities early in the second quarter. Even with global refineries running near max capacities, gasoline and distillate inventories remain low, supporting elevated refining margins. In the second quarter, we had adjusted earnings of $3.3 billion or $6.77 per share. We generated $1.8 billion in operating cash flow. Excluding working capital, operating cash flow was $3.6 billion. We returned $533 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We resumed our share repurchase program in the second quarter and remain committed to a secure, competitive and growing dividend. In May, we raised our dividend 5% to $0.97 per share. We've increased the dividend 11 times since our inception in 2012, resulting in an 18% compound annual growth rate. Our strategy remains consistent, supported by a strong foundation of operating excellence and a high-performing organization. We're focused on strategic return-enhancing growth investments in Midstream, Chemicals and Emerging Energy while selectively investing to increase returns in Refining and Marketing and Specialties. We continue to target a long-term capital allocation framework of 60% reinvestment in the business and 40% cash returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We've been successful in reducing pandemic debt, including paying down $1.5 billion of debt during the second quarter. In addition, we believe higher cash levels are prudent, given the current uncertain economic environment. We're executing an enterprise-wide business transformation to achieve sustained annual cost savings of at least $700 million. David Erfert, Senior Vice President and Chief Transformation Officer, has been leading the effort across our organization with engagement from over 1,000 employees. Initiatives are being implemented to position us for the future and ensure we remain competitive in any economic scenario. We look forward to sharing more details on our business transformation at our Investor Day in November. During the quarter, we continued to focus on operating excellence and advancing our strategic initiatives. In Midstream, at the Sweeny Hub, we expect Frac 4 to start up late this quarter. The total project cost for Frac 4 is expected to be approximately $525 million. CPChem is pursuing a portfolio of high-return projects, enhancing its asset base as well as optimizing its existing operations. CPChem's total capital budget for 2022 is $1.4 billion, of which $1 billion is for growth projects with average expected returns above 20%. This includes growing its normal alpha olefins business with a second world-scale unit to produce 1-hexene, a critical component of high-performance polyethylene. Construction is underway on the 586 million pounds per year unit located in Old Ocean, Texas. CPChem is also building a new propylene splitter at its Cedar Bayou facility, which will expand its capacity by 1 billion pounds per year. Both the 1-hexene and propylene splitter projects are expected to start up in the second half of 2023. Recently, CPChem announced plans to double its polyolefins capacity in Belgium to approximately 265 million pounds per year, with start-up expected in 2024. CPChem continues to develop 2 world-scale petrochemical facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Ras Laffan, Qatar. A final investment decision for the U.S. Gulf Coast project is expected this year. In Refining, we made a final investment decision to move forward with our Rodeo Renewed project to convert our San Francisco refinery into one of the world's largest renewable fuels facilities. The project is expected to cost approximately $850 million and begin commercial operations in the first quarter of 2024. Upon completion, Rodeo will have over 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuels production capacity. In addition, the conversion is projected to reduce life cycle carbon emissions by approximately 65% or the equivalent of permanently removing 1.4 million cars from California roads. In July, we formed JET H2 Energy Austria, a 50-50 joint venture with H2 Energy Europe to develop up to 250 retail hydrogen refueling stations across Germany, Austria and Denmark by 2026. Recently, we published our 2022 Sustainability Report, providing a comprehensive look at our actions to both prepare Phillips 66 to thrive in the energy future and deliver on our commitment to being one of the industry's best operators. The report includes a detailed analysis of the company's climate-related risks and opportunities as well as performance data on various environmental, social and governance matters. Before we review the financial results, we'd like to recognize our employees' commitment to operating excellence. We're honored that our Midstream business was awarded the American Petroleum Institute's Distinguished Pipeline Safety Award for large operators for the second consecutive year. In addition, Midstream received the Platinum Safety Award in the large company division from the International Liquid Terminals Association. Congratulations to all the people working at these facilities. Well done. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results. Thank you, Neil. And it's a great question and I appreciate that. There's a number of dimensions that we're looking at that. You mentioned our business transformation. At a high level, we've mentioned that we're targeting over $700 million in expense reduction, and we're quite confident in that number. There's probably a little upside there, but we're transitioning from analyzing what we can do identifying what we can do to executing. So we're launching into execution as we speak. When you think about Refining, cost is a big piece of what we're doing in Refining and it's a big piece of that whole $700 million. We're looking at things like standardizing across our Refining fleet, how we do things. We're looking at centralizing many of the support functions for our refineries all the way out to looking at how we do maintenance, how we operate and optimize using digital, things that we've implemented to do better maintenance at a lower cost to optimize more aggressively, to identify opportunities quicker. And when you think about the margin capture, it really boils down to utilization, yield, reliability, things like that. And we've got things in flight to address reliability, things to enhance the yields of what we produce and certainly maximize our ability to utilize those assets. All of that -- some of that was in flight before business transformation hit, but all of that will come through in business transformation. And beyond the cost element, we're really pushing the organization from the bottom up to identify opportunities. The folks out on the frontline have a big role in identifying the things that they think are inefficient in what we do and how we can capture those efficiencies and change the way we work. And when you layer on that, the digital things we're putting in place from Wi-Fi in our facilities to different kinds of sensors on our pumps and different processing equipment so we can better monitor them in real-time, it's all going to add up better utilization, pushing that operating envelope even further. And that will enhance our reliability and our yields as we go forward. So there's a number of dimensions that we're pressing on, Neil, and we think they'll all contribute to much stronger competitive performance in our Refining sector. Yes, Neil, we're in alignment in that. We think the fundamentals are strong for our kit going forward and we need to operate very well. We will see some turnarounds come back into the picture later in the year, later in the quarter, but we see an opportunity to run strong. Our assets are in really good shape. And the crude diffs are certainly moving in our favor, and our ability to outperform on distillates versus gasoline will be strong. If you look at the fundamentals around the cost curve between the U.S. and Europe, if you look at the fundamentals around where inventories are, we just can't build any inventory with prompt demand where it is. We're bullish on that outlook as well. Thanks, Doug. You broke up a little bit, Doug. I think the first part of the question was about our view on capacity additions. I'm going to have Jeff address that. And then we may have you repeat the second half because you broke up a little bit. Yes. I think at a high level, we're happy with Humber's performance. They're doing a number of things really well. They're profitable. I think Rich can provide a little more color on our competitive position there. So I think the question is, Roger, are there specific suppliers, specific manufacturers in Europe that we might have exposure to that could be disrupted as they cut back on natural gas and their ability to manufacture. Is that the question? Rich, do you have a perspective on that? Yes. I don't think we have any single points of failure in securing any equipment that we might need to keep our operations going. Yes, Ryan, I'll cover the macro then Tim Roberts, he sits on the CPChem Board of Directors, and they'll be looking at those FID opportunities. I'll ask him to provide color on the megaprojects. But from a macro perspective, CPChem is seeing, frankly, really strong demand for most of their products, in particularly polyethylene. The challenge in the polyethylene chain is with what's going on in the energy sector, their feedstock costs have gone up. And in spite of pretty significant increases in demand, there's more capacity -- new capacity coming on in North America and they continue to face export challenges. So North America demand has been strong. European demand has been very strong. And you see European producers doing quite well because North America is kind of bottled up on logistics getting into Europe to take advantage of that. So you're seeing that captured by European producers, by Middle East producers. Asia is still slow. If Asia comes back, that will add some upside to things in a number of dimensions. So if you look at their Specialty Chemicals business, their Performance Pipe business, they're having kind of record years. And even their Styrenics business, their exposure there, I think, is benefiting from relative lower abundant naphtha, abundant benzene driving better values in some of their aromatics products. So they're seeing pretty robust demand across the board for now. So with that, Tim, do you want to pick up on the major projects? Yes. Both those projects will be rural scale. If you think about Gulf Coast One, it was 1.5 million tons plus derivatives. These will be 2 million tons plus derivatives, and they're going to both leverage off of considerable advantaged infrastructure on the Gulf Coast and, of course, in Ras Laffan in Qatar. So they've got a substantial capital advantage, which lowers their exposure to any inflationary pressure. And they've done, as Tim referenced, things to mitigate that inflationary pressure. CPChem, along with Qatar Energy is -- and the owners of CPChem, have a very diligent, deliberate process to go through to ensure that we're mitigating those risks and positioning to take advantage in the best way, what the market -- the long-term market fundamentals will offer them. And both those projects will be off-balance sheet project financed. Kevin, you've got a perspective there. Why don't you talk about that? Yes, Manav, that's a great question. We've got four pillars in that business that we're trying to establish ourselves. Of course, the nearest and the most actionable is around renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, converting assets that we have to produce things that are very, very close to us. We -- the longer-term things around batteries and carbon capture and hydrogen, you'll see us making more modest investments to learn how to take on those things. Across the whole spectrum of these things, we're going to take a very disciplined approach around capital investment. We've got good line of sight on Rodeo. It's a high-return project. It's going to be the lowest capital cost per gallon of any renewable diesel facility that we're aware of. We really like that project. It's in the right marketplace. It's got the right logistics and feedstock access. As you look further out in time, you look at the NOVONIX investment, it was a modest investment. We won't invest in a big way in assets in -- to chase batteries or to chase hydrogen until we see line of sight on good returns, returns that our investors will be happy with. But we do have to take steps now to understand how you can create value in those value chains. Where is the right position for us to establish a competitive advantage and bring the right products, the right energies to the market that needs them? So we are not adverse to doing inorganic things if it makes sense. And as we've demonstrated, we've entered into joint ventures to help explore these opportunities, or we'll go out organically on our own in areas that are very close to our wheelhouse that we believe we can establish and capture advantage and capture real value in. Yes. I think as we look at the businesses we're in, there's good integration across these businesses even as we add the Emerging Energy opportunities. If you think about needle coke going into batteries, as you think about our ability to produce and market and capture the full value chain around things like renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, the Midstream assets that are integrated, in many respects, into CPChem and our ability to see through there, I think that, that -- we're pretty comfortable with the integration opportunities there. There's always individual assets that we look at that may be able to create more value for someone else and we take a critical view at that consistently on our portfolio, if there's opportunities to do things around individual assets. We're always in optimization mode. But I think at a macro level, I think we like the businesses that we're in. Yes. I think as far as this year, you're right, this year has been a catch-up year. We caught up on a lot of turnaround activity that was deferred out of the heavy COVID season because it was too risky. And we were able to save some cash outlays during volatile times. So I think you'll see the turnaround activity much lower and more typical year in 2023. Thank you, Paul. Sure. I'll let Rich take his up and then I'll follow up. Yes. As far as the portfolio and investments, I think that we always plan and have a strategy around investing where we can create the most value. I don't think we're talking about exiting Refining. I think that we see a long-term future in Refining, but we've got to make sure that we've got the right Refining assets to deliver what the market needs in the right locations. And I think that we've done a nice job of selectively investing in retail joint ventures that have helped capture the kinds of opportunities that you saw in the second quarter. Midstream certainly as the Permian, West Texas basins came on strong. There were opportunities to put Midstream assets in to capitalize on that as the growth in production there slowed down, as consolidation occurred in upstream players, that changes that landscape. But we certainly continue to look for the right opportunities to create value around our Midstream assets, whether it's participating in consolidation or finding some pieces here or there, we can invest in that's different. There's continued strong fundamentals, long-term fundamentals in petrochemicals that we want to participate in the above GDP growth. We'll do that primarily through CPChem, but if we see opportunities where we can produce chemicals out of some of our existing Refining assets, we'll take a good look at that. And then again, I mentioned in the opening comments that if we can find very targeted high-return, quick payout projects in Refining to improve our yield, to improve our utilization, to enhance our ability to capture what the market has to offer us, we'll make those in a very disciplined way as well. So I think that it's -- the overarching strategy is driven by disciplined capital investments, finding the right way to capture value for the markets that are available to us. And then we'll be building out our Emerging Energy business, too. And we're not going to invest, though, in emerging energy opportunities just to fly an emerging energy flag. It's going to be there to create value and capture value. So that's where we're headed."

            "name": "Kevin Mitchell",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark, and hello, everyone. Starting with an overview on Slide 4, we summarize our financial results for the second quarter. Adjusted earnings were $3.3 billion or $6.77 per share. A $240 million decrease in the fair value of our investment in NOVONIX reduced earnings per share by $0.38. We generated $1.8 billion of operating cash flow, including a working capital use of $1.8 billion. Cash distributions from equity affiliates were $527 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $376 million, including $167 million for growth projects. We returned $533 million to shareholders through $460 million of dividends and $66 million of share repurchases. We ended the quarter with 481 million shares outstanding. Moving to Slide 5. This slide highlights the change in adjusted results by segment from the first quarter to the second quarter. During the period, adjusted earnings increased $2.7 billion with a substantial improvement in Refining. Slide 6 shows our Midstream results. Second quarter adjusted pretax income was $292 million compared with $242 million in the previous quarter. Transportation contributed adjusted pretax income of $250 million, down $28 million from the prior quarter. The decrease was mainly due to lower equity earnings, driven by reduced Bakken crude volumes associated with winter storm impacts. NGL and Other adjusted pretax income was $152 million compared with $91 million in the first quarter. The increase was primarily due to improved margins and volumes at the Sweeny Hub. The margin improvement includes unfavorable inventory impact in the previous quarter. In addition, we had higher Sand Hills Pipeline equity earnings in the second quarter. The fractionators at the Sweeny Hub averaged a record 441,000 barrels per day, and the Freeport LPG export facility loaded 240,000 barrels per day in the second quarter. DCP Midstream adjusted pretax income of $130 million was up $99 million from the previous quarter, mainly driven by improved gathering and processing results and hedging impacts. The hedge gain recognized in the second quarter was approximately $30 million compared with a hedge loss of approximately $50 million in the first quarter. Our NOVONIX investment is marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period. The fair value of the investment, including foreign exchange impacts, decreased $240 million in the second quarter compared to a decrease of $158 million in the first quarter. Turning to Chemicals on Slide 7. Chemicals second quarter adjusted pretax income of $273 million was down $123 million from the prior quarter. Olefins and polyolefins adjusted pretax income was $216 million. The $161 million decrease from the previous quarter was primarily due to lower margins resulting from higher feedstock costs as well as increased utility and turnaround costs. Global O&P utilization was 94% for the quarter. Adjusted pretax income for SA&S was $59 million, up $27 million from the prior quarter. The increase was mainly due to improved margins on benzene and specialty chemicals as well as improved styrene results. The $11 million improvement in Other mainly reflects lower employee-related expenses and higher capitalized interest related to growth projects. During the second quarter, we received $216 million in cash distributions from CPChem. Turning to Refining on Slide 8. Refining's second quarter adjusted pretax income was $3.1 billion, up from $140 million in the first quarter. The improvement was primarily due to higher realized margins across all regions. Realized margins increased by 168% to $28.31 per barrel. Pretax turnaround costs were $223 million, up from $102 million in the prior quarter. Crude utilization was 90% in the second quarter and clean product yield was 83%. Slide 9 covers market capture. Our composite global 3:2:1 market crack for the second quarter was $46.72 per barrel compared to $21.93 per barrel in the first quarter. Realized margin was $28.31 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 61%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 48%. Market capture is impacted by the configuration of our refineries. We have a higher distillate yield and a lower gasoline yield than the market indicator. During the quarter, the distillate crack was $61.38 per barrel, and the gasoline crack was $39.52 per barrel. The configuration impact as a percentage of the market crack was similar to first quarter. Losses from secondary products of $3.03 per barrel were in line with the prior quarter. Our feedstock loss of $1.46 per barrel declined $2.47 per barrel from the previous quarter due to narrowing Canadian crude differentials. The other category reduced realized margins by $7.48 per barrel. This category includes RINs, clean product realizations, freight costs and inventory impacts. Moving to Marketing and Specialties on Slide 10. Adjusted second quarter pretax income was $765 million compared with $316 million in the prior quarter. Marketing and Other increased $453 million from the first quarter. This was primarily due to higher realized fuel margins, including inventory impacts. Refined product exports in the second quarter were 153,000 barrels per day. Specialties generated second quarter adjusted pretax income of $109 million, in line with the previous quarter. Slide 11 shows the change in cash during the second quarter. We started the quarter with a $3.3 billion cash balance. Cash from operations was $3.6 billion, excluding working capital. There was a working capital use of $1.8 billion, mainly reflecting an increase in accounts receivable due to higher product prices and timing of sales. We repaid $1.5 billion of debt, lowering our net debt-to-capital ratio to below 30%, the lowest it has been since the fourth quarter of 2019. In addition, we funded $376 million of capital spending and returned $533 million to shareholders. Our ending cash balance was $2.8 billion. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In Chemicals, we expect the third quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In refining, we expect the third quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low to mid-90s and pretax turnaround expenses to be between $260 million and $290 million. We expect full year pretax turnaround expenses to be at the lower end of our $800 million to $900 million guidance. We anticipate third quarter corporate and other costs to come in between $210 million and $230 million pretax. Now we will open the line for questions. Yes. I will because it's an important point. Two projects of that scale running. Obviously, that's a big capital outlay. But when you factor in both joint ventures, so CPChem is 51% of the Gulf Coast project, 30% of the Middle East project. And then both will be subject to project financing on the Gulf Coast 2 project. The financing is being actively worked at this point to get that ready for FID. But the expectation is if you think of about 50% project financing, combined with the fact that CPChem's ownership is at 51% on one and 30% on the other, that dramatically reduces the cash outlay that CPChem will have as they're funding the construction of those projects. And Manav, it's Kevin. Just to reinforce the point, we have a balance sheet but we are going to be very diligent in how we use that balance sheet. And so our expectation is that if we're putting our balance sheet to work, we're expecting returns that meet all of our typical thresholds as we've talked about in the past. Theresa, it's Kevin. I would just also add that in the quarter, there's probably about $80 million of gains that are associated with inventory-related movements that we would expect that to come back in the second half of the year, realistically third quarter. So there's that component that is included in those results."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.  I will now turn the call over to Jeff Dietert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Jeff, you may begin.\nJeff Dietert: Good morning. And welcome to Phillips 66 first quarter earnings conference call. Participants on today\u2019s call will include Greg Garland, Chairman and CEO; Mark Lashier, President and COO; Kevin Mitchell, EVP and CFO; Bob Herman, EVP, Refining; Brian Mandell, EVP, Marketing and Commercial; and Tim Roberts, EVP, Midstream. Today\u2019s presentation materials can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website, along with supplemental financial and operating information. Slide two contains our Safe Harbor statement. We will be making forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call. Actual results may differ materially from today\u2019s comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here, as well as in our SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to Greg.\nGreg Garland: Okay, Jeff. Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In the first quarter, we had adjusted earnings of $595 million or $1.32 per share. Our results were impacted by seasonally lower margins across our businesses. In March, we saw substantially improved operating earnings. In fact, March provided the majority of our first quarter earnings. Well, gasoline and distillate inventories coupled with strong demand will provide momentum as we head into the summer driving season. We generated strong operating cash flow of $1.1 billion during the first quarter and returned $404 million to shareholders in dividends. In April, we repaid $1.45 billion of debt, and earlier today, we announced that we will restart our share repurchases under our existing $2.5 billion authorization. In addition, we remain committed to a secure, competitive and growing dividend, and plan to resume our cadence of annual dividend increases. Earlier this month, we announced that Mark Lashier will become President and CEO of Phillips 66 effective July 1. Mark will lead a company that has a solid strategy, strong leadership and outstanding employees. We are all confident that Mark will serve Phillips 66, our employees, communities and shareholders well as the right leader to position the company to thrive in the years ahead. And with that, I will turn the call over to Mark to provide additional comments.\nMark Lashier: Thank you, Greg. I am excited to embark on this new role, building on the talents of our team and the strength of our assets as we continue to deliver shareholder value. We remain focused on operating excellence and advancing our strategic initiatives. We are committed to improving our competitive position across our business segments to drive future performance in any market environment. Business transformation efforts were initiated last year and a cross-functional team is focused on opportunities to sustainably optimize our costs and organizational structure across the enterprise. We are targeting a sustainable cost reduction of at least $700 million per year, which equates to about $1 per barrel. We plan to provide regular updates on our efforts over the coming year. In Midstream, we completed the buy-in of Phillips 66 Partners and at the Sweeny Hub, we expect Frac 4 to start up in the third quarter. The total project cost Frac 4 is expected to be approximately $525 million.  CPChem is pursuing a portfolio of high return projects, enhancing its asset base, as well as optimizing its existing operations. CPChem\u2019s total capital budget for 2022 is $1.4 billion, of which $1 billion is for growth projects with an average expected return above 20%. This includes growing its normal alpha olefins business with a second world scale unit to produce 1-hexene, a critical component in high performance polyethylene. CPChem is also expanding its propylene splitting capacity by 1 billion pounds per year with a new unit located at its Cedar Bayou facility. Both projects are expected to start up in 2023. CPChem continues to develop two world-scale petrochemical facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Ras Laffan, Qatar. A final investment decision for the U.S. Gulf Coast project is expected this year. We continue to progress Rodeo Renewed and expect to complete the final steps of the permitting process this quarter. Completion of the conversion project is expected in early 2024. Rodeo will initially have over 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuel production capacity. In addition, the conversion will reduce emissions from the facility. The total project cost is anticipated to be approximately $850 million. Our Emerging Energy Group continues to advance opportunities in renewable fuels, batteries, carbon capture and hydrogen. In March, our Humber Refinery made its first delivery of sustainable aviation fuel in the U.K. under a supply agreement with British Airways. Also during the quarter, we entered into an agreement with H2 Energy Europe to form a joint venture to develop up to 250 retail hydrogen refueling stations across Germany, Austria and Denmark by 2026. During the first quarter, we added a 2050 target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 50% compared with 2019 levels. The new target builds on our 2030 target announced last year. Our targets reflect our commitment to sustainability, while meeting the world\u2019s energy needs today and in the future. Before we review financial results, we would like to recognize our employees\u2019 commitment to operating excellence. We are honored that our Refining and Chemicals businesses were recently recognized for their 2021 safety performance. The AFPM recognized three of our refineries, including Sweeny, Billings and Bayway. The Sweeny Refinery received the Distinguished Safety Award, which is the highest annual award the industry recognizes. In Chemicals, CPChem received two AFPM awards for its sites in Borger and Conroe, Texas. Congratulations to all the people working at these facilities. Well done. Now I will turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results.\nKevin Mitchell: Thank you, Mark, and hello, everyone. Starting with an overview on slide four, we summarize our financial results for the quarter. Adjusted earnings were $595 million or $1.32 per share. The $158 million decrease in the fair value of our investment in NOVONIX reduced earnings per share by $0.27. We generated $1.1 billion of operating cash flow, including a working capital use of $115 million. We received distributions from equity affiliates of $585 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $370 million, including $221 million for growth projects. We paid $404 million in dividends. We ended the quarter with 481 million shares outstanding, including the 42 million shares issued for the PSXP merger. Moving to slide five, this slide highlights the change in adjusted results by segment from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. During the period, adjusted earnings decreased $703 million, driven by lower results across all segments. Slide six shows our Midstream results. First quarter adjusted pretax income was $242 million, a decrease of $426 million from the previous quarter. Transportation contributed adjusted pretax income of $278 million, in line with the previous quarter. NGL and other adjusted pretax income was $91 million, compared with $138 million in the fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of rising prices on inventory, partially offset by improved butane and propane trading results. The fractionators at the Sweeny Hub averaged a record 423,000 barrels per day and the Freeport LPG export facility loaded 43 cargoes in the first quarter. Frac 4 is ahead of schedule and we expect startup in the third quarter. DCP Midstream adjusted pretax income of $31 million was down $80 million from the previous quarter, mainly driven by unfavorable hedging impacts, partially offset by lower operating costs. The hedge loss recognized in the first quarter was approximately $50 million, compared with a hedging gain of approximately $50 million in the fourth quarter. Beginning this quarter, we are showing our investment in NOVONIX at its own sub-segment to separate it from our core Midstream businesses. This investment is mark-to-market at the end of each reporting period. The fair value of the investment, including foreign exchange impacts decreased $158 million in the first quarter, compared with an increase of $146 million in the fourth quarter. Our initial investment in the NOVONIX of $150 million had a fair value of $363 million -- $362 million at the end of the first quarter. Turning to Chemicals on slide seven. Chemicals\u2019 first quarter adjusted pretax income of $396 million was down $28 million from the fourth quarter. Olefins and Polyolefins adjusted pretax income was $377 million. The $28 million decrease from the previous quarter was primarily due to lower polyethylene margins as inventories normalized, following supply disruptions last year. This was partially offset by higher sales volumes. Global O&P utilization was 99% for the quarter. Adjusted pre-tax income for SA&S was $32 million, in line with the previous quarter. During the first quarter, we received $299 million in cash distributions from CPChem. Turning to Refining slide eight. Refining first quarter adjusted pretax income was $140 million, down from $404 million in the fourth quarter. The decrease was mainly due to lower realized margins, as well as lower clean product volumes driven by planned maintenance. Realized margins for the quarter decreased by 9% to $10.55 per barrel. Favorable impacts from higher market cracks were more than offset by higher RIN costs, lower Gulf Coast clean product realizations and secondary product margins, as well as inventory impacts. The higher RIN costs were primarily due to the fourth quarter recognition of the reduction in the 2021 compliance year obligation of approximately $230 million. Pretax turnaround costs were $102 million, down from $106 million in the prior quarter. Crude utilization was 89% in the first quarter and clean product yield was 84%. Slide nine covers market capture. The 3:2:1 market crack for the first quarter was $21.93 per barrel, compared to $17.93 per barrel in the fourth quarter. Realized margin was $10.55 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 48%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 65%. Market capture is impacted by the configuration of our refineries. Our refineries are more heavily weighted toward distillate production than the market indicator. The configuration impact was relatively flat quarter-on-quarter as lower clean product yield offset higher distillate cracks. Losses from secondary products of $3.05 per barrel were $1.17 per barrel higher than the previous quarter due to rising crude prices. Our feedstock advantage of $1.01 per barrel improved by, $0.83 per barrel from the prior quarter. The other category reduced realized margins by $6.42 per barrel. This category includes RINs, clean product realizations, freight costs and inventory impacts. Moving to Marketing and Specialties on slide 10. Adjusted first quarter pretax income was $316 million, compared with $499 million in the prior quarter. Marketing and other decreased $199 million from the prior quarter this was primarily due to lower marketing margins, mainly resulting from rising spot prices as well as seasonally lower demand. Refined product exports in the first quarter were 134,000 barrels per day. Specialties generated first quarter adjusted pretax income of $113 million, up from $97 million in the prior quarter, mainly due to higher finished lubricant margins. Slide 11 shows the change in cash during the first quarter. We had another strong quarter for cash generation. This was the fourth quarter in a row, that cash flow from operations allowed us to return cash to shareholders, invest in our business and strengthen the balance sheet. We started the quarter with a $3.1 billion cash balance. Cash from operations grew $1.1 billion, which covered $370 million of capital spend and $404 million for the dividend, while also increasing our cash balance by $188 million. Our ending cash balance was $3.3 billion. In early April, we repaid $1.45 billion of maturing debt. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I will cover a few outlook items. In Chemicals, we expect the second quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the second quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low 90s and pretax turnaround expenses to be between $230 million and $250 million. We anticipate second quarter corporate and other costs to come in between $230 million and $250 million pretax. Now we will open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, team. And Greg, you will be missed. Congratulations on your retirement and Mark congratulations on the new role.\nGreg Garland: Thank you, Neil.\nMark Lashier: Thanks, Neil.\nNeil Mehta: I wanted to pick up on the cost point that you talked about, the business transformation. Can you put more meat on the bones around this point and help us quantify what the upside potentially could be either on a dollar barrel basis or across the fleet?\nMark Lashier: We started this initiative last year. We are looking at the entire organization and really it\u2019s more than just the cost reduction. That\u2019s the primary focus. But we want to focus on recurring cost reduction. We want that to be a run rate. So that $700 million number, that\u2019s what we view as kind of the bare minimum that we have line of sight on and we are focused on transforming the organization to ensure that, that cost reduction is sustainable and we have got about 800 people, employees and contractors working on that. We are looking at over 1,000 initiatives. So it\u2019s broad, it\u2019s deep. We are looking at simplifying structures, simplifying ways of working to ensure that, that number is sustainable. So there\u2019s upside to it. I don\u2019t know that we want to quantify any particular upside, but I guarantee you that we are relentlessly pursuing every opportunity across the organization.\nNeil Mehta: And Mark, that\u2019s not just in Refining, that\u2019s across the organization?\nMark Lashier: That\u2019s correct, Neil.\nNeil Mehta: Okay. All right. And then the follow-up is around return of capital. Congratulations on being able to execute the share repurchase program. Again, just talk about your strategy around this, how you think about market and so on?\nGreg Garland: Well, I think I will take a stab and Kevin and Mark can come in. Neil, I think, as we think about capital allocation, we think it\u2019s important to get back to a regular cadence in terms of the dividend and increasing the dividend. So that point was made, I think, in the opening comments. Certainly, share repurchases, we laid those down in 2020, as a result of the pandemic to preserve cash and I think it\u2019s just time to get back to that. One of the great things, I think, that our opportunities we have is this tailwind we see in our base business in Refining. We are going to have excess cash. I think that\u2019s going to give us the opportunity to increase the dividend, buy shares back, pay down some more debt, at the same time build some cash on the balance sheet. But I would say, we are -- as a team, our Board of Directors, we are laser-focused on improving total shareholder return for our company.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, guys.\nGreg Garland: Thank you.\nOperator: Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPhil Gresh: Good afternoon, Greg, I also wanted to say congratulations on a fantastic career. You have always been such a balanced spokesman and visionary for the energy sector and you will definitely be missed.\nGreg Garland: Thanks, Phil.\nPhil Gresh: If I could follow up, I guess, just around shareholder returns, how do you think about like the pacing? I mean are you ready to move back to the 60-40. You have talked about -- Kevin, I think you have talked about a $12 billion gross debt target. Is that where you are still kind of highballing at this point and how much cash do you want to maintain on a regular basis? Thank you. \nKevin Mitchell: Yeah. Neil, so the $12 billion gross debt target puts us back to where we were before the pandemic. And while that target is still out there, we feel that we are now -- we are on a pace to where we have taken care of $3 billion of the $4 billion we added. Cash generation is strong. The outlook, at least in the near-term is very optimistic. And so we feel comfortable that we can get back into share repurchases while [Audio Gap] 60-40. And so we are going to be -- we will have some balance between reinvesting in the business through the capital program, which we have said about $2 billion in aggregate for the next couple of years, returning funds to shareholders through the dividend. We are back in share repurchases, but also working on the balance sheet with a continued -- some form of cadence to debt reduction and increased cash as you highlighted. You look over the last year and our quarterly cash balance, I think, has increased every quarter-on-quarter. And while that trend will not necessarily continue forever, we do feel comfortable that having a cash balance that we used to say sort of $1 billion to $1.5 billion sort of minimum cash level, we are probably looking more at a $2 billion to $3 billion level that we feel more comfortable with on an ongoing basis and it\u2019s not that we need that much cash, but they just provide us more flexibility.\nGreg Garland: I think maybe what\u2019s also been left unsaid here this morning is, we have kind of given guidance about being a very disciplined around our capital investments at our company. And then we have kind of guided to $2 billion or less for this year and next year, and I would say, that guidance is still on the table this morning.\nPhil Gresh: Okay. Great. Thank you. A follow-up question on Refining, I guess, interesting comment that most of the money was made in March, it makes sense relative to what peers have said. You do have some higher maintenance, I guess, in the second quarter. As you look at the full year, are you still sticking with the $800 million to $900 million of maintenance, and if you could just elaborate a bit on the central corridor performance where there was a loss in the quarter. Thank you.\nGreg Garland: Okay. I will take a shot. I think there\u2019s three questions there, but I will get them all. So I think we were -- we had primarily maintenance activity in the month of March and really the back half of March as the weather warmed up in the north, which allowed us to get into turnaround mode again, primarily in the central corridor. So we were -- we entered into that. We will have most of our turnaround activity wrapped up by mid-May, and certainly, all of our conversion units will be back online kind of middle of the month. It really positions us well then to run very strong throughout the summer driving season and we won\u2019t come back to any significant turnaround activity until after Labor Day. I think on total activity for the year, we are really looking at -- we have executed our first half plan, and for the most part has gone really according to what we planned. Second half, we continue to look at primarily catalyst type change out turnarounds. And do we have a catalyst life left and we pushed some of those turnarounds into next year. We have got some opportunity there, I think, in the back half of the year to squeak some of those out into next spring or maybe even next fall. So we are constantly trying to re-optimize around all that. The other thing I would say about the Central Corridor results is, we had a pretty good headwind in the Central Corridor with our lagged Canadian crude buying program. So that that was a significant impact on a timing basis to what we saw as the results in the Central Corridor and it all basically lands there for us in our system. So that\u2019s a timing issue. It has a lot to do with how quickly the crude ran up, particularly in the back couple of weeks of the quarter. We will get that back over time as crude prices come off as they seem to always do and then we will see it come back.\nKevin Mitchell: Yeah. And just, Phil, in terms of the impact of that in the Central Corridor, it\u2019s about a $3 per barrel on the realized margin impact through that crude timing effect.\nPhil Gresh: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. Your line is open.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks everyone. Greg, needless to say, I will add my thanks and congratulations to both you guys and I hope we get -- I am trying to encourage Jeff to do a retirement dinner for the sell-side, Greg. So, hopefully, I think\u2026\nGreg Garland: Okay.\nDoug Leggate: \u2026 you can make. So going \u2026\nGreg Garland: I thought you are buying, Doug.\nDoug Leggate: Well, I will move mountains to be there, but thanks for to know your insights and help over the years. Mark, look forward to seeing how you steer the company. So, first, I have got two. One big picture question, I also ask -- I want to ask a bit of a philosophical question perhaps for both of you guys. First of all, on the industry level, look, we have obviously, I think, you are all familiar with our opinion on where we think we stand right now. But you have Humber, and like Valero, you have insights to what\u2019s happening in Europe, and obviously, you are also responsible for shutting down to the facilities in the U.S. by the time we get to the end of next year. So when you look at the structural shift that we appear to be going through right now, I am just curious what you are thinking in terms of, are we seeing the U.S. move to a whole new level kind of mid-cycle advantage, if you like, relative to international, dare I say, European peers, and obviously, Humber gives you some insights to that?\nBob Herman: Yeah. Doug, this is Bob. I will take a shot and others can come in over the top. I think the last time we talked, I think, it was at the beginning of your call on the golden age of Refining we are talking about the structural differences.\nDoug Leggate: U.S. Refining.\nBob Herman: Yeah.\nDoug Leggate: Yeah.\nBob Herman: U.S. Refining. And at the time, right, gas prices were just, they were skyrocketing in Europe and we had inside Humber. Humber being by far the strongest refiner in the U.K. and a very strong refiner in Europe in particular and one that doesn\u2019t use a lot of fuel gas, right? We are structurally advantaged there with the large coking capacity and generating most of our own needs, but it gave us a view. And at the time, Humber was just kind of in a breakeven position. So we talked about the fact that European refiners had to be underwater and that the market would have to move to incent those marginal refiners to keep running and get back to making diesel. And in fact, that\u2019s exactly what we have seen happen, right? Diesel cracks have come up to incent that Humber\u2019s return to good profitability and the whole market works. Sometimes it takes a while for that structure to kind of get itself right, but again, the market worked. I don\u2019t really see this changing anytime, right? Gas prices are up in the U.S., but certainly not anywhere near what we are seeing yet in Europe, and it really puts us at a structural advantage. If you add in the fact that Europe is basically hydrocracker-based, they use a lot of hydrogen, you got to buy a lot of fuel gas to make hydrogen for the most part, it does give us a cost advantage and one that should translate all the way back through improved kind of mid-cycle margins for U.S. Refining versus the rest of the Western Hemisphere. Brian, if you have got anything you want to add?\nBrian Mandell: Bob, I would just add that in the U.K. where we have our large refinery gas prices have come off quite a bit. Last night settled at $16 an MMBtu versus most of Europe, which is still over $30. But our guesstimate is about $8 to $9 benefit through the U.S. versus the EU, given the price of natural gas here and the price of natural gas in EU currently.\nMark Lashier: And probably an advantage also on crude feedstock with light sweet crudes having been traded up in Europe relative to the U.S.\nDoug Leggate: Of course, well, Bob, just for everyone listening, your insights were extremely valuable as we prepared that thought. Thank you for that. So, guys, my philosophical thought, and Greg, and Mark, I think, when we look back over the last five years, the volatility of the challenges that you guys, Greg, in particular, have had to navigate, your strategy obviously moved to be more defensive, if I say, diversified from Refining. And obviously, if we have got this reset going forward, you are perhaps a little less exposed than some of your peers. So when we look at your relative share performance over that five-year period, it seems to us you behave more like an integrator than a refiner. So I am curious, Mark, as you look forward, how do you think about differentiating the investment case relative to that, let\u2019s say, pure-play Refining peer group as opposed to the more, I guess, glacial kind of share buyback type of situation we are now starting to see with some of the majors? How do you think about the relative investment case? And I will leave it there. Thank you.\nMark Lashier: Yeah. I think that, Doug, the relative investment case really revolves around a couple of different things. We -- first of all, we want to make sure that we take care of our refineries, that we operate them well. They are going to -- you have referenced the North American golden age. We want to make sure that we are able to be a full participant in that. But then as we generate cash, what do we do with that? I think there\u2019s a number of things we want to do around Refining to position our refineries for the long-term, so to drive them more towards the refinery of the future, maybe producing more petrochemicals. We will continue, as you look for growth opportunities through CPChem, they have got two mega projects teed up, but they have got several midsized projects and then they have got a lot of debottlenecks that build on their advantage. So they have got good, high return opportunities to drive down the refining side of things. And then we continue to look for where we are going to play in emerging energies and we see some real opportunities to leverage our existing assets and to leverage our technologies to create sustainable value in Emerging Energy. So think about it as -- and then there\u2019s Midstream that we have got opportunities in Midstream to both optimize our Midstream asset base,. as well as drive some consolidation there. So we have got that leg as well. So we will continue to drive down those segments, each a little unique, but each delivering value in its own way.\nDoug Leggate: Understood. Thanks a lot. Congratulations again, Greg.\nGreg Garland: Thanks, Doug.\nOperator: Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRoger Read: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. And yes, my congratulations to you, Greg, and to you, Mark, for getting to take over and step into a big pair of shoes to fill.\nMark Lashier: Yeah. They are big indeed. Thanks, Brian.\nRoger Read: Just to jump on in here. I guess, the first thing, if I look at your presentation, I know I am going to make Jeff squirm a little bit here. But the -- well, the amount that you can earn in terms of guidance on diesel margins, and Greg, this will be near and dear to your heart and you have talked so many times about Phillips really benefits from diesel or the distillate crack. I am not even going to throw the numbers out there if I were to calculate off of New York harbor diesel crack right now? But what is the right way for us to think about what Phillips can do in this environment? I know you got turnarounds but everybody always has turnarounds. Just how we should think about some of that guidance and some of the capture possibilities on the Refining side?\nGreg Garland: Yeah. I think the focus is going to be on operating well and being in the market and able to take advantage of the margins that are available. I think we have talked about some of the exposures that we have on diesel on heavy sour dips on prem cokes and all of those environments look favorable as we look into the summer months. I think there\u2019s some moving parts. We were hindered this quarter on timing issues in the Gulf Coast on product timing and in the Central Corridor on crude purchasing and timing issues there. So I think those will normalize out and we will see that profitability show up in later periods.\nRoger Read: Okay. But, I mean, I guess, just to clarify, is the -- should we presume that the broad guidance is still pretty reasonable even at these levels? There\u2019s not some sort of deterioration we should think about and capture as we go forward?\nJeff Dietert: No. I don\u2019t think we see that. I mean, Brian can speak to what we are seeing in the current market. It\u2019s hard to predict the net income but I watch cash and we have seen just cash just strengthening as we have come in the back half of March and on into April. And so, I mean, to me that suggests that capture rates are definitely have improved. Brian, I will let you comment.\nBrian Mandell: Yeah. I would add that, as Jeff said, timing is an issue so prices continue to increase from here. There will be a lag in terms of the amount of money that we can capture, but we will capture that over time. But in terms of the crack margins, we are absolutely in a position to capture those and we do every day.\nMark Lashier: I think one thing I would emphasize, Roger, just the amount of volatility that we are seeing on a daily basis with crude trading in a $5 to $10 a barrel range on a daily basis, and products, especially diesel trading in wide range on a daily basis, that average crack you see at the end of the day, there was a lot done across that period of time. And so, I think, when we see this kind of volatility, the indicators are not going to be as accurate as they typically are when volatility is not so high.\nRoger Read: That\u2019s fair. There\u2019s a lot of room for error, given where cracks are right now. One follow-up question, the $700 million cost savings goal, how does that fit into what was laid out in the fall of 2019 and I know a lot of things happened since the fall of 2019? But how should we think about that $700 million within the overall framework that was laid out at that point?\nMark Lashier: Roger, this is going to build on what we did around Advantage 66. There were a lot of things done there, a lot of value capture and some things were moved out into the future, some things were captured in a one-off fashion, a lot of digital innovation was introduced, and we are going to leverage those innovations to simplify what we do to drive efficiencies in the organization. So this is additive to that.\nRoger Read: So should we think about -- it\u2019s just a logical next step in the process? It\u2019s not iterative as opposed to like something brand new or radically different?\nMark Lashier: Well, this -- yeah. It\u2019s building on that. It\u2019s probably getting more into the organization structure as well and how we can capture efficiencies and transform how we drive our business. We are not going to change what we do but how we do it, I think, will become more efficient. So I think it does build on it and is additive to that.\nJeff Dietert: Yeah. There\u2019s a substantial incremental effort that\u2019s going in place now.\nRoger Read: No. Understood. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Ryan Todd from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nRyan Todd: Hey. Thanks. Maybe a follow-up on Chemicals from some of your comments earlier. First quarter was a very strong quarter. I think we came into this year and I think your messaging had been expecting margins to trend back towards mid-cycle levels from the peaks that we saw last year, but it seems like they may have inflected a little bit higher lately. And can you talk about how you see the market trending from here? And how market dynamics in crude and natural gas pricing are driving relative advantages in your portfolio versus European and Asian plants?\nMark Lashier: Yeah. Thanks, Ryan. I think that your closing comment really touched on it that since the last call, with crude moving up and ethane to a crude advantage becoming enhanced, that\u2019s driven margins wider for CPChem and the entire industry and we are well-positioned to take advantage of ethane both here in the U.S. and in the Middle East. So that\u2019s there and I think that that\u2019s going to persist. You are going to see the ethane extraction value driven to a point to attract more ethane out as more consumption comes online. That consumption is going to provide a headwind in new capacity as we go into seasonally stronger margins. So you kind of see those two things balancing off each other. So we see kind of a status quo in those margins going forward into the next quarter.\nRyan Todd: Great. That\u2019s helpful. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe can you talk about any update that you have on timing of permits at Rodeo, the next steps in the process there and maybe what you have seen in terms of the operating environment for the renewable diesel volumes that you have been able to produce so far year-to-date?\nBob Herman: Yeah. It\u2019s Bob. The permitting process is really moving forward quite well and as we expected. We have had conditional approval from the Planning Commission in Contra Costa County. As usual in that part of the world, it was appealed. It goes to the County Board supervisors who have actually set a special meeting to address our permit on May 3rd. Coming out of that, we would expect the Board of Supervisors to grant the permit and allow us to start work shortly after that. Everything we can see, we have got good support in that community. Realize that while there\u2019s a great drive in California to have alternative vehicles and everything else in the marketplace, that renewable diesel is a needed fuel now and the quicker we can get going, the quicker we can get the unit up and running and starting to provide those fuels to the California driving public. So we expect that permit to come here just very, very shortly. On the Unit 250, the renewables we have been running there, we continue to see profitability on that unit. And really what we have come to understand is that the price of soybean oil, the price of California diesel, the price of low carbon fuel standard, credits, RINs, cap and trade, they all seem to sort of work in concert to incent us to continue to make renewable diesel and put it in the marketplace. So, we are very encouraged by what we see there kind of on the commercial side and we are very happy with what we have learned on the operating side about how to run bean oil type feedstocks through the units. So we are really looking forward to the next phase and getting Rodeo Renewed permitted hopefully next week and then get going and looking for startup in early 2024.\nBrian Mandell: And I would add, we are able to get all the volume out of Unit 250 to the end consumer through our retail and wholesale network in California.\nRyan Todd: That\u2019s great. And congratulations, Greg, on your retirement and Mark on the new position. It\u2019s been a pleasure with both\nGreg Garland: Thank you.\nMark Lashier: Thanks.\nOperator: Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nManav Gupta: I have more of a strategy question here. For a long time Midstream was a growth vehicle for PSX to grow earnings. Now you have brought in PSXP. How should we think about Midstream growth here? Is it basically going to be a small growth or if you actually come across a really good opportunity which is even capital-intensive, then you would still be willing to invest capital and grow the Midstream business, even though PSXP doesn\u2019t exist? So, help us understand now, where does Midstream sit in terms of your overall growth strategy going ahead?\nTim Roberts: Manav, this is Tim. Thanks for the question. Hey. When you think about it with the roll-up, that simplification helps us both commercially, as well as takes out some complexities in dealing with reporting and what we do and takes out some cost in that process. So you roll it out, but our strategy really hasn\u2019t changed. Fundamentally, yes, we were on a very fast growth trajectory, a lot of opportunities, we built out the MLP and built out our Midstream business. But as we have said before, we have slowed that down because the pipes appear to be in place. Infrastructure is well caught up. So in our world, we are looking at optimization and how we can best find incremental high return opportunities and optimize our set, as well as build out our further NGL integration. So, if the right opportunity comes up, it\u2019s going to compete like all our projects do and if it meets the right threshold and it\u2019s the right thing to do overall from PSXP, it would be considered. But outside of that, we are really optimizing the kit at this point in time.\nManav Gupta: And then the second is more on the growing the energy transition business. So, I think, the first part of the question is obviously, you have a very good project in Rodeo. Would you like to do it all alone, because some of what you are seeing out there is people bringing in partners for capital and other expertise? So the first part of the question is, would you like to keep it the renewable diesel project on to yourself or you are open to a partner? And second part is, besides this bigger project of Rodeo, what else can PSX do to grow its cleaner fuel franchise or energy transition business? Thank you.\nGreg Garland: Well, I would say with Rodeo, we have it funded through our capital program this year and next so we don\u2019t need a partner in that way. Some folks have gotten a partner because they need a commercial expertise. We have a very strong commercial organization. We have been buying used cooking oil for a long time. As you know, we have a deal with a soybean producer. We have soybean, canola oil, distilled corn oil in the Rodeo Unit 250. We met with tallow producers and have leads to buy tallow as well. So we are in a very good position. Our marketing business is building out portfolio, so we can sell the renewable diesel to the end users. So we don\u2019t really need the expertise that others might need and we don\u2019t need the funding.\nMark Lashier: As far as other opportunities, we are doing things at our Humber Refinery today. The rules are a little different in the U.K. than they are in the U.S., so they can co-process renewable feedstocks through their facility and they are producing sustainable aviation fuel today that they are supplying to British Airways. And so there are British Airways planes flying today using sustainable aviation fuel from Humber. We can also -- if the economics drive it, we can produce sustainable aviation fuel at Rodeo when we have the facility fully on stream and so it\u2019s going to be, what are the economic drivers? We are looking at other opportunities, other technical routes to sustainable aviation fuel. They are still under development. But, ultimately, we think that sustainable aviation fuel has legs. It\u2019s difficult to fly planes with things other than hydrocarbons. And we have had a number of airlines, a number of jet manufacturers approach us helping to look for solutions for their future. So we see both renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel as great opportunities.\nManav Gupta: Thank you.\nOperator: Theresa Chen from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTheresa Chen: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and I want to offer my congratulations to Greg as well. May your peace of mind go up and your handicap go down, Greg and congratulations, Mark, on the new role.\nMark Lashier: Thanks.\nTheresa Chen: I wanted to revisit the discussion on Chem. Just because your margin came in a lot stronger than your indicator and sensitivity would have suggested. How much of this is owed to the portion of your sales that are contracted by nature versus sold on a spot basis, and if you can, can you help us break down like the portion of each on a run rate basis?\nMark Lashier: Yeah. I think that in that universe, there\u2019s -- the contractual commitments are a little [Audio Gap] bit fuzzier than you might be used to in other environments. So I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s -- that they are seeing any margin capture do that. CPChem\u2019s margins contracted substantially less than the IHS marker. And I think that, that has to do with product mix more than anything. The high density business that is their primary driver. It came up a little slower than the marker and now it\u2019s coming off slower than the market. And so, it\u2019s really driven by that and perhaps some discipline in how they are managing the business. But I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a great driver in their contractual position that you can attribute that to.\nTheresa Chen: Got it. And on the OpEx reduction side, the $700 million number, just to clarify, does that compare to the state of OpEx where you had alliance within your system or is that pro forma of the line shut down?\nMark Lashier: That is in addition to the alliance shutdown.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you.\nOperator: Matthew Blair from TPH. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMatthew Blair: Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. Greg, congrats on a great run. And Mark, congrats on the new role here. Mark, my question is on the Chem side. I think in the past, you have talked about opportunities in hydrogen but more so, on the Refining side and so, I was wondering, if CPChem has any hydrogen opportunities, and if so, could you maybe flesh those out?\nMark Lashier: CPChem really is a technically a producer of hydrogen out of the large steam crackers. They have got relationships often that allow them to monetize that. It has to be cleaned up. But -- or some of it is consumed as fuel in the facility. So there probably is an opportunity for CPChem to grow that presence as they grow their cracking capabilities.\nMatthew Blair: Okay. And then could you talk about the general trend in marketing margins so far in the second quarter, has there been any sort of recovery compared to the low numbers in Q1?\nKevin Mitchell: Generally, marketing margins are better in the second quarter, just seasonality. The headwind we have typical marketing margins now are the rising prices keep margins. Margins don\u2019t move as quickly as the rising prices in the marketplace. So we will see -- we would expect to do slightly better next quarter but we will see depending on where the prices of products go.\nMatthew Blair: Sounds good. Thanks.\nOperator: Jason Gabelman from Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open\nJason Gabelman: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats, Greg, on your retirement and Mark on the new role. I have two. The first, there\u2019s been some conflicting comments between what the DOE is putting out and what some of your peers are saying in terms of demand, particularly on the gasoline side and so I am wondering if you are seeing demand destruction in your system, consistent with what the DOE has been showing weekly or if demand is holding up? And then my second question is kind of, I guess, a broader longer-term Refining question. Greg, you have probably been more bearish than your peers on the refining margin outlook in the past. This is obviously a pretty insanely strong margin environment that we are in right now. I am just wondering how you expect this all to play out over time and if these higher margins are here for a good while or if you will see some maybe normalization and what would drive that? Thanks \nGreg Garland: So I will take a stab and then Brian can come out. So, I mean, we had the luxury of a diversified portfolio, so we have had the opportunity to be bullish about other parts of our business. And for the most part, I think we are probably right on those calls and you think about -- we started at 2012 with $450 million of EBITDA at Midstream and we are $2.2 billion, $2.3 billion today. So, really kind of the strategy of growing a more highly valued business in terms of multiple some of the parts, et cetera. I would tell you though that as we are coming into this year on the Refining business. We are probably as constructive on Refining. So we have been in a long time. I think that\u2019s a combination of the capacity that we have seen shutdown over the last 24 months. The capacity newbuilds has either been delayed or slowed down that\u2019s coming on where we see global inventories today and where we see global demand. So I think that whole combination together really puts us in what I think is going to be a mid-cycle or a better environment for Refining for the next 12 months, 24 months\u2019 time. And Brian, you can comment on what we are seeing in real time.\nBrian Mandell: Hi, Jason. It\u2019s Brian. So in terms of demand in the U.S., we are seeing everywhere, but on the West Coast, demand back to 2019 levels. On the West Coast, they got out of COVID a little later than the rest of the country and prices have been particularly high, so we have seen a bit of demand trimming. So they are a little bit lower. But we have seen very good demand. On the distillate side, demand over 2019 globally. So we are pretty happy there as well. I think our inventories are really the driver, gasoline inventories, of five-year lows and distillate inventories are the lowest they have been since May of 2008 and PAD1 the lowest it\u2019s been since April of 1996. So with these low inventories, we would expect to see strong demand going forward.\nJason Gabelman: Great. Thanks for the answers.\nOperator: Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPaul Cheng: Hey, guys. Good morning in your times. Greg, just congratulation for your retirement, has been a fun 10-year ride, and Mark, congratulations on the new role going forward. Two questions, I think, at the one year is a really short one. At the beginning of the year, I think, the company has put out a turnaround expense, call it, $800 million to $900 million. Based on earlier comments, is that still a good estimate or that number has been changed, because it doesn\u2019t look like you have mentioned, there\u2019s a lot of major turnaround? There\u2019s more catalyst change and the first half of the year, the spending is only about, say, probably, $330 million or $350 million kind of range. So I want to see that how certainly look at the overall spending level from the turnaround standpoint? Secondly, if the company believe the energy transition is happening and may even see at some point. In your Midstream business, your transportation system is linked directly to the gasoline and diesel demand in this country. And so from that standpoint, maybe this is a curve for Mark, longer term over the next three or four years, will the company start to deemphasize or maybe the scale back in that segment and trying to reposition and put the capital into some sales?\nMark Lashier: I will take a shot at the turnaround again. As we talked, we are finishing up the turnaround program that we had for the first half and we have guided towards a total of about $340 million of spend in the first part of this year. During the summer or during gasoline season, right, we are prepared to run hard and so we won\u2019t have any turnarounds again until the fall. We continue to look at all of our turnarounds that are in the back half of the year, catalyst life and can we push those out. We expect to push some of those turnarounds out. We are not ready to update the budget. But I think you can expect that we will spend less money on turnarounds than we originally guided to as we are able to slide some of those out of the back half of 2022 into 2023.\nTim Roberts: Paul, on the energy transition impact on the Midstream assets, we have got a diversity of pipelines in our Midstream business. And you go from the NGL side, which we think has got tremendous upside potential for the long-term, primarily delivering to petrochemical facilities and exports, things like propane and butane as well and so we see a very, very long horizon for those pipes. The crude pipes bringing crude into our refineries and then taking refined clean products out of those refineries, those will evolve with what our refineries produce and we believe that liquid hydrocarbons are going to be around for a long time, but we are going to look at ways to lower the carbon intensity of the products, lower the carbon intensity of the operations. There may be opportunities to repurpose those assets for other molecules that will emerge from the energy transition. So we are always looking at how we can maximize the value of our Midstream assets, repurpose them. We do that today and we will do that in the future as well.\nOperator: Prashant Rao with Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nPrashant Rao: Hi. Thanks for taking the question and I\u2019d like to echo congratulations, Greg. It\u2019s been great getting to know you and hearing your outlook and all your thoughts on the energy industry at large, and Mark, look forward to working with you more and congratulations. I will keep it to one. Just on Chemicals and this is a bit bigger picture. You talked about incremental projects that are north of 20% return on invested capital. And looking back, the last time several years ago when there was an announced expansion and you had projects in the queue, is a higher margin environment and you targeted pretty good returns. And since then, what happened is we all know the margin environment kind of depressed. But you were still able to hit targets. You were at high teens, low 20s ROCEs, combination of expenses, volume increases. I am curious because there seems to be history sometimes doesn\u2019t repeat itself but it sometimes rhymes. We are coming out of a high margin environment in Chemicals right now and it seems to be settling slowly. So just wondering, as you look ahead with the cost takeout, where the margin outlook is on the volumes, can you kind of triangulate? You have done it before, obviously, historically, it\u2019s shown up. You are able to hit those return targets. But as you look forward now, just could you help piece together what are the levers to ensure that, that sort of the lower end of the return range we could be with it just like you did, I guess, post 2014, and I will leave it with that.\nMark Lashier: Yeah. Thanks guys. It\u2019s a great question. CPChem\u2019s got a long history of executing mega projects and have really never tried to time them to any particular market conditions. They focus on the fundamentals. The long-term growth in ethylene demand, the long-term growth in polyethylene demand, both at a multiple of GDP as we go forward. And so that\u2019s what drives the opportunities. And then we think about that growth, we put those assets where we can access low cost feedstocks. And today and for the foreseeable future, we see that as ethane. That\u2019s why you see us doing something in the U.S. around our U.S. Gulf Coast two project. That\u2019s why you see us looking at another project in Qatar to take advantage of large baseload infrastructure and advantaged feedstocks that we can tap into. And I think that\u2019s what delivers the long-term value, staying focused on those fundamentals and not getting caught up in any short-term dislocations and then having an outstanding ability to take those products into the marketplace and capture value consistently around the planet.\nPrashant Rao: Thank you for your answer. Appreciate that.\nOperator: We have reached the end of today\u2019s call. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.\nJeff Dietert: Thank you, Erica. And thank all of you for your interest in Phillips 66. If you have further questions, please contact Shannon or me. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect.",

Last night settled at $16 an MMBtu versus most of Europe, which is still over $30. But our guesstimate is about $8 to $9 benefit through the U.S. versus the EU, given the price of natural gas here and the price of natural gas in EU currently. Yeah.

There will be a lag in terms of the amount of money that we can capture, but we will capture that over time.

            "name": "Bob Herman",
            "content": "Yeah. Doug, this is Bob. I will take a shot and others can come in over the top. I think the last time we talked, I think, it was at the beginning of your call on the golden age of Refining we are talking about the structural differences. Yeah. U.S. Refining. And at the time, right, gas prices were just, they were skyrocketing in Europe and we had inside Humber. Humber being by far the strongest refiner in the U.K. and a very strong refiner in Europe in particular and one that doesn't use a lot of fuel gas, right? We are structurally advantaged there with the large coking capacity and generating most of our own needs, but it gave us a view. And at the time, Humber was just kind of in a breakeven position. So we talked about the fact that European refiners had to be underwater and that the market would have to move to incent those marginal refiners to keep running and get back to making diesel. And in fact, that's exactly what we have seen happen, right? Diesel cracks have come up to incent that Humber's return to good profitability and the whole market works. Sometimes it takes a while for that structure to kind of get itself right, but again, the market worked. I don't really see this changing anytime, right? Gas prices are up in the U.S., but certainly not anywhere near what we are seeing yet in Europe, and it really puts us at a structural advantage. If you add in the fact that Europe is basically hydrocracker-based, they use a lot of hydrogen, you got to buy a lot of fuel gas to make hydrogen for the most part, it does give us a cost advantage and one that should translate all the way back through improved kind of mid-cycle margins for U.S. Refining versus the rest of the Western Hemisphere. Brian, if you have got anything you want to add? Yeah. It's Bob. The permitting process is really moving forward quite well and as we expected.

            "name": "Greg Garland",
            "content": "Okay, Jeff. Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In the first quarter, we had adjusted earnings of $595 million or $1.32 per share. Our results were impacted by seasonally lower margins across our businesses. In March, we saw substantially improved operating earnings. In fact, March provided the majority of our first quarter earnings. Well, gasoline and distillate inventories coupled with strong demand will provide momentum as we head into the summer driving season. We generated strong operating cash flow of $1.1 billion during the first quarter and returned $404 million to shareholders in dividends. In April, we repaid $1.45 billion of debt, and earlier today, we announced that we will restart our share repurchases under our existing $2.5 billion authorization. In addition, we remain committed to a secure, competitive and growing dividend, and plan to resume our cadence of annual dividend increases. Earlier this month, we announced that Mark Lashier will become President and CEO of Phillips 66 effective July 1. Mark will lead a company that has a solid strategy, strong leadership and outstanding employees. We are all confident that Mark will serve Phillips 66, our employees, communities and shareholders well as the right leader to position the company to thrive in the years ahead. And with that, I will turn the call over to Mark to provide additional comments. Thank you, Neil. Well, I think I will take a stab and Kevin and Mark can come in. Neil, I think, as we think about capital allocation, we think it's important to get back to a regular cadence in terms of the dividend and increasing the dividend. So that point was made, I think, in the opening comments. Certainly, share repurchases, we laid those down in 2020, as a result of the pandemic to preserve cash and I think it's just time to get back to that. One of the great things, I think, that our opportunities we have is this tailwind we see in our base business in Refining. We are going to have excess cash. I think that's going to give us the opportunity to increase the dividend, buy shares back, pay down some more debt, at the same time build some cash on the balance sheet. But I would say, we are -- as a team, our Board of Directors, we are laser-focused on improving total shareholder return for our company. Thank you. Thanks, Phil. I think maybe what's also been left unsaid here this morning is, we have kind of given guidance about being a very disciplined around our capital investments at our company. And then we have kind of guided to $2 billion or less for this year and next year, and I would say, that guidance is still on the table this morning. Okay. I will take a shot. I think there's three questions there, but I will get them all. So I think we were -- we had primarily maintenance activity in the month of March and really the back half of March as the weather warmed up in the north, which allowed us to get into turnaround mode again, primarily in the central corridor. So we were -- we entered into that. We will have most of our turnaround activity wrapped up by mid-May, and certainly, all of our conversion units will be back online kind of middle of the month. It really positions us well then to run very strong throughout the summer driving season and we won't come back to any significant turnaround activity until after Labor Day. I think on total activity for the year, we are really looking at -- we have executed our first half plan, and for the most part has gone really according to what we planned. Second half, we continue to look at primarily catalyst type change out turnarounds. And do we have a catalyst life left and we pushed some of those turnarounds into next year. We have got some opportunity there, I think, in the back half of the year to squeak some of those out into next spring or maybe even next fall. So we are constantly trying to re-optimize around all that. The other thing I would say about the Central Corridor results is, we had a pretty good headwind in the Central Corridor with our lagged Canadian crude buying program. So that that was a significant impact on a timing basis to what we saw as the results in the Central Corridor and it all basically lands there for us in our system. So that's a timing issue. It has a lot to do with how quickly the crude ran up, particularly in the back couple of weeks of the quarter. We will get that back over time as crude prices come off as they seem to always do and then we will see it come back. Okay. I thought you are buying, Doug. Thanks, Doug. Yeah. I think the focus is going to be on operating well and being in the market and able to take advantage of the margins that are available. I think we have talked about some of the exposures that we have on diesel on heavy sour dips on prem cokes and all of those environments look favorable as we look into the summer months. I think there's some moving parts. We were hindered this quarter on timing issues in the Gulf Coast on product timing and in the Central Corridor on crude purchasing and timing issues there. So I think those will normalize out and we will see that profitability show up in later periods. Thank you. Well, I would say with Rodeo, we have it funded through our capital program this year and next so we don't need a partner in that way. Some folks have gotten a partner because they need a commercial expertise. We have a very strong commercial organization. We have been buying used cooking oil for a long time. As you know, we have a deal with a soybean producer. We have soybean, canola oil, distilled corn oil in the Rodeo Unit 250. We met with tallow producers and have leads to buy tallow as well. So we are in a very good position. Our marketing business is building out portfolio, so we can sell the renewable diesel to the end users. So we don't really need the expertise that others might need and we don't need the funding. So I will take a stab and then Brian can come out. So, I mean, we had the luxury of a diversified portfolio, so we have had the opportunity to be bullish about other parts of our business. And for the most part, I think we are probably right on those calls and you think about -- we started at 2012 with $450 million of EBITDA at Midstream and we are $2.2 billion, $2.3 billion today. So, really kind of the strategy of growing a more highly valued business in terms of multiple some of the parts, et cetera. I would tell you though that as we are coming into this year on the Refining business. We are probably as constructive on Refining. So we have been in a long time. I think that's a combination of the capacity that we have seen shutdown over the last 24 months. The capacity newbuilds has either been delayed or slowed down that's coming on where we see global inventories today and where we see global demand. So I think that whole combination together really puts us in what I think is going to be a mid-cycle or a better environment for Refining for the next 12 months, 24 months' time. And Brian, you can comment on what we are seeing in real time."

            "content": "Thank you, Greg. I am excited to embark on this new role, building on the talents of our team and the strength of our assets as we continue to deliver shareholder value. We remain focused on operating excellence and advancing our strategic initiatives. We are committed to improving our competitive position across our business segments to drive future performance in any market environment. Business transformation efforts were initiated last year and a cross-functional team is focused on opportunities to sustainably optimize our costs and organizational structure across the enterprise. We are targeting a sustainable cost reduction of at least $700 million per year, which equates to about $1 per barrel. We plan to provide regular updates on our efforts over the coming year. In Midstream, we completed the buy-in of Phillips 66 Partners and at the Sweeny Hub, we expect Frac 4 to start up in the third quarter. The total project cost Frac 4 is expected to be approximately $525 million.  CPChem is pursuing a portfolio of high return projects, enhancing its asset base, as well as optimizing its existing operations. CPChem's total capital budget for 2022 is $1.4 billion, of which $1 billion is for growth projects with an average expected return above 20%. This includes growing its normal alpha olefins business with a second world scale unit to produce 1-hexene, a critical component in high performance polyethylene. CPChem is also expanding its propylene splitting capacity by 1 billion pounds per year with a new unit located at its Cedar Bayou facility. Both projects are expected to start up in 2023. CPChem continues to develop two world-scale petrochemical facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Ras Laffan, Qatar. A final investment decision for the U.S. Gulf Coast project is expected this year. We continue to progress Rodeo Renewed and expect to complete the final steps of the permitting process this quarter. Completion of the conversion project is expected in early 2024. Rodeo will initially have over 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuel production capacity. In addition, the conversion will reduce emissions from the facility. The total project cost is anticipated to be approximately $850 million. Our Emerging Energy Group continues to advance opportunities in renewable fuels, batteries, carbon capture and hydrogen. In March, our Humber Refinery made its first delivery of sustainable aviation fuel in the U.K. under a supply agreement with British Airways. Also during the quarter, we entered into an agreement with H2 Energy Europe to form a joint venture to develop up to 250 retail hydrogen refueling stations across Germany, Austria and Denmark by 2026. During the first quarter, we added a 2050 target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 50% compared with 2019 levels. The new target builds on our 2030 target announced last year. Our targets reflect our commitment to sustainability, while meeting the world's energy needs today and in the future. Before we review financial results, we would like to recognize our employees' commitment to operating excellence. We are honored that our Refining and Chemicals businesses were recently recognized for their 2021 safety performance. The AFPM recognized three of our refineries, including Sweeny, Billings and Bayway. The Sweeny Refinery received the Distinguished Safety Award, which is the highest annual award the industry recognizes. In Chemicals, CPChem received two AFPM awards for its sites in Borger and Conroe, Texas. Congratulations to all the people working at these facilities. Well done. Now I will turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results. Thanks, Neil. We started this initiative last year. We are looking at the entire organization and really it's more than just the cost reduction. That's the primary focus. But we want to focus on recurring cost reduction. We want that to be a run rate. So that $700 million number, that's what we view as kind of the bare minimum that we have line of sight on and we are focused on transforming the organization to ensure that, that cost reduction is sustainable and we have got about 800 people, employees and contractors working on that. We are looking at over 1,000 initiatives. So it's broad, it's deep. We are looking at simplifying structures, simplifying ways of working to ensure that, that number is sustainable. So there's upside to it. I don't know that we want to quantify any particular upside, but I guarantee you that we are relentlessly pursuing every opportunity across the organization. That's correct, Neil. And probably an advantage also on crude feedstock with light sweet crudes having been traded up in Europe relative to the U.S. Yeah. I think that, Doug, the relative investment case really revolves around a couple of different things. We -- first of all, we want to make sure that we take care of our refineries, that we operate them well. They are going to -- you have referenced the North American golden age. We want to make sure that we are able to be a full participant in that. But then as we generate cash, what do we do with that? I think there's a number of things we want to do around Refining to position our refineries for the long-term, so to drive them more towards the refinery of the future, maybe producing more petrochemicals. We will continue, as you look for growth opportunities through CPChem, they have got two mega projects teed up, but they have got several midsized projects and then they have got a lot of debottlenecks that build on their advantage. So they have got good, high return opportunities to drive down the refining side of things. And then we continue to look for where we are going to play in emerging energies and we see some real opportunities to leverage our existing assets and to leverage our technologies to create sustainable value in Emerging Energy. So think about it as -- and then there's Midstream that we have got opportunities in Midstream to both optimize our Midstream asset base,. as well as drive some consolidation there. So we have got that leg as well. So we will continue to drive down those segments, each a little unique, but each delivering value in its own way. Yeah. They are big indeed. Thanks, Brian. I think one thing I would emphasize, Roger, just the amount of volatility that we are seeing on a daily basis with crude trading in a $5 to $10 a barrel range on a daily basis, and products, especially diesel trading in wide range on a daily basis, that average crack you see at the end of the day, there was a lot done across that period of time. And so, I think, when we see this kind of volatility, the indicators are not going to be as accurate as they typically are when volatility is not so high. Roger, this is going to build on what we did around Advantage 66. There were a lot of things done there, a lot of value capture and some things were moved out into the future, some things were captured in a one-off fashion, a lot of digital innovation was introduced, and we are going to leverage those innovations to simplify what we do to drive efficiencies in the organization. So this is additive to that. Well, this -- yeah. It's building on that. It's probably getting more into the organization structure as well and how we can capture efficiencies and transform how we drive our business. We are not going to change what we do but how we do it, I think, will become more efficient. So I think it does build on it and is additive to that. Yeah. Thanks, Ryan. I think that your closing comment really touched on it that since the last call, with crude moving up and ethane to a crude advantage becoming enhanced, that's driven margins wider for CPChem and the entire industry and we are well-positioned to take advantage of ethane both here in the U.S. and in the Middle East. So that's there and I think that that's going to persist. You are going to see the ethane extraction value driven to a point to attract more ethane out as more consumption comes online. That consumption is going to provide a headwind in new capacity as we go into seasonally stronger margins. So you kind of see those two things balancing off each other. So we see kind of a status quo in those margins going forward into the next quarter. Thanks. As far as other opportunities, we are doing things at our Humber Refinery today. The rules are a little different in the U.K. than they are in the U.S., so they can co-process renewable feedstocks through their facility and they are producing sustainable aviation fuel today that they are supplying to British Airways. And so there are British Airways planes flying today using sustainable aviation fuel from Humber. We can also -- if the economics drive it, we can produce sustainable aviation fuel at Rodeo when we have the facility fully on stream and so it's going to be, what are the economic drivers? We are looking at other opportunities, other technical routes to sustainable aviation fuel. They are still under development. But, ultimately, we think that sustainable aviation fuel has legs. It's difficult to fly planes with things other than hydrocarbons. And we have had a number of airlines, a number of jet manufacturers approach us helping to look for solutions for their future. So we see both renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel as great opportunities. Thanks. Yeah. I think that in that universe, there's -- the contractual commitments are a little [Audio Gap] bit fuzzier than you might be used to in other environments. So I don't know that there's -- that they are seeing any margin capture do that. CPChem's margins contracted substantially less than the IHS marker. And I think that, that has to do with product mix more than anything. The high density business that is their primary driver. It came up a little slower than the marker and now it's coming off slower than the market. And so, it's really driven by that and perhaps some discipline in how they are managing the business. But I don't know that there's a great driver in their contractual position that you can attribute that to. That is in addition to the alliance shutdown. CPChem really is a technically a producer of hydrogen out of the large steam crackers. They have got relationships often that allow them to monetize that. It has to be cleaned up. But -- or some of it is consumed as fuel in the facility. So there probably is an opportunity for CPChem to grow that presence as they grow their cracking capabilities. I will take a shot at the turnaround again. As we talked, we are finishing up the turnaround program that we had for the first half and we have guided towards a total of about $340 million of spend in the first part of this year. During the summer or during gasoline season, right, we are prepared to run hard and so we won't have any turnarounds again until the fall. We continue to look at all of our turnarounds that are in the back half of the year, catalyst life and can we push those out. We expect to push some of those turnarounds out. We are not ready to update the budget. But I think you can expect that we will spend less money on turnarounds than we originally guided to as we are able to slide some of those out of the back half of 2022 into 2023. Yeah. Thanks guys. It's a great question. CPChem's got a long history of executing mega projects and have really never tried to time them to any particular market conditions. They focus on the fundamentals. The long-term growth in ethylene demand, the long-term growth in polyethylene demand, both at a multiple of GDP as we go forward. And so that's what drives the opportunities. And then we think about that growth, we put those assets where we can access low cost feedstocks. And today and for the foreseeable future, we see that as ethane. That's why you see us doing something in the U.S. around our U.S. Gulf Coast two project. That's why you see us looking at another project in Qatar to take advantage of large baseload infrastructure and advantaged feedstocks that we can tap into. And I think that's what delivers the long-term value, staying focused on those fundamentals and not getting caught up in any short-term dislocations and then having an outstanding ability to take those products into the marketplace and capture value consistently around the planet."

            "name": "Kevin Mitchell",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark, and hello, everyone. Starting with an overview on slide four, we summarize our financial results for the quarter. Adjusted earnings were $595 million or $1.32 per share. The $158 million decrease in the fair value of our investment in NOVONIX reduced earnings per share by $0.27. We generated $1.1 billion of operating cash flow, including a working capital use of $115 million. We received distributions from equity affiliates of $585 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $370 million, including $221 million for growth projects. We paid $404 million in dividends. We ended the quarter with 481 million shares outstanding, including the 42 million shares issued for the PSXP merger. Moving to slide five, this slide highlights the change in adjusted results by segment from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. During the period, adjusted earnings decreased $703 million, driven by lower results across all segments. Slide six shows our Midstream results. First quarter adjusted pretax income was $242 million, a decrease of $426 million from the previous quarter. Transportation contributed adjusted pretax income of $278 million, in line with the previous quarter. NGL and other adjusted pretax income was $91 million, compared with $138 million in the fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of rising prices on inventory, partially offset by improved butane and propane trading results. The fractionators at the Sweeny Hub averaged a record 423,000 barrels per day and the Freeport LPG export facility loaded 43 cargoes in the first quarter. Frac 4 is ahead of schedule and we expect startup in the third quarter. DCP Midstream adjusted pretax income of $31 million was down $80 million from the previous quarter, mainly driven by unfavorable hedging impacts, partially offset by lower operating costs. The hedge loss recognized in the first quarter was approximately $50 million, compared with a hedging gain of approximately $50 million in the fourth quarter. Beginning this quarter, we are showing our investment in NOVONIX at its own sub-segment to separate it from our core Midstream businesses. This investment is mark-to-market at the end of each reporting period. The fair value of the investment, including foreign exchange impacts decreased $158 million in the first quarter, compared with an increase of $146 million in the fourth quarter. Our initial investment in the NOVONIX of $150 million had a fair value of $363 million -- $362 million at the end of the first quarter. Turning to Chemicals on slide seven. Chemicals' first quarter adjusted pretax income of $396 million was down $28 million from the fourth quarter. Olefins and Polyolefins adjusted pretax income was $377 million. The $28 million decrease from the previous quarter was primarily due to lower polyethylene margins as inventories normalized, following supply disruptions last year. This was partially offset by higher sales volumes. Global O&P utilization was 99% for the quarter. Adjusted pre-tax income for SA&S was $32 million, in line with the previous quarter. During the first quarter, we received $299 million in cash distributions from CPChem. Turning to Refining slide eight. Refining first quarter adjusted pretax income was $140 million, down from $404 million in the fourth quarter. The decrease was mainly due to lower realized margins, as well as lower clean product volumes driven by planned maintenance. Realized margins for the quarter decreased by 9% to $10.55 per barrel. Favorable impacts from higher market cracks were more than offset by higher RIN costs, lower Gulf Coast clean product realizations and secondary product margins, as well as inventory impacts. The higher RIN costs were primarily due to the fourth quarter recognition of the reduction in the 2021 compliance year obligation of approximately $230 million. Pretax turnaround costs were $102 million, down from $106 million in the prior quarter. Crude utilization was 89% in the first quarter and clean product yield was 84%. Slide nine covers market capture. The 3:2:1 market crack for the first quarter was $21.93 per barrel, compared to $17.93 per barrel in the fourth quarter. Realized margin was $10.55 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 48%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 65%. Market capture is impacted by the configuration of our refineries. Our refineries are more heavily weighted toward distillate production than the market indicator. The configuration impact was relatively flat quarter-on-quarter as lower clean product yield offset higher distillate cracks. Losses from secondary products of $3.05 per barrel were $1.17 per barrel higher than the previous quarter due to rising crude prices. Our feedstock advantage of $1.01 per barrel improved by, $0.83 per barrel from the prior quarter. The other category reduced realized margins by $6.42 per barrel. This category includes RINs, clean product realizations, freight costs and inventory impacts. Moving to Marketing and Specialties on slide 10. Adjusted first quarter pretax income was $316 million, compared with $499 million in the prior quarter. Marketing and other decreased $199 million from the prior quarter this was primarily due to lower marketing margins, mainly resulting from rising spot prices as well as seasonally lower demand. Refined product exports in the first quarter were 134,000 barrels per day. Specialties generated first quarter adjusted pretax income of $113 million, up from $97 million in the prior quarter, mainly due to higher finished lubricant margins. Slide 11 shows the change in cash during the first quarter. We had another strong quarter for cash generation. This was the fourth quarter in a row, that cash flow from operations allowed us to return cash to shareholders, invest in our business and strengthen the balance sheet. We started the quarter with a $3.1 billion cash balance. Cash from operations grew $1.1 billion, which covered $370 million of capital spend and $404 million for the dividend, while also increasing our cash balance by $188 million. Our ending cash balance was $3.3 billion. In early April, we repaid $1.45 billion of maturing debt. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I will cover a few outlook items. In Chemicals, we expect the second quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the second quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low 90s and pretax turnaround expenses to be between $230 million and $250 million. We anticipate second quarter corporate and other costs to come in between $230 million and $250 million pretax. Now we will open the line for questions. Yeah. Neil, so the $12 billion gross debt target puts us back to where we were before the pandemic. And while that target is still out there, we feel that we are now -- we are on a pace to where we have taken care of $3 billion of the $4 billion we added. Cash generation is strong. The outlook, at least in the near-term is very optimistic. And so we feel comfortable that we can get back into share repurchases while [Audio Gap] 60-40. And so we are going to be -- we will have some balance between reinvesting in the business through the capital program, which we have said about $2 billion in aggregate for the next couple of years, returning funds to shareholders through the dividend. We are back in share repurchases, but also working on the balance sheet with a continued -- some form of cadence to debt reduction and increased cash as you highlighted. You look over the last year and our quarterly cash balance, I think, has increased every quarter-on-quarter. And while that trend will not necessarily continue forever, we do feel comfortable that having a cash balance that we used to say sort of $1 billion to $1.5 billion sort of minimum cash level, we are probably looking more at a $2 billion to $3 billion level that we feel more comfortable with on an ongoing basis and it's not that we need that much cash, but they just provide us more flexibility. Yeah. And just, Phil, in terms of the impact of that in the Central Corridor, it's about a $3 per barrel on the realized margin impact through that crude timing effect. Generally, marketing margins are better in the second quarter, just seasonality. The headwind we have typical marketing margins now are the rising prices keep margins. Margins don't move as quickly as the rising prices in the marketplace. So we will see -- we would expect to do slightly better next quarter but we will see depending on where the prices of products go."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jeff Dietert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Jeff, you may begin.\nJeff Dietert: Thank you. Welcome to Philips 66 fourth quarter earnings call. Participants on today\u2019s call will include Mark Lashier, President and CEO; Kevin Mitchell, CFO; Tim Roberts, Midstream and Chemicals; Rich Harbison, Refining; and Brian Mandell, Marketing and Commercial. Today\u2019s presentation can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Philips 66 website along with supplemental financial and operating information. Slide two contains our Safe Harbor statement. We will be making forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call. Actual results may differ materially from today\u2019s comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here, as well as in our SEC filings. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark.\nMark Lashier: Thanks, Jeff. Welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter earnings call. We delivered a strong quarter and a strong year. In 2023, our total shareholder return was 33% and we increased our quarterly dividend by 8%. Today we\u2019re going to cover a few major items, including the reasons why Philips 66 is an attractive investment opportunity and we\u2019ll highlight the progress we\u2019ve made on our strategic priorities. Next, we\u2019ll discuss our fourth quarter financial results. Then we look forward to your questions. On slide three, we summarize the attributes that make us a differentiated and attracted value proposition. Our diversified and integrated portfolio delivers strong returns on capital employed and a high payout ratio supported by dividend growth. We\u2019re on a path to increase mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA by 40% to $14 billion by 2030. In addition, 75% of this growth will be outside of Refining. We expect this growth and more stable cash flow to support our valuation going forward and contribute to attractive total shareholder returns. Our disciplined approach to capital allocation across our portfolio has contributed to an average return on capital employed of 13% since our formation in 2012, almost double our cost of capital. We\u2019re committed to financial flexibility and our strong investment grade credit rating remains differentiated relative to our peers. We expect to return in excess of 50% of our growing operating cash flow to shareholders. All of these attributes will support a secure, competitive and growing dividend, strong share repurchases, as well as debt reduction at mid-cycle margins. Slide four summarizes our achievements to-date on our strategic priorities. On our last call, we raised our targets and continue to successfully execute our plan to increase mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA and grow shareholder distributions. Since July of 2022, we\u2019ve distributed $8.3 billion through share repurchases and dividends. We\u2019re on track to achieve our $13 billion to $15 billion target by the end of 2024. The execution of our plan to enhance Refining operating performance has resulted in crude utilization rates above the industry average for four consecutive quarters. In fact, we operated at our highest annual rate since 2019. We remain focused on improving performance, increasing market capture and reducing costs to enhance our earnings per barrel. In Midstream, our NGO wellhead to market business continues to exceed our expectations. The team has done a remarkable job of integrating DCP Midstream and captured run rate synergies of $250 million as of year-end and we expect over $400 million of synergies by 2025. Since increasing our ownership of DCP, the Midstream annual run rate for adjusted EBITDA has been $3.6 billion. The stable cash generation from our Midstream business has grown to a level that covers the company\u2019s top capital priorities, funding sustaining capital and the dividend. We\u2019re delivering on business transformation targets and remain laser focused on further reducing our cost structure in 2024. Kevin will be providing more details. In addition, we plan to monetize assets that no longer fit our long-term strategy. These asset dispositions are expected to generate over $3 billion in proceeds that will support our strategic priorities, including returns to shareholders. Timing of these dispositions will be subject to satisfactory market conditions and any necessary regulatory approvals. Our total adjusted EBITDA in 2023 was $12.7 billion, reflecting above mid-cycle margins in Refining and nearly $6 billion contributed by our more stable Midstream and Marketing and Specialties businesses. We\u2019re focused on disciplined capital allocation, only funding attractive, high-return projects across our portfolio. The Rodeo Renewed Project to convert our San Francisco Refinery into one of the world\u2019s largest renewable fuels facilities is expected to generate strong returns. The project\u2019s progressing well and we expect to start up later this quarter. Looking forward, we\u2019re well positioned to achieve our targets by capitalizing on the strengths of our diversified and integrated portfolio. We\u2019ll do this through continued operating and commercial excellence to deliver significant shareholder value through the economic cycles as demonstrated by our total shareholder return of 33% in 2023. Our commitment to a secure, competitive and growing dividend has resulted in a 16% compound annual growth rate since 2012. Before I turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results, I\u2019d like to thank the Phillips 66 team for their continued dedication to safe and reliable operations. Our employees enable us to execute on our strategic priorities and deliver on our mission to provide energy and improve lives. Kevin, over to you.\nKevin Mitchell: Thank you, Mark. I\u2019ll start on slide five with an update on our business transformation progress and how we are reducing costs to sustain higher cash generation. We achieved $1.2 billion in run rate savings as of year-end 2023, comprised of $900 million of cost reductions and $300 million of sustaining capital efficiencies. Sustaining capital is one of our business transformation success stories. Our sustaining capital historically averaged about $1 billion per year and we added approximately $200 million with the consolidation of DCP Midstream. Despite the additional sustaining capital requirements from DCP, we reduced our sustaining capital spend to under $900 million in 2023. This $300 million benefit is also reflected in our 2024 capital plan. Through the end of 2023, we realized $630 million in cost reductions. The majority of these cost reductions relate to Refining, operating and SG&A expenses, as well as benefits to equity earnings and gross margin. On slide six, we provide more detail on the cost reductions at the total company level. Adjusted controllable costs were $8.4 billion in 2023, compared with $8.1 billion in 2022. The chart illustrates the main cost drivers year-over-year, including the impact of a full year of DCP consolidation. We continue to realize cost synergies from the DCP acquisition and subsequent integration. Our successful business transformation has already reduced costs, including our share of WRB costs, by approximately $500 million and this work continues. Slide seven provides a breakdown of Refining costs. Refining adjusted controllable costs, including turnaround expense and our proportionate share of WRB and MiRO controllable costs, decreased over $550 million to $5.2 billion in 2023. Business transformation savings reduced Refining costs by approximately $300 million. Additionally, lower turnaround expense and market impacts, primarily from lower utility prices, further reduced costs. These cost reductions more than offset inflationary impacts. On a $1 per barrel basis, adjusted controllable costs were $7.56 per barrel or $6.57 per barrel, excluding turnaround expense. This is a fully burdened cost that includes about $1 per barrel for Refining share of corporate allocations and SG&A expenses. The business transformation savings reduced our 2023 adjusted costs by over $0.40 per barrel. We expect to achieve our full $1 per barrel run rate target by the end of 2024. Additional details can be referenced in the appendix to this presentation. Slide eight summarizes our fourth quarter results. Adjusted earnings were $1.4 billion or $3.09 per share. We generated operating cash flow of $2.2 billion, including cash distributions from equity affiliates of $226 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $634 million. We distributed $1.6 billion to shareholders through $1.2 billion of share repurchases and $457 million of dividends. Net debt to capital ratio was 34% at year-end 2023 and return on capital employed was 16% for the year. Slide nine highlights the change in results by segment from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. During the period, adjusted earnings decreased $708 million, mostly due to lower results in Refining and Marketing and Specialties, partially offset by improved results in Midstream. In Midstream, fourth quarter adjusted pre-tax income of $754 million was a record, up $185 million from the prior quarter, reflecting improvements in both NGL and transportation. The NGL business increased primarily due to higher margins and record volumes at the Sweeney Hub, as well as lower operating costs. Transportation results were also higher, mainly reflecting the recognition of deferred revenue related to throughput and deficiency agreements. Chemicals adjusted pre-tax income increased $2 million to $106 million in the fourth quarter. This increase was mainly due to higher margins, mostly offset by lower equity earnings from CPChem\u2019s affiliates and decreased sales volumes from lower seasonal demand. Global O&P utilization was 94%. Refining fourth quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $797 million, down $943 million from the third quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower realized margins. Realized margins decreased due to lower market crack spreads, partially offset by inventory hedge impacts, higher Gulf Coast clean product realizations, wider heavy crude discounts and strong commercial results. Market capture increased from 66% to 107%. Marketing and Specialties adjusted fourth quarter pre-tax income was $432 million, a decrease of $201 million from the previous quarter. The decrease was mainly due to a seasonal decline in domestic wholesale fuel margins, primarily in the Mid-Continent. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 23%. Slide 10 shows the change in cash during the fourth quarter. We started the quarter with a $3.5 billion cash balance. Cash from operations excluding working capital was $2 billion. There was a working capital benefit of $207 million, mainly reflecting a reduction in inventory that was mostly offset by movements in accounts receivables and payables, which included the impact of declining commodity prices. We funded $634 million of capital spending and repaid approximately $100 million of debt. Additionally, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our ending cash balance was $3.3 billion. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I\u2019ll cover a few outlook items for the first quarter. In Chemicals, we expect the first quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the first quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low 90s and turnaround expense to be between $110 million and $130 million. Our turnaround expense guidance excludes costs associated with the conversion and start-up of the Rodeo Renewable Fuels Facility. At our San Francisco Refinery, we are executing the Rodeo Renewed Project. The facility operated as a crude oil refinery in January. [Audio Gap]\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] [Audio Gap] Apologies, everyone. We have lost connection to the speakers. Please stand by while we reconnect them.\nKevin Mitchell: \u2026 refinery, we are executing the Rodeo Renewed Project. The facility operated as a crude oil refinery in January and we will shut down crude operations in February, as we are prepared to start up renewable fuels production by the end of the quarter. We anticipate $100 million of decommissioning and start-up costs in the first quarter. We anticipate first quarter, corporate and other costs to come in between $290 million and $310 million. Full year guidance for 2024 is provided on slide 11 of this presentation. Now we will open the line for questions, after which Mark will make closing comments.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nRyan Todd: Yeah. Thanks. Maybe starting out on margin, very strong margin capture in the quarter. Can you -- I know you talked about some of the things, but can you talk about some of the underlying drivers of that performance on the quarter, what might be seasonal or transient and maybe what you would highlight that might be more sustainable going forward in terms of improved performance?\nKevin Mitchell: Yeah. Ryan, it\u2019s Kevin. Let me make some additional comments around that. So a few different drivers to the strong market capture. You\u2019ll recall back in the third quarter, we talked about some inventory hedge impacts that were a negative $100 million to $150 million and that we expected that to reverse in the fourth quarter, and that is in fact what happened. And so you had that benefit, which is a circa close to $300 million swing quarter-over-quarter. We also had improved feedstock, especially in the central corridor on Canadian crude differentials, and obviously, that\u2019s really a market-driven item. In the Gulf Coast, we had benefit from product pricing because of the effect on -- sort of lagged effect on product pricing for barrels going up colonial and so that again is a bit of a market-driven factor. So that item was a bit of a headwind in the third quarter, it was a tailwind in the fourth quarter and what will happen in the first quarter is going to be dependent on where prices end the quarter at. But we also had strong commercial results and this is a result of really being able to take advantage of market opportunities as they present themselves to us. So we were able to capture strong pipeline arbitrage and the commercial optimization around that as we optimized those barrels. So it\u2019s a bit of a combination of there are certain things that you would say were unique to the market dynamics in the quarter, but some of it is a function of strong operations, strong commercial execution by that organization.\nRyan Todd: Great. Thank you. That was helpful. And then maybe a follow-up on Rodeo. I appreciate the update that you gave there in terms of some of the timeline that we can expect over the next couple of months. As we think about starting the renewable diesel plant. Can you maybe walk through, what you would expect in terms of the first three months to six months of operation there in terms of how long does it take the ramp to full operating capacity, how long does it take to you to get up and running? Maybe some of those things in terms of where we go from end of this quarter until you have kind of a full run right there.\nRich Harbison: Yeah. Ryan, this is Rich. I\u2019ll take that question here to kick it off and maybe somebody will fill in for some additional color here. But the way we see the project progression at this point is, as Kevin mentioned in his points that, in February, we\u2019re going to shut down the facility and that will allow us then to tie in the common utilities for one of our hydrocrackers, which is currently in the conversion process. We expect that to start up in March timeframe, which will quickly ramp up to about 50% of the stated capacity of the Rodeo Renewed Project. In April, we will finish up the PTU and continue the conversion of the second reactor hydrocrackers system and finish that up in April and then start the commissioning process, which will roll into the May timeframe and then we\u2019ll continue to optimize performance up and we expect to be up to full rates by the end of the second quarter would be the ramp period for that. Does that answer your question there, Ryan?\nRyan Todd: Yeah. Yeah. That was great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Manav Gupta with UBS. Please go ahead.\nManav Gupta: Guys, congrats on a very strong quarter and a strong start to the year. Looks like everything is coming together. I just quickly want to focus on the NGO part of the Midstream business. There were some concerns that DCP synergies will be delayed or there\u2019s some degradation of earnings. I think you have silenced a lot of critics over there with this earnings release, but help us walk through the sequential improvement we saw in the NGL business in the fourth quarter.\nMark Lashier: Yeah. Manav, thanks for your comments. I\u2019m just going to make some high level comments and then turn it over to Tim. But I appreciate you recognizing that we are delivering on the integration. The integration has been a success. The DCP team is fully integrated into Phillips 66 and performing seamlessly, and we\u2019re seeing great, really synergies across the whole value chain that even down at the level of communications, things happening quicker, things -- better decisions being made faster and it\u2019s really been something to behold. As we noted in the comments, we did hit $250 million of synergies captured and we\u2019ve got a line of sight on another or getting that up to $400 million plus. And Tim and his team are hard at work, so I\u2019ll let him give you some more color on that.\nTim Roberts: All right. Thanks, Mark. Yeah. Manav, a couple things. I mean, really, it\u2019s pretty simple. When you put the two -- with the transaction, you put the two businesses together, we had improved volumes, costs were down, we executed well operationally, we executed well commercially and then ultimately what that does is allow you to deliver results and we felt this was more representative of what we\u2019re going to see in this business going forward. It really does highlight the strong earnings and free cash flow generation of the Midstream segment. Now, that doesn\u2019t all happen by accident. It\u2019s been a bit of a slog as we\u2019ve slowly got those folks integrated. We\u2019re almost done with the integration completely. We should be done sometime here early in the second quarter, once we get all the ERP and IT systems all under one versus still running two in parallel. So we expect to see some additional costs come off. But really, it\u2019s just what I call blocking and tackling. We have -- the market hasn\u2019t been overly helpful, so we\u2019ve had to make do with what we can in this environment. And I think, like I said, you operate well and you commercially execute well, you give yourself a chance and I think this is representative of that. So overall, we like the transaction and we like where it\u2019s going and we think it\u2019s getting itself positioned well to go out and compete.\nManav Gupta: Perfect. And my quick follow-up is, you always have a very informed view of the Refining macro. Help us understand within your system what you\u2019re seeing in terms of gasoline, diesel and even jet fuel demand out there?\nBrian Mandell: Hi, Manav. It\u2019s Brian. I\u2019ll take that one. Global gasoline demand finished last year about 3% over prior year. We saw about 1% in the U.S. We expect 2024 global gasoline to grow almost 1% and we\u2019re expecting U.S. to remain flat. Gasoline inventories continue at the high end of the five-year average for both U.S. and Europe. We think the majority of the stored gasoline is winter grade, particularly given the current strong octane values. Overall gasoline stocks, we think, should move back to the middle of the five-year range with spring turnarounds as we move toward the summer. On the distillate side, distillate demand finished 2023 about 2% over 2022 and the U.S. was actually down 2%, mostly in the West Coast due to rains and the renewable diesel production and imports. Latin America we saw up 2%. We expect 2024 global distillate demand to grow about 0.5% and the U.S. 2%, given the U.S.\u2019s stronger economy. And U.S. distillate stocks are about 14% below five-year average and we\u2019d anticipate draws through the spring maintenance season that should take inventories even closer to last year\u2019s levels. And finally, on jet demand, finished last year 17% over prior year, with a total C count recovering to 2019. 2024 global jet demand is expected to grow about 6%, with continued recovery on international travel and we\u2019ve seen cargo flights remain elevated and we think that\u2019ll continue in 2024 as well.\nManav Gupta: Thank you so much, guys.\nMark Lashier: Thanks, Manav.\nOperator: The next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Gents, I wonder if I could ask you about the EBITDA number for 2023, the $12.7 billion, you mentioned. If you rebase that to mid-cycle, where are we relative to the $14 billion target? It seems to us you\u2019ve only got a year to go, basically, to do a very small amount of incremental cost-cutting. It seems you might have some upside to those numbers. So if you could help us rebase that, that would be real helpful. That\u2019s my first question.\nKevin Mitchell: Yeah. Doug, it\u2019s Kevin. Let me try and fill in the gaps on that one for you. There\u2019s really a couple of items that are probably a bit more significant in terms of the shift from current to what\u2019s 2025 mid-cycle the $14 billion target. So for one, remember, the $14 billion is mid-cycle. The Chemicals business is not at mid-cycle currently and that\u2019s about an incremental $1 billion to get to mid-cycle. And then in a -- on a mid-cycle basis, there\u2019s an increment of about $200 million from the mid-cap projects that they have just put into place, most of which took place -- happened towards the end of last year and so an incremental billion in Chemicals really driven by the overall environment. Rodeo is not reflected in current and that\u2019s a $700 million mid-cycle impact. And so that\u2019s a -- between those two, you\u2019re at getting close to $2 billion of increment that is still to come. There is some additional on the cost side of things and there\u2019s Midstream at -- while we\u2019re close to our mid-cycle on a run rate basis, remember, the $12.7 billion only had our current ownership of DCPs since June of last year. So there\u2019s that incremental step up on it from an adjusted basis on that -- in that respect.  In addition, we talked about the $600 million of additional commercial contribution to the business. We expect to see that materialize over the next two years and we\u2019re also executing on the Refining projects that Rich has talked about in the past. And so those are the items that are going to get us to that $14 billion 2025 mid-cycle level.\nDoug Leggate: That\u2019s very granular and much appreciated. Thanks, Kevin. My follow-up is kind of a -- it\u2019s a question on Rodeo, but a different question perhaps than you normally get? We\u2019re trying to understand what the West Coast would look like if we rebased your capture rate, your historical relationship with realized margins versus indicators if Rodeo was not in the system. So I guess it\u2019s kind of a request and a question at the same time, to the extent you can give us the history ex-Rodeo, that would be really helpful. But order of magnitude, was Rodeo loss making for most of the last several years or how would you characterize the EBITDA contribution? I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.\nKevin Mitchell: Yeah. Doug, it\u2019s -- understand the request and why you would want that and we\u2019ll take that under consideration as we think about how we\u2019re going to report the go-forward Rodeo as a renewable fuels facility, because we do want -- we also want to be able to demonstrate that that asset as a renewable fuels facility is generating the kind of financial results that we\u2019ve been talking about and so we\u2019ll take that under consideration in terms of what we show from a recast basis. I think the question on what Rodeo has done in the past, it\u2019s really been a function of the market environment. I mean, it has been challenged over the last few years as what was historically a very strong crude advantage, sort of disappeared with the declining supplies of domestic feedstocks for this facility and having to rely more on imported barrels. But then you\u2019re also, it\u2019s a high cost area as you know, so it\u2019s, although that\u2019s typical, that\u2019s all of California is that way and then you\u2019re into what the market environment looks like. And so what we\u2019ve typically seen in California is when there\u2019s operating upsets and supply is impacted, then you see an increase in margins and the financials look respectable, but there are -- when everything\u2019s running well, it\u2019s more challenged.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks very much indeed, Kevin. We\u2019ll look forward to that. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of John Royall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead, John.\nJohn Royall: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first question is on the balance sheet. You guys had guided to hitting the top end of your leverage range by year end 2023. You\u2019re finishing a bit above that, which I think was just driven by the working capital impact of falling prices. So assuming a somewhat stable environment for working capital and price in 2024, do you have any updated guidance on when you think you\u2019ll get back into that range?\nKevin Mitchell: Yeah. John, you\u2019re right that the working capital tailwind that we expected to see for a variety of reasons didn\u2019t quite materialize the way that we thought they would and that probably impacted us by 2 percentage points to 3 percentage points on the net debt to capital metric. We expect to make some modest progress on a debt reduction in 2024. We have a total of $1.1 billion of maturities in 2024 at the Phillips 66 level. And so that gives us some flexibility in terms of how we manage this. I will say though, that the working capital component is always a little bit of a wild card, because it can swing us to the tune of a couple of billion dollars over the course of a quarter and that has an impact on the stated metrics. So I think what I\u2019d say is that, we still target the 25% to 30% range, but when you step back and look in aggregate terms, we\u2019re very comfortable with where we are, and our capital allocation decisions are going to be made with consideration of all the different priorities that we\u2019ve got out there of which the balance sheet and debt is one of them. So I don\u2019t want to commit to any sort of rash decisions just to target that one particular metric. We want to make sure we make the right overall decisions factoring in all of the different priorities.\nJohn Royall: Understood. Thanks, Kevin. And my next question is just on the turnaround guide for the year. You took a pretty big year in 2022 or a very big year in 2022, which I think was somewhat of a catch-up year. Last year was a pretty meaningful step down and the guidance looks like 2024 is basically same ballpark as 2023. So should we think of the average -- an average turnaround year from here as being somewhere in that kind of $600 million range and does the Rodeo conversion change that at all?\nRich Harbison: John, I\u2019ll take that. This is Rich. Yeah. I think that the range that we\u2019re at last year and this year is what you would consider an average year for us and the outlook for this year stays in that. Like most companies, we do concentrate our plan maintenance activity in the first and fourth quarters in our system in any given year and we tend to lighten those during the driving season, second quarter and third quarter of the year. But the way our turnarounds are working and a huge effort by the organization, which I need to compliment them, is to really flatten out these heavy peak periods in our turnaround cycles. Now, we will occasionally get a couple sites that get stacked up on ourselves, but what we\u2019ve really tried to do is push those out, level out the spend on a long-term basis and work towards this $500 million to $600 million range as our average turnaround cycle. So there will be a few years that will be a little bit higher than that and then there will be some that may be slightly under that as well. But in a general sense, that\u2019s a good number to use.\nJohn Royall: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Please go ahead, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nMark Lashier: Good morning, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: Maybe the first one is for Kevin. Thank you. Kevin, can you tell us what in the fourth quarter was running at and what is the cost associated with that? And in the first quarter, the $100 million of decommissioning and decommissioning expense, I suppose that\u2019s going to run through and not being treated as a special item?\nKevin Mitchell: So, Paul, what was the first part of the question? I missed that first piece.\nPaul Cheng: We\u2019re trying to understand that without with Rodeo, what is the through-put run rate in the fourth quarter and what is the cost? Actually, yes, or that if you can tell us that what is Rodeo cost in the fourth quarter and what is the run rate also?\nMark Lashier: So, Rodeo performance in the fourth quarter versus the first quarter.\nKevin Mitchell: Yeah. So we -- I mean, we don\u2019t give out that sort of asset-specific level of financial information. What I can say is that the -- when you look at the fourth quarter results and the capture rates, the Rodeo starting to come -- turn operations down, we shut down one of the crude units in the fourth quarter. That did have a detrimental impact to our fourth quarter results versus if we were just carrying on in the traditional normal full crude operations at Rodeo. So it did have an impact. In terms of the $100 million of startup and decommissioning costs in the first quarter, we would not treat those as a special item. They will flow through as GAAP earnings or impact and that will be how we report the results, because they\u2019re not, I mean, it\u2019s normal for what we\u2019re doing. It\u2019s not a unique factor. Now, we can talk about it and you can choose to make your own sort of adjustments around it. But for us, it will just be part of our normal operating results.\nPaul Cheng: And, Kevin, if I look at on your page 23 on your presentation, in terms of the margin capture, the other column, you\u2019re talking about $7.11. And in here that, you have, call it, $200 million of, I think, the swing benefit from the Colonial Pipeline product pricing. So that\u2019s translating to about $3.90. So where is other, say, $3 per barrel contribute to that?\nKevin Mitchell: Yeah. So, I think, the bulk of the rest. So that\u2019s one factor on that. You\u2019ve also got the swing I mentioned on the Gulf Coast product pricing effect. You had a swing there from one quarter to the next. And you also have the benefit in there of our, we talked about our commercial performance during the quarter. That will also show up in that bar. So, all those things get reflected in that part of the representation.\nPaul Cheng: So I suppose that the bulk of the gap, say, $3 is contributed by commercial operation or that there\u2019s just a minor piece of that you have other things that are even a bigger contributor?\nKevin Mitchell: Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s a combination of all of those items. So you see benefit on the product side. You see benefit from commercial contribution. You see the benefit from the inventory hedging items that we talked about. So they all combine to make up the bulk of that $7.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Matthew, please go ahead.\nMatthew Blair: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions here. On the Chem side, sorry, on the Chem side, you provided strong utilization guidance once again for Q1. Could you talk about the recent improvement in PE prices? What\u2019s driving that? And then also, could you share any trends on demand that you\u2019re seeing, either export-related or domestic?\nTim Roberts: Yeah. Hey, Matt. This is Tim. Yeah. A couple things on that from the Chem standpoint. Yeah, we\u2019ve seen actually pretty good stability with regard to polyethylene prices through the fourth quarter. Things were relatively flat from October through December. Then they got a $0.05 increase in January. How much of the $0.05 they actually get, I think, that might be a little bit of a discussion point. But nonetheless, it did highlight that the U.S. is running hard. Demand in the U.S. has been good, albeit steady in Europe, soft in Asia. The feedstock advantage here is really, you\u2019ve got a highly utilized U.S. Gulf Coast kit, namely CPChem and they\u2019re running hard. So you\u2019ve seen some destocking that\u2019s going on as well. So I think that\u2019s helped underpin a little bit of momentum. Now, I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s declaring victory on this at this point. I think there\u2019s a lot of destocking that still needs to happen throughout the balance of the year. But it does tell you that the market forces are in play and you will see a rebalancing through 2024.\nMark Lashier: Yeah. And Matthew, I think this just demonstrates the resilience of CPChem across this down cycle. They\u2019ve done relatively well, been able to run at high rates and compete, and be cash positive and show bottom of the cycle returns that we\u2019re happy with. We\u2019re anxious to see them come out of this cyclical downturn, but they are really, really well positioned for the long-term.\nMatthew Blair: Sounds good. And then, could you provide an outlook on your deferred taxes for 2024? It\u2019s been a little volatile recently, but I believe that 2023 did come in above your overall expectations. What\u2019s the outlook for 2024?\nKevin Mitchell: Yeah. Matt, that\u2019s a great question. We had pretty strong deferred tax benefit in 2023 and also 2022, and in both years the primary driver to those were the MLP roll-ups. So in 2022, we had benefit associated with PSXP, and in 2023, with the DCP roll-up. And that end -- in the end, that was a bigger benefit than we were anticipating, which drove some of the movements in that that you saw last year. That benefit drops off significantly as we go into 2024 and it\u2019s a combination of less lower capital spend and so less depreciation to take advantage of, and bonus depreciation is scaling down as well, so we dropped 60% year one bonus in 2024. So we\u2019re anticipating about a $200 million benefit for the year in 2024, so quite a lot lower than what we had in 2023. There is one caveat on this and that there\u2019s a current bill in Congress that if ultimately passed, will extend some of the tax provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Right now we\u2019re in the process of starting to sunset out, and if that passes, we\u2019ll actually see 100% bonus depreciation backdated to 2023, so you\u2019d get 2023, 2024 and 2025 all at 100%. That would benefit us in 2024 and to the tune of probably an incremental $300 million or so, but that\u2019s contingent on that legislation passing.\nMatthew Blair: Great. Thanks for the color.\nMark Lashier: Yeah.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen. Please go ahead, Jason.\nJason Gabelman: Yeah. Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a follow-up question on the Rodeo startup plan and I appreciate all the color. I know you mentioned it was going to be ramping up to full rates by midyear. Does that also include indicative feed slate, meaning you\u2019re going to be running dirty lower CI feed from the middle of the year? Is that going to be more of a ramp up once you hit full rates?\nRich Harbison: Yeah. Jason, this Rich. We will start off with the easier feedstocks generally and those are used vegetable oils, maybe some used cooking oils and some neat vegetable oils. As we get the pretreatment unit up and running and lined out, we\u2019ll start introducing lower and lower CI carbon intensive feedstocks, which includes the fats, the greases, the tallows, those types of feedstocks, and we fully expect those to be introduced into the system towards the second half of the second quarter, maybe into the third quarter and we\u2019ll slowly and continuously reduce that carbon intensity feedstock quality as we get more and more comfortable with the operation of the pretreatment unit and their impacts inside the processing units as well. So -- and I think our commercial organizations lined up with that same and they\u2019ve been out and about gathering up these feedstocks and actively developing the aggregation facilities. And so they\u2019re positioning quite well for the -- looking for the green light from the Rodeo team to go ahead and start sending these that direction and they\u2019ll be ready when we\u2019re ready.\nJason Gabelman: Got it. And then my follow-up is on the Midstream segment and clearly very strong results, as you\u2019ve discussed on the call. But I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s any seasonality we should think about to the business that would result in maybe stronger winter results and weaker summer results, thinking of things like higher propane demand and butane being pulled out of storage for blending and anything else that would be included like that that would drive kind of lower earnings 2Q and 3Q relative to 4Q and 1Q. Thanks.\nTim Roberts: Yeah. Jason, that\u2019s a great question. And no, that\u2019s how we would look at it. If I look at 2024, as you kind of think about what we see that IBT looking like, we think that looks somewhere around on average, again, simple average across the four quarters about 675 a quarter. But you\u2019re right, there\u2019s some seasonality that comes into play. Typically, it\u2019s a little stronger in the fourth quarter. Again, you nailed it, propane, butane, all those things kind of come into play. You see a little bit of that still in the first quarter. So, again, first quarter, fourth quarter, a little bit stronger, and then it comes off a little bit. But on average, about 675 is what we\u2019re looking at. Now, that\u2019s at mid-cycle. So, I want to be real clear there. At mid-cycle commodity pricing, that\u2019s the framework we\u2019re operating under. Now, obviously, if you look at first quarter, if there are winter events and things that happen that remember a couple years ago that we had and that\u2019s a different game, too. We\u2019ll have to -- we just deal with that when that occurs. But generally, that\u2019s kind of the framework we\u2019re looking at, again, on an IBT basis.\nJason Gabelman: All right. Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTheresa Chen: Hi. In terms of your longer NGL wellhead-to-market strategy, can you just remind us, on a run rate basis, what do you anticipate is the breakdown of Y-grade volumes you control from your own processing plants flowing to your downstream assets versus third-party?\nMark Lashier: Well, I won\u2019t go into a lot of detail on that, Theresa, but what I will tell you is we\u2019re long. We are long on NGLs. But actually, we want to be and that\u2019s by design. We offload to third parties to run some of our product for us, whether to transport or whether to frac. And at some point, I\u2019d like to think over time, as we continue to build scale on the integrated value chain that we\u2019ve got, we\u2019ll bring those volumes in-house. But at this point in time, like I said, we\u2019re long and we are for the foreseeable future on NGLs.\nTheresa Chen: Got it. And would you mind giving us an update on the progress with the asset sales? How far are you along this process and have you narrowed things down further?\nMark Lashier: Yeah. As far as asset sales go, we said before that everything we have has a value and we understand what that value is and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. If we can capture more value from someone else owning assets, then we\u2019ll do that. But having said that, we are in some active discussions as we speak. There\u2019s a number of processes underway that we can\u2019t comment on, but all I\u2019d say is, leave it there, that we\u2019ll have more comments likely at our first quarter earnings call.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Laetsch with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJoe Laetsch: Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a good quarter. So I wanted to ask on cracks in the central corridor, particularly on the gasoline side, which have remained weak to start the year. I know you benefit from running WCS there, but I was just hoping to get your latest thoughts on Mid-Con dynamics and just watching there as the year progresses.\nMark Lashier: Yeah. Particularly in Chicago where the crack is now close to zero, a number of factors have caused that weak gasoline margins. Demand has been poor due to winter weather, which affected production, demand more than production. Refinings have been running strongly there. And then the upper Illinois River was frozen for 10 days, which blocked U.S. Mid-Con or Chicago exports from getting to the U.S. Gulf Coast. So kind of our view there is Chicago refineries are soon going to be in turnaround and there\u2019s a closed arc from the U.S. Gulf Coast up north. We think things will clear up, particularly as winter grade gasoline has moved out of tank and the market switches to summer grade gasoline.\nJoe Laetsch: Great. Thank you for that. And then I just wanted to ask on the export side, have you seen a shift in any crude or product flows with the Panama Canal capacity limitations or any Suez Canal diversions, maybe shipping more product to Europe.\nMark Lashier: I would say, first with Russia, now with the Red Sea, we have been seeing different arbitrage, different places. As you know, Russian barrels are going different places than they used to. But by and large, it\u2019s just increasing freight rates and time. For us, that\u2019s actually helpful because as it does that the European type barrels, the Brent TIs widen out and we buy more barrels at basis WTI, so for us, it\u2019s a benefit. Also, we have a strong and robust bunker fueling business, which also benefits from the higher bunker sales for the longer voyages.\nJoe Laetsch: Great. Thank you all.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll now turn it back to Mark for closing remarks.\nMark Lashier: Thanks for all your questions. I\u2019m going to wrap up with slide 13 and have some comments about where we\u2019ve been and where we\u2019re headed. You\u2019ll recall back in 2022 at our Investor Day, we set some pretty ambitious goals and those goals were based on shareholder feedback. Then in 2023, we focused on what we control and we delivered on our plans with strong operating and financial results. Those results enable us to deliver the attractive returns to shareholders that you heard about today. Now, in 2024, we\u2019re raising the performance bar once again to enhance our ability to reward shareholders with strong returns now and in the future. For those of you that are invested in Phillips 66, we thank you for your confidence.\nJeff Dietert: Thanks for all your interest in Phillips 66. If you have further questions, please call Owen or me. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you everyone for joining us today. This concludes our call and you may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Tim Roberts",
            "content": "All right. Thanks, Mark. Yeah. Manav, a couple things. I mean, really, it's pretty simple. When you put the two -- with the transaction, you put the two businesses together, we had improved volumes, costs were down, we executed well operationally, we executed well commercially and then ultimately what that does is allow you to deliver results and we felt this was more representative of what we're going to see in this business going forward. It really does highlight the strong earnings and free cash flow generation of the Midstream segment. Now, that doesn't all happen by accident. It's been a bit of a slog as we've slowly got those folks integrated. We're almost done with the integration completely. We should be done sometime here early in the second quarter, once we get all the ERP and IT systems all under one versus still running two in parallel. So we expect to see some additional costs come off. But really, it's just what I call blocking and tackling. We have -- the market hasn't been overly helpful, so we've had to make do with what we can in this environment. And I think, like I said, you operate well and you commercially execute well, you give yourself a chance and I think this is representative of that. So overall, we like the transaction and we like where it's going and we think it's getting itself positioned well to go out and compete. Yeah. Hey, Matt. This is Tim. Yeah. A couple things on that from the Chem standpoint. Yeah, we've seen actually pretty good stability with regard to polyethylene prices through the fourth quarter. Things were relatively flat from October through December. Then they got a $0.05 increase in January. How much of the $0.05 they actually get, I think, that might be a little bit of a discussion point. But nonetheless, it did highlight that the U.S. is running hard. Demand in the U.S. has been good, albeit steady in Europe, soft in Asia. The feedstock advantage here is really, you've got a highly utilized U.S. Gulf Coast kit, namely CPChem and they're running hard. So you've seen some destocking that's going on as well. So I think that's helped underpin a little bit of momentum. Now, I don't think anybody's declaring victory on this at this point. I think there's a lot of destocking that still needs to happen throughout the balance of the year. But it does tell you that the market forces are in play and you will see a rebalancing through 2024. Yeah. Jason, that's a great question. And no, that's how we would look at it. If I look at 2024, as you kind of think about what we see that IBT looking like, we think that looks somewhere around on average, again, simple average across the four quarters about 675 a quarter. But you're right, there's some seasonality that comes into play. Typically, it's a little stronger in the fourth quarter. Again, you nailed it, propane, butane, all those things kind of come into play. You see a little bit of that still in the first quarter. So, again, first quarter, fourth quarter, a little bit stronger, and then it comes off a little bit. But on average, about 675 is what we're looking at. Now, that's at mid-cycle. So, I want to be real clear there. At mid-cycle commodity pricing, that's the framework we're operating under. Now, obviously, if you look at first quarter, if there are winter events and things that happen that remember a couple years ago that we had and that's a different game, too. We'll have to -- we just deal with that when that occurs. But generally, that's kind of the framework we're looking at, again, on an IBT basis."

            "name": "Brian Mandell",
            "content": "Hi, Manav. It's Brian. I'll take that one. Global gasoline demand finished last year about 3% over prior year. We saw about 1% in the U.S. We expect 2024 global gasoline to grow almost 1% and we're expecting U.S. to remain flat. Gasoline inventories continue at the high end of the five-year average for both U.S. and Europe. We think the majority of the stored gasoline is winter grade, particularly given the current strong octane values. Overall gasoline stocks, we think, should move back to the middle of the five-year range with spring turnarounds as we move toward the summer. On the distillate side, distillate demand finished 2023 about 2% over 2022 and the U.S. was actually down 2%, mostly in the West Coast due to rains and the renewable diesel production and imports. Latin America we saw up 2%. We expect 2024 global distillate demand to grow about 0.5% and the U.S. 2%, given the U.S.'s stronger economy. And U.S. distillate stocks are about 14% below five-year average and we'd anticipate draws through the spring maintenance season that should take inventories even closer to last year's levels. And finally, on jet demand, finished last year 17% over prior year, with a total C count recovering to 2019. 2024 global jet demand is expected to grow about 6%, with continued recovery on international travel and we've seen cargo flights remain elevated and we think that'll continue in 2024 as well."

            "name": "Rich Harbison",
            "content": "Yeah. Ryan, this is Rich. I'll take that question here to kick it off and maybe somebody will fill in for some additional color here. But the way we see the project progression at this point is, as Kevin mentioned in his points that, in February, we're going to shut down the facility and that will allow us then to tie in the common utilities for one of our hydrocrackers, which is currently in the conversion process. We expect that to start up in March timeframe, which will quickly ramp up to about 50% of the stated capacity of the Rodeo Renewed Project. In April, we will finish up the PTU and continue the conversion of the second reactor hydrocrackers system and finish that up in April and then start the commissioning process, which will roll into the May timeframe and then we'll continue to optimize performance up and we expect to be up to full rates by the end of the second quarter would be the ramp period for that. Does that answer your question there, Ryan? John, I'll take that. This is Rich. Yeah. I think that the range that we're at last year and this year is what you would consider an average year for us and the outlook for this year stays in that. Like most companies, we do concentrate our plan maintenance activity in the first and fourth quarters in our system in any given year and we tend to lighten those during the driving season, second quarter and third quarter of the year. But the way our turnarounds are working and a huge effort by the organization, which I need to compliment them, is to really flatten out these heavy peak periods in our turnaround cycles. Now, we will occasionally get a couple sites that get stacked up on ourselves, but what we've really tried to do is push those out, level out the spend on a long-term basis and work towards this $500 million to $600 million range as our average turnaround cycle. So there will be a few years that will be a little bit higher than that and then there will be some that may be slightly under that as well. But in a general sense, that's a good number to use. Yeah. Jason, this Rich. We will start off with the easier feedstocks generally and those are used vegetable oils, maybe some used cooking oils and some neat vegetable oils. As we get the pretreatment unit up and running and lined out, we'll start introducing lower and lower CI carbon intensive feedstocks, which includes the fats, the greases, the tallows, those types of feedstocks, and we fully expect those to be introduced into the system towards the second half of the second quarter, maybe into the third quarter and we'll slowly and continuously reduce that carbon intensity feedstock quality as we get more and more comfortable with the operation of the pretreatment unit and their impacts inside the processing units as well. So -- and I think our commercial organizations lined up with that same and they've been out and about gathering up these feedstocks and actively developing the aggregation facilities. And so they're positioning quite well for the -- looking for the green light from the Rodeo team to go ahead and start sending these that direction and they'll be ready when we're ready."

            "name": "Mark Lashier",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff. Welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter earnings call. We delivered a strong quarter and a strong year. In 2023, our total shareholder return was 33% and we increased our quarterly dividend by 8%. Today we're going to cover a few major items, including the reasons why Philips 66 is an attractive investment opportunity and we'll highlight the progress we've made on our strategic priorities. Next, we'll discuss our fourth quarter financial results. Then we look forward to your questions. On slide three, we summarize the attributes that make us a differentiated and attracted value proposition. Our diversified and integrated portfolio delivers strong returns on capital employed and a high payout ratio supported by dividend growth. We're on a path to increase mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA by 40% to $14 billion by 2030. In addition, 75% of this growth will be outside of Refining. We expect this growth and more stable cash flow to support our valuation going forward and contribute to attractive total shareholder returns. Our disciplined approach to capital allocation across our portfolio has contributed to an average return on capital employed of 13% since our formation in 2012, almost double our cost of capital. We're committed to financial flexibility and our strong investment grade credit rating remains differentiated relative to our peers. We expect to return in excess of 50% of our growing operating cash flow to shareholders. All of these attributes will support a secure, competitive and growing dividend, strong share repurchases, as well as debt reduction at mid-cycle margins. Slide four summarizes our achievements to-date on our strategic priorities. On our last call, we raised our targets and continue to successfully execute our plan to increase mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA and grow shareholder distributions. Since July of 2022, we've distributed $8.3 billion through share repurchases and dividends. We're on track to achieve our $13 billion to $15 billion target by the end of 2024. The execution of our plan to enhance Refining operating performance has resulted in crude utilization rates above the industry average for four consecutive quarters. In fact, we operated at our highest annual rate since 2019. We remain focused on improving performance, increasing market capture and reducing costs to enhance our earnings per barrel. In Midstream, our NGO wellhead to market business continues to exceed our expectations. The team has done a remarkable job of integrating DCP Midstream and captured run rate synergies of $250 million as of year-end and we expect over $400 million of synergies by 2025. Since increasing our ownership of DCP, the Midstream annual run rate for adjusted EBITDA has been $3.6 billion. The stable cash generation from our Midstream business has grown to a level that covers the company's top capital priorities, funding sustaining capital and the dividend. We're delivering on business transformation targets and remain laser focused on further reducing our cost structure in 2024. Kevin will be providing more details. In addition, we plan to monetize assets that no longer fit our long-term strategy. These asset dispositions are expected to generate over $3 billion in proceeds that will support our strategic priorities, including returns to shareholders. Timing of these dispositions will be subject to satisfactory market conditions and any necessary regulatory approvals. Our total adjusted EBITDA in 2023 was $12.7 billion, reflecting above mid-cycle margins in Refining and nearly $6 billion contributed by our more stable Midstream and Marketing and Specialties businesses. We're focused on disciplined capital allocation, only funding attractive, high-return projects across our portfolio. The Rodeo Renewed Project to convert our San Francisco Refinery into one of the world's largest renewable fuels facilities is expected to generate strong returns. The project's progressing well and we expect to start up later this quarter. Looking forward, we're well positioned to achieve our targets by capitalizing on the strengths of our diversified and integrated portfolio. We'll do this through continued operating and commercial excellence to deliver significant shareholder value through the economic cycles as demonstrated by our total shareholder return of 33% in 2023. Our commitment to a secure, competitive and growing dividend has resulted in a 16% compound annual growth rate since 2012. Before I turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results, I'd like to thank the Phillips 66 team for their continued dedication to safe and reliable operations. Our employees enable us to execute on our strategic priorities and deliver on our mission to provide energy and improve lives. Kevin, over to you. Yeah. Manav, thanks for your comments. I'm just going to make some high level comments and then turn it over to Tim. But I appreciate you recognizing that we are delivering on the integration. The integration has been a success. The DCP team is fully integrated into Phillips 66 and performing seamlessly, and we're seeing great, really synergies across the whole value chain that even down at the level of communications, things happening quicker, things -- better decisions being made faster and it's really been something to behold. As we noted in the comments, we did hit $250 million of synergies captured and we've got a line of sight on another or getting that up to $400 million plus. And Tim and his team are hard at work, so I'll let him give you some more color on that. Thanks, Manav. Good morning, Paul. So, Rodeo performance in the fourth quarter versus the first quarter. Yeah. And Matthew, I think this just demonstrates the resilience of CPChem across this down cycle. They've done relatively well, been able to run at high rates and compete, and be cash positive and show bottom of the cycle returns that we're happy with. We're anxious to see them come out of this cyclical downturn, but they are really, really well positioned for the long-term. Yeah. Well, I won't go into a lot of detail on that, Theresa, but what I will tell you is we're long. We are long on NGLs. But actually, we want to be and that's by design. We offload to third parties to run some of our product for us, whether to transport or whether to frac. And at some point, I'd like to think over time, as we continue to build scale on the integrated value chain that we've got, we'll bring those volumes in-house. But at this point in time, like I said, we're long and we are for the foreseeable future on NGLs. Yeah. As far as asset sales go, we said before that everything we have has a value and we understand what that value is and that's what we're focused on. If we can capture more value from someone else owning assets, then we'll do that. But having said that, we are in some active discussions as we speak. There's a number of processes underway that we can't comment on, but all I'd say is, leave it there, that we'll have more comments likely at our first quarter earnings call. Yeah. Particularly in Chicago where the crack is now close to zero, a number of factors have caused that weak gasoline margins. Demand has been poor due to winter weather, which affected production, demand more than production. Refinings have been running strongly there. And then the upper Illinois River was frozen for 10 days, which blocked U.S. Mid-Con or Chicago exports from getting to the U.S. Gulf Coast. So kind of our view there is Chicago refineries are soon going to be in turnaround and there's a closed arc from the U.S. Gulf Coast up north. We think things will clear up, particularly as winter grade gasoline has moved out of tank and the market switches to summer grade gasoline. I would say, first with Russia, now with the Red Sea, we have been seeing different arbitrage, different places. As you know, Russian barrels are going different places than they used to. But by and large, it's just increasing freight rates and time. For us, that's actually helpful because as it does that the European type barrels, the Brent TIs widen out and we buy more barrels at basis WTI, so for us, it's a benefit. Also, we have a strong and robust bunker fueling business, which also benefits from the higher bunker sales for the longer voyages. Thanks for all your questions. I'm going to wrap up with slide 13 and have some comments about where we've been and where we're headed.

            "name": "Kevin Mitchell",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. I'll start on slide five with an update on our business transformation progress and how we are reducing costs to sustain higher cash generation. We achieved $1.2 billion in run rate savings as of year-end 2023, comprised of $900 million of cost reductions and $300 million of sustaining capital efficiencies. Sustaining capital is one of our business transformation success stories. Our sustaining capital historically averaged about $1 billion per year and we added approximately $200 million with the consolidation of DCP Midstream. Despite the additional sustaining capital requirements from DCP, we reduced our sustaining capital spend to under $900 million in 2023. This $300 million benefit is also reflected in our 2024 capital plan. Through the end of 2023, we realized $630 million in cost reductions. The majority of these cost reductions relate to Refining, operating and SG&A expenses, as well as benefits to equity earnings and gross margin. On slide six, we provide more detail on the cost reductions at the total company level. Adjusted controllable costs were $8.4 billion in 2023, compared with $8.1 billion in 2022. The chart illustrates the main cost drivers year-over-year, including the impact of a full year of DCP consolidation. We continue to realize cost synergies from the DCP acquisition and subsequent integration. Our successful business transformation has already reduced costs, including our share of WRB costs, by approximately $500 million and this work continues. Slide seven provides a breakdown of Refining costs. Refining adjusted controllable costs, including turnaround expense and our proportionate share of WRB and MiRO controllable costs, decreased over $550 million to $5.2 billion in 2023. Business transformation savings reduced Refining costs by approximately $300 million. Additionally, lower turnaround expense and market impacts, primarily from lower utility prices, further reduced costs. These cost reductions more than offset inflationary impacts. On a $1 per barrel basis, adjusted controllable costs were $7.56 per barrel or $6.57 per barrel, excluding turnaround expense. This is a fully burdened cost that includes about $1 per barrel for Refining share of corporate allocations and SG&A expenses. The business transformation savings reduced our 2023 adjusted costs by over $0.40 per barrel. We expect to achieve our full $1 per barrel run rate target by the end of 2024. Additional details can be referenced in the appendix to this presentation. Slide eight summarizes our fourth quarter results. Adjusted earnings were $1.4 billion or $3.09 per share. We generated operating cash flow of $2.2 billion, including cash distributions from equity affiliates of $226 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $634 million. We distributed $1.6 billion to shareholders through $1.2 billion of share repurchases and $457 million of dividends. Net debt to capital ratio was 34% at year-end 2023 and return on capital employed was 16% for the year. Slide nine highlights the change in results by segment from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. During the period, adjusted earnings decreased $708 million, mostly due to lower results in Refining and Marketing and Specialties, partially offset by improved results in Midstream. In Midstream, fourth quarter adjusted pre-tax income of $754 million was a record, up $185 million from the prior quarter, reflecting improvements in both NGL and transportation. The NGL business increased primarily due to higher margins and record volumes at the Sweeney Hub, as well as lower operating costs. Transportation results were also higher, mainly reflecting the recognition of deferred revenue related to throughput and deficiency agreements. Chemicals adjusted pre-tax income increased $2 million to $106 million in the fourth quarter. This increase was mainly due to higher margins, mostly offset by lower equity earnings from CPChem's affiliates and decreased sales volumes from lower seasonal demand. Global O&P utilization was 94%. Refining fourth quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $797 million, down $943 million from the third quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower realized margins. Realized margins decreased due to lower market crack spreads, partially offset by inventory hedge impacts, higher Gulf Coast clean product realizations, wider heavy crude discounts and strong commercial results. Market capture increased from 66% to 107%. Marketing and Specialties adjusted fourth quarter pre-tax income was $432 million, a decrease of $201 million from the previous quarter. The decrease was mainly due to a seasonal decline in domestic wholesale fuel margins, primarily in the Mid-Continent. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 23%. Slide 10 shows the change in cash during the fourth quarter. We started the quarter with a $3.5 billion cash balance. Cash from operations excluding working capital was $2 billion. There was a working capital benefit of $207 million, mainly reflecting a reduction in inventory that was mostly offset by movements in accounts receivables and payables, which included the impact of declining commodity prices. We funded $634 million of capital spending and repaid approximately $100 million of debt. Additionally, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our ending cash balance was $3.3 billion. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items for the first quarter. In Chemicals, we expect the first quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the first quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low 90s and turnaround expense to be between $110 million and $130 million. Our turnaround expense guidance excludes costs associated with the conversion and start-up of the Rodeo Renewable Fuels Facility. At our San Francisco Refinery, we are executing the Rodeo Renewed Project. The facility operated as a crude oil refinery in January. [Audio Gap] ... refinery, we are executing the Rodeo Renewed Project. The facility operated as a crude oil refinery in January and we will shut down crude operations in February, as we are prepared to start up renewable fuels production by the end of the quarter. We anticipate $100 million of decommissioning and start-up costs in the first quarter. We anticipate first quarter, corporate and other costs to come in between $290 million and $310 million. Full year guidance for 2024 is provided on slide 11 of this presentation. Now we will open the line for questions, after which Mark will make closing comments. Yeah. Ryan, it's Kevin. Let me make some additional comments around that. So a few different drivers to the strong market capture. You'll recall back in the third quarter, we talked about some inventory hedge impacts that were a negative $100 million to $150 million and that we expected that to reverse in the fourth quarter, and that is in fact what happened. And so you had that benefit, which is a circa close to $300 million swing quarter-over-quarter. We also had improved feedstock, especially in the central corridor on Canadian crude differentials, and obviously, that's really a market-driven item. In the Gulf Coast, we had benefit from product pricing because of the effect on -- sort of lagged effect on product pricing for barrels going up colonial and so that again is a bit of a market-driven factor. So that item was a bit of a headwind in the third quarter, it was a tailwind in the fourth quarter and what will happen in the first quarter is going to be dependent on where prices end the quarter at. But we also had strong commercial results and this is a result of really being able to take advantage of market opportunities as they present themselves to us. So we were able to capture strong pipeline arbitrage and the commercial optimization around that as we optimized those barrels. So it's a bit of a combination of there are certain things that you would say were unique to the market dynamics in the quarter, but some of it is a function of strong operations, strong commercial execution by that organization. Yeah. Doug, it's Kevin. Let me try and fill in the gaps on that one for you. There's really a couple of items that are probably a bit more significant in terms of the shift from current to what's 2025 mid-cycle the $14 billion target. So for one, remember, the $14 billion is mid-cycle. The Chemicals business is not at mid-cycle currently and that's about an incremental $1 billion to get to mid-cycle. And then in a -- on a mid-cycle basis, there's an increment of about $200 million from the mid-cap projects that they have just put into place, most of which took place -- happened towards the end of last year and so an incremental billion in Chemicals really driven by the overall environment. Rodeo is not reflected in current and that's a $700 million mid-cycle impact. And so that's a -- between those two, you're at getting close to $2 billion of increment that is still to come. There is some additional on the cost side of things and there's Midstream at -- while we're close to our mid-cycle on a run rate basis, remember, the $12.7 billion only had our current ownership of DCPs since June of last year. So there's that incremental step up on it from an adjusted basis on that -- in that respect.  In addition, we talked about the $600 million of additional commercial contribution to the business. We expect to see that materialize over the next two years and we're also executing on the Refining projects that Rich has talked about in the past. And so those are the items that are going to get us to that $14 billion 2025 mid-cycle level. Yeah. Doug, it's -- understand the request and why you would want that and we'll take that under consideration as we think about how we're going to report the go-forward Rodeo as a renewable fuels facility, because we do want -- we also want to be able to demonstrate that that asset as a renewable fuels facility is generating the kind of financial results that we've been talking about and so we'll take that under consideration in terms of what we show from a recast basis. I think the question on what Rodeo has done in the past, it's really been a function of the market environment. I mean, it has been challenged over the last few years as what was historically a very strong crude advantage, sort of disappeared with the declining supplies of domestic feedstocks for this facility and having to rely more on imported barrels. But then you're also, it's a high cost area as you know, so it's, although that's typical, that's all of California is that way and then you're into what the market environment looks like. And so what we've typically seen in California is when there's operating upsets and supply is impacted, then you see an increase in margins and the financials look respectable, but there are -- when everything's running well, it's more challenged. Yeah. John, you're right that the working capital tailwind that we expected to see for a variety of reasons didn't quite materialize the way that we thought they would and that probably impacted us by 2 percentage points to 3 percentage points on the net debt to capital metric. We expect to make some modest progress on a debt reduction in 2024. We have a total of $1.1 billion of maturities in 2024 at the Phillips 66 level. And so that gives us some flexibility in terms of how we manage this. I will say though, that the working capital component is always a little bit of a wild card, because it can swing us to the tune of a couple of billion dollars over the course of a quarter and that has an impact on the stated metrics. So I think what I'd say is that, we still target the 25% to 30% range, but when you step back and look in aggregate terms, we're very comfortable with where we are, and our capital allocation decisions are going to be made with consideration of all the different priorities that we've got out there of which the balance sheet and debt is one of them. So I don't want to commit to any sort of rash decisions just to target that one particular metric. We want to make sure we make the right overall decisions factoring in all of the different priorities. So, Paul, what was the first part of the question? I missed that first piece. Yeah. So we -- I mean, we don't give out that sort of asset-specific level of financial information. What I can say is that the -- when you look at the fourth quarter results and the capture rates, the Rodeo starting to come -- turn operations down, we shut down one of the crude units in the fourth quarter. That did have a detrimental impact to our fourth quarter results versus if we were just carrying on in the traditional normal full crude operations at Rodeo. So it did have an impact. In terms of the $100 million of startup and decommissioning costs in the first quarter, we would not treat those as a special item. They will flow through as GAAP earnings or impact and that will be how we report the results, because they're not, I mean, it's normal for what we're doing. It's not a unique factor. Now, we can talk about it and you can choose to make your own sort of adjustments around it. But for us, it will just be part of our normal operating results. Yeah. So, I think, the bulk of the rest. So that's one factor on that. You've also got the swing I mentioned on the Gulf Coast product pricing effect. You had a swing there from one quarter to the next. And you also have the benefit in there of our, we talked about our commercial performance during the quarter. That will also show up in that bar. So, all those things get reflected in that part of the representation. Yeah. I mean, it's a combination of all of those items. So you see benefit on the product side. You see benefit from commercial contribution. You see the benefit from the inventory hedging items that we talked about. So they all combine to make up the bulk of that $7. Yeah. Matt, that's a great question. We had pretty strong deferred tax benefit in 2023 and also 2022, and in both years the primary driver to those were the MLP roll-ups. So in 2022, we had benefit associated with PSXP, and in 2023, with the DCP roll-up. And that end -- in the end, that was a bigger benefit than we were anticipating, which drove some of the movements in that that you saw last year. That benefit drops off significantly as we go into 2024 and it's a combination of less lower capital spend and so less depreciation to take advantage of, and bonus depreciation is scaling down as well, so we dropped 60% year one bonus in 2024. So we're anticipating about a $200 million benefit for the year in 2024, so quite a lot lower than what we had in 2023. There is one caveat on this and that there's a current bill in Congress that if ultimately passed, will extend some of the tax provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Right now we're in the process of starting to sunset out, and if that passes, we'll actually see 100% bonus depreciation backdated to 2023, so you'd get 2023, 2024 and 2025 all at 100%. That would benefit us in 2024 and to the tune of probably an incremental $300 million or so, but that's contingent on that legislation passing."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jeff Dietert, Vice President of Investor Relations. Jeff, you may begin.\nJeff Dietert: Good morning and welcome to Phillips 66 third quarter earnings conference call. Participants on today\u2019s call will include Mark Lashier, President and CEO; Kevin Mitchell, CFO; Tim Roberts, Midstream and Chemicals; Rich Harbison, Refining; and Brian Mandell, Marketing and Commercial. Today\u2019s presentation material can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website, along with supplemental financial and operating information. Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement. We will be making forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call. Actual results may differ materially from today\u2019s comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here as well as in our SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Lashier: Thanks, Jeff. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong financial and operating results and we continue to execute on our strategic priorities to increase shareholder value. Our achievements to-date have enabled us to make significant progress toward the commitments we made to shareholders a year ago at Investor Day. We are confident in our ability to exceed these commitments and we will provide an update today. Slide 4 shows the evolution of our portfolio. We are much more than a refining company. We are differentiated by an integrated and diversified Midstream, Chemicals, Refining, Marketing and Specialties portfolio that generates free cash flow through the economic cycles. Our global commercial supply and trading organization leverages our assets to generate incremental value. We continue to execute our strategy to increase more stable cash flows in Midstream. We see more growth opportunities as U.S. natural gas and natural gas liquids production is expected to outpace crude oil. The demand fundamentals are strong as NGLs and petrochemical feedstocks remain the fastest growing segment of liquids demand. The DCP acquisition earlier this year strengthened our competitive position by integrating our NGL wellhead-to-market value chain and adds over $1 billion to mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA. Our current synergy run-rate is on pace to deliver more than $400 million. Midstream\u2019s stable cash generation covers the company\u2019s dividend and our sustaining capital. We will continue to capitalize on our integrated and diversified portfolio to deliver results. Moving to Slide 5. At our Investor Day in November 2022, we targeted $3 billion in mid-cycle EBITDA growth by 2025. This included NGL wellhead-to-market, Rodeo Renewed, business transformation and CPChem growth projects. Given the substantial progress employees across the company have made, we are raising the bar. We now expect to grow mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA by $4 billion between 2022 and 2025, reflecting a $1 billion increase from our original target. This includes additional value from business transformation, midstream synergies and commercial contributions. We are increasing the business transformation target to $1.4 billion from $1 billion. We are enhancing our commercial capabilities to extract additional value, maximizing return on capital employed and increasing refining market capture. We are committing to higher shareholder distributions. Our new target is $13 billion to $15 billion between July 2022 and year end 2024. This is an increase from our original target of $10 billion to $12 billion. We will return over 50% of our operating cash flow to shareholders. Lastly, we plan to monetize assets that no longer meet strategic long-term objectives. Proceeds from monetizing these non-core assets are expected to be more than $3 billion. We will deploy the proceeds to advance strategic priorities, including accelerating cash return to shareholders. Slide 6 shows progress on distributions to shareholders and improving Refining performance. We returned $6.7 billion through share repurchases and dividends since July 2022, representing over 50% of operating cash flow during the same time period. Strong cash generation and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to exceed the pace to achieve the original $10 billion to $12 billion target before year end 2024. The increased target of $13 billion to $15 billion equates to 25% to 30% of current market cap. Our Board of Directors approved a $5 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization. This is in addition to the previous authorization, which had approximately $3.1 billion remaining as of September 30. Since 2012, the Board has authorized $25 billion in share repurchases. These higher distributions to shareholders will be supported by $4 billion of mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA growth between 2022 and 2025. We are laser-focused on improving Refining performance. Third quarter crude utilization of 95% was the highest utilization since 2019. Our refining system ran above industry average utilization rates for the third straight quarter. We continue to advance high return, low capital projects to improve reliability and market capture. We are executing 10 to 15 projects a year to improve market capture by 5%. Last year, we completed several projects that added 2% to market capture and we expect the 2023 projects to add a further 1.3%. We reduced costs by $0.40 per barrel and will achieve a $0.75 per barrel run-rate by the end of 2023. Our people have fully embraced business transformation and we are raising our target to a $1 per barrel run-rate by the end of 2024. Slide 7 provides an overview of the business transformation program. We are increasing our business transformation target to $1.4 billion, comprised of $1.1 billion of cost reductions and $300 million of sustaining capital efficiencies. The incremental reductions are $300 million in costs, over half of which benefits Refining and $100 million of sustaining capital. We are on track to achieve the targets this year and next. Slide 8 summarizes our strategic priorities and enhancements. Last November, we announced six priorities to increase shareholder value. These were ambitious and consistent with investor feedback. Our achievements to-date provide us with the confidence that we will not only meet these targets, but we\u2019ll exceed them. So with the support of our Board, we are increasing our commitments to shareholders. Delivering on the commitments will generate additional free cash flow from our integrated and diversified portfolio, positioning us to increase cash returns to shareholders now and in the future. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kevin to review the third quarter financial results.\nKevin Mitchell: Thank you, Mark. Adjusted earnings were $2.1 billion or $4.63 per share. A $9 million decrease in the fair value of our investment in NOVONIX reduced earnings per share by $0.02. We generated operating cash flow of $2.7 billion, including a working capital benefit of $285 million and cash distributions from equity affiliates of $361 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $855 million. We returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through $752 million of share repurchases and $465 million of dividends. We ended the quarter with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 33%. Annualized adjusted return on capital employed was 17%. I\u2019ll cover the segment results on Slide 10. Additional details can be referenced in the appendix to this presentation. This slide highlights the change in adjusted results by segment from the second quarter to the third quarter. During the period, adjusted earnings increased $304 million, mostly due to improved results in Refining, partially offset by lower results in Chemicals and Midstream as well as higher corporate costs. In Midstream, third quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $569 million, down $57 million from the prior quarter. The decrease related to our NGL business and was mainly due to the timing of cargo freight costs as well as higher utility, integration and employee costs. These impacts were partially offset by higher margins from increasing commodity prices. Chemicals adjusted pre-tax income decreased $88 million to $104 million in the third quarter. This decrease was mainly due to lower margins. Global O&P utilization was 99%. Refining third quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $1.7 billion, up $592 million from the second quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher realized margins and strong utilization. Realized margins increased due to higher market crack spreads, partially offset by inventory hedge impacts, lower secondary product margins and lower Gulf Coast clean product realizations. Inventory hedges and losses from secondary products mainly reflect the impact of rising crude prices during the quarter. These market factors negatively impacted capture rate, which was 66% in the quarter. Marketing and Specialties adjusted third quarter pre-tax income was $633 million, a slight decrease of $11 million from the previous quarter, reflecting continued strong margins. The Corporate and Other segment\u2019s adjusted pre-tax costs were $59 million higher than the previous quarter. The increase was mainly due to higher net interest expense related to acquiring DCP Midstream\u2019s public common units on June 15 as well as employee-related expenses. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 24%. The impact of non-controlling interest was improved compared to the prior quarter and reflects a lower non-controlling interest since our acquisition of DCP Midstream public common units. Slide 11 shows the change in cash during the third quarter. We started the quarter with a $3 billion cash balance. Cash from operations was $2.4 billion, excluding working capital. During the quarter, we funded $358 million of pension plan contributions, which comes out of cash from operations. That was a working capital benefit of $285 million. Year-to-date working capital is a use of around $2 billion, primarily related to inventory that we expect to mostly reverse by year-end. We received $280 million from asset dispositions, mainly reflecting the sale of our interest in South Texas Gateway Terminal. Total proceeds from asset dispositions of $370 million through the third quarter of 2023. We funded $855 million of capital spending. This includes $260 million for the acquisition of a U.S. West Coast marketing business. We repaid approximately $500 million of debt, mostly reflecting lower borrowings on DCP Midstream\u2019s credit facilities. Additionally, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our ending cash balance was $3.5 billion. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I\u2019ll cover a few outlook items. In Chemicals, we expect the fourth quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the fourth quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low-90s and turnaround expenses to be between $90 million and $110 million. We anticipate fourth quarter Corporate and Other costs to come in between $280 million and $300 million. Now we will open the line for questions, after which Mark will make closing comments.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs, your line is now open. Please ask your question.\nNeil Mehta: Thank you. Good morning, team. This was very helpful, particularly the commentary on the strategic priorities. And so I want to \u2013 on the bullet about maintaining financial strength and flexibility, you talked about moving from $3 billion to $4 billion of EBITDA growth and greater than $3 billion of non-core asset dispositions. So wondering if you could take some time to talk about what are the key drivers of the move from $3 billion to $4 billion? And then as you identify non-core asset sales, what are some of the parameters that you\u2019re evaluating as we think about what assets could be part of that discussion?\nMark Lashier: Hi, Neil. Good morning. This is Mark. When you think about the additional billion-dollar increments in EBITDA, that really comes from the enhanced business transformation work that we\u2019re going to do as well as the additional synergies we intend to capture from the DCP roll-up, supplemented by the enhanced capability and value creation that we\u2019re going to see out of the commercial organization. Regarding asset dispositions, this fundamentally is about creating focus and redeploying capital. We\u2019re not going to comment on specific assets today, but we generally have some high-performing assets that may be more valuable to others and maybe more strategic to others and we are going to explore that. And if we can capture value greater than our whole value, we\u2019ll do so. But the bottom line is this, that we\u2019re committed to managing the portfolio to drive focus that\u2019s consistent with our strategy and simplifying our business.\nNeil Mehta: Okay. Alright, thank you. And then on the quarter itself, the Refining capture rates probably came in a little bit lower than street was expecting. Was that just timing effects with crude? Or is there anything else that we need to keep in mind as we think about what it all means for 4Q and 2024?\nKevin Mitchell: Yes, Neil. It\u2019s Kevin. Let me just make a couple of comments on that. So we did have a few things moving around in the quarter that impacted capture to the negative. And so we saw regional price differentials that differed from the benchmark that we use in terms of the market crack. And so those worked against us that during the quarter, for example, the Chicago market, which became disconnected from the group, and we move product into that market. We also had an impact from the effect of inventory hedges in a rising price environment. So that crack component, this all showed up in the central corridor. We expect about $100 million to $150 million of that to come back in the fourth quarter as we see the physical gain on those barrels that offsets the paper loss that we took in the third quarter.\nNeil Mehta: It\u2019s very helpful. Thank you, Kevin.\nOperator: Thank you, Neil. Roger Read from Wells Fargo Securities, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRoger Read: Yes, thank you. Good morning and appreciate the winding up of the changes here, improvements, I should say, overall. The question I have, to start with, you mentioned $3 billion of target disposition proceeds, but you\u2019ve upped your overall EBITDA target. So I\u2019m just curious, what EBITDA is associated with those ops, if any? And what does that imply about the sort of extra growth in the overall performance of your raised EBITDA target?\nKevin Mitchell: Yes. Roger, it\u2019s Kevin. So just for clarity on that point, the growth that we laid out there, the incremental $1 billion is excluding the impact of dispositions. And so clearly, dispositions will reduce EBITDA. We\u2019re not giving any guidance on that at this point in time. I mean, you can come up with an assumption on where you may think we will be selling assets and make a multiple assumption from that. But we\u2019re not giving any specific guidance on the dispositions, other than we expect to realize in excess of $3 billion.\nRoger Read: Okay. And I assume based on the idea that there is always a larger pool of assets that could be sold, that\u2019s why it\u2019s unclear right now what the net impact would be.\nKevin Mitchell: That\u2019s right. We will do what makes the most sense for us.\nRoger Read: Okay. And then a follow-up to Neil\u2019s question on Refining margins, but maybe looking forward rather than back. The shift here, where diesel margins are well above gasoline, I think about generally a diesel yield improvement for you versus industry standards. Is that the right way to think about Q4 here? Or is there anything else that we should be paying attention to that would work against that?\nRich Harbison: Yes, Roger, this is Rich. As we\u2019ve indicated over the years, our kit has shifted towards distillate production. There is nothing that\u2019s changed on that, other than some of our flexibility to move back and forth between gasoline and distillate. So we still maintain a kit that is favorable to distillate margins in the market.\nRoger Read: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Roger. Manav Gupta from UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nManav Gupta: Good morning, guys. My question here is, and I know kind of answer, most likely you will not answer it, but we get this question a lot. A very strong result on the West Coast again. A weaker default in price environment. Is there a possibility you could let Rodeo Renewed a little longer and capture higher margins and then just wait for LCFS to rebound later in 2024? So is there a way you could \u2013 is there a possibility you could move the timing of startup of Rodeo to better coincide with higher LCFS prices and, in the meantime, make more money on the West Coast?\nRich Harbison: Manav, I\u2019ll start that answer and then maybe give \u2013 hand it over to Brian here to add a little color on the backside. So at Rodeo, maybe I\u2019ll just step back a little bit and level set on everything that\u2019s going on at Rodeo here. So Rodeo, there was two NGOs that filed a suit against at Contra Costa County, alleging that the Rodeo Renewed project environmental impact report insufficiently address project impacts. The ruling for the suit was received earlier this year. And actually, there were several issues in our favor, but there were three issues identified as insufficient in the county-certified EIR. The judge explicitly allowed construction to continue with the project while Contra Costa County works through and addresses the three deficiencies that were identified in the EIR. The county actually posted that revised EIR update on October 24. That initiated a 45-day public comment period. The county will respond to the comments and then likely issue a final EIR early 2024. So right now, our project construction remains on track to complete in the first quarter, and we\u2019re committed to that time line. However, I want to add, we have options. We\u2019ve talked a little bit about this, but let me be a little bit more explicit on this one. There is flexibility to continue crude operation in the event that circumstances beyond our control prevent the start-up of the project. I want to say we are committed to the start-up of the project. But if, for some reason, we don\u2019t have that authority, we will continue to operate in crude operation. This is a staggered conversion process. In the past, we\u2019ve called this a ramp-up plan, so that creates natural flexibility for us. It allows us to continue to process crude, or it allows us to start up the Rodeo Renewed project, which, I want to remind people, that\u2019s equivalent to removing emissions of 1 million cars from the roads. So we remain pretty confident. We remain confident, I should say, that we will start up the operation of Rodeo Renewed at the end of the first quarter. And we\u2019re focused on executing that conversion plan. But we have this planned flexibility, and we will continue to process the crude oil, if necessary. Now the outlook on the market and what your \u2013 the other part of your question is really this outlook of LCFS and \u2013 in this relationship. I\u2019m going to hand that over to Brian, who can explain that relationship a little bit more. It\u2019s more complicated than just the LCFS credit program.\nBrian Mandell: Hi, Manav, it\u2019s Brian. So when you think about the RD margins, you have to think about not just the credits but the price of the feedstock, the price of the RD when it comes to market. So even though we\u2019ve had lower LCFS and RINs, we\u2019ve had these distillate prices that have outrun soybean prices. In fact, soybean prices are off. We have more low CI feedstocks that are making their way into the U.S. Kinder Morgan pipeline is allowing RD on their pipelines now, so that means more reach of RD into the California market for consumption. We\u2019ve had \u2013 domestic demand is expected to continue to grow. We\u2019ve converted all our stations. We\u2019re seeing RD demand in Oregon and Washington continue to mature as those programs mature. We\u2019ve been seeing RD moving to states like Texas and Illinois and Colorado, where they have tax abatement and tax reduction programs. And I think traders believe that the U.S. harvest is looking good. And if you remember last year, in Argentina, they had a drought. And this year, we expect a more normal crop level condition. And then finally, what a lot of traders and folks have on their minds is SAF or renewable jet. And as those incentives make more sense to produce renewable jet, you\u2019ll see some of this RD that\u2019s being produced move away and become SAF. So we\u2019re expecting about 200,000 barrels a day of RD at the end of this year, but we will see some of that RD in the future become renewable jet.\nManav Gupta: Thank you. That was very detailed, and I think the key is the flexibility part which you expressed. My quick follow-up here is, in your opening comments, you said you are more than a refiner, and yes, you have a very strong Marketing and Specialties business. Can we have some visibility, on the near and medium-term, how that business is looking, both in Europe and in the U.S., if you could elaborate a little bit on the near-term outlook for that business? Thank you.\nBrian Mandell: Hey, Manav, it\u2019s Brian again. So I\u2019ll say we had a really strong quarter in the third quarter. In fact, it was our fourth best quarter on record. Q2 and Q3 are usually stronger seasonally than Q1 and Q4. And as you remember, starting 2019, we\u2019ve added a lot of retail to our retail joint ventures in the U.S. We\u2019re up to 700 retail stores now, and they performed really well this quarter. We\u2019re also focused on what we\u2019ve called the last-mile strategy internally, which is getting Rodeo complex RD to the market, directly to the market, and getting that value chain value at Phillips 66. We\u2019ve seen product volumes in our businesses relatively flat, but we continue to optimize those volumes through higher-value distribution channels. So as a reminder, we have a wholesale business, we have a branded or franchise business, and then we have a retail business. And the branded or franchise business and the retail business, those margins are significantly higher than the wholesale margins. And then finally, on the lubricants base oil business, it continues to perform really well. So I\u2019d say, for Q4, we think that earnings will be in-line with our normal Q4 mid-cycle expectations.\nMark Lashier: Yes. Manav, I would just add over the top that Brian and his team have been just quietly and consistently executing their last-mile strategy and this opportunity to invest a fairly small amount of capital to get very high returns and to enhance our exposure to retail margins in a very accretive way. And it\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019re seeing the value show up, and you\u2019re seeing a consistent performance there that we really appreciate.\nManav Gupta: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Manav. Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. And appreciate all the updates this morning. Mark, I wonder if I could try the disposal question again. I just want to be clear where you guys are in this process. Have you internally identified the assets for sale? I just wanted to be clear on that. And maybe what your expectations are of time line? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s been touched on, and I\u2019ve got a quick follow-up on Refining.\nMark Lashier: The answer to the first question is yes. The answer to the second question is, it really is a function of the market appetite. We understand the value that these assets provide us, and they provide good value. So we\u2019ve got to find willing buyers that have a greater affinity for those assets than we do. And so we\u2019re not in any rush. We\u2019re not performing any fire sale, but we believe there is opportunities out there in the market today to execute that plan.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you. My follow-up is on Refining, and I\u2019m going to ask for a little forgiveness on this one ahead of time. But I think you know where our position has been on the strength of the Refining sector, the Refining cycle going forward, volatile as it may be. And we\u2019ve kind of challenged you guys a few times on what you\u2019re assuming as a mid-cycle sustainable EBITDA for your business. So I\u2019m curious if you could walk us through \u2013 and expedition\u2019s always possible, given we\u2019re on this call, what the moving parts are behind the contribution of Refining to the new mid-cycle targets? The capture rate is one part, but you\u2019ve been running ahead. When your facility has been running, you\u2019ve been running ahead for quite a while now. And similarly, your utilization rates were not great. Now they are better. Is that a big factor? I\u2019m just wondering what the key kind of moving parts are in the assumptions and what the contribution is from Refining in your new targets. Thank you.\nKevin Mitchell: Yes, Doug, let me try and unpack some of that. So our mid-cycle Refining EBITDA, as we laid out at Investor Day, was $4 billion. That reflects a historic average assumption around where the market will trade. And that\u2019s \u2013 we haven\u2019t changed that assumption. What we are doing is increasing our ability to capture value across that system through lower costs and increased contribution from our commercial organization and the EBITDA uplift they provide \u2013 that, that organization provides to the system will predominantly show up in Refining. It won\u2019t all be Refining, but it\u2019ll predominantly show up in Refining. We haven\u2019t tried to make a call on if we actually think the go-forward mid-cycle margin environment is stronger now than it has been historically. Clearly, we\u2019ve been in above mid-cycle conditions for most of this year and last year. And that\u2019s all \u2013 we view that as upside, so we\u2019re still pretty optimistic for the near-term. We\u2019re probably above mid-cycle in the near-term, but our fundamental view of mid-cycle hasn\u2019t changed. But our belief in terms of what that business can do in a mid-cycle environment is going up with the enhancements we\u2019re putting in place.\nDoug Leggate: Kevin, has your utilization assumption changed?\nKevin Mitchell: Well, not really because, if you think back to where we were running for the years prior to the pandemic and then we took a hit during the pandemic, we\u2019re really assuming we get back to that kind of level of operations that we were at before. And so some of the things \u2013 some of the Refining performance priorities that Rich has talked about in the past that were outlined in Investor Day a year ago, we did not include those in as increases to mid-cycle. We view that as we have to deliver on these to get back to that level of operations that we\u2019ve historically been at.\nDoug Leggate: Terrific. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you, Doug. Ryan Todd from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRyan Todd: Thanks. Maybe if I could, a question on the shareholder return target. Thanks for the positive update there. I mean, at the midpoint, it implies, I think, roughly $1 billion a year of buyback a quarter to year-end 2024, which is a nice step-up from what we saw during the third quarter, pretty close to the pace that you\u2019ve had year-to-date in 2023 in what has been a \u2013 obviously is like \u2013 certainly an above-mid-cycle environment. So can you maybe talk about your confidence in \u2013 what drove your confidence in being able to lean into the shareholder return target in that way, maybe what it implies in your view of the outlook from here? And on the \u2013 should we think \u2013 you\u2019ve been above pace on \u2013 your prior mid-cycle target has been above mid-cycle. Should we think of it the same way, where, if we continue to stay above mid-cycle in 2024, that you\u2019ll drive towards the upside or beyond and that type of target?\nMark Lashier: Yes. Ryan, this is Mark. Glad to answer that question. To answer your last question, the answer is yes. If we\u2019re outperforming our \u2013 our desire is to hit the high end of that target, and we\u2019ve provided the flexibility in the event that there is less cash available because of market conditions, we can pull back a little bit. Another thing I would point out is our $3 billion in asset dispositions, we have not factored that cash into the $13 billion to $15 billion. So there is another level of assurance there that we can hit that. And we really are focusing on the things that we can control. As you look at the business transformation, we see those numbers, we see the reality of those numbers, and we can capture that and use that value to drive those returns. And we also see line of sight to the additional increments of EBITDA, the $4 billion that\u2019s coming into play. And of course, that could be impacted by market as well. But when you factor all those things in, the risk of underperforming is fairly muted. So we\u2019ve got a high level of confidence that we can deliver.\nRyan Todd: Okay. Perfect. That\u2019s very helpful. And then maybe just a question on the Midstream. You\u2019ve had a little bit of time now with the consolidated position there, DCP under your belt at this point. Synergies have moved a little bit higher from $300 million to $400 million. Maybe can you talk about how you view the opportunity set there, both in terms of what you\u2019re seeing in terms of your ability to drive commercial improvements there and maybe incremental growth down the line?\nTim Roberts: Yes, sure. Ryan, this is Tim. So yes, great question. Glad you asked. If anything else, business transformation \u2013 and I\u2019ll talk about that because business transformation, we started that process. And as we got into it, we just found more. We\u2019re doing the same thing with the DCP integration. So as we brought this thing together \u2013 and by the way, we won\u2019t be complete with the integration. We will get all the IT stuff done by the end of the first quarter. And I think it\u2019s important to say that because once that\u2019s done in the end of the first quarter, one, we can get some redundancies in people that will move away in supporting two different systems. The other is our commercial team and our ops team will all be reading off the same screens, the single source of data. It will all be one versus trying to look at two different systems and trying to make some decisions there. So we think the real catalyst for optimization is going to happen \u2013 or further optimization will happen in that 1Q. But probably worth me giving an example here on the commercial side, so we are really excited about what \u2013 this venture and putting it together, really excited about it. And we also think the \u2013 as we have gotten into it, as I have mentioned, we really felt like we are finding more and more as we go. And the example I want to give you is one that just came up a couple of weeks ago for us, where commercially, we were able to move barrels. I won\u2019t put any names in here, we were able to move barrels off one pipe, put it onto another pipe and allow more volume to go on the pipe we moved off of. And that net impacts an additional $10 million a year for us. So, we could not have done that if we were two separate entities. So, yes, are we believers, yes. And do we think there is more there, yes. And are we encouraged once we get past the first quarter about there being more opportunity, absolutely.\nMark Lashier: Yes. And I would like to throw another example out there, Ryan, that last week, a group of us visited the Sweeny Complex, and we got to stop by the control room that operates all of our fractionators. And I asked a couple of frontline operators how they felt integration was going, and they were ecstatic because they see the ability to improve their ability to perform. They see it in real time. They said we can run at harder rates because we get better information, there is greater collaboration. They can run without concern or surprises coming at them. And so the whole mindset around business transformation, synergy capture, being more competitive has evolved all the way to the front line. These folks want to win, and they want to figure out every day how to do better and how to drive more synergies and capture that and deliver value. So, it\u2019s real, and it\u2019s out on the front line.\nRyan Todd: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Ryan. Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. Good morning guys.\nMark Lashier: Good morning Paul.\nPaul Cheng: Good morning. A couple of questions. Marketing, the business seems like continued to do better than expected in a number of quarters. You have been adding retail stations and everything. So, should we look at that your base and then what\u2019s considered mid-cycle have a structural improvement because of your \u2013 the way that how you guided maybe changing the way how you run or adding to the asset? And if it is the case, what is the new good baseline that we can assume?\nMark Lashier: Yes. Paul, what I think you are asking is you are applauding the good performance you have seen in the marketing group, and it continues to increase, as Brian and his team execute their strategy. And you are asking, is there a reset in the mid-cycle performance of the marketing business, is that the question?\nPaul Cheng: That\u2019s correct. Because I mean I think historically, that it\u2019s sort of like mid-cycle is $400 million a quarter. But you certainly have done much better than that in the past 2 years. I think that one quarter, you can say, maybe it\u2019s one risk, but it seems like it\u2019s pretty consistent that you guys have been performing better. I was just curious that, is it structurally that the business is stronger today as you add more retail station and everything, or that this is truly that you think is just the market condition is much better than average?\nBrian Mandell: Paul, this is Brian. I would say we did raise the mid-cycle a couple of years ago, and we will continue to watch it. And if we need to raise it again, we will. But obviously, the business is performing better and we are proud of the business performing better. We are going to continue to look for opportunities to add to the last-mile strategy and some of our other initiatives. So, as we see that value hitting the bottom line, we will indeed, at some point raise the mid-cycle.\nPaul Cheng: So, Brian, that you don\u2019t feel comfortable that we have seen enough of the improvement, saying that the mid-cycle is that, indeed, that is now even better than what you had in mind, say, a couple of years ago?\nBrian Mandell: I would say keep watching the bottom line, and you will see the dollars there. And when we feel comfortable, we will move mid-cycle up.\nMark Lashier: Yes, Brian never lacks confidence.\nPaul Cheng: Okay, fair enough. And maybe this one is for Rich. Rich, can you share with us that \u2013 what\u2019s the Phillips 66 turnaround activity look like for next year? Is it comparing to this year, whether it\u2019s going to be higher, lower or about the same? And also, what\u2019s your view about the industry turnaround activity for next year? Thank you.\nRich Harbison: Yes, Paul, appreciate the question. We generally give that guidance out fourth quarter, and so stand by for that outlook on the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Thank you, Paul. John Royall from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJohn Royall: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So, my first question is on the net debt target. You had guided to hitting the top end of your range on leverage by year-end. It was a pretty modest tailwind from working capital in 3Q, and Kevin mentioned you will catch it up and get most of that 1H build back in 4Q. Do you need any help from price to hit that working capital number, or could price conversely be a headwind that prevents you from getting it all back? And then does the worsening environment that we have seen here in 4Q in refining potentially impact your ability to hit that target?\nKevin Mitchell: Yes. I mean, John, the market environment will impact profitability. It will impact cash generation. But the bulk of the working capital benefit we expect to see in the fourth quarter will be driven by inventory impacts, and that\u2019s pretty solid in terms of that impact. So, while there will always be other parts moving around in this equation, I feel pretty confident that the top end of that targeted range is \u2013 we will be around about there at the end of the year. I am not too concerned by that.\nJohn Royall: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then I was just hoping for your latest views on WCS differentials. You should get some tailwinds from the widening we have seen here in 4Q. But where do you think the differential goes from here, particularly as we get close to the start-up of TMX, although there is some debate over the timing there? But just any thoughts on WCS as we head into next year would be helpful.\nBrian Mandell: Hey John, it\u2019s Brian. So, like you said, the WCS dips are very wide, minus $25 now. That\u2019s a benefit to us. We are the largest importer of Canadian crude, nearly 500,000 barrels a day. The reason the dips are wide is because you have more production than you have pipeline egress. And you also have the diluent blended into \u2013 starting in September, into the crude, which adds or swells volume. We would expect to see the dips remain seasonally wide with more barrels than egress as traders also sell barrels to meet the year-end inventories. TMX has announced the start-up in April. We will take them at their word. Currently, we don\u2019t think the pipeline will run at full capacity. But if you take a look at the forward curves currently, Q2, Q3 average is about minus $15, and that\u2019s about where we think it might end up.\nJohn Royall: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, John. Jason Gabelman from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJason Gabelman: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is on refining capture, and we have seen co-product headwinds continue now for a second quarter. Last quarter was a pretty high headwind, and then this quarter was even higher. And the oil price moving up obviously impacts the co-product headwind, but was wondering what else is going on in that bucket? If you could give us some visibility into that and if you think any of that is structural in nature.\nRich Harbison: Jason, this is Rich. Are you asking about the co-product bucket?\nJason Gabelman: Yes.\nMark Lashier: Secondary products.\nRich Harbison: Secondary products, yes. Yes, so the primary \u2013 in refining, that primary mover there is petroleum coke, right. That\u2019s the product that generally drives that secondary product margin for us. And it generally lags behind crude pricing, right, and it\u2019s tied to the coal markets that can pressure it up or pressure it down based on supply and demand requirements there. The other subtle component that plays into secondary products for us is NGL pricing. And that\u2019s bigger in some markets than others for us, but it certainly does play into it, and that\u2019s been depressed for some period now. And that\u2019s \u2013 our outlook continues to not be real strong on NGL pricing on the forward curves. The balance of the secondary products, which are fuel oil intermediates and some other products that probably aren\u2019t worth mentioning, those have been relatively flat, really, over the period. So, we don\u2019t see \u2013 so, we see those coke and NGLs as the primary movers right now for us in that area.\nJason Gabelman: Got it. Thanks. And my follow-up is on the $3 billion divestment target and not really where that\u2019s going to come from, but use of proceeds. You mentioned in the earnings press release that those proceeds will be deployed to strategic priorities, including returns to shareholders. But I was wondering if there is a desire to use some of that cash to continue to grow and just, kind of in broad strokes, what type of growth you would prioritize? Thanks.\nMark Lashier: Yes. Thanks Jason. The cash that we might receive from those asset dispositions will be allocated consistent with our premise capital allocation process. It always includes a growth element. And if there are things that we can accelerate in our growth agenda, we can look at that. But certainly, also would be a factor is opportunities around our balance sheet and then opportunities to hit the high end of our cash return to shareholders target. So, it\u2019s all in play, just like any dollar of cash that we would turn over to treasury.\nJason Gabelman: Got it. Thanks for the color.\nMark Lashier: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you, Jason. Matthew Blair from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Blair: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First one is on the chem side. Could you talk about some of the dynamics in PE? Inventories have cleaned up a little bit here, but what\u2019s your margin outlook for both the U.S. and international heading into Q4? Could you give a comment on [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: Hi Matthew, unfortunately, your line is breaking up, so we will have to move to the next question. If you would like to rejoin the queue and potentially try dialing back in.\nMark Lashier: Yes. We heard the first part, so Tim is going to take a shot at the first part around PE margins and inventories.\nTim Roberts: Yes, let me do that. Sorry, Matt, with the breakout there. I got the front end of it. And so I could take a wild guess on the back end, but that probably wouldn\u2019t go well. So, from a chem standpoint, look, it feels like a little bit of a broken record. We still have a supply-demand imbalance. Clearly, China, Asia is not where we would like it to be. Over time, we expect that to come back around. But you are going to have to see a correction in the new capacity that\u2019s coming onboard, coupled with demand picking up. So, we do think that\u2019s going to be hard to see at least through 2024. But to your point, I mean when you have things like we have seen a little bit of improvement on polyethylene, you see a couple of price increases, which have been good. I don\u2019t know if they are sustainable, but nonetheless, they have come through, which has helped. And we have seen inventories coming off slowly, but coming off. So, from that standpoint, there is a little bit of, I am going to say, constructive, but we know that balance has got to get fixed. Now, the one thing that I think is really important we stress here is, though, that CPChem\u2019s kit and their assets, 96% of their assets are utilizing advantaged feedstocks. So, while there may be a lot of pain in the chemical space, those that are leveraging advantaged feedstocks are doing okay. We would love to be doing a lot better, but they are doing okay. Our assets at CPChem are running hard as well as probably their competition using light feed in the U.S. Gulf Coast and in the Middle East. But those that are using naphtha in higher-cost regions are probably challenged at this point. Our teams are running hard, running well, taking advantage and are well positioned to actually benefit from this low-margin environment because of the feedstock we are in. So with that, we still think, though there is some more lifting to do with regard to getting the supply-demand balance where it needs to be, but if we can continue to see some green shoots like the GDP that we saw earlier this week, maybe you put a couple of those together, and we can start moving that forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Joe Laetsch from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJoe Laetsch: Hi team. Thanks for taking my questions. So, I wanted to just start on the demand side. So, recognizing the DOE demand data has been really volatile, could you just share what you are seeing in your system across gasoline, diesel and jet? And then if possible, just your outlook for the remainder of the year, realizing that it\u2019s really volatile right now. Thank you.\nBrian Mandell: Hey Joe, this is Brian. Let me take a stab at that. In the U.S., inventories remain low for distillate, 17% under 5-year averages. Gasoline has come back up now close to 5-year averages. So, maybe starting on the distillate side, cracks are now in the mid to high $20 range when adjusted in U.S. Gulf Coast, New York and Europe. To be reminded, European refiners need distillate cracks at higher levels because of the higher net gas price to incentivize production. We are seeing distillate demand globally at about 2% higher than last year. In the U.S., we will start \u2013 we see demand a little bit off, although we have been watching the manufacturing sector, and we think it\u2019s probably bottomed. Truck tonnage index has begun to rebound as an example. So, for \u2013 on our outlook for diesel, we would say it\u2019s supported from here with the low inventories and potential shortages in Europe. And as a reminder, this is Europe\u2019s first year without Russian distillate supply, so we will have to watch that as well. And on the gas cracks, gas has been coming along for a ride as refiners have produced \u2013 continue to produce diesel with the strong diesel margins. We have also had butane blending startup, which has increased the volume of gasoline. And the summer has kind of been devoid of any hurricane issues. What we have seen is, especially on the Gulf Coast, we started to see plants cutting FCC units. So, we think that will be a help to clearing up the gasoline. On the demand side, we are seeing global gasoline 2% year-over-year and particularly strong, Asia and Middle East, Europe, about flat. U.S. demand seems to be about flat, too. Latin America has been really strong, about 5% over last year. So, on our outlook for gasoline, we would say demand relatively flat through the end of the year as the markets work to clean up some of the gasoline supply.\nJoe Laetsch: Got it. Thanks. Appreciate your response on that. And I just wanted to ask, on the dividend, so we have \u2013 it was good to see the increase in the target. We have touched on the buyback a bit. But could you just remind us how you are thinking on dividend growth from here?\nMark Lashier: Yes. Our position there is consistent, secure growing dividends. We have grown the dividend every year since spin, and that\u2019s not going to change.\nJoe Laetsch: Great. Thanks. Appreciate it today.\nMark Lashier: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you, Joe. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Mark Lashier for closing comments.\nMark Lashier: Thank you and thanks to all of you for your questions. Our integrated and diversified portfolio continues to perform extremely well and it creates unique competitive advantage. Our strong performance and confidence in execution drives us to increase several of the original commitments in our pursuit to achieve superior returns for our shareholders. We will return $13 billion to $15 billion to shareholders by year-end 2024. We will reduce refining operating costs by $1 per barrel. We will capture over $400 million in Midstream synergies, and we will deliver $1.4 billion of cash savings by year-end 2024. We will monetize over $3 billion of non-core assets and we will enhance our commercial capabilities generating additional earnings. Our plans are ambitious. We are raising the bar and continuing to reward shareholders now and well into the future.\nJeff Dietert: Thanks Mark. If you have any additional questions, please call Owen or me. We appreciate your participation on the call today. Thank you.",

            "name": "Brian Mandell",
            "content": "Hi, Manav, it's Brian. So when you think about the RD margins, you have to think about not just the credits but the price of the feedstock, the price of the RD when it comes to market. So even though we've had lower LCFS and RINs, we've had these distillate prices that have outrun soybean prices. In fact, soybean prices are off. We have more low CI feedstocks that are making their way into the U.S. Kinder Morgan pipeline is allowing RD on their pipelines now, so that means more reach of RD into the California market for consumption. We've had \u2013 domestic demand is expected to continue to grow. We've converted all our stations. We're seeing RD demand in Oregon and Washington continue to mature as those programs mature. We've been seeing RD moving to states like Texas and Illinois and Colorado, where they have tax abatement and tax reduction programs. And I think traders believe that the U.S. harvest is looking good. And if you remember last year, in Argentina, they had a drought. And this year, we expect a more normal crop level condition. And then finally, what a lot of traders and folks have on their minds is SAF or renewable jet. And as those incentives make more sense to produce renewable jet, you'll see some of this RD that's being produced move away and become SAF. So we're expecting about 200,000 barrels a day of RD at the end of this year, but we will see some of that RD in the future become renewable jet. Hey, Manav, it's Brian again. So I'll say we had a really strong quarter in the third quarter. In fact, it was our fourth best quarter on record. Q2 and Q3 are usually stronger seasonally than Q1 and Q4. And as you remember, starting 2019, we've added a lot of retail to our retail joint ventures in the U.S. We're up to 700 retail stores now, and they performed really well this quarter. We're also focused on what we've called the last-mile strategy internally, which is getting Rodeo complex RD to the market, directly to the market, and getting that value chain value at Phillips 66. We've seen product volumes in our businesses relatively flat, but we continue to optimize those volumes through higher-value distribution channels. So as a reminder, we have a wholesale business, we have a branded or franchise business, and then we have a retail business. And the branded or franchise business and the retail business, those margins are significantly higher than the wholesale margins. And then finally, on the lubricants base oil business, it continues to perform really well. So I'd say, for Q4, we think that earnings will be in-line with our normal Q4 mid-cycle expectations. Paul, this is Brian. I would say we did raise the mid-cycle a couple of years ago, and we will continue to watch it. And if we need to raise it again, we will. But obviously, the business is performing better and we are proud of the business performing better. We are going to continue to look for opportunities to add to the last-mile strategy and some of our other initiatives. So, as we see that value hitting the bottom line, we will indeed, at some point raise the mid-cycle. I would say keep watching the bottom line, and you will see the dollars there. And when we feel comfortable, we will move mid-cycle up. Hey John, it's Brian. So, like you said, the WCS dips are very wide, minus $25 now. That's a benefit to us. We are the largest importer of Canadian crude, nearly 500,000 barrels a day. The reason the dips are wide is because you have more production than you have pipeline egress. And you also have the diluent blended into \u2013 starting in September, into the crude, which adds or swells volume. We would expect to see the dips remain seasonally wide with more barrels than egress as traders also sell barrels to meet the year-end inventories. TMX has announced the start-up in April. We will take them at their word. Currently, we don't think the pipeline will run at full capacity. But if you take a look at the forward curves currently, Q2, Q3 average is about minus $15, and that's about where we think it might end up. Hey Joe, this is Brian. Let me take a stab at that. In the U.S., inventories remain low for distillate, 17% under 5-year averages. Gasoline has come back up now close to 5-year averages. So, maybe starting on the distillate side, cracks are now in the mid to high $20 range when adjusted in U.S. Gulf Coast, New York and Europe.

            "content": "Yes, Roger, this is Rich. As we've indicated over the years, our kit has shifted towards distillate production. There is nothing that's changed on that, other than some of our flexibility to move back and forth between gasoline and distillate. So we still maintain a kit that is favorable to distillate margins in the market. Manav, I'll start that answer and then maybe give \u2013 hand it over to Brian here to add a little color on the backside. So at Rodeo, maybe I'll just step back a little bit and level set on everything that's going on at Rodeo here. So Rodeo, there was two NGOs that filed a suit against at Contra Costa County, alleging that the Rodeo Renewed project environmental impact report insufficiently address project impacts. The ruling for the suit was received earlier this year. And actually, there were several issues in our favor, but there were three issues identified as insufficient in the county-certified EIR. The judge explicitly allowed construction to continue with the project while Contra Costa County works through and addresses the three deficiencies that were identified in the EIR. The county actually posted that revised EIR update on October 24. That initiated a 45-day public comment period. The county will respond to the comments and then likely issue a final EIR early 2024. So right now, our project construction remains on track to complete in the first quarter, and we're committed to that time line. However, I want to add, we have options. We've talked a little bit about this, but let me be a little bit more explicit on this one. There is flexibility to continue crude operation in the event that circumstances beyond our control prevent the start-up of the project. I want to say we are committed to the start-up of the project. But if, for some reason, we don't have that authority, we will continue to operate in crude operation. This is a staggered conversion process. In the past, we've called this a ramp-up plan, so that creates natural flexibility for us. It allows us to continue to process crude, or it allows us to start up the Rodeo Renewed project, which, I want to remind people, that's equivalent to removing emissions of 1 million cars from the roads. So we remain pretty confident. We remain confident, I should say, that we will start up the operation of Rodeo Renewed at the end of the first quarter. And we're focused on executing that conversion plan. But we have this planned flexibility, and we will continue to process the crude oil, if necessary. Now the outlook on the market and what your \u2013 the other part of your question is really this outlook of LCFS and \u2013 in this relationship. I'm going to hand that over to Brian, who can explain that relationship a little bit more. It's more complicated than just the LCFS credit program. Yes, Paul, appreciate the question. We generally give that guidance out fourth quarter, and so stand by for that outlook on the fourth quarter. Jason, this is Rich. Are you asking about the co-product bucket? Secondary products, yes. Yes, so the primary \u2013 in refining, that primary mover there is petroleum coke, right. That's the product that generally drives that secondary product margin for us. And it generally lags behind crude pricing, right, and it's tied to the coal markets that can pressure it up or pressure it down based on supply and demand requirements there. The other subtle component that plays into secondary products for us is NGL pricing. And that's bigger in some markets than others for us, but it certainly does play into it, and that's been depressed for some period now. And that's \u2013 our outlook continues to not be real strong on NGL pricing on the forward curves. The balance of the secondary products, which are fuel oil intermediates and some other products that probably aren't worth mentioning, those have been relatively flat, really, over the period. So, we don't see \u2013 so, we see those coke and NGLs as the primary movers right now for us in that area."

            "content": "Thanks, Jeff. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong financial and operating results and we continue to execute on our strategic priorities to increase shareholder value. Our achievements to-date have enabled us to make significant progress toward the commitments we made to shareholders a year ago at Investor Day. We are confident in our ability to exceed these commitments and we will provide an update today. Slide 4 shows the evolution of our portfolio. We are much more than a refining company. We are differentiated by an integrated and diversified Midstream, Chemicals, Refining, Marketing and Specialties portfolio that generates free cash flow through the economic cycles. Our global commercial supply and trading organization leverages our assets to generate incremental value. We continue to execute our strategy to increase more stable cash flows in Midstream. We see more growth opportunities as U.S. natural gas and natural gas liquids production is expected to outpace crude oil. The demand fundamentals are strong as NGLs and petrochemical feedstocks remain the fastest growing segment of liquids demand. The DCP acquisition earlier this year strengthened our competitive position by integrating our NGL wellhead-to-market value chain and adds over $1 billion to mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA. Our current synergy run-rate is on pace to deliver more than $400 million. Midstream's stable cash generation covers the company's dividend and our sustaining capital. We will continue to capitalize on our integrated and diversified portfolio to deliver results. Moving to Slide 5. At our Investor Day in November 2022, we targeted $3 billion in mid-cycle EBITDA growth by 2025. This included NGL wellhead-to-market, Rodeo Renewed, business transformation and CPChem growth projects. Given the substantial progress employees across the company have made, we are raising the bar. We now expect to grow mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA by $4 billion between 2022 and 2025, reflecting a $1 billion increase from our original target. This includes additional value from business transformation, midstream synergies and commercial contributions. We are increasing the business transformation target to $1.4 billion from $1 billion. We are enhancing our commercial capabilities to extract additional value, maximizing return on capital employed and increasing refining market capture. We are committing to higher shareholder distributions. Our new target is $13 billion to $15 billion between July 2022 and year end 2024. This is an increase from our original target of $10 billion to $12 billion. We will return over 50% of our operating cash flow to shareholders. Lastly, we plan to monetize assets that no longer meet strategic long-term objectives. Proceeds from monetizing these non-core assets are expected to be more than $3 billion. We will deploy the proceeds to advance strategic priorities, including accelerating cash return to shareholders. Slide 6 shows progress on distributions to shareholders and improving Refining performance. We returned $6.7 billion through share repurchases and dividends since July 2022, representing over 50% of operating cash flow during the same time period. Strong cash generation and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to exceed the pace to achieve the original $10 billion to $12 billion target before year end 2024. The increased target of $13 billion to $15 billion equates to 25% to 30% of current market cap. Our Board of Directors approved a $5 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization. This is in addition to the previous authorization, which had approximately $3.1 billion remaining as of September 30. Since 2012, the Board has authorized $25 billion in share repurchases. These higher distributions to shareholders will be supported by $4 billion of mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA growth between 2022 and 2025. We are laser-focused on improving Refining performance. Third quarter crude utilization of 95% was the highest utilization since 2019. Our refining system ran above industry average utilization rates for the third straight quarter. We continue to advance high return, low capital projects to improve reliability and market capture. We are executing 10 to 15 projects a year to improve market capture by 5%. Last year, we completed several projects that added 2% to market capture and we expect the 2023 projects to add a further 1.3%. We reduced costs by $0.40 per barrel and will achieve a $0.75 per barrel run-rate by the end of 2023. Our people have fully embraced business transformation and we are raising our target to a $1 per barrel run-rate by the end of 2024. Slide 7 provides an overview of the business transformation program. We are increasing our business transformation target to $1.4 billion, comprised of $1.1 billion of cost reductions and $300 million of sustaining capital efficiencies. The incremental reductions are $300 million in costs, over half of which benefits Refining and $100 million of sustaining capital. We are on track to achieve the targets this year and next. Slide 8 summarizes our strategic priorities and enhancements. Last November, we announced six priorities to increase shareholder value. These were ambitious and consistent with investor feedback. Our achievements to-date provide us with the confidence that we will not only meet these targets, but we'll exceed them. So with the support of our Board, we are increasing our commitments to shareholders. Delivering on the commitments will generate additional free cash flow from our integrated and diversified portfolio, positioning us to increase cash returns to shareholders now and in the future. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review the third quarter financial results. Hi, Neil. Good morning. This is Mark. When you think about the additional billion-dollar increments in EBITDA, that really comes from the enhanced business transformation work that we're going to do as well as the additional synergies we intend to capture from the DCP roll-up, supplemented by the enhanced capability and value creation that we're going to see out of the commercial organization. Regarding asset dispositions, this fundamentally is about creating focus and redeploying capital. We're not going to comment on specific assets today, but we generally have some high-performing assets that may be more valuable to others and maybe more strategic to others and we are going to explore that. And if we can capture value greater than our whole value, we'll do so. But the bottom line is this, that we're committed to managing the portfolio to drive focus that's consistent with our strategy and simplifying our business. Yes. Manav, I would just add over the top that Brian and his team have been just quietly and consistently executing their last-mile strategy and this opportunity to invest a fairly small amount of capital to get very high returns and to enhance our exposure to retail margins in a very accretive way. And it's \u2013 you're seeing the value show up, and you're seeing a consistent performance there that we really appreciate. The answer to the first question is yes. The answer to the second question is, it really is a function of the market appetite. We understand the value that these assets provide us, and they provide good value. So we've got to find willing buyers that have a greater affinity for those assets than we do. And so we're not in any rush. We're not performing any fire sale, but we believe there is opportunities out there in the market today to execute that plan. Yes. Ryan, this is Mark. Glad to answer that question. To answer your last question, the answer is yes. If we're outperforming our \u2013 our desire is to hit the high end of that target, and we've provided the flexibility in the event that there is less cash available because of market conditions, we can pull back a little bit. Another thing I would point out is our $3 billion in asset dispositions, we have not factored that cash into the $13 billion to $15 billion. So there is another level of assurance there that we can hit that. And we really are focusing on the things that we can control. As you look at the business transformation, we see those numbers, we see the reality of those numbers, and we can capture that and use that value to drive those returns. And we also see line of sight to the additional increments of EBITDA, the $4 billion that's coming into play. And of course, that could be impacted by market as well. But when you factor all those things in, the risk of underperforming is fairly muted. So we've got a high level of confidence that we can deliver. Yes. And I would like to throw another example out there, Ryan, that last week, a group of us visited the Sweeny Complex, and we got to stop by the control room that operates all of our fractionators. And I asked a couple of frontline operators how they felt integration was going, and they were ecstatic because they see the ability to improve their ability to perform. They see it in real time. They said we can run at harder rates because we get better information, there is greater collaboration. They can run without concern or surprises coming at them. And so the whole mindset around business transformation, synergy capture, being more competitive has evolved all the way to the front line. These folks want to win, and they want to figure out every day how to do better and how to drive more synergies and capture that and deliver value. So, it's real, and it's out on the front line. Good morning Paul. Yes. Paul, what I think you are asking is you are applauding the good performance you have seen in the marketing group, and it continues to increase, as Brian and his team execute their strategy. And you are asking, is there a reset in the mid-cycle performance of the marketing business, is that the question? Yes, Brian never lacks confidence. Secondary products. Yes. Thanks Jason. The cash that we might receive from those asset dispositions will be allocated consistent with our premise capital allocation process. It always includes a growth element. And if there are things that we can accelerate in our growth agenda, we can look at that. But certainly, also would be a factor is opportunities around our balance sheet and then opportunities to hit the high end of our cash return to shareholders target. So, it's all in play, just like any dollar of cash that we would turn over to treasury. You bet. Yes. We heard the first part, so Tim is going to take a shot at the first part around PE margins and inventories. Yes. Our position there is consistent, secure growing dividends. We have grown the dividend every year since spin, and that's not going to change. You bet. Thank you and thanks to all of you for your questions. Our integrated and diversified portfolio continues to perform extremely well and it creates unique competitive advantage. Our strong performance and confidence in execution drives us to increase several of the original commitments in our pursuit to achieve superior returns for our shareholders. We will return $13 billion to $15 billion to shareholders by year-end 2024. We will reduce refining operating costs by $1 per barrel. We will capture over $400 million in Midstream synergies, and we will deliver $1.4 billion of cash savings by year-end 2024. We will monetize over $3 billion of non-core assets and we will enhance our commercial capabilities generating additional earnings. Our plans are ambitious. We are raising the bar and continuing to reward shareholders now and well into the future."

            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Adjusted earnings were $2.1 billion or $4.63 per share. A $9 million decrease in the fair value of our investment in NOVONIX reduced earnings per share by $0.02. We generated operating cash flow of $2.7 billion, including a working capital benefit of $285 million and cash distributions from equity affiliates of $361 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $855 million. We returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through $752 million of share repurchases and $465 million of dividends. We ended the quarter with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 33%. Annualized adjusted return on capital employed was 17%. I'll cover the segment results on Slide 10. Additional details can be referenced in the appendix to this presentation. This slide highlights the change in adjusted results by segment from the second quarter to the third quarter. During the period, adjusted earnings increased $304 million, mostly due to improved results in Refining, partially offset by lower results in Chemicals and Midstream as well as higher corporate costs. In Midstream, third quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $569 million, down $57 million from the prior quarter. The decrease related to our NGL business and was mainly due to the timing of cargo freight costs as well as higher utility, integration and employee costs. These impacts were partially offset by higher margins from increasing commodity prices. Chemicals adjusted pre-tax income decreased $88 million to $104 million in the third quarter. This decrease was mainly due to lower margins. Global O&P utilization was 99%. Refining third quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $1.7 billion, up $592 million from the second quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher realized margins and strong utilization. Realized margins increased due to higher market crack spreads, partially offset by inventory hedge impacts, lower secondary product margins and lower Gulf Coast clean product realizations. Inventory hedges and losses from secondary products mainly reflect the impact of rising crude prices during the quarter. These market factors negatively impacted capture rate, which was 66% in the quarter. Marketing and Specialties adjusted third quarter pre-tax income was $633 million, a slight decrease of $11 million from the previous quarter, reflecting continued strong margins. The Corporate and Other segment's adjusted pre-tax costs were $59 million higher than the previous quarter. The increase was mainly due to higher net interest expense related to acquiring DCP Midstream's public common units on June 15 as well as employee-related expenses. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 24%. The impact of non-controlling interest was improved compared to the prior quarter and reflects a lower non-controlling interest since our acquisition of DCP Midstream public common units. Slide 11 shows the change in cash during the third quarter. We started the quarter with a $3 billion cash balance. Cash from operations was $2.4 billion, excluding working capital. During the quarter, we funded $358 million of pension plan contributions, which comes out of cash from operations. That was a working capital benefit of $285 million. Year-to-date working capital is a use of around $2 billion, primarily related to inventory that we expect to mostly reverse by year-end. We received $280 million from asset dispositions, mainly reflecting the sale of our interest in South Texas Gateway Terminal. Total proceeds from asset dispositions of $370 million through the third quarter of 2023. We funded $855 million of capital spending. This includes $260 million for the acquisition of a U.S. West Coast marketing business. We repaid approximately $500 million of debt, mostly reflecting lower borrowings on DCP Midstream's credit facilities. Additionally, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our ending cash balance was $3.5 billion. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In Chemicals, we expect the fourth quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the fourth quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low-90s and turnaround expenses to be between $90 million and $110 million. We anticipate fourth quarter Corporate and Other costs to come in between $280 million and $300 million. Now we will open the line for questions, after which Mark will make closing comments. Yes, Neil. It's Kevin. Let me just make a couple of comments on that. So we did have a few things moving around in the quarter that impacted capture to the negative. And so we saw regional price differentials that differed from the benchmark that we use in terms of the market crack. And so those worked against us that during the quarter, for example, the Chicago market, which became disconnected from the group, and we move product into that market. We also had an impact from the effect of inventory hedges in a rising price environment. So that crack component, this all showed up in the central corridor. We expect about $100 million to $150 million of that to come back in the fourth quarter as we see the physical gain on those barrels that offsets the paper loss that we took in the third quarter. Yes. Roger, it's Kevin. So just for clarity on that point, the growth that we laid out there, the incremental $1 billion is excluding the impact of dispositions. And so clearly, dispositions will reduce EBITDA. We're not giving any guidance on that at this point in time. I mean, you can come up with an assumption on where you may think we will be selling assets and make a multiple assumption from that. But we're not giving any specific guidance on the dispositions, other than we expect to realize in excess of $3 billion. That's right. We will do what makes the most sense for us. Yes, Doug, let me try and unpack some of that. So our mid-cycle Refining EBITDA, as we laid out at Investor Day, was $4 billion. That reflects a historic average assumption around where the market will trade. And that's \u2013 we haven't changed that assumption. What we are doing is increasing our ability to capture value across that system through lower costs and increased contribution from our commercial organization and the EBITDA uplift they provide \u2013 that, that organization provides to the system will predominantly show up in Refining. It won't all be Refining, but it'll predominantly show up in Refining. We haven't tried to make a call on if we actually think the go-forward mid-cycle margin environment is stronger now than it has been historically. Clearly, we've been in above mid-cycle conditions for most of this year and last year. And that's all \u2013 we view that as upside, so we're still pretty optimistic for the near-term. We're probably above mid-cycle in the near-term, but our fundamental view of mid-cycle hasn't changed. But our belief in terms of what that business can do in a mid-cycle environment is going up with the enhancements we're putting in place. Well, not really because, if you think back to where we were running for the years prior to the pandemic and then we took a hit during the pandemic, we're really assuming we get back to that kind of level of operations that we were at before. And so some of the things \u2013 some of the Refining performance priorities that Rich has talked about in the past that were outlined in Investor Day a year ago, we did not include those in as increases to mid-cycle. We view that as we have to deliver on these to get back to that level of operations that we've historically been at. Yes. I mean, John, the market environment will impact profitability. It will impact cash generation. But the bulk of the working capital benefit we expect to see in the fourth quarter will be driven by inventory impacts, and that's pretty solid in terms of that impact. So, while there will always be other parts moving around in this equation, I feel pretty confident that the top end of that targeted range is \u2013 we will be around about there at the end of the year. I am not too concerned by that."

[Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded.  I will now turn the call over to Jeff Dietert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Jeff, you may begin.\nJeff Dietert: Good morning, and welcome to Phillips 66 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Participants on today's call will include Mark Lashier, President, and CEO; Kevin Mitchell, CFO; Tim Roberts, Midstream and Chemicals; Rich Harbison, Refining; and Brian Mandell, Marketing and Commercial. Today's presentation material can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website, along with supplemental financial and operating information. Slide 2 contains our safe harbor statement. We will be making forward-looking statements during today's call. Actual results may differ materially from today's comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here as well as in our SEC filings.  With that, I'll turn it over to Mark.\nMark Lashier: Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. In the second quarter, we had adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion or $3.87 per share. We continued to execute on our strategic priorities and returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our results reflect strong operating performance across our portfolio, demonstrating the commitment of our employees to maintain safe and reliable operations. We want to thank them for their dedication to operating excellence and delivering on our mission to provide energy and improve lives. In Refining, we continue to run above industry average rates, and in Midstream, we had record NGL frac volumes. We continue to run our Sweeny Hub fracs, and export terminal at above nameplate capacities to meet strong demand. We remain committed to operating excellence and continue to focus on our strategic priorities to create value and return cash to shareholders. Slide 4 summarizes progress toward our strategic priorities. Over the last 12 months, we've returned 14% of our market cap or $5.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We're on track to return $10 billion to $12 billion over the 10-quarter period between July 2022 through year-end 2024. In Refining, we had another quarter of strong operating performance with crude utilization of 93% and lower operating costs. As of the end of the quarter, more than $300 million of the $550 million run rate cost savings are attributable to Refining. Kevin will provide an update on our business transformation progress in a moment. We're executing our NGL wellhead to market strategy and capturing DCP integration synergies faster than expected. Our current synergy run rate is over $200 million. We've been successful in identifying additional opportunities to increase our target from $300 million to more than $400 million by 2025. In June, we completed the acquisition of DCP Midstream's public common units for $3.8 billion, increasing our economic interest from 43% to 87%. We ended the quarter with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 35%. We expect leverage to be within our target range by year-end. In Refining, we're converting our San Francisco refinery into one of the world's largest renewable fuels facilities. The capital to convert the facility to over 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuels production is anticipated to be approximately $1.25 billion. This is an increase from our original premise due to higher-than-anticipated material and labor costs as well as impacts related to weather and permitting. The revised capital cost of around $1.60 per gallon remains well below similar announced projects, and the expected returns are significantly above our Refining hurdle rates. The overall project timing and scope remains unchanged. We expect to begin commercial operations in the first quarter of 2024. In Chemicals, CPChem completed construction of the 1-hexene unit in Old Ocean, Texas, and expects to begin operations by the end of the third quarter. The new propylene splitter at its Cedar Bayou facility is expected to start up in the fourth quarter. CPChem and Qatar Energy are jointly building world-scale petrochemical facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Ras Laffan, Qatar. On the U.S. Gulf Coast, the Golden Triangle Polymers joint venture has project financing in place. The Ras Laffan petrochemical joint venture expects to complete project financing later this year. Both projects remain on schedule to start up in 2026. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review the business transformation savings and second quarter financial results.\nKevin Mitchell : Thank you, Mark. Starting on Slide 5 with an update on our business transformation progress. Our $1 billion business transformation target includes $800 million of cost savings and $200 million of sustaining capital reductions. We have identified over 2,700 initiatives to permanently reduce costs, with employees across the organization actively engaged in the transformation process. We have completed 1,200 initiatives that are generating value today. The chart on the left shows our progress toward the $800 million cost reduction target, with $550 million of run-rate cost savings at the end of the second quarter. The stacked bar shows our actual cumulative cost reductions for the year by category. Over the first half of 2023, we realized $260 million in cost savings. The majority of these cost reductions relate to Refining, which has benefited by about $0.40 per barrel. Business transformation initiatives range from optimizing services across our portfolio of assets to establishing new tools to improve use of steam and energy.  Organizationally, we strengthened our centralized model for core functions to drive consistency and efficiencies. We continue implementing cost savings initiatives and are on track to achieve our run rate target by year-end 2023. We expect to realize the full $800 million of cost savings in 2024, which will include Refining cost reductions of $0.75 per barrel. Now I'll move to Slide 6 to cover the second quarter financial results. Adjusted earnings were $1.8 billion or $3.87 per share. The $15 million decrease in the fair value of our investment in NOVONIX reduced earnings per share by $0.03. We generated operating cash flow of $1 billion, including a working capital use of $1 billion and cash distributions from equity affiliates of $239 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $551 million, including $339 million for growth projects. We returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through $1.3 billion of share repurchases and $474 million of dividends. We ended the quarter with 445 million shares outstanding. I'll cover the segment results on Slide 7. Additional details can be referenced in the appendix to this presentation. This slide highlights the change in adjusted results by segment from the first quarter to the second quarter. During the period, adjusted earnings decreased $199 million, mostly due to lower results in Refining and Midstream, partially offset by an improvement in Marketing and Specialties. In Midstream, second quarter adjusted pretax income was $626 million, down $52 million from the prior quarter. The decrease was driven by the impact of declining commodity prices in our NGL business. This was partially offset by higher volumes in transportation. Chemicals adjusted pretax income decreased $6 million to $192 million in the second quarter. The industry polyethylene chain margin increased by $0.03 to $0.20 per pound. However, this was offset by higher maintenance and turnaround costs in the quarter. Global O&P utilization was 98%.  Refining second quarter adjusted pretax income was $1.1 billion, down $460 million from the first quarter. The decrease was due to a decline in margins, partially offset by higher volumes and lower operating expenses. Realized margins decreased primarily due to the decline in distillate crack spreads and narrowing heavy crude differentials, partially offset by improved gasoline cracks. In addition, realized margins reflect the impact of losses from secondary products due to declining NGL and coke purchase. Marketing and Specialties adjusted second quarter pretax income was $644 million, an increase of $218 million from the previous quarter, mainly due to seasonally higher global marketing margins on continued strong demand. The Corporate and Other segments adjusted pretax costs were $12 million lower than the prior quarter. The adjusted effective tax rate was 22%, consistent with the previous quarter. The impact of noncontrolling interests was improved compared to the prior quarter and also reflects our acquisition of DCP units on June 15. Slide 13 shows the change in cash during the second quarter. We started the quarter with a $7 billion cash balance. Cash from operations was $2 billion, excluding working capital. There was a working capital use of $1 billion, mainly reflecting an increase in inventory, which included the impact of unplanned downtime at the Bayway Refinery and seasonal storage opportunities. Year-to-date working capital is a use of around $2 billion, primarily related to inventory that we expect to mostly reverse by year-end. We funded $551 million of capital spending. In June, we drew $1.25 billion on a single-draw term loan to partially fund the acquisition of the DCP units for $3.8 billion. This transaction and the redemption of DCP's Series B preferred units of $161 million are represented as repurchase of noncontrolling interests. Additionally, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our ending cash balance was $3 billion. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In Chemicals, we expect the third quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the third quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the mid-90s and turnaround expenses to be between $110 million and $130 million. We anticipate third quarter Corporate and Other costs to come in between $280 million and $300 million, reflecting higher net interest expense from funding the purchase of DCP units during the second quarter. In 2023, we expect our full year capital spend to be above the $2 billion budget, reflecting approximately $200 million of additional spending on Rodeo Renewed. In addition, we just closed on a $260 million acquisition of West Coast marketing assets. This acquisition supports the high-return Rodeo Renewed project by optimizing the full value of our renewable fuel sales to end customers.  We continue to review our portfolio to determine if assets meet our strategic long-term objectives or if they provide more value to third parties. Earlier this year, we divested the Belle Chasse Terminal, and very recently, we sold our interest in the South Texas Gateway Terminal. Total proceeds from the two transactions are approximately $350 million.  Now we will open the line for questions, after which Mark will make closing comments.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question for today comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Doug your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDoug Leggate : I'm not sure who wants to answer this, maybe Kevin, but we've obviously talked ad nauseam about what we think could be a new mid-cycle Refining outlook. But what we haven't taken into account is the continued upgrade to your synergy targets, the faster delivery of your cost reductions, and more importantly, the continued appearance of deferred taxes in your operating cash flow. So, Kevin, I guess my somewhat convoluted question is, what do you think your sustainable mid-cycle free cash flow looks like for the company post these recent series of changes that you've introduced?\nKevin Mitchell: Yes, Doug. So, we had guided to $7 billion increasing to $10 billion at Investor Day of cash flow. And the reality is some of the actions that bridge us from $7 billion to $10 billion we have executed on. And so, at this point in time, on a traditional -- our view of Refining mid-cycle, we're probably somewhere in the $8 billion range, maybe a little bit higher than that. But we're not all the way to $10 billion because there are still other things we need to execute on. But we're certainly making good progress from the $7 billion to $10 billion. Your comment on deferred taxes is a relevant one. This year, we actually expect to have a slightly larger-than-normal deferred tax benefit on cash flow. So, I think I had previously guided to about $400 million to $500 million of benefit for the year. We expect that to be more like $700 million to $800 million, and that's mainly because of the impact of DCP buy-in on that. And after that, we should revert to a more traditional sort of $400 million to $500 million level.\nDoug Leggate : Just to be clear, you have not changed your view of mid-cycle margins, is that right?\nKevin Mitchell: That is correct. We have not changed our view of mid-cycle, but we would acknowledge that we are in a stronger than mid-cycle margin environment currently. We have been for the last 1 year-plus, 1.5 years. And barring any major economic downturn, we actually think that will continue for a reasonable period of time, just given the overall supply, demand balances that exist globally.\nDoug Leggate : Okay. Thank you. My follow-up, just a quick one. The step-up in the back piece. Is that a transitory perhaps as a consequence of the DCP process? I'm not quite sure what other things might have delayed you. But I guess my point is that if I look to the $5 billion to $7 billion buyback guidance you gave through 2024, two things come to mind, which is well, it seems to us you could maintain an elevated pace and certainly a pace well beyond 2024. So, I could just wonder if you could just touch on the cash return strategy, and I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nKevin Mitchell: Yes, I think that's right. I mean, as you know, we have been -- other than during the COVID period, we've been consistently buying back shares since really 2012 when we started the program. The elevated pace in the second quarter was not so much an impact of the DCP transaction. More it was a function of we recognize that relative to our share price at the time and our outlook, which was quite positive in terms of the overall business fundamentals, it seemed like a good opportunity to up the pace from where we had been. And based on where things sit today, it looks like a good decision on our part. The $5 billion to $7 billion that we guided at Investor Day, that's a sort of minimum threshold that we expect to meet. It doesn't mean to say we can't either hit that total return $10 billion to $12 billion before the end of 2024, and it certainly does not mean that we stop once we hit that threshold either. And so, I go back to our normal -- our traditional sort of guidance of at least 40% of cash flow returned to shareholders through the dividend and buybacks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nNeil Mehta: Thank you. I want to stay on the topic of capital structure. The net debt to capital, as you guys indicated, kind of ticked up to 35%, but you indicated that you expect it to move lower by year-end. Talk about some of the things that are moving back into your favor in addition to the strong margin environment, working capital or other items that we need to keep in mind. And how should we think about exit rate for that metric?\nKevin Mitchell: Yes, Neil. I think we had given guidance that we expected our debt to cap to increase once we completed the buy-in of the DCP units. And so, it wasn't a surprise to us where we landed on that number. The two big drivers that will bring that back between now and the end of the year are what you pointed to, working capital. So that's about $2 billion inflow in cash that we expect to see between now and the end of the year, and then also just the ongoing ability to generate earnings, generate strong earnings, and build to equity. So, on our math, we think we end the year at right around the 30% level, so the top end of the range, but nonetheless, still within that overall target range. Obviously, this thing will move around quarter-over-quarter depending on what's going on in terms of market environment and cash items like working capital. But fundamentally, we think we're on a reasonable trajectory to be able to sustain in that target range.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks. And then the follow-up is just on Rodeo Renewed. Some changes, it sounds like in the capital scope here. Just can you walk us through the drivers of those changes? And then as we think about against the capital, the type of EBITDA that you can generate from the asset, how has your view of mid-cycle from that asset evolved as you spend more time on the project? Thank you.\nMark Lashier : Yes, Neil, it's Mark. I'll cover it at a high level and then Rich can drill in a little bit. But essentially, what we've experienced there as we commenced the project execution, we had a lot of heavy rainfall. And of course, even the start of the project was deferred a little bit because of permitting challenges. And we believe -- we recognize that the earnings from this are going too far exceed the earnings we realized to date from the San Francisco refinery so we wanted to stick to the schedule. So, we incurred some more cost to compensate for the productivity loss during bad weather and delays around permitting. We also saw some inflation. When this project was sanctioned, the big run-up in inflationary pressures hadn't hit yet. And so, we realized that really is the only project in our purview where we're seeing that kind of impact or haven't accounted for the inflation at sanction, so we're having to take care of that. So, we still look at that $1.60 a gallon as incredibly competitive.  The overall competitiveness of the asset is strong. The location, we've got competitive advantage. The pull-through with our retail presence is a competitive advantage. And as you look at as we bring this facility online, we're taking off almost as much traditional diesel as we're bringing in renewable diesel to the market, so the market disruption will be minimal. So, we really are bullish around this project, and we see that the economics are still very robust in spite of the cost increases. Rich, do you want to go...\nRich Harbison: Yes, I think you covered most of that, Mark. Maybe I can add just a little bit of color to it. As we talked about, the primary drivers for the increase were material and labor costs. And when you think about the timing of this project, it was estimated and approved prior to the heavy inflationary period. So, we're realizing that inflationary pressure that's occurred over the duration of the development of the project. Half of those costs we'll experience this year. The other half will flow into next year's capital allocation. As Mark indicated, the project is still very capital efficient at $1.60 a gallon, and we're very happy with that and that is very competitive versus other announced projects. And we continue to work full steam ahead on the construction, and it remains on track for commercial operation in first quarter 2024. Now I know there's been a lot of focus around the lower LCFS credits over the recent change. But the reality of this, the economics around this project are centered around four programs as well as the retail price of diesel in the state of California and other markets that recognize renewable diesel. And those programs, too, are federal and two are at the state level. And all of these seem to be working interrelationally with each other as well as impacting the feedstock costs as well. So, when we look at the overall momentum and movement of all this interrelationship, we still see very strong economics for the project and continue to be very optimistic about the EBITDA returns on it.\nMark Lashier : And when you look at those increases across '23 and '24, it will require a modest increase in our capital target of $2 billion for this year, but we will manage that additional cost within our $2 billion target going forward in 2024.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nRoger Read : Thank you. Good morning. I was hoping to follow up on the DCP transaction, just how that's gone so far. And while I understand you've raised the, I guess we would call it, cost savings, another part of this transaction was on the revenue synergy side, building a truly integrated model. So, I was just curious what you've seen to date, what you maybe expect in the near term on that or maybe even the medium term on that in terms of how the transaction comes together as a seamless organization.\nTim Roberts: Roger, this is Tim. Thanks for the question. We started working on this as soon as we closed the initial part of the transaction last year, so we got the integration teams together. At the beginning of this back in the fall of last year, we felt we had a line of sight of $300 million that we could get full value for all the way through the first quarter of 2025. And that's when some contracts are rolling off that we're going to third parties and we could bring them into our system. But most of that we felt would be captured by 2024. Well, as we dug in, and we've got the teams involved, engaged, everybody's working together. Now the employees have done a really good job of digging deeper and finding a couple more gems in there. So now that's why we're comfortable talking about an increase going to $400 million. And I'm actually hoping at some point, I can give you more upside to that as we continue to dig because this integration is going to continue through the first quarter of 2024. The big driver right now, the teams are working together commercially, and probably worth setting a tone there is that early when we had the $300 million number, one-third was based on cost, two-third on commercial, we'll call it system optimization. But as we dug in and we've got to the $400 million number, now that is more 50-50 on cost. We found more in our procurement, more in our maintenance, more in our operations. And then -- so 50% on cost and now 50% on, again, system optimization and commercial activities. So that's kind of the breakdown. And the real driver right now for us through the first quarter of 2024 is systems integration. So, a lot of good work being done by the team, but it just takes time and you got to get it right. So, we are spending the time to do that, and we'll be done by the end of the first quarter. And then we'll be in what I consider a normal operation, steady-state mode with regard to how we run as a business.\nMark Lashier : Yes, I'd just like to comment a little bit on that, the integration impact. This really is a clear indication of how well the teams are integrating, the DCP team, the Phillips 66 teams coming together. And as Tim noted, once we had operational control of the entity after the Enbridge transaction, we were able to really hit the ground running and started executing against our targets. And getting these teams integrated, one team, one culture, taking the best of the best and driving this, this is really the biggest visible measure of how successful that's been. And we see those numbers move up and we see teams excited about the future and looking at ways to capture more value, both from a cost perspective and a commercial perspective. And so, this is going to be what they are and what they do from this point forward.\nRoger Read : Yes. Thanks, for that. And then the unrelated follow-up just to come back to the $0.40 a barrel of Refining margin, cash OpEx savings, the goal to get to $0.75. Can you give us an idea of -- I mean, I know you mentioned seeing cost reductions, things like that? But like what is this process allowing you to do? Is it a best practice in one location being expanded, an overall centralized look at the cost structure? Just it's a very impressive number. It's certainly sustainable up over time. And so, I was just curious kind of where did you start? How did you get here? How confident are you in the $0.75 on the time line that you've set?\nRich Harbison: Yes, Roger, this is Rich. We're well on our way, as you indicated, to our $0.75 per barrel savings target that we announced or committed to during the Investor Day last November. And you know what's most exciting about this whole process for me has really been how the organization, the entire organization is engaged in this process. So yes, there is some oversharing site to site of activity in best practices. But most of these activities are opportunities identified by that local organization, really accepting the challenge to improve the business. And they're uncovering these opportunities to be more efficient in their work process, right? And changing -- and then fundamentally changing how that work process is occurring to drive inefficiencies out of the business, which ultimately reduce costs out of the business. So, if you think about, we talked about $0.40 a barrel already year-to-date. If you -- that's calculated by, if you take our barrels that we've run year-to-date and calculate to the $0.40, you can back into the number that we're seeing drive to the bottom line of our financial report there. And that's been quite impressive. And we've got a lot more in the queue, as Mark indicated on his comments, with the run rate. Our target is $550 million. Over $300 million of that is currently assigned to Refining. And of course, the run rate doesn't mean it's realized, right? But that just means it's identified, it's locked in. And now we've got to drive it to the bottom line, and that's what's most impressive about the organization, really pushing to get these identified opportunities pushed to the bottom line.\nMark Lashier : Yes. And if you see some commonalities between the mindset and our Refining organization and the Midstream organization, it's real. And it's this business transformation process, it's easy to talk about the cost impact and it's easy to have those cost targets. But really the most phenomenal thing going on is the mindset change and the drive that we see in the employees to get better at what they do every day. And you're seeing that move on from cost focus to just where do we create the most value, how do we create the most value together. Whether it's the way we've organized and integrated our value chain optimization organization more synergistically across the refineries, having VCO folks sitting on the refinery leadership team every day, searching for ways to optimize and coordinate with other refineries. It's real. And that's -- it's that mindset, it's that drive that's going to make these cost savings and the synergy capture sustainable for the long term. And it's just not going to end. It's just going to be the way we do business going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Royall of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nJohn Royall: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, my first question is on the Bayway FCC. I think your last official statement was around mid-July for the restart. We saw reports after that, that it was the end of July. I'm not sure if that's been confirmed. So, if you can just update us on the status of the unit and when you expect it up and running full if it's not now.\nRich Harbison: John, this is Rich. FCC repairs were complete and the unit is up and running as of July 20. That's the actual date that it was back online producing on specification material. The refinery itself is back to normal operations, so all the units and all the assets there are running to our plan. The Bayway team did a phenomenal job getting that repair work done very efficiently. Very excited about how they performed to complete that work. And additionally, when Mark's just talking about this mindset activity, we saw other parts of our organization also really focused to help pick up our teammates that were struggling a little bit in Bayway. And we saw phenomenal performance in our refineries in Sweeney, Ponca City and Billings. They each had record performance as well as our assets on the West Coast, and it all ended up in a system-wide utilization of 93%, which is our highest crude utilization since 2019. So -- and we're looking forward to building on this momentum and continuing that into the third quarter.\nJohn Royall: Great. And then I know it's early on but maybe sticking with Refining. You could give us possibly some expectations on some puts and takes around captures for 3Q. And then relatedly, maybe you can weave in your view on WCS dips from here. We've widened out a fair amount off of bottoms but still look very tight. So, any views there into 2H [ph] would be helpful.\nBrian Mandell : It's Brian. Maybe I'll just talk about product demand, give you a sense of what we're thinking for Q3. The strength in U.S. products basically starts with low inventories. Gasoline, we're under five-year averages by 7%. Distillate, we're under averages, five-year averages by 19%. That's a lot. We have a lot of new capacity coming online in the U.S., but we've had even more outages than the new capacity. For us, we're seeing gasoline demand up about 2% over last year in the U.S. and about 4% globally. So that's strong demand. On distillate, we have the demand down a bit in the U.S., mostly on industrial manufacturing segments. But globally, we have it up. We have lots of pockets of really strong distillate demand in Latin America, up 9%, Asia up 4% and diesel cracks continue to remain strong. In fact, they've gotten a lot stronger and we believe that they'll continue to perform throughout the year as we head into higher demand planning season and into winter in the U.S. where distillate over gasoline every pad now. And then finally on the jet, the jet's also strong. Low inventories, increasing domestic and international travels. Global seat demand is essentially flat to 2019 levels. TSA throughput numbers in the U.S. are back [ph] to 2019 levels. And interestingly, U.S. jet yields remain a little bit higher so that should add some marginal strength to diesel. And then on the WCS, you're right. WCS has started to widen again, which is in our best interest here at -- we buy the most WCS of, I think, anybody there is. And we've seen the widening mostly because of heavy crude dips, in general, have started to widen. We also see fall turnarounds in pad 2 as being very strong. And then if you'll remember in September, which next month, we'll start to see Dillon blending, which will swell the volume of Canadian crude. So, all those things have been putting pressure on and widening the dips to our advantage.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Todd of Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nRyan Todd: Hi, thanks. We don't often talk that much about Marketing, but your Marketing business, as it continues to generally kind of exceed expectations on a regular basis, so I think first half contributions are fairly in line with last year's first half contributions, which was generally higher-than-expected year-end Marketing. Is that business maybe structurally -- just structurally stronger than we have appreciated and maybe you've guided to? Or what do you attribute kind of continued strength in the Marketing side?\nBrian Mandell : Ryan, this is Brian. Exceeding expectations is a good thing. We're happy about that. We did have a strong quarter in Q2. We've added a bunch of retail JVs since 2019. We're roughly at 750 retail stores, which have really performed well since we've added them and certainly in 2Q. We had higher margins, as Kevin mentioned, in both the domestic markets and in our Western European business. We had U.S. volumes up a bit. And finally, in our lubricants business, the base oil business has been performing really well as the feedstock prices have been falling more than the base oil prices. So, I'd tell you for Q3, when you're thinking about Q3, our earnings should be in line with our mid-cycle expectations, assuming the kind of normal seasonal demand.\nMark Lashier : Yes. I would just comment over again and compliment Brian and his Marketing team on the execution of the strategy that they've held for several years is to go in and participate through these joint venture opportunities in markets that make sense for us, that we have a competitive advantage that there's strength to capitalize on. And we don't go and do this everywhere. It's very surgical. It's very intentional, and it is exceeding expectations so it's a well-executed strategy.\nRyan Todd : Great. Thanks. And maybe just a quick follow-up on Rodeo and some of your comments from earlier. Are there -- as we think about kind of the pathway from here until start-up in first quarter '24, are there any outstanding permits required, legal challenges that we should be looking at? Or any -- how do you view the kind of potential risks that exist or things you're keeping an eye on between now and commercial start-up there?\nRich Harbison : Yes, Ryan. Permitting to complete any project in California is very challenging, projects even to convert a conventional crude oil facility refinery to a lower carbon intensity transportation fuel production facility. So, we did recently receive news on an appeal to our environmental impact report that is the supporting document for permits. This was filed by a couple of NGOs in the state. And the good news is the court ruling found several issues in the favor of Phillips 66. And notably, most notably is the construction of the Rodeo Renewed project can continue with the county work to resolve three issues. So, we're working closely with the county and the courts to provide the necessary information to reconsider the open issues. And we remain very confident that the Rodeo Renewed project is on track to start commercial operation in first quarter of 2024.\nRyan Todd : Okay, thank you.\nRich Harbison : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Gabelman of Cowen. Your line is open please go ahead.\nJason Gabelman: Hey, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on Ryan's question just now on Marketing and the outlook for 3Q. There were reports of droughts in the Rhine River. And I think typically when that happens, you're positioned to supply that region well and take advantage of margin moves there. Have you seen any strength in 3Q, or early 3Q as a result of those outages?  And would you expect, as a result, continued outperformance in Marketing in 3Q? And then conversely, what you're seeing on chems, we've seen chain margins fall into July. Just any views on the outlook there into 3Q and then beyond that when you expect Chemical margins to move back to mid-cycle?\nBrian Mandell : Hey Jason, it's Brian. So, far in Western Europe on the Rhine, we haven't seen water levels low enough to benefit us. It is true if water levels do get low, we benefit from that. But the water levels haven't gotten there yet. Can't really predict where they're going to go in Q3, but if they get lower, then we'll have some benefit.\nTim Roberts : Yes. And with regard -- this is Tim Roberts on this. With regard to Chemicals, talk about currently where we're at with chain margins. Yes, it's been an interesting run here. Obviously, you've got supply, plenty of supply available, and demand, they're not matching up. So, therefore, you've seen chain margins have been dropping over the last several quarters. Where you're at right now, I think IHS added about $0.12 in chain margins. And really the way we would look at this and look at it going forward is, is that the high-cost producers, both in Asia and those that are in Europe are going to set the price. And those that are in advantaged feedstock locations will keep running and probably run hard, which is what we're seeing right now in North America and the Middle East. While those are having to shut in capacity or having to manage production or any other reasons I mentioned earlier. Now fundamentally, though, you've got to get demand and supply to match up and you got to start working off inventory. Ethylene inventories here in North America are above the five-year average. So, that's got a direction that needs to start working its way down. And you're seeing the same thing in polyethylene, so, two of the main products that we see with regard to our CPChem JV. However, we're running really strong here. Exports are strong as well with regard to North America because we're advantaged on feedstock. So, our outlook is that yes, you got to hit the bottom before you can start working your way back up. I can't say this is the inflection point, but cash costs typically will drive where you get to the bottom and then how soon you can accelerate. And usually, as we would say and it goes in a lot of different directions is low cost, low prices solve prices. So, fundamentally, we do think that the outlook is still going to be constructive and constructive in that you still got population growth. You still have economies that have not been churning at their all cylinders, China being one of them. And that's not a position of saying they never will, not at all. We think there is still going to be good solid economic growth. You're just not seeing it consistent global. So, we do anticipate that, that will happen and that will help soak up some of the capacity that's out there, bring the markets back into balance and you get back into more of a mid-cycle case.\nJason Gabelman: Great. That's really helpful. And my follow-up is just on acquisitions and divestments. You mentioned it at the top of the call that you continue to evaluate the portfolio. As you look across the various segments you operate in, any thoughts on where maybe you have noncore positions or you have some portfolio gaps? And how are you viewing the broader M&A market? Thanks.\nMark Lashier: Yes. I think that again, as Kevin mentioned earlier, we looked across our portfolio, and there's different dimensions across our portfolio where others may have some interest in our assets and may place a greater value because it's not strategic to us and we'll continue to evaluate that. I wouldn't comment on any specific opportunities. And likewise, as we did with Marketing in California to -- we made some relatively small acquisitions to enhance the opportunities around Rodeo once it's up and running, and we've done a series of those and they're all doing quite well. And so, we'll look at smaller opportunistic things. But you think about where we've come from, we've done some pretty significant transactions in Midstream. It's time to digest those and to drive value through those. And if we can find some very accretive small, midsized kinds of things, we'd look at them, but there's nothing in the queue and nothing that we'd want to comment on. We've got a great backbone there and history has shown that the strong backbone in that industry can attract smaller investments that are quite attractive. So, think in terms of small, very accretive, high-return opportunities like we've done in Marketing would be on our scale. But we're going to stick with our disciplined approach going forward. We've got a commitment of around $2 billion for 2024, and anything around that would be very disciplined and high return.\nJason Gabelman: Great thanks for the call.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Gupta of UBS. Your line is open please go ahead.\nManav Gupta : I want to start on the East Coast. That was like a 52% margin capture. That's a significant drop from the last quarter. Was it primarily the outage at Bayway? Can you talk about some of the factors that led to such a significant drop on the East Coast and margin capture?\nRich Harbison : Yes. No, this is Rich. Over in that, what we refer to it as the Atlantic Basin, we did have higher volumes and lower costs due to less turnaround activity at Bayway quarter-over-quarter when you look at those. But a lot of those were offset by lower margins. The realized margin was lower primarily due to a weaker market crack. Configuration impacts also played into this with the gasoline cracks increasing by $10 a barrel and then the distillate crack decreasing by $18 a barrel. That played into the market capture quite a bit. And there was lower product differentials there. And then the other one that goes a little bit unnoticed in this market is really the secondary product cost and margins on those secondary products. And both the NGLs for both Bayway and Humber were lower. And then the petroleum coke that sold out of Humber also experienced lower product differentials. So, those are the primary reasons you saw lower market capture there in Atlantic Basin.\nManav Gupta : Okay. Can you also talk a little bit about the TMX expansion? There's a lot of capacity coming on and moving the crude to the West Coast starting next year. What would -- how would that change the WCS, WTI differential outlook in your opinion?\nBrian Mandell : Hey Manav, this is Brian. Well, first, I think our view is that TMX will probably come on later in the year, although line fill is forecasted for early Q1. I think the line will not be filled completely. That's our view. I think those are on the lines, I feel like some of those barrels will be exported to Asia. We'll see if that happens. It's hard to get VLCCs there. In fact, you can't load VLCCs. You have to load them ship to ship outside of L.A. So, it's -- we'll see what happens going forward. But certainly, it could be a benefit to the West Coast having more of that crude.\nManav Gupta : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Blair of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is open please go ahead.\nMatthew Blair : Hey, good morning thanks for taking my question. On the Midstream side, did Phillips unwind any of the DCP, NGL, and Nat gas hedges? And if so, could you quantify the impact that flowed through the Midstream EBITDA in Q2?\nKevin Mitchell : Yes, Matt, this is Kevin. We did. We did unwind them or have we let them roll off but we have less of that. We don't have that same hedging on our exposure to the Nat gas NGL commodity price that we have -- that DCP has historically had in our overall portfolio. And when you also factor in our position in Refining as a consumer of those project products, it felt more appropriate just to let the natural offsets flow through. And so, we have done that. I don't think we've given a number. I know we haven't given any specific number out there. What we have done is updated the sensitivities for Midstream to reflect the fact that those hedges are no longer in place. And so, you see a slightly higher Midstream sensitivity to the commodity price than before. \nMatthew Blair : Okay, sounds good. And then I don't know if I missed it, but did you give out a number for refined product exports in Q2? I think a year ago, it was 153,000 barrels per day. How did it trend this year? And are you seeing a mix shift with more barrels headed to Europe and fewer to Latin America?\nBrian Mandell : This is Brian. We exported over 200,000 barrels this quarter, which was up. In large part, our Sweeny refinery was making some higher sulfur diesel that we exported to Latin America. Like others have said, we have been exporting more distillate to Europe as trade flows from Russia change and Russia is importing more barrels, particularly into Brazil, 120,000 barrels to 140,000 barrels, and where U.S. exporting more barrels to Europe. \nMatthew Blair : Brain. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Your line is open please go ahead.\nPaul Cheng : Thank you, good morning guys. I think this is for Mark. Mark, if we look at California, you still have the Carson and Wilmington, combined refinery. Today, probably 60% of the diesel in California being consumed by renewable and biodiesel. And that in several years' time, you may end up that to be 100%. So, what's the role of that facility going to look like, and how your configuration may need to change?\nMark Lashier: Yes. It'll help cover that at a high level. Paul, I think Brian has some views on what's going on there as well. I think at one end of the spectrum, we're well connected to LAX from that facility. And jet is a big opportunity there, and we would certainly look at doing what we could to provide more jet. I think that one mitigant of that is as we take the San Francisco refinery offline, that diesel production will go away and leave the market. And it's almost a gallon-for-gallon replacement with renewable diesel so that is an opportunity there as well. And so, we -- I think that there are exports from California today and Brian can comment further on that, but that's an opportunity to balance things out.\nBrian Mandell : And Paul, I would add, the best amount of distillate producer at LA is actually exported by pipeline to neighboring states. So, we don't make a lot of California distillate at that refinery. So, it's, for us, at least a nonissue.\nPaul Cheng : Okay. So, you think that. And do you think that on a longer-term basis, that should be part of your portfolio? Or given the political environment and everything, that, that may -- I mean, is there any plan to do something if there are what you have done to Rodeo?\nMark Lashier: Well, yeah Paul, we're looking at everything we can do to keep the LA refinery competitive in that environment. It is, frankly, a difficult environment. And it's been very publicly, politically challenging there, whether it's EV mandates. But we believe that it's going to be challenging for California to implement their aspirations around EVs so I think that may be overplayed. But we're watching the market's environment very carefully and doing everything that's in our control to keep the LA refinery competitive and supplying products in that market.\nPaul Cheng : Okay. And the final one, I think this maybe is for either Rich or Kevin. When we look at your margin capture or that your margin realization in Central Corridor, you're actually doing better than we thought. Is there any one-off benefit that we see or it's just normal market condition and that recovery from the downtime in the first quarter? Thank you.\nRich Harbison : Paul, this is Rich. I'll start it off here with an answer. The Central Corridor, the primary reason that you're seeing is a really strong performance from our facilities there. It's specifically Ponca City and the Billings refinery. Both of those facilities have been running very, very well over the last several quarters and continue to operate, exceeding expectations on utilization as well as clean product yield, which is improving the market capture there.\nKevin Mitchell : And just to clarify, it's not a function of one-off items that are benefiting. It is all operational, as Rich described.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Laetsch of Morgan Stanley. your question is live please go ahead.\nJoe Laetsch : Great thanks on Beyond. So, I wanted to go back to a couple of topics we've already hit on. But first on Chemicals. So, with the two CPChem projects starting up in the back half of the year, could you just give us a sense of earnings contribution and uplift, probably 2024 on a normalized margin environment from those two projects, just how we should think about that?\nTim Roberts : Yes. On that, Joe, probably to clarify, those projects are expected to start up in 2026. And so, on the hexene units, okay. So, with regard to the hexene unit, yes, that 1 was completed. We're looking at that, my apologies here. I was thinking of the bigger projects. 1-hexene has been completed down at Sweeny. They'll be in start-up mode through the third quarter. And you should probably start to see some level of earnings start to show up in the fourth quarter. The splitter project, which is up at Cedar Bayou, that project also is in the final completion at this point or they're going to be ready to get everything completed by the end of sometime in the mid-fourth quarter, excuse me. So, you're really probably not going to see anything meaningful as they go through shaking out the units, getting them started up. And probably for both of them, you may be probably landing more toward a grueling first quarter before something really starts to show up there.\nMark Lashier: Yes. And CPChem executed the hexene project and brought it in under budget as well so I think that's notable in this environment.\nJoe Laetsch : Great. Thank. And then just going back to Rodeo. I know you all have talked about the potential to produce renewable jet fuel out of that facility as well. Can you just talk about any progress you've made there? Any thoughts on the timing when a decision could be made to produce SAF?\nRich Harbison : Yes, this is Rich. The project, as it's designed, will be able to produce SAF. What's really missing from the whole equation is the market indicator to do that. And as soon as that's in place, we will quickly shift to a renewable jet sustainable aviation fuel production. The facility will have the capability of producing 20,000 barrels a day of sustainable aviation fuel on the backbone of 10,000 barrels a day of renewable jet that's blended with traditional crude oil-based jet production.\nMark Lashier: Yes. And that's not saying negative about SAF. We believe that SAF will be an important part of our path toward renewable fuels. But today at Rodeo, the economics favor renewable diesel so would maximize renewable diesel produce some. There are some that you just will produce just because of the yields. But any additional investment to produce more SAF would require something that would incent us to divert away from renewable diesel into SAF.\nRich Harbison : And there is the capability to invest and increase that production level.\nMark Lashier: Yes.\nJoe Laetsch : Great thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mark Lashier for closing remarks.\nMark Lashier: Thank you, Alex, and thanks to all of you for your questions. We delivered strong second-quarter financial and operating results as we executed on our strategic priorities by focusing on the things we control, most importantly, the commitments we made to our owners in November. We continued a healthy pace of returning cash to shareholders. And in Refinery -- Refining, we had another quarter of strong operating performance with above-industry average crude utilization and lower operating costs. We're executing our Midstream NGL wellhead-to-market strategy and completed the buy-in of DCP's units and raised our synergy targets to over $400 million, wrapping up a series of foundational transactions to drive value creation in our NGL business. We're realizing our business transformation initiatives and are on track to achieve at least $1 billion of annual run rate savings by year-end while driving a transformative mindset across the enterprise. As we deliver on our strategic priorities, we remain committed to financial strength, disciplined capital allocation, and returning cash to shareholders. The outstanding operational performance will position us to capture the current strong market environment in the third quarter. And we look forward to updating you on our progress. Thank you all for your interest in Phillips 66.\nOperator: Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Tim Roberts",
            "content": "Roger, this is Tim. Thanks for the question. We started working on this as soon as we closed the initial part of the transaction last year, so we got the integration teams together. At the beginning of this back in the fall of last year, we felt we had a line of sight of $300 million that we could get full value for all the way through the first quarter of 2025. And that's when some contracts are rolling off that we're going to third parties and we could bring them into our system. But most of that we felt would be captured by 2024. Well, as we dug in, and we've got the teams involved, engaged, everybody's working together. Now the employees have done a really good job of digging deeper and finding a couple more gems in there. So now that's why we're comfortable talking about an increase going to $400 million. And I'm actually hoping at some point, I can give you more upside to that as we continue to dig because this integration is going to continue through the first quarter of 2024. The big driver right now, the teams are working together commercially, and probably worth setting a tone there is that early when we had the $300 million number, one-third was based on cost, two-third on commercial, we'll call it system optimization. But as we dug in and we've got to the $400 million number, now that is more 50-50 on cost. We found more in our procurement, more in our maintenance, more in our operations. And then -- so 50% on cost and now 50% on, again, system optimization and commercial activities. So that's kind of the breakdown. And the real driver right now for us through the first quarter of 2024 is systems integration. So, a lot of good work being done by the team, but it just takes time and you got to get it right. So, we are spending the time to do that, and we'll be done by the end of the first quarter. And then we'll be in what I consider a normal operation, steady-state mode with regard to how we run as a business. Yes. And with regard -- this is Tim Roberts on this. With regard to Chemicals, talk about currently where we're at with chain margins. Yes, it's been an interesting run here. Obviously, you've got supply, plenty of supply available, and demand, they're not matching up. So, therefore, you've seen chain margins have been dropping over the last several quarters. Where you're at right now, I think IHS added about $0.12 in chain margins. And really the way we would look at this and look at it going forward is, is that the high-cost producers, both in Asia and those that are in Europe are going to set the price. And those that are in advantaged feedstock locations will keep running and probably run hard, which is what we're seeing right now in North America and the Middle East. While those are having to shut in capacity or having to manage production or any other reasons I mentioned earlier. Now fundamentally, though, you've got to get demand and supply to match up and you got to start working off inventory. Ethylene inventories here in North America are above the five-year average. So, that's got a direction that needs to start working its way down. And you're seeing the same thing in polyethylene, so, two of the main products that we see with regard to our CPChem JV. However, we're running really strong here. Exports are strong as well with regard to North America because we're advantaged on feedstock. So, our outlook is that yes, you got to hit the bottom before you can start working your way back up. I can't say this is the inflection point, but cash costs typically will drive where you get to the bottom and then how soon you can accelerate. And usually, as we would say and it goes in a lot of different directions is low cost, low prices solve prices. So, fundamentally, we do think that the outlook is still going to be constructive and constructive in that you still got population growth. You still have economies that have not been churning at their all cylinders, China being one of them. And that's not a position of saying they never will, not at all. We think there is still going to be good solid economic growth. You're just not seeing it consistent global. So, we do anticipate that, that will happen and that will help soak up some of the capacity that's out there, bring the markets back into balance and you get back into more of a mid-cycle case. Yes. On that, Joe, probably to clarify, those projects are expected to start up in 2026. And so, on the hexene units, okay. So, with regard to the hexene unit, yes, that 1 was completed. We're looking at that, my apologies here. I was thinking of the bigger projects. 1-hexene has been completed down at Sweeny. They'll be in start-up mode through the third quarter.

            "name": "Brian Mandell",
            "content": "It's Brian. Maybe I'll just talk about product demand, give you a sense of what we're thinking for Q3. The strength in U.S. products basically starts with low inventories. Gasoline, we're under five-year averages by 7%. Distillate, we're under averages, five-year averages by 19%. That's a lot. We have a lot of new capacity coming online in the U.S., but we've had even more outages than the new capacity. For us, we're seeing gasoline demand up about 2% over last year in the U.S. and about 4% globally. So that's strong demand. On distillate, we have the demand down a bit in the U.S., mostly on industrial manufacturing segments. But globally, we have it up. We have lots of pockets of really strong distillate demand in Latin America, up 9%, Asia up 4% and diesel cracks continue to remain strong. In fact, they've gotten a lot stronger and we believe that they'll continue to perform throughout the year as we head into higher demand planning season and into winter in the U.S. where distillate over gasoline every pad now. And then finally on the jet, the jet's also strong. Low inventories, increasing domestic and international travels. Global seat demand is essentially flat to 2019 levels. TSA throughput numbers in the U.S. are back [ph] to 2019 levels. And interestingly, U.S. jet yields remain a little bit higher so that should add some marginal strength to diesel. And then on the WCS, you're right. WCS has started to widen again, which is in our best interest here at -- we buy the most WCS of, I think, anybody there is. And we've seen the widening mostly because of heavy crude dips, in general, have started to widen. We also see fall turnarounds in pad 2 as being very strong. And then if you'll remember in September, which next month, we'll start to see Dillon blending, which will swell the volume of Canadian crude. So, all those things have been putting pressure on and widening the dips to our advantage. Ryan, this is Brian. Exceeding expectations is a good thing. We're happy about that. We did have a strong quarter in Q2. We've added a bunch of retail JVs since 2019. We're roughly at 750 retail stores, which have really performed well since we've added them and certainly in 2Q. We had higher margins, as Kevin mentioned, in both the domestic markets and in our Western European business. We had U.S. volumes up a bit. And finally, in our lubricants business, the base oil business has been performing really well as the feedstock prices have been falling more than the base oil prices. So, I'd tell you for Q3, when you're thinking about Q3, our earnings should be in line with our mid-cycle expectations, assuming the kind of normal seasonal demand. Hey Jason, it's Brian. So, far in Western Europe on the Rhine, we haven't seen water levels low enough to benefit us. It is true if water levels do get low, we benefit from that. But the water levels haven't gotten there yet. Can't really predict where they're going to go in Q3, but if they get lower, then we'll have some benefit. Hey Manav, this is Brian. Well, first, I think our view is that TMX will probably come on later in the year, although line fill is forecasted for early Q1. I think the line will not be filled completely. That's our view. I think those are on the lines, I feel like some of those barrels will be exported to Asia. We'll see if that happens. It's hard to get VLCCs there. In fact, you can't load VLCCs. You have to load them ship to ship outside of L.A. So, it's -- we'll see what happens going forward. But certainly, it could be a benefit to the West Coast having more of that crude. This is Brian. We exported over 200,000 barrels this quarter, which was up. In large part, our Sweeny refinery was making some higher sulfur diesel that we exported to Latin America. Like others have said, we have been exporting more distillate to Europe as trade flows from Russia change and Russia is importing more barrels, particularly into Brazil, 120,000 barrels to 140,000 barrels, and where U.S. exporting more barrels to Europe. And Paul, I would add, the best amount of distillate producer at LA is actually exported by pipeline to neighboring states. So, we don't make a lot of California distillate at that refinery. So, it's, for us, at least a nonissue."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Rich Harbison",
            "content": "Yes, I think you covered most of that, Mark. Maybe I can add just a little bit of color to it. As we talked about, the primary drivers for the increase were material and labor costs. And when you think about the timing of this project, it was estimated and approved prior to the heavy inflationary period. So, we're realizing that inflationary pressure that's occurred over the duration of the development of the project. Half of those costs we'll experience this year. The other half will flow into next year's capital allocation. As Mark indicated, the project is still very capital efficient at $1.60 a gallon, and we're very happy with that and that is very competitive versus other announced projects. And we continue to work full steam ahead on the construction, and it remains on track for commercial operation in first quarter 2024. Now I know there's been a lot of focus around the lower LCFS credits over the recent change. But the reality of this, the economics around this project are centered around four programs as well as the retail price of diesel in the state of California and other markets that recognize renewable diesel. And those programs, too, are federal and two are at the state level. And all of these seem to be working interrelationally with each other as well as impacting the feedstock costs as well. So, when we look at the overall momentum and movement of all this interrelationship, we still see very strong economics for the project and continue to be very optimistic about the EBITDA returns on it. Yes, Roger, this is Rich. We're well on our way, as you indicated, to our $0.75 per barrel savings target that we announced or committed to during the Investor Day last November. And you know what's most exciting about this whole process for me has really been how the organization, the entire organization is engaged in this process. So yes, there is some oversharing site to site of activity in best practices. But most of these activities are opportunities identified by that local organization, really accepting the challenge to improve the business. And they're uncovering these opportunities to be more efficient in their work process, right? And changing -- and then fundamentally changing how that work process is occurring to drive inefficiencies out of the business, which ultimately reduce costs out of the business. So, if you think about, we talked about $0.40 a barrel already year-to-date. If you -- that's calculated by, if you take our barrels that we've run year-to-date and calculate to the $0.40, you can back into the number that we're seeing drive to the bottom line of our financial report there. And that's been quite impressive. And we've got a lot more in the queue, as Mark indicated on his comments, with the run rate. Our target is $550 million. Over $300 million of that is currently assigned to Refining. And of course, the run rate doesn't mean it's realized, right? But that just means it's identified, it's locked in. And now we've got to drive it to the bottom line, and that's what's most impressive about the organization, really pushing to get these identified opportunities pushed to the bottom line. John, this is Rich. FCC repairs were complete and the unit is up and running as of July 20. That's the actual date that it was back online producing on specification material. The refinery itself is back to normal operations, so all the units and all the assets there are running to our plan. The Bayway team did a phenomenal job getting that repair work done very efficiently. Very excited about how they performed to complete that work. And additionally, when Mark's just talking about this mindset activity, we saw other parts of our organization also really focused to help pick up our teammates that were struggling a little bit in Bayway. And we saw phenomenal performance in our refineries in Sweeney, Ponca City and Billings. They each had record performance as well as our assets on the West Coast, and it all ended up in a system-wide utilization of 93%, which is our highest crude utilization since 2019. So -- and we're looking forward to building on this momentum and continuing that into the third quarter. Yes, Ryan. Permitting to complete any project in California is very challenging, projects even to convert a conventional crude oil facility refinery to a lower carbon intensity transportation fuel production facility. So, we did recently receive news on an appeal to our environmental impact report that is the supporting document for permits. This was filed by a couple of NGOs in the state. And the good news is the court ruling found several issues in the favor of Phillips 66. And notably, most notably is the construction of the Rodeo Renewed project can continue with the county work to resolve three issues. So, we're working closely with the county and the courts to provide the necessary information to reconsider the open issues. And we remain very confident that the Rodeo Renewed project is on track to start commercial operation in first quarter of 2024. Thank you. Yes. No, this is Rich. Over in that, what we refer to it as the Atlantic Basin, we did have higher volumes and lower costs due to less turnaround activity at Bayway quarter-over-quarter when you look at those. But a lot of those were offset by lower margins. The realized margin was lower primarily due to a weaker market crack. Configuration impacts also played into this with the gasoline cracks increasing by $10 a barrel and then the distillate crack decreasing by $18 a barrel. That played into the market capture quite a bit. And there was lower product differentials there. And then the other one that goes a little bit unnoticed in this market is really the secondary product cost and margins on those secondary products. And both the NGLs for both Bayway and Humber were lower. And then the petroleum coke that sold out of Humber also experienced lower product differentials. So, those are the primary reasons you saw lower market capture there in Atlantic Basin. Paul, this is Rich. I'll start it off here with an answer. The Central Corridor, the primary reason that you're seeing is a really strong performance from our facilities there. It's specifically Ponca City and the Billings refinery. Both of those facilities have been running very, very well over the last several quarters and continue to operate, exceeding expectations on utilization as well as clean product yield, which is improving the market capture there. Yes, this is Rich. The project, as it's designed, will be able to produce SAF. What's really missing from the whole equation is the market indicator to do that. And as soon as that's in place, we will quickly shift to a renewable jet sustainable aviation fuel production. The facility will have the capability of producing 20,000 barrels a day of sustainable aviation fuel on the backbone of 10,000 barrels a day of renewable jet that's blended with traditional crude oil-based jet production. And there is the capability to invest and increase that production level."

            "name": "Mark Lashier",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. In the second quarter, we had adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion or $3.87 per share. We continued to execute on our strategic priorities and returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our results reflect strong operating performance across our portfolio, demonstrating the commitment of our employees to maintain safe and reliable operations. We want to thank them for their dedication to operating excellence and delivering on our mission to provide energy and improve lives. In Refining, we continue to run above industry average rates, and in Midstream, we had record NGL frac volumes. We continue to run our Sweeny Hub fracs, and export terminal at above nameplate capacities to meet strong demand. We remain committed to operating excellence and continue to focus on our strategic priorities to create value and return cash to shareholders. Slide 4 summarizes progress toward our strategic priorities. Over the last 12 months, we've returned 14% of our market cap or $5.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We're on track to return $10 billion to $12 billion over the 10-quarter period between July 2022 through year-end 2024. In Refining, we had another quarter of strong operating performance with crude utilization of 93% and lower operating costs. As of the end of the quarter, more than $300 million of the $550 million run rate cost savings are attributable to Refining. Kevin will provide an update on our business transformation progress in a moment. We're executing our NGL wellhead to market strategy and capturing DCP integration synergies faster than expected. Our current synergy run rate is over $200 million. We've been successful in identifying additional opportunities to increase our target from $300 million to more than $400 million by 2025. In June, we completed the acquisition of DCP Midstream's public common units for $3.8 billion, increasing our economic interest from 43% to 87%. We ended the quarter with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 35%. We expect leverage to be within our target range by year-end. In Refining, we're converting our San Francisco refinery into one of the world's largest renewable fuels facilities. The capital to convert the facility to over 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuels production is anticipated to be approximately $1.25 billion. This is an increase from our original premise due to higher-than-anticipated material and labor costs as well as impacts related to weather and permitting. The revised capital cost of around $1.60 per gallon remains well below similar announced projects, and the expected returns are significantly above our Refining hurdle rates. The overall project timing and scope remains unchanged. We expect to begin commercial operations in the first quarter of 2024. In Chemicals, CPChem completed construction of the 1-hexene unit in Old Ocean, Texas, and expects to begin operations by the end of the third quarter. The new propylene splitter at its Cedar Bayou facility is expected to start up in the fourth quarter. CPChem and Qatar Energy are jointly building world-scale petrochemical facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Ras Laffan, Qatar. On the U.S. Gulf Coast, the Golden Triangle Polymers joint venture has project financing in place. The Ras Laffan petrochemical joint venture expects to complete project financing later this year. Both projects remain on schedule to start up in 2026. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review the business transformation savings and second quarter financial results. Yes, Neil, it's Mark. I'll cover it at a high level and then Rich can drill in a little bit. But essentially, what we've experienced there as we commenced the project execution, we had a lot of heavy rainfall. And of course, even the start of the project was deferred a little bit because of permitting challenges. And we believe -- we recognize that the earnings from this are going too far exceed the earnings we realized to date from the San Francisco refinery so we wanted to stick to the schedule. So, we incurred some more cost to compensate for the productivity loss during bad weather and delays around permitting. We also saw some inflation. When this project was sanctioned, the big run-up in inflationary pressures hadn't hit yet. And so, we realized that really is the only project in our purview where we're seeing that kind of impact or haven't accounted for the inflation at sanction, so we're having to take care of that. So, we still look at that $1.60 a gallon as incredibly competitive.  The overall competitiveness of the asset is strong. The location, we've got competitive advantage. The pull-through with our retail presence is a competitive advantage. And as you look at as we bring this facility online, we're taking off almost as much traditional diesel as we're bringing in renewable diesel to the market, so the market disruption will be minimal. So, we really are bullish around this project, and we see that the economics are still very robust in spite of the cost increases. Rich, do you want to go... And when you look at those increases across '23 and '24, it will require a modest increase in our capital target of $2 billion for this year, but we will manage that additional cost within our $2 billion target going forward in 2024. Yes, I'd just like to comment a little bit on that, the integration impact. This really is a clear indication of how well the teams are integrating, the DCP team, the Phillips 66 teams coming together. And as Tim noted, once we had operational control of the entity after the Enbridge transaction, we were able to really hit the ground running and started executing against our targets. And getting these teams integrated, one team, one culture, taking the best of the best and driving this, this is really the biggest visible measure of how successful that's been. And we see those numbers move up and we see teams excited about the future and looking at ways to capture more value, both from a cost perspective and a commercial perspective. And so, this is going to be what they are and what they do from this point forward. Yes. And if you see some commonalities between the mindset and our Refining organization and the Midstream organization, it's real. And it's this business transformation process, it's easy to talk about the cost impact and it's easy to have those cost targets. But really the most phenomenal thing going on is the mindset change and the drive that we see in the employees to get better at what they do every day. And you're seeing that move on from cost focus to just where do we create the most value, how do we create the most value together. Whether it's the way we've organized and integrated our value chain optimization organization more synergistically across the refineries, having VCO folks sitting on the refinery leadership team every day, searching for ways to optimize and coordinate with other refineries. It's real. And that's -- it's that mindset, it's that drive that's going to make these cost savings and the synergy capture sustainable for the long term. And it's just not going to end. It's just going to be the way we do business going forward. Yes. I would just comment over again and compliment Brian and his Marketing team on the execution of the strategy that they've held for several years is to go in and participate through these joint venture opportunities in markets that make sense for us, that we have a competitive advantage that there's strength to capitalize on. And we don't go and do this everywhere. It's very surgical. It's very intentional, and it is exceeding expectations so it's a well-executed strategy. Yes. I think that again, as Kevin mentioned earlier, we looked across our portfolio, and there's different dimensions across our portfolio where others may have some interest in our assets and may place a greater value because it's not strategic to us and we'll continue to evaluate that. I wouldn't comment on any specific opportunities. And likewise, as we did with Marketing in California to -- we made some relatively small acquisitions to enhance the opportunities around Rodeo once it's up and running, and we've done a series of those and they're all doing quite well. And so, we'll look at smaller opportunistic things. But you think about where we've come from, we've done some pretty significant transactions in Midstream. It's time to digest those and to drive value through those. And if we can find some very accretive small, midsized kinds of things, we'd look at them, but there's nothing in the queue and nothing that we'd want to comment on. We've got a great backbone there and history has shown that the strong backbone in that industry can attract smaller investments that are quite attractive. So, think in terms of small, very accretive, high-return opportunities like we've done in Marketing would be on our scale. But we're going to stick with our disciplined approach going forward. We've got a commitment of around $2 billion for 2024, and anything around that would be very disciplined and high return. Yes. It'll help cover that at a high level. Paul, I think Brian has some views on what's going on there as well. I think at one end of the spectrum, we're well connected to LAX from that facility. And jet is a big opportunity there, and we would certainly look at doing what we could to provide more jet. I think that one mitigant of that is as we take the San Francisco refinery offline, that diesel production will go away and leave the market. And it's almost a gallon-for-gallon replacement with renewable diesel so that is an opportunity there as well. And so, we -- I think that there are exports from California today and Brian can comment further on that, but that's an opportunity to balance things out. Well, yeah Paul, we're looking at everything we can do to keep the LA refinery competitive in that environment. It is, frankly, a difficult environment. And it's been very publicly, politically challenging there, whether it's EV mandates. But we believe that it's going to be challenging for California to implement their aspirations around EVs so I think that may be overplayed. But we're watching the market's environment very carefully and doing everything that's in our control to keep the LA refinery competitive and supplying products in that market. Yes. And CPChem executed the hexene project and brought it in under budget as well so I think that's notable in this environment. Yes. And that's not saying negative about SAF. We believe that SAF will be an important part of our path toward renewable fuels. But today at Rodeo, the economics favor renewable diesel so would maximize renewable diesel produce some. There are some that you just will produce just because of the yields. But any additional investment to produce more SAF would require something that would incent us to divert away from renewable diesel into SAF. Yes. Thank you, Alex, and thanks to all of you for your questions. We delivered strong second-quarter financial and operating results as we executed on our strategic priorities by focusing on the things we control, most importantly, the commitments we made to our owners in November. We continued a healthy pace of returning cash to shareholders. And in Refinery -- Refining, we had another quarter of strong operating performance with above-industry average crude utilization and lower operating costs. We're executing our Midstream NGL wellhead-to-market strategy and completed the buy-in of DCP's units and raised our synergy targets to over $400 million, wrapping up a series of foundational transactions to drive value creation in our NGL business. We're realizing our business transformation initiatives and are on track to achieve at least $1 billion of annual run rate savings by year-end while driving a transformative mindset across the enterprise. As we deliver on our strategic priorities, we remain committed to financial strength, disciplined capital allocation, and returning cash to shareholders. The outstanding operational performance will position us to capture the current strong market environment in the third quarter. And we look forward to updating you on our progress. Thank you all for your interest in Phillips 66."

            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Starting on Slide 5 with an update on our business transformation progress. Our $1 billion business transformation target includes $800 million of cost savings and $200 million of sustaining capital reductions. We have identified over 2,700 initiatives to permanently reduce costs, with employees across the organization actively engaged in the transformation process. We have completed 1,200 initiatives that are generating value today. The chart on the left shows our progress toward the $800 million cost reduction target, with $550 million of run-rate cost savings at the end of the second quarter. The stacked bar shows our actual cumulative cost reductions for the year by category. Over the first half of 2023, we realized $260 million in cost savings. The majority of these cost reductions relate to Refining, which has benefited by about $0.40 per barrel. Business transformation initiatives range from optimizing services across our portfolio of assets to establishing new tools to improve use of steam and energy.  Organizationally, we strengthened our centralized model for core functions to drive consistency and efficiencies. We continue implementing cost savings initiatives and are on track to achieve our run rate target by year-end 2023. We expect to realize the full $800 million of cost savings in 2024, which will include Refining cost reductions of $0.75 per barrel. Now I'll move to Slide 6 to cover the second quarter financial results. Adjusted earnings were $1.8 billion or $3.87 per share. The $15 million decrease in the fair value of our investment in NOVONIX reduced earnings per share by $0.03. We generated operating cash flow of $1 billion, including a working capital use of $1 billion and cash distributions from equity affiliates of $239 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $551 million, including $339 million for growth projects. We returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through $1.3 billion of share repurchases and $474 million of dividends. We ended the quarter with 445 million shares outstanding. I'll cover the segment results on Slide 7. Additional details can be referenced in the appendix to this presentation. This slide highlights the change in adjusted results by segment from the first quarter to the second quarter. During the period, adjusted earnings decreased $199 million, mostly due to lower results in Refining and Midstream, partially offset by an improvement in Marketing and Specialties. In Midstream, second quarter adjusted pretax income was $626 million, down $52 million from the prior quarter. The decrease was driven by the impact of declining commodity prices in our NGL business. This was partially offset by higher volumes in transportation. Chemicals adjusted pretax income decreased $6 million to $192 million in the second quarter. The industry polyethylene chain margin increased by $0.03 to $0.20 per pound. However, this was offset by higher maintenance and turnaround costs in the quarter. Global O&P utilization was 98%.  Refining second quarter adjusted pretax income was $1.1 billion, down $460 million from the first quarter. The decrease was due to a decline in margins, partially offset by higher volumes and lower operating expenses. Realized margins decreased primarily due to the decline in distillate crack spreads and narrowing heavy crude differentials, partially offset by improved gasoline cracks. In addition, realized margins reflect the impact of losses from secondary products due to declining NGL and coke purchase. Marketing and Specialties adjusted second quarter pretax income was $644 million, an increase of $218 million from the previous quarter, mainly due to seasonally higher global marketing margins on continued strong demand. The Corporate and Other segments adjusted pretax costs were $12 million lower than the prior quarter. The adjusted effective tax rate was 22%, consistent with the previous quarter. The impact of noncontrolling interests was improved compared to the prior quarter and also reflects our acquisition of DCP units on June 15. Slide 13 shows the change in cash during the second quarter. We started the quarter with a $7 billion cash balance. Cash from operations was $2 billion, excluding working capital. There was a working capital use of $1 billion, mainly reflecting an increase in inventory, which included the impact of unplanned downtime at the Bayway Refinery and seasonal storage opportunities. Year-to-date working capital is a use of around $2 billion, primarily related to inventory that we expect to mostly reverse by year-end. We funded $551 million of capital spending. In June, we drew $1.25 billion on a single-draw term loan to partially fund the acquisition of the DCP units for $3.8 billion. This transaction and the redemption of DCP's Series B preferred units of $161 million are represented as repurchase of noncontrolling interests. Additionally, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our ending cash balance was $3 billion. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In Chemicals, we expect the third quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the third quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the mid-90s and turnaround expenses to be between $110 million and $130 million. We anticipate third quarter Corporate and Other costs to come in between $280 million and $300 million, reflecting higher net interest expense from funding the purchase of DCP units during the second quarter. In 2023, we expect our full year capital spend to be above the $2 billion budget, reflecting approximately $200 million of additional spending on Rodeo Renewed. In addition, we just closed on a $260 million acquisition of West Coast marketing assets. This acquisition supports the high-return Rodeo Renewed project by optimizing the full value of our renewable fuel sales to end customers.  We continue to review our portfolio to determine if assets meet our strategic long-term objectives or if they provide more value to third parties. Earlier this year, we divested the Belle Chasse Terminal, and very recently, we sold our interest in the South Texas Gateway Terminal. Total proceeds from the two transactions are approximately $350 million.  Now we will open the line for questions, after which Mark will make closing comments. Yes, Doug. So, we had guided to $7 billion increasing to $10 billion at Investor Day of cash flow. And the reality is some of the actions that bridge us from $7 billion to $10 billion we have executed on. And so, at this point in time, on a traditional -- our view of Refining mid-cycle, we're probably somewhere in the $8 billion range, maybe a little bit higher than that. But we're not all the way to $10 billion because there are still other things we need to execute on. But we're certainly making good progress from the $7 billion to $10 billion. Your comment on deferred taxes is a relevant one. This year, we actually expect to have a slightly larger-than-normal deferred tax benefit on cash flow. So, I think I had previously guided to about $400 million to $500 million of benefit for the year. We expect that to be more like $700 million to $800 million, and that's mainly because of the impact of DCP buy-in on that. And after that, we should revert to a more traditional sort of $400 million to $500 million level. That is correct. We have not changed our view of mid-cycle, but we would acknowledge that we are in a stronger than mid-cycle margin environment currently. We have been for the last 1 year-plus, 1.5 years. And barring any major economic downturn, we actually think that will continue for a reasonable period of time, just given the overall supply, demand balances that exist globally. Yes, I think that's right. I mean, as you know, we have been -- other than during the COVID period, we've been consistently buying back shares since really 2012 when we started the program. The elevated pace in the second quarter was not so much an impact of the DCP transaction. More it was a function of we recognize that relative to our share price at the time and our outlook, which was quite positive in terms of the overall business fundamentals, it seemed like a good opportunity to up the pace from where we had been. And based on where things sit today, it looks like a good decision on our part. The $5 billion to $7 billion that we guided at Investor Day, that's a sort of minimum threshold that we expect to meet. It doesn't mean to say we can't either hit that total return $10 billion to $12 billion before the end of 2024, and it certainly does not mean that we stop once we hit that threshold either. And so, I go back to our normal -- our traditional sort of guidance of at least 40% of cash flow returned to shareholders through the dividend and buybacks. Yes, Neil. I think we had given guidance that we expected our debt to cap to increase once we completed the buy-in of the DCP units. And so, it wasn't a surprise to us where we landed on that number. The two big drivers that will bring that back between now and the end of the year are what you pointed to, working capital. So that's about $2 billion inflow in cash that we expect to see between now and the end of the year, and then also just the ongoing ability to generate earnings, generate strong earnings, and build to equity. So, on our math, we think we end the year at right around the 30% level, so the top end of the range, but nonetheless, still within that overall target range. Obviously, this thing will move around quarter-over-quarter depending on what's going on in terms of market environment and cash items like working capital. But fundamentally, we think we're on a reasonable trajectory to be able to sustain in that target range. Yes, Matt, this is Kevin. We did. We did unwind them or have we let them roll off but we have less of that. We don't have that same hedging on our exposure to the Nat gas NGL commodity price that we have -- that DCP has historically had in our overall portfolio. And when you also factor in our position in Refining as a consumer of those project products, it felt more appropriate just to let the natural offsets flow through. And so, we have done that. I don't think we've given a number. I know we haven't given any specific number out there. What we have done is updated the sensitivities for Midstream to reflect the fact that those hedges are no longer in place. And so, you see a slightly higher Midstream sensitivity to the commodity price than before. And just to clarify, it's not a function of one-off items that are benefiting. It is all operational, as Rich described."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jeff Dietert, Vice President of Investor Relations. Jeff, you may begin.\nJeff Dietert: Good morning, and welcome to Phillips 66 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Participants on today's call will include Mark Lashier, President, CEO; Kevin Mitchell, CFO; Brian Mandell, Marketing and Commercial; Tim Roberts, Midstream and Chemicals; and Rich Harbison, Refining. Today's presentation material can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website, along with supplemental financial and operating information. Slide 2 contains our safe harbor statement. We will be making forward-looking statements during today's call. Actual results may differ materially from today's comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here as well as in our SEC filings. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Lashier: Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. During the first quarter, we delivered strong financial and operating results. We had adjusted earnings of $2 billion or $4.21 per share, a record first quarter. In Refining, we successfully executed major planned maintenance and ran above industry average rates. Currently, our refineries are running at high utilization to meet demand and capture market opportunities as we enter summer driving season. We returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In February, we raised our dividend 8% to $1.05 per share, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to a secure, competitive and growing dividend. Our integrated diversified portfolio provides us with the ability to generate strong cash flow, return substantial cash to shareholders and invest in the most attractive projects. We remain committed to operating excellence and disciplined capital allocation as we execute our strategy. Recently, our Midstream, Refining and Chemicals business were recognized for their exemplary safety performance in 2022. For the third consecutive year, Midstream was awarded the American Petroleum Institute's Distinguished Pipeline Safety Award for Large Operators. This is the highest recognition by API for the midstream industry. The American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers recognized five of our refineries for outstanding safety performance. Sweeny Refinery received the Distinguished Safety Award for the second year in a row. Bayway, Borger, Santa Maria and Ponca City refineries also earned safety awards. In Chemicals, four CPChem facilities were recognized with AFPM Safety Awards. We're honored to receive these awards and would like to recognize our employees' commitment to operating excellence. Congratulations to all the people working at these facilities. Well done. We started the year off well and continue to advance strategic priorities from our Investor Day late last year. Slide 4 summarizes progress toward our targets to create value and increase shareholder distributions. Since July of 2022, we've returned $3.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We're on track to meet our target to return $10 billion to $12 billion over the 10-quarter period between July 2022 through year-end 2024. We had strong refining operational performance in the first quarter and market capture increased to 93%. In Midstream, we're advancing our NGL wellhead to market strategy. We recently achieved an integration milestone with the transition of DCP Midstream employees to Phillips 66, enabling continued synergy capture. In anticipation of the DCP buy-in, we issued bonds and executed a delayed draw term loan. We expect to close on the transaction by the end of the second quarter. We're advancing our business transformation initiatives, and we're on track to deliver $1 billion of annual run rate savings by year-end. Next quarter, we'll provide a more detailed update on the cost savings achieved through the first half of the year. In Refining, we're converting our San Francisco refinery into one of the world's largest renewables fuels facilities. The conversion will substantially reduce emissions from the facility and produce lower carbon intensity transportation fuels. In February, we safely shut down the Santa Maria facility, as we continued to advance the project. We expect to begin commercial operations in the first quarter of 2024. Upon completion, Rodeo will have over 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuels production capacity. In Chemicals, CPChem is pursuing a portfolio of high-return projects, enhancing its asset base and optimizing its existing operations. This includes construction of a second world-scale 1-hexene unit in Old Ocean, Texas and the expansion of propylene splitting capacity at its Cedar Bayou facility. Both projects are expected to start up in the second half of 2023. CPChem and Qatar Energy are jointly building world-scale petrochemical facilities on the US Gulf Coast and in Ras Laffan, Qatar, with start-up at each facility expected in 2026. We look forward to continuing to update you on our strategic priorities. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results.\nKevin Mitchell: Thank you, Mark, and hello, everyone. Starting with an overview on Slide 5, we summarized our financial results for the first quarter. Adjusted earnings were $2 billion or $4.21 per share. The $12 million decrease in the fair value of our investment in NOVONIX reduced earnings per share by $0.02. We generated operating cash flow of $1.2 billion, including a working capital use of $1.3 billion and cash distributions from equity affiliates of $369 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $378 million, including $228 million for growth projects. We returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through $486 million of dividends and $800 million of share repurchases. We ended the quarter with 459 million shares outstanding. Moving to Slide 6. This slide highlights the change in adjusted results by segment from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. During the period, adjusted earnings increased $66 million, mostly due to higher results in Chemicals and lower corporate costs, partially offset by a decrease in Marketing and Specialties. Slide 7 shows our Midstream results. First quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $678 million compared with $674 million in the previous quarter. Transportation contributed adjusted pre-tax income of $270 million, up $33 million from the prior quarter. The increase was primarily driven by seasonally lower operating costs. NGL and Other adjusted pre-tax income was $420 million compared to $448 million in the fourth quarter. The decrease was mainly due to the impact of declining commodity prices in the gathering and processing business. The fractionators at the Sweeny Hub continued to run above nameplate capacity, averaging 554,000 barrels per day. The Freeport LPG Export facility loaded a record 282,000 barrels per day in the first quarter. Turning to Chemicals on slide eight. Chemicals had first quarter adjusted pre-tax income of $198 million compared with $52 million in the previous quarter. The increase was mainly due to improved margins from lower feedstock costs, higher sales volumes and decreased utility costs. The industry polyethylene margin increased by $0.10 to $0.17 per pound during the quarter. Global O&P utilization was 94% for the quarter. Turning to Refining on slide nine. Refining first quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $1.6 billion, down $18 million from the fourth quarter. The impact of lower volumes from turnaround activities was mostly offset by higher realized margins and lower utility costs. Our realized margins increased by 5% to $20.72 per barrel, while the composite 3:2:1 market crack decreased by 5%. In the first quarter, turnaround costs were $234 million, crude utilization was 90% and clean product yield was 83%. Slide 10 covers market capture. The market crack for the first quarter was $22.39 per barrel compared to $23.58 per barrel in the fourth quarter. Realized margin was $20.72 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 93%, up from 84% in the previous quarter. Market capture is impacted by the configuration of our refineries. We have a higher distillate yield and a lower gasoline yield than the 3:2:1 market indicator. During the first quarter, the distillate crack decreased $19 per barrel and the gasoline crack increased $7 per barrel. Losses from secondary products of $2.56 per barrel were $1.03 per barrel lower than the previous quarter due to falling crude prices. Our feedstock advantage of $2.34 per barrel was $2.37 per barrel improved compared to the fourth quarter, primarily due to running more advantaged crudes. The Other category improved realized margins by $2.19 per barrel. This category includes freight costs, clean product realizations and inventory impacts. First quarter was $1.73 per barrel higher than the previous quarter, primarily due to improved clean product realizations. Moving to slide 11. Marketing and Specialties had a solid quarter, reflecting stronger-than-typical first quarter margins. Adjusted first quarter pre-tax income was $426 million compared with $539 million in the prior quarter, mainly due to lower international marketing margins. On slide 12, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted pre-tax costs of $248 million; $32 million lower than the prior quarter. The improvement was mainly due to higher interest income and recognition of a transfer tax on a foreign entity reorganization in the fourth quarter of 2022. Slide 13 shows the change in cash during the first quarter. We started the quarter with a $6.1 billion cash balance. Cash from operations was $2.5 billion, excluding working capital. There was a working capital use of $1.3 billion, mainly reflecting an increase in inventory, partially offset by a decrease in our net accounts receivable position. During the quarter, we issued $1.25 billion of senior unsecured notes in support of the pending buy-in of DCP Midstream's publicly held common units. We funded $378 million of capital spending and returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our ending cash balance was $7 billion. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items for the second quarter. In Chemicals, we expect the second quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the second quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the mid-90s and turnaround expenses to be between $100 million and $120 million. We anticipate second quarter Corporate and Other costs coming between $260 million and $290 million, reflecting higher interest costs. In March, we issued senior unsecured notes of $1.25 billion and entered into a delayed draw term loan of up to $1.5 billion in support of the DCP Midstream buy-in transaction, which is expected to close during the second quarter. Now we will open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning team. The first question is around refining utilization. It was better than expected in the quarter, and the guide for Q2 also looks a little bit better. So you talked about what improvements that you're making on the ground and it's been a choppy 18 months in Refining from a utilization standpoint. So what conviction can you provide the market that we've turned the corner here? Thank you.\nRich Harbison: Yes. Thanks, Neil. This is Rich. Good question, and it's a number of things coming together here for us. Back in November, we outlined a number of opportunities to improve refining's performance. One of them was asset availability. Optimizing our turnaround durations, we've done a really good job executing those in a pretty heavy turnaround quarter for us, and that's a big component of allowing us to operate at that 90% crude unit utilization. It's really executing those turnarounds in a very high-performing status. On the Gulf Coast, our assets performed very well. They increased their crude flexibility that also allowed us to open up the utilization window and also allowed us to capture additional market as well, which you saw as well, the refining market capture rate of 93% was very good for the quarter as well. The key assets there are running the assets, focusing on what we can control in our business, Neil, and that is executing our turnarounds well. And we were able to do that coming in below guidance this year -- or this first quarter, continuing a trend that started last year with us coming in below guidance.\nMark Lashier: Yes, Neil, this is Mark. I'll just come over with a little bit relating that back to the Investor Day commitments, that we made those commitments based on the groundwork that had been underway for some time, the fairly small projects that we were going through, the blocking and tackling that we were taking on, and we're really starting to see those come to fruition now. And we're pleased with what we're seeing out there. And really, I think the biggest impact of business transformation has been the hearts and minds of our employees. They are all in. Wasn't that way a year ago when first started the initiative, but now they see the things that they're doing, the hard work that they're doing are starting to impact their results and turnarounds, starting to impact the operational effectiveness of the plants as well as they're seeing it in the cost. And that's just been a very virtuous cycle for our employees. There's a stronger competitive edge out there and they really want to own their future now.\nJeff Dietert: Rich, you want to talk about some of the projects that were completed last year?\nRich Harbison: Yes, I think that plays into the Refining capture rate of 93% for the quarter for us. Last year, we actually implemented 12 projects focused on market capture. The result of the impact of those projects is a 1.2% improvement in market capture with mid-cycle pricing assumptions. We implemented $225 million worth of projects, and the net return on those or the EBITDA generation for that investment was $158 million at mid-cycle pricing. 2023, we actually have additional 18 projects identified that are in flight, and the estimate is a 1.4% improvement in market capture. So, I think what you're seeing here is the plan we laid out in November is starting to really come to the bottom line of the performance of the Refining.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks. That's a lot of good color there. The second question is around the decline we've seen in crude prices. And that should manifest itself in different parts across the business, so I would love any perspective on how we can think about it from a modeling perspective. Specifically around Marketing, which tends to be a tailwind, capture rates, declining crude prices tends to help secondary products but also can be a headwind for working capital. So, if the crude price decline sustains, how should we think about that in terms of Q2 movements? Thank you.\nBrian Mandell: Well, let me start, Neil. This is Brian. Talking about marketing and probably noticed we had very strong marketing earnings in Q1. Pretty happy about that. You know that we have a geographic diverse portfolio with assets both here in the US and Western Europe, which is great. But we also market through a number of channels, wholesale, branded, and retail. And what we've been doing is trying to focus our sales on the higher margin parts of our business, particularly in retail. And we purchased retail in the past few years. In fact, in mid-2019, we had 50 retail JV stores in the US. Now, we have 1,000 retail JV stores in the US, and we also spent some time reimaging all of our stores to get higher margins in business. And I would also say that in the lubes business, that it's also performing quite strongly in both base oils and finished products. So, as you mentioned, as spot prices come off, that generally benefits the marketing business because marketing margins, generally, or marketing prices generally fall slower.\nRich Harbison: Yes. On the Refining side, as you framed up the question, Neil, it's the flat price drop in accrued does reduce usually the secondary product losses. So they tend to tighten up a little bit there, so that has a positive impact for us in refining. But really, in refining, it's -- for us, it's the differential that we make our money off of on the light heavy sweet differential, and that's what we keep a close eye on. Kevin, any additional color to add to that?\nKevin Mitchell: Yeah. Neil, just on the working capital impact. As you've highlighted, with the declining prices, we will have a working capital hurt because we're in a net payables position. So you think about a system that's essentially 2 million barrels per day and a longer duration on the payables outstanding than on the receivables. So the approximate rule of thumb is somewhere in the order of $40 million to $50 million of working capital hurt per $1 of price reduction. And that assumes that the crude and the products move together, and the crack stays at the same level. But as you know, also, there's a lot of other moving parts in working capital, what's happening to inventories and so on. But as a rule of thumb, simple rule of thumb, you can use that $40 million to $50 million per $1 movement in price.\nNeil Mehta: Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks, everyone. \nMark Lashier: Thanks, Neil.\nOperator: Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is now open. You may proceed.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks everyone for getting me on. Guys, I want to ask a follow-up to Neil's question on the capture rate. So should -- I mean, obviously, reliability was a bit of a question mark over the past year? So should we now think about this level of capture rate, should we anticipate that, that's kind of a new normal? And if I could risk it, just a bolt-on to that, the same kind of seems to be true of the cost-cutting progress. It looks like you're a little bit ahead of schedule there. So as we wrap it all together, the earnings power of the business overall, it looks like you're kind of past the hump and trending higher. So I just wonder, if you could kind of characterize whether we're thinking about that the right way.\nMark Lashier: Great question, Doug. I'll let Rich address the capture rate, and I'll come back in on the cost-cutting progress.\nRich Harbison: Yeah. So capture rate has a lot of moving parts to it so it's very difficult to predict that, the configuration component of it, secondary products, feedstock costs, others. But back to focusing on what we can control in our business, Doug, is we're seeing continued maturity in our reliability programs, and these saves are coming on a regular basis where we're catching issues early and preventing larger events from occurring. And also under asset availability, as I mentioned earlier, the turnaround execution is going very well for us. We've significantly improved our predictability on this. That takes a lot of leg work over time to improve those processes. And most importantly, even though we're hitting our turnaround execution goals, we are continuing to complete all the necessary work to operate the equipment safely and reliably over time. So that program is continuing to mature. We'll continue to see that. And that will allow our utilization rates to be available to operate in the market if the market is there. And then as you mentioned, the cost side of it is a big component of this as well. We have a clear path that we've identified reducing our costs by $500 million by the end of this year on a run rate basis. Over half of the $400 million run rate cost savings that Kevin mentioned in his comments are coming out of Refining. And that's good news for us. And probably more importantly, as Mark has indicated, our entire organization is uncovering opportunities to lower cost. We're being much more efficient in how we work and accepting the challenge to improve the business, which all should directionally support improved market capture and utilization.\nMark Lashier: Yes. Thanks, Rich. Doug, we've really come a long way on the business transformation efforts. It was a heavy lift, a major focus really for the last 18 months or so, and we're seeing great progress. We beat our goal of $500 million by year-end of 2022, and we're accelerating right into 2023, hitting more than $600 million in the first quarter. And as I mentioned in our comments, we'll take you on a tour of those realized savings at the second quarter call. And we're excited the organization is excited. We've made major changes in the structure of the organization that eliminates a lot of inefficiencies. We've got feedback loops that we put in place to make sure that these savings are real and that they're sustainable. And we're seeing it and people have bought in. We're using some really state-of-the-art tools to make sure that we're capturing what we think we're capturing and delivering those results to the bottom line. So it's just an incredible change in the organization that we've witnessed over the last six or eight months as things start to be realized.\nDoug Leggate: A lot of progress in a short period of time, Mark. I guess my follow-up is fairly predictable, and I apologize for this demand. Your large -- one of your large competitors talked about big increases in deal demand year-over-year. And a healthy outlook for gasoline and market doesn\u2019t seem to believe that right now. I just wonder, through your marketing channels, if you could share, what you\u2019re seeing on both of those trends.\nBrian Mandell: Yes. Doug, this is Brian. Maybe I\u2019ll talk about kind of what we\u2019re seeing in the market. And that, it's kind of what we\u2019re seeing in our business as well. Although, our volumes are somewhat off, because of California flooding and because of the sub-maintenance. But generally, for US gasoline, we\u2019re seeing demand better than last year and we\u2019re seeing global demand about 3% better than last year. And we\u2019re now heading to gasoline driving season, as was mentioned, with kind of the lowest US gasoline inventories in almost 10 years. We\u2019re also seeing a very strong octane spreads of about a-third larger than they were first quarter of last year, $0.27. We would expect demand to hold better than last year, particularly given that the -- we have lower retail prices versus last year as well. On the diesel side, the year did start off weaker early in the year with warmer winter but has become to firm with Mid-Continent planning season. Currently we\u2019re seeing US diesel demand about 2.5% under last year. But that said, global distillate demand is a bit strong than last year and some countries are seeing particularly strong diesel demand. In Latin America, we\u2019re seeing demand at 10% over last year and China, 4% over last year. And finally, I\u2019d say that, in the US, it's been bouncing back and forth between max diesel and max gasoline pad 5s EBIT and max gasoline since mid-February pretty much. Pad 1 signaled max gasoline in mid-April. And so this bodes well for helping the firm up distillate throughout the summer.\nDoug Leggate: Interesting color. Will watch with interest, guys. Thanks so much for your answers.\nBrian Mandell: Thanks, Doug.\nOperator: Ryan Todd from Piper Sandler. Please, go ahead. Your line is open.\nRyan Todd: Great. Thanks. Maybe you basically said that you were not going to talk about this until next quarter, but was wondering on the cost reduction side. I mean, you've made great progress there. I mean, can you talk a little bit about where you've been ahead of schedule where you've had some success there and whether I mean you've already hit the $200 million kind of sustaining capital reduction target. Is there further upside to that versus your prior target? And as you continue to trend ahead of schedule, does -- have your expectations changed at all in terms of the ultimate amount of cost savings that you might find available?\nMark Lashier: I'll touch a couple of those things, Ryan, at a high level, and then Kevin can drill into how the savings are distributed. But really Refining has performed very well. With respect to business transformation, we're seeing that. On the sustaining capital, I just want to make it clear that, that's really not an outright reduction in sustaining capital opportunities. It's becoming more efficient and more productive in how we're spending that, and we're going to continue to do that. You'll see really that impact in any of our capital projects that we look at going forward and we're not really capturing that. So, it's going to be a continuous process to look at how to get more and more efficient around sustaining capital. And we're not going to end this adventure when we get to the end of the defined program at the end of next year. We have outlined goals. We expect to continue to generate more savings on into 2024 and beyond. There are some things that we aren't even talking about today that require modest capital that will further enhance cost savings. So, we're instilling this as part of our culture, Ryan, and this is just going to be an ongoing march of continuous improvement, greater competitive edge. We've got 14,000 employees that want to win out there every day and they're highly motivated. Now, Kevin can give you a little insight to where you're going to see these numbers.\nKevin Mitchell: Yes. Thanks, Mark. So as we said, over $600 million run rate at the end of the quarter when you adjust for the fact that some of that's capital from an EBITDA standpoint, it's a north of $400 million run rate. And as we look at the detail in the quarter, we are seeing the proportionate share of that show up. It's not necessarily obvious from the externally reported data just because of the other things happening like consolidation of DCP into our results and so on. But of that $400 million-plus run rate, half of that or even a little bit more is showing up in Refining, which is where you would expect it to be, given that, that's the largest spend area in the company anyway. We're doing this through a combination of organization work. We completed that last year and we're seeing that benefit flow through this quarter between the sort of centralization of some of our activities across the organization. We've done a lot of work around our processes where we've been looking for ways to standardize and simplify the way we do work and, in some cases, just eliminate work. And so we've optimized the sort of overall business support model around all of those activities. And then we continue to work on our external spend, the third-party sourcing activities and leveraging the technologies that we really put the foundation in place with Advantage 66 in terms of the digital progress we have made in those areas. So, a lot of different elements to that, and we'll give more specifics this time next quarter as we have the half year results available.\nRyan Todd: Great. Thanks. And then maybe, I mean, you mentioned the importance of crude differentials to Refining profitability. Can you talk a little bit -- I mean, we've seen some pretty big moves on crude differentials widening and then coming in some Canadian heavy differentials narrowing. Can you talk about what you're seeing out there, what your outlook is for some of these crude differentials over the remainder of this year?\nBrian Mandell: Sure, Ryan, this is Brian. I think overall, as you as you pointed out, sours gained strength since the beginning of the year. And this strength was a number of factors you have now it's starting to weaken but you have new refinery capacity in China and in Kuwait. You have new US refinery additions on the Gulf Coast at Port Arthur and Galveston Bay. We had an unexpected OPEC cut, 1.1 million barrels. I don't know how much of that cut will actually happen. But that's a large cut. Chinese economy has been very strong. And you can see that economy coming back with more people driving, more people flying and then lack of sour barrels on the market. So combination of things that firm did initially and then the market started to weaken. I will point out that even though the market has come off since Q1 When you think about the sours, it's useful to remember that while they're weak, they're still weak, but relative to historical perspective, so if you look at Latin American sours like Castillo Amaya. They're still about $4 to $6 weaker than five-year averages. So those differentials are still weaker than historical although they firmed up some since Q1.\nRyan Todd: Okay, thank you.\nBrian Mandell: Thanks, Ryan.\nOperator: Manav Gupta with UBS. You may proceed. Your line is now open.\nManav Gupta: Guys, I just wanted to first touch base a little bit on the chemical earnings seen the strong rebound it really helps you out, I think do you have a $0.10 improvement in ethylene chain margin? So just trying to understand from the demand point on the chemical side? What are you seeing and should we expect a further recovery in chemical margins given the strong global demand?\nTim Roberts: Yes, Manav. This is Tim Roberts on the chemicals front which has got really our -- yes, we did benefit but then if it was really related to lower advantage feedstocks, ethane, propane, butane namely here in the United States, so you saw that advantage as those prices dropped. They became advanced in the crack and subsequently that showed up in the margin. The other side of that as well as lower natural gas prices, which of course is driving that whole structure. Also help with regard to utility cost. So yes, lower utility costs, the better feedstock advantage so it really helped in the quarter. You still got a supply issue and you have a demand issue and supply side fundamentally you've got more capacity that's coming on board and here in the United States. So you're going to have to work through that new capacity. The demand side is coming around. But you're still trying to work off a lot of inventory that happened as you had the supply chain disruptions out there in the marketplace. So you got to work through that inventory. And you also need to see China coming back stronger. As Brian mentioned, there are some strength there in travel, driving so some good things there needs to also show up in consumption on that side as well as production to meet global demand for products made out of polymers. So fundamentally, I think it's still going to take us a little bit of time to work through those two imbalances. We're not expecting anything to happen by the end of the year, there's going to be a significant bump. But I would throw one caveat is China is a significant impact in the market. If they're clicking on all cylinders, you can see things change rapidly. But at this point in time, we've got an inventory to work off, and we need to see some additional demand come back, especially from Asia.\nMark Lashier: Yes. And the only thing I would add, Manav, is CPChem's operations have been very strong. And I think their ability to outproduce their competitors is based on their strong operations and their solid cost position and they're delivering -- in a tough environment, they're delivering and outperforming.\nBrian Mandell: Yes. And I do think, Mark, exactly on that point though is that also their product slate is geared towards consumables. Durables are a little bit -- you're seeing it slow up a little bit on the durables front, and they don't have as much exposure to that.\nManav Gupta: Perfect, guys. My quick follow-up is if you can get some updates on your -- the progress you're making on your renewable diesels project, and hopefully, it starts up by year-end or early 2024.\nMark Lashier: Yes. Manav, we're making good progress on the project out at Rodeo. You heard me mention we shut down the Santa Maria facility, which is basically a feed prep unit for the Rodeo facility. The project is moving along. And there are lots of weather challenges out there, but the team has fought through it and dealt with it, and we're looking forward to having that on in the first quarter of next year. And I'll remind you that we've had a unit there operating and producing renewable diesel, what we call Unit 250 since April 2021. And I'll tell you what, it's exceeded both our operating expectations and our commercial expectations. And frankly, we're ready for more. We've got a great strategy out there and we are implementing and executing. And I'll let Brian touch on more of those details.\nBrian Mandell: Hi, Manav, just to follow up on Mark's point, the margins that we've seen at Unit 250, since we started the unit in Q1 of 2021, have been better than we premised every single quarter. And if you remember, we premised Unit 250 when running soybean oil feedstock only, but we've also run distillers corn oil, canola oil and pretreated used cooking oil, and we're actively blending feedstocks at the plant now. And in general -- just a general comment, we're seeing 3 times the volumes of low CI imports into the US now than last year. And we're also seeing more crushing capacity for vegetable oils. And then on the Marketing side of the business, we're selling almost all of our production through our branded and retail outlets directly to the end consumer. And we've also sold volumes to geographic locations that offer higher credit incentives than California for some of the feedstocks. And then finally, on the credit side, the LCFS programs are currently available in California, Oregon, Washington and Canada, as you know, but we're seeing other states proposing these programs, and in fact, Minnesota and Pennsylvania are two states that recently proposed an LCFS program. And then Mark, that's the kind of the commercial side. Mark mentioned the operating side, too. And on the operating side, we're seeing higher than premised yields of RD at greater than 95%. And we're also making 30% more renewable diesel production at the plant than we originally thought. So as Mark pointed out, we're looking forward to Rodeo Renewed and Rodeo Renewed will also have the flexibility of producing up to 10,000 barrels of renewable jet fuel with very little capital.\nManav Gupta: Those are all very encouraging updates. Thank you, guys.\nMark Lashier: Thanks, Manav.\nOperator: John Royall with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Your line is open.\nJohn Royall: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first one is on OpEx. So can you talk about OpEx trends in Refining into the second quarter? It's an item that you don't guide to, but 1Q ticks down, presumably on lower natural gas prices and despite higher maintenance. In 2Q, you'll have an even lower price presumably and less maintenance, and of course, your efforts around costs. So any color on expectations on the Refining OpEx side in 2Q and going forward?\nKevin Mitchell: John, this is Kevin. I would just say, I mean, your points are valid. We'll see -- we'll benefit from lower maintenance turnaround costs. And the natural gas prices are settling in at a pretty low level, and so you would expect to see a drop 1Q to 2Q. We're not giving specific guidance on the number. Now the other side of that is utilization will be higher, so some of the variable costs, you'll see a small impact from. But that's a good thing. But net-net, I think you should see a small -- a modest sequential decline.\nJohn Royall: Great. Thanks, Kevin. And then just on the share buyback in 1Q. You paced a bit ahead of your quarterly pace that you need to hit your longer-term guidance, but 2Q, does have an outflow from the acquisition. So should we be expecting a slowing in 2Q? And then further, if the environment were to continue to deteriorate from a cracks perspective, could that impact your pacing as well?\nKevin Mitchell: Yes. John, I wouldn't be too concerned about buyback pace being driven by the funding the buyback because we are at a $7 billion cash balance at the end of the first quarter. We had drawn -- we had issued $1.25 billion of notes but we have the term loan facility, which has not been drawn yet. And so we will draw on that as we fund the buy-in. So even all other things unchanged, we'll still have a healthy cash balance at that point in time. We're still generating cash. And so I think that our buyback pace should still be at a very respectable level in the second quarter. The balance sheet is in a good position. The operating cash flow is still strong. We've seen some weakening in Refining margins. But relative to our mid-cycle assumptions, the business is still looking really good. So I'm not too concerned about the buyback pace being impacted by the DCP buy-in.\nJohn Royall: Thank you.\nOperator: Matthew Blair with TPH. Please proceed. Your line is open.\nMatthew Blair: Hey, good morning. I was hoping you could expand a little bit on the dynamics in the Central Corridor in Q1 and then heading into Q2 as well. I think you ran at 89% utilization in Q1? Were Wood River and Borger still impacted by some of the issues from Q4. And then it looks like your margin capture was actually pretty good in Q1, 116%. Was that a function of wider WCS dips? And then, I guess, would we expect lower margin capture in Central Corridor heading into Q2 with narrower WCS dips?\nRich Harbison: Yes, this is Rich. So Central Corridor, I think the first thing to remember, the quarter-over-quarter analysis, fourth quarter, we had some pretty heavy headwinds with the Keystone shutdown and the winter storm effects, so that kind of sets the baseline. In the first quarter, we did see improved feedstock advantage running the heavy crudes. And more importantly, we are able to actually increase our crude slate percentage of these crudes that we were able to run. That impacted our market capture there as well. Now some of that was offset by the unplanned downtime impacts that carried on -- initiated fourth quarter, carried on into the first quarter. That unplanned downtime, primarily at Wood River was -- is now repaired and that facility is back up and running. We did slide one turnaround from the first quarter to the first half of the second quarter. That turnaround is now ramping up this week here. So we do expect the utilization rates to get back to higher levels for the WRB assets. There -- also, there was other some slight turnaround impacts as well to that first quarter results and a little bit lower market cracks also that played into that result. But that's how we see the Central Corridor kind of moving forward. We expect our utilization rates to turn back upwards.\nMatthew Blair: Great. Thanks. And then -- thanks for the comprehensive RD update. I just had one follow-up there. Could you talk about how the process is going for getting LCFS pathways? Some of your peers have mentioned that CARB is pretty backed up and it's taking longer than expected. As you bring on the full site in Q1 2024, would you expect to have all your LCFS pathways at that time, or is that a risk to the earnings contribution?\nRich Harbison: Well, we -- this is Rich again. We anticipated this flood of activity that would occur for -- to get these LCFS pathways approved. And we've been working diligently to get these approved even ahead of the start-up of the project. Any pathway that was approved for the Unit 250 operation is also applicable to the Rodeo Renewed project as well. So while we are concerned, I would say that there is a flood of applications to pathways. We think we're in a good position, and that should meter into our system, consistent with the start-up of the project.\nMatthew Blair: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Please proceed. Your line is open.\nPaul Cheng: Hey guys, good morning. Mark, just two questions. First, with the new California windfall profit penalty, that being passed, how does that change your view, or does it change your view about your California asset, both in the Refining and Marketing?\nMark Lashier: Yeah. Paul, that's been taking up a lot of intellectual capacity for, I think, the entire industry since that was rushed through. Before that, California was a tough place to manage Refining business, and I think this just makes it even a little more difficult. We're like everyone else, working hard to understand both the intended and unintended consequences of SBX1-2. And it certainly, at a fundamental level, creates more uncertainty, and it's going to make it more difficult for people to step up and invest in the supply chain that the consumers need, because even though you've got a lot of things coming over the hill to reduce demand, today, demand is strong, and you can see what happens when there's disruptions and the supply chain can be pretty tight there. So it's really tough for us to see how this new law is going to benefit the consumers at the end of the day.\nPaul Cheng: Mark, do you think you or the industry is going to challenge them in court, because I'm not sure how -- the industry has not been proven to have done anything wrong, why that will be slapped with a penalty?\nMark Lashier: Yeah. I think that it's logical to assume that industry associations will defend and protect the interests of the industries, and even individual companies may take action. That's certainly going to be up to each company. But from an industry perspective, I think that, that's an angle that's obviously being looked at.\nPaul Cheng : Okay. The second question, I think this is for Kevin. Kevin, you mentioned about in the Refining capture in your presentation, in the other corners is a very big positive. And I actually went back to the last, say, four, five quarters. I think mainly without exception, that column is always a negative, that is helping your margin instead of, say, benefiting like what we've seen in this quarter. I think you sort of talked a bit in your prepared remarks. Can you elaborate a little bit more than what that column really represent and why we have seen such an improvement and whether those is sustainable?\nKevin Mitchell: Yes. Paul, the big driver of the change this quarter, especially comparing to last quarter is around the product, clean product realizations or clean product differentials. And that was a particular negative item in the fourth quarter because the way we do our market crack for Atlantic Basin, we use a New York Harbor-based crack and the distillate crack or the jet crack was particularly strong in New York Harbor. It was weaker in Europe. And our capacity is approximately 50-50 between New York, Northeast and Europe. And so our Europe distillate production is causing a negative relative to that market. And so that pulled down the overall capture, and that shows up in other -- we had a little bit of a similar phenomenon going on in the West Coast as well, where we used an LA marker for the entire West Coast, which includes Northern California and the Pacific Northwest. And so when those markets are out of sync with each other, that can drive differentials in our actual product realizations, and that will show up in that other. That's the biggest single driver in there, Paul.\nJeff Dietert: And it was really negative impacts from -- in the fourth quarter.\nKevin Mitchell: Yes.\nOperator: Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Please proceed. Your line is now open.\nJason Gabelman: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. The first I wanted to ask was on kind of global Refining margin structure. There are stories out there that Asian plants are cutting runs while US cracks are still really healthy, $20 a barrel. So the question is, is that kind of a leading indicator that some of that weakness will ultimately make its way over into the US via lower margins, or is it an indication that the global margin environment could be at a floor because we're cutting around somewhere? Thanks.\nBrian Mandell: Hey, Jason, this is Brian. I'd say that, as you know, refineries in the US are advantaged relative to European and Asian refineries. And as margins in Asia and Europe have begun to fall, like you said, we're beginning to see runs trim, particularly in Korea, Taiwan and Europe. Also, China is heading this month into a turnaround season, which should, along with the low US inventories and the fact that we're stepping into summer driving season, begin to help strengthen, in our opinion, global margins.\nJason Gabelman: Okay, great. And my follow-up is on DCP, and I understand the deal isn't closed yet but just maybe wanted to get some early indications on progress. And specifically, I think part of the rationale for the deal was the combined Midstream platform of Phillips and DCP would attract more acreage to fill midstream assets within that platform and support growth there. And so the question is, are there any early indications that upstream companies do view this combined platform as more favorable to partner with, to support future growth for Philips? Thanks.\nTim Roberts: Yes, Jason. This is Tim Roberts. Yes, a couple of things. First thing on the second part of the deal, which is the buy-in and the public units. We're expecting to get that done here in 2Q, probably the latter portion of the second quarter, get that completed and get that behind us and increasing our economic interest of close to 87%. So, the next part, as far as rationale of the deal, what we found is that those that were integrated, wellhead, especially in the NGL space, wellhead to the market, we're more advantaged than those that maybe only participated in a portion of the value chain, i.e., GNP or the transportation logistics, fractionation exports. And so being able to go into a major and being able to sell -- the ability to get some wellhead all the way to the market is tough to do if you don't participate all the way there. So, bringing the GNP portion of DCP together with Phillips' portion, which was the transportation all the way to the dock, we think that created that infrastructure now that can go out and compete. Now, to your question, has that shown any interest or do we have any interest percolating out there from producers who like that? The answer is yes. We've had a lot of activity and a lot of engagement, as you would expect. People want options and more alternatives. And so we're bringing a viable option and alternative as well as the ability to get barrels out of the Houston Ship Channel and get them down to a less congested area down in the Freeport area. So, yes, it's been so far, so good. We just need to make sure we convert those into bottom-line.\nJason Gabelman: Great. That's really helpful. Thanks for the color.\nMark Lashier: Thank you, Jason.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mark Lashier for closing remarks.\nMark Lashier: Thank you, Sierra. I just want to recap a few key things. We had a strong start to the year. We had solid first quarter results, and we raised the dividend and increased our share repurchases, which are on pace to deliver our targeted return of $10 billion to $12 billion from July of 2022 to year-end 2024. We've made great progress in Refining with strong turnaround execution, improved market capture, and lower costs. In Midstream, just as Tim mentioned, we advanced Midstream integration and we remain confident in capturing $300 million of synergies. We expect to close on the buy-in this quarter. We're progressing our business transformation initiatives, and we're on track to achieve $1 billion of annual run rate savings by year-end. We remain committed to financial strength, disciplined capital allocation, and returning distributions to our shareholders. We look forward to updating you on our progress. Thank you for all your interest in Phillips 66.",

So you talked about what improvements that you're making on the ground and it's been a choppy 18 months in Refining from a utilization standpoint. So what conviction can you provide the market that we've turned the corner here? Thank you. Thanks. That's a lot of good color there. The second question is around the decline we've seen in crude prices. And that should manifest itself in different parts across the business, so I would love any perspective on how we can think about it from a modeling perspective. Specifically around Marketing, which tends to be a tailwind, capture rates, declining crude prices tends to help secondary products but also can be a headwind for working capital. So, if the crude price decline sustains, how should we think about that in terms of Q2 movements? Thank you. Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks, everyone."

            "name": "Brian Mandell",
            "content": "Well, let me start, Neil. This is Brian. Talking about marketing and probably noticed we had very strong marketing earnings in Q1. Pretty happy about that. You know that we have a geographic diverse portfolio with assets both here in the US and Western Europe, which is great. But we also market through a number of channels, wholesale, branded, and retail. And what we've been doing is trying to focus our sales on the higher margin parts of our business, particularly in retail. And we purchased retail in the past few years. In fact, in mid-2019, we had 50 retail JV stores in the US. Now, we have 1,000 retail JV stores in the US, and we also spent some time reimaging all of our stores to get higher margins in business. And I would also say that in the lubes business, that it's also performing quite strongly in both base oils and finished products. So, as you mentioned, as spot prices come off, that generally benefits the marketing business because marketing margins, generally, or marketing prices generally fall slower. Yes. Doug, this is Brian. Maybe I'll talk about kind of what we're seeing in the market. And that, it's kind of what we're seeing in our business as well. Although, our volumes are somewhat off, because of California flooding and because of the sub-maintenance. But generally, for US gasoline, we're seeing demand better than last year and we're seeing global demand about 3% better than last year. And we're now heading to gasoline driving season, as was mentioned, with kind of the lowest US gasoline inventories in almost 10 years. We're also seeing a very strong octane spreads of about a-third larger than they were first quarter of last year, $0.27. We would expect demand to hold better than last year, particularly given that the -- we have lower retail prices versus last year as well. On the diesel side, the year did start off weaker early in the year with warmer winter but has become to firm with Mid-Continent planning season. Currently we're seeing US diesel demand about 2.5% under last year. But that said, global distillate demand is a bit strong than last year and some countries are seeing particularly strong diesel demand. In Latin America, we're seeing demand at 10% over last year and China, 4% over last year. And finally, I'd say that, in the US, it's been bouncing back and forth between max diesel and max gasoline pad 5s EBIT and max gasoline since mid-February pretty much. Pad 1 signaled max gasoline in mid-April. And so this bodes well for helping the firm up distillate throughout the summer. Thanks, Doug. Sure, Ryan, this is Brian. I think overall, as you as you pointed out, sours gained strength since the beginning of the year. And this strength was a number of factors you have now it's starting to weaken but you have new refinery capacity in China and in Kuwait. You have new US refinery additions on the Gulf Coast at Port Arthur and Galveston Bay. We had an unexpected OPEC cut, 1.1 million barrels. I don't know how much of that cut will actually happen. But that's a large cut. Chinese economy has been very strong. And you can see that economy coming back with more people driving, more people flying and then lack of sour barrels on the market. So combination of things that firm did initially and then the market started to weaken. I will point out that even though the market has come off since Q1 When you think about the sours, it's useful to remember that while they're weak, they're still weak, but relative to historical perspective, so if you look at Latin American sours like Castillo Amaya. They're still about $4 to $6 weaker than five-year averages. So those differentials are still weaker than historical although they firmed up some since Q1. Thanks, Ryan. Yes. And I do think, Mark, exactly on that point though is that also their product slate is geared towards consumables. Durables are a little bit -- you're seeing it slow up a little bit on the durables front, and they don't have as much exposure to that. Hi, Manav, just to follow up on Mark's point, the margins that we've seen at Unit 250, since we started the unit in Q1 of 2021, have been better than we premised every single quarter. And if you remember, we premised Unit 250 when running soybean oil feedstock only, but we've also run distillers corn oil, canola oil and pretreated used cooking oil, and we're actively blending feedstocks at the plant now. And in general -- just a general comment, we're seeing 3 times the volumes of low CI imports into the US now than last year. And we're also seeing more crushing capacity for vegetable oils. And then on the Marketing side of the business, we're selling almost all of our production through our branded and retail outlets directly to the end consumer. And we've also sold volumes to geographic locations that offer higher credit incentives than California for some of the feedstocks. And then finally, on the credit side, the LCFS programs are currently available in California, Oregon, Washington and Canada, as you know, but we're seeing other states proposing these programs, and in fact, Minnesota and Pennsylvania are two states that recently proposed an LCFS program. And then Mark, that's the kind of the commercial side. Mark mentioned the operating side, too. And on the operating side, we're seeing higher than premised yields of RD at greater than 95%. And we're also making 30% more renewable diesel production at the plant than we originally thought. So as Mark pointed out, we're looking forward to Rodeo Renewed and Rodeo Renewed will also have the flexibility of producing up to 10,000 barrels of renewable jet fuel with very little capital. Hey, Jason, this is Brian. I'd say that, as you know, refineries in the US are advantaged relative to European and Asian refineries. And as margins in Asia and Europe have begun to fall, like you said, we're beginning to see runs trim, particularly in Korea, Taiwan and Europe. Also, China is heading this month into a turnaround season, which should, along with the low US inventories and the fact that we're stepping into summer driving season, begin to help strengthen, in our opinion, global margins."

            "name": "Rich Harbison",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Neil. This is Rich. Good question, and it's a number of things coming together here for us. Back in November, we outlined a number of opportunities to improve refining's performance. One of them was asset availability. Optimizing our turnaround durations, we've done a really good job executing those in a pretty heavy turnaround quarter for us, and that's a big component of allowing us to operate at that 90% crude unit utilization. It's really executing those turnarounds in a very high-performing status. On the Gulf Coast, our assets performed very well. They increased their crude flexibility that also allowed us to open up the utilization window and also allowed us to capture additional market as well, which you saw as well, the refining market capture rate of 93% was very good for the quarter as well. The key assets there are running the assets, focusing on what we can control in our business, Neil, and that is executing our turnarounds well. And we were able to do that coming in below guidance this year -- or this first quarter, continuing a trend that started last year with us coming in below guidance. Yes, I think that plays into the Refining capture rate of 93% for the quarter for us. Last year, we actually implemented 12 projects focused on market capture. The result of the impact of those projects is a 1.2% improvement in market capture with mid-cycle pricing assumptions. We implemented $225 million worth of projects, and the net return on those or the EBITDA generation for that investment was $158 million at mid-cycle pricing. 2023, we actually have additional 18 projects identified that are in flight, and the estimate is a 1.4% improvement in market capture. So, I think what you're seeing here is the plan we laid out in November is starting to really come to the bottom line of the performance of the Refining. Yes. On the Refining side, as you framed up the question, Neil, it's the flat price drop in accrued does reduce usually the secondary product losses. So they tend to tighten up a little bit there, so that has a positive impact for us in refining. But really, in refining, it's -- for us, it's the differential that we make our money off of on the light heavy sweet differential, and that's what we keep a close eye on. Kevin, any additional color to add to that? Yeah. So capture rate has a lot of moving parts to it so it's very difficult to predict that, the configuration component of it, secondary products, feedstock costs, others. But back to focusing on what we can control in our business, Doug, is we're seeing continued maturity in our reliability programs, and these saves are coming on a regular basis where we're catching issues early and preventing larger events from occurring. And also under asset availability, as I mentioned earlier, the turnaround execution is going very well for us. We've significantly improved our predictability on this. That takes a lot of leg work over time to improve those processes. And most importantly, even though we're hitting our turnaround execution goals, we are continuing to complete all the necessary work to operate the equipment safely and reliably over time. So that program is continuing to mature. We'll continue to see that. And that will allow our utilization rates to be available to operate in the market if the market is there. And then as you mentioned, the cost side of it is a big component of this as well. We have a clear path that we've identified reducing our costs by $500 million by the end of this year on a run rate basis. Over half of the $400 million run rate cost savings that Kevin mentioned in his comments are coming out of Refining. And that's good news for us. And probably more importantly, as Mark has indicated, our entire organization is uncovering opportunities to lower cost. We're being much more efficient in how we work and accepting the challenge to improve the business, which all should directionally support improved market capture and utilization. Yes, this is Rich. So Central Corridor, I think the first thing to remember, the quarter-over-quarter analysis, fourth quarter, we had some pretty heavy headwinds with the Keystone shutdown and the winter storm effects, so that kind of sets the baseline. In the first quarter, we did see improved feedstock advantage running the heavy crudes. And more importantly, we are able to actually increase our crude slate percentage of these crudes that we were able to run. That impacted our market capture there as well. Now some of that was offset by the unplanned downtime impacts that carried on -- initiated fourth quarter, carried on into the first quarter. That unplanned downtime, primarily at Wood River was -- is now repaired and that facility is back up and running. We did slide one turnaround from the first quarter to the first half of the second quarter. That turnaround is now ramping up this week here. So we do expect the utilization rates to get back to higher levels for the WRB assets. There -- also, there was other some slight turnaround impacts as well to that first quarter results and a little bit lower market cracks also that played into that result. But that's how we see the Central Corridor kind of moving forward. We expect our utilization rates to turn back upwards. Well, we -- this is Rich again. We anticipated this flood of activity that would occur for -- to get these LCFS pathways approved. And we've been working diligently to get these approved even ahead of the start-up of the project. Any pathway that was approved for the Unit 250 operation is also applicable to the Rodeo Renewed project as well. So while we are concerned, I would say that there is a flood of applications to pathways. We think we're in a good position, and that should meter into our system, consistent with the start-up of the project."

            "name": "Mark Lashier",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. During the first quarter, we delivered strong financial and operating results. We had adjusted earnings of $2 billion or $4.21 per share, a record first quarter. In Refining, we successfully executed major planned maintenance and ran above industry average rates. Currently, our refineries are running at high utilization to meet demand and capture market opportunities as we enter summer driving season. We returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In February, we raised our dividend 8% to $1.05 per share, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to a secure, competitive and growing dividend. Our integrated diversified portfolio provides us with the ability to generate strong cash flow, return substantial cash to shareholders and invest in the most attractive projects. We remain committed to operating excellence and disciplined capital allocation as we execute our strategy. Recently, our Midstream, Refining and Chemicals business were recognized for their exemplary safety performance in 2022. For the third consecutive year, Midstream was awarded the American Petroleum Institute's Distinguished Pipeline Safety Award for Large Operators. This is the highest recognition by API for the midstream industry. The American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers recognized five of our refineries for outstanding safety performance. Sweeny Refinery received the Distinguished Safety Award for the second year in a row. Bayway, Borger, Santa Maria and Ponca City refineries also earned safety awards. In Chemicals, four CPChem facilities were recognized with AFPM Safety Awards. We're honored to receive these awards and would like to recognize our employees' commitment to operating excellence. Congratulations to all the people working at these facilities. Well done. We started the year off well and continue to advance strategic priorities from our Investor Day late last year. Slide 4 summarizes progress toward our targets to create value and increase shareholder distributions. Since July of 2022, we've returned $3.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We're on track to meet our target to return $10 billion to $12 billion over the 10-quarter period between July 2022 through year-end 2024. We had strong refining operational performance in the first quarter and market capture increased to 93%. In Midstream, we're advancing our NGL wellhead to market strategy. We recently achieved an integration milestone with the transition of DCP Midstream employees to Phillips 66, enabling continued synergy capture. In anticipation of the DCP buy-in, we issued bonds and executed a delayed draw term loan. We expect to close on the transaction by the end of the second quarter. We're advancing our business transformation initiatives, and we're on track to deliver $1 billion of annual run rate savings by year-end. Next quarter, we'll provide a more detailed update on the cost savings achieved through the first half of the year. In Refining, we're converting our San Francisco refinery into one of the world's largest renewables fuels facilities. The conversion will substantially reduce emissions from the facility and produce lower carbon intensity transportation fuels. In February, we safely shut down the Santa Maria facility, as we continued to advance the project. We expect to begin commercial operations in the first quarter of 2024. Upon completion, Rodeo will have over 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuels production capacity. In Chemicals, CPChem is pursuing a portfolio of high-return projects, enhancing its asset base and optimizing its existing operations. This includes construction of a second world-scale 1-hexene unit in Old Ocean, Texas and the expansion of propylene splitting capacity at its Cedar Bayou facility. Both projects are expected to start up in the second half of 2023. CPChem and Qatar Energy are jointly building world-scale petrochemical facilities on the US Gulf Coast and in Ras Laffan, Qatar, with start-up at each facility expected in 2026. We look forward to continuing to update you on our strategic priorities. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results. Yes, Neil, this is Mark. I'll just come over with a little bit relating that back to the Investor Day commitments, that we made those commitments based on the groundwork that had been underway for some time, the fairly small projects that we were going through, the blocking and tackling that we were taking on, and we're really starting to see those come to fruition now. And we're pleased with what we're seeing out there. And really, I think the biggest impact of business transformation has been the hearts and minds of our employees. They are all in. Wasn't that way a year ago when first started the initiative, but now they see the things that they're doing, the hard work that they're doing are starting to impact their results and turnarounds, starting to impact the operational effectiveness of the plants as well as they're seeing it in the cost. And that's just been a very virtuous cycle for our employees. There's a stronger competitive edge out there and they really want to own their future now. Thanks, Neil. Great question, Doug. I'll let Rich address the capture rate, and I'll come back in on the cost-cutting progress. Yes. Thanks, Rich. Doug, we've really come a long way on the business transformation efforts. It was a heavy lift, a major focus really for the last 18 months or so, and we're seeing great progress. We beat our goal of $500 million by year-end of 2022, and we're accelerating right into 2023, hitting more than $600 million in the first quarter. And as I mentioned in our comments, we'll take you on a tour of those realized savings at the second quarter call. And we're excited the organization is excited. We've made major changes in the structure of the organization that eliminates a lot of inefficiencies. We've got feedback loops that we put in place to make sure that these savings are real and that they're sustainable. And we're seeing it and people have bought in. We're using some really state-of-the-art tools to make sure that we're capturing what we think we're capturing and delivering those results to the bottom line. So it's just an incredible change in the organization that we've witnessed over the last six or eight months as things start to be realized. I'll touch a couple of those things, Ryan, at a high level, and then Kevin can drill into how the savings are distributed. But really Refining has performed very well. With respect to business transformation, we're seeing that. On the sustaining capital, I just want to make it clear that, that's really not an outright reduction in sustaining capital opportunities. It's becoming more efficient and more productive in how we're spending that, and we're going to continue to do that. You'll see really that impact in any of our capital projects that we look at going forward and we're not really capturing that. So, it's going to be a continuous process to look at how to get more and more efficient around sustaining capital. And we're not going to end this adventure when we get to the end of the defined program at the end of next year. We have outlined goals. We expect to continue to generate more savings on into 2024 and beyond. There are some things that we aren't even talking about today that require modest capital that will further enhance cost savings. So, we're instilling this as part of our culture, Ryan, and this is just going to be an ongoing march of continuous improvement, greater competitive edge. We've got 14,000 employees that want to win out there every day and they're highly motivated. Now, Kevin can give you a little insight to where you're going to see these numbers. Yes. And the only thing I would add, Manav, is CPChem's operations have been very strong. And I think their ability to outproduce their competitors is based on their strong operations and their solid cost position and they're delivering -- in a tough environment, they're delivering and outperforming. Yes. Manav, we're making good progress on the project out at Rodeo. You heard me mention we shut down the Santa Maria facility, which is basically a feed prep unit for the Rodeo facility. The project is moving along. And there are lots of weather challenges out there, but the team has fought through it and dealt with it, and we're looking forward to having that on in the first quarter of next year. And I'll remind you that we've had a unit there operating and producing renewable diesel, what we call Unit 250 since April 2021. And I'll tell you what, it's exceeded both our operating expectations and our commercial expectations. And frankly, we're ready for more. We've got a great strategy out there and we are implementing and executing. And I'll let Brian touch on more of those details. Thanks, Manav. Yeah. Paul, that's been taking up a lot of intellectual capacity for, I think, the entire industry since that was rushed through. Before that, California was a tough place to manage Refining business, and I think this just makes it even a little more difficult. We're like everyone else, working hard to understand both the intended and unintended consequences of SBX1-2. And it certainly, at a fundamental level, creates more uncertainty, and it's going to make it more difficult for people to step up and invest in the supply chain that the consumers need, because even though you've got a lot of things coming over the hill to reduce demand, today, demand is strong, and you can see what happens when there's disruptions and the supply chain can be pretty tight there. So it's really tough for us to see how this new law is going to benefit the consumers at the end of the day. Yeah. I think that it's logical to assume that industry associations will defend and protect the interests of the industries, and even individual companies may take action. That's certainly going to be up to each company. But from an industry perspective, I think that, that's an angle that's obviously being looked at. Thank you, Jason. Thank you, Sierra. I just want to recap a few key things. We had a strong start to the year. We had solid first quarter results, and we raised the dividend and increased our share repurchases, which are on pace to deliver our targeted return of $10 billion to $12 billion from July of 2022 to year-end 2024. We've made great progress in Refining with strong turnaround execution, improved market capture, and lower costs. In Midstream, just as Tim mentioned, we advanced Midstream integration and we remain confident in capturing $300 million of synergies. We expect to close on the buy-in this quarter. We're progressing our business transformation initiatives, and we're on track to achieve $1 billion of annual run rate savings by year-end. We remain committed to financial strength, disciplined capital allocation, and returning distributions to our shareholders. We look forward to updating you on our progress. Thank you for all your interest in Phillips 66."

            "name": "Kevin Mitchell",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark, and hello, everyone. Starting with an overview on Slide 5, we summarized our financial results for the first quarter. Adjusted earnings were $2 billion or $4.21 per share. The $12 million decrease in the fair value of our investment in NOVONIX reduced earnings per share by $0.02. We generated operating cash flow of $1.2 billion, including a working capital use of $1.3 billion and cash distributions from equity affiliates of $369 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $378 million, including $228 million for growth projects. We returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through $486 million of dividends and $800 million of share repurchases. We ended the quarter with 459 million shares outstanding. Moving to Slide 6. This slide highlights the change in adjusted results by segment from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. During the period, adjusted earnings increased $66 million, mostly due to higher results in Chemicals and lower corporate costs, partially offset by a decrease in Marketing and Specialties. Slide 7 shows our Midstream results. First quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $678 million compared with $674 million in the previous quarter. Transportation contributed adjusted pre-tax income of $270 million, up $33 million from the prior quarter. The increase was primarily driven by seasonally lower operating costs. NGL and Other adjusted pre-tax income was $420 million compared to $448 million in the fourth quarter. The decrease was mainly due to the impact of declining commodity prices in the gathering and processing business. The fractionators at the Sweeny Hub continued to run above nameplate capacity, averaging 554,000 barrels per day. The Freeport LPG Export facility loaded a record 282,000 barrels per day in the first quarter. Turning to Chemicals on slide eight. Chemicals had first quarter adjusted pre-tax income of $198 million compared with $52 million in the previous quarter. The increase was mainly due to improved margins from lower feedstock costs, higher sales volumes and decreased utility costs. The industry polyethylene margin increased by $0.10 to $0.17 per pound during the quarter. Global O&P utilization was 94% for the quarter. Turning to Refining on slide nine. Refining first quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $1.6 billion, down $18 million from the fourth quarter. The impact of lower volumes from turnaround activities was mostly offset by higher realized margins and lower utility costs. Our realized margins increased by 5% to $20.72 per barrel, while the composite 3:2:1 market crack decreased by 5%. In the first quarter, turnaround costs were $234 million, crude utilization was 90% and clean product yield was 83%. Slide 10 covers market capture. The market crack for the first quarter was $22.39 per barrel compared to $23.58 per barrel in the fourth quarter. Realized margin was $20.72 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 93%, up from 84% in the previous quarter. Market capture is impacted by the configuration of our refineries. We have a higher distillate yield and a lower gasoline yield than the 3:2:1 market indicator. During the first quarter, the distillate crack decreased $19 per barrel and the gasoline crack increased $7 per barrel. Losses from secondary products of $2.56 per barrel were $1.03 per barrel lower than the previous quarter due to falling crude prices. Our feedstock advantage of $2.34 per barrel was $2.37 per barrel improved compared to the fourth quarter, primarily due to running more advantaged crudes. The Other category improved realized margins by $2.19 per barrel. This category includes freight costs, clean product realizations and inventory impacts. First quarter was $1.73 per barrel higher than the previous quarter, primarily due to improved clean product realizations. Moving to slide 11. Marketing and Specialties had a solid quarter, reflecting stronger-than-typical first quarter margins. Adjusted first quarter pre-tax income was $426 million compared with $539 million in the prior quarter, mainly due to lower international marketing margins. On slide 12, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted pre-tax costs of $248 million; $32 million lower than the prior quarter. The improvement was mainly due to higher interest income and recognition of a transfer tax on a foreign entity reorganization in the fourth quarter of 2022. Slide 13 shows the change in cash during the first quarter. We started the quarter with a $6.1 billion cash balance. Cash from operations was $2.5 billion, excluding working capital. There was a working capital use of $1.3 billion, mainly reflecting an increase in inventory, partially offset by a decrease in our net accounts receivable position. During the quarter, we issued $1.25 billion of senior unsecured notes in support of the pending buy-in of DCP Midstream's publicly held common units. We funded $378 million of capital spending and returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our ending cash balance was $7 billion. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items for the second quarter. In Chemicals, we expect the second quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the second quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the mid-90s and turnaround expenses to be between $100 million and $120 million. We anticipate second quarter Corporate and Other costs coming between $260 million and $290 million, reflecting higher interest costs. In March, we issued senior unsecured notes of $1.25 billion and entered into a delayed draw term loan of up to $1.5 billion in support of the DCP Midstream buy-in transaction, which is expected to close during the second quarter. Now we will open the line for questions. Yeah. Neil, just on the working capital impact. As you've highlighted, with the declining prices, we will have a working capital hurt because we're in a net payables position. So you think about a system that's essentially 2 million barrels per day and a longer duration on the payables outstanding than on the receivables. So the approximate rule of thumb is somewhere in the order of $40 million to $50 million of working capital hurt per $1 of price reduction. And that assumes that the crude and the products move together, and the crack stays at the same level. But as you know, also, there's a lot of other moving parts in working capital, what's happening to inventories and so on. But as a rule of thumb, simple rule of thumb, you can use that $40 million to $50 million per $1 movement in price. Yes. Thanks, Mark. So as we said, over $600 million run rate at the end of the quarter when you adjust for the fact that some of that's capital from an EBITDA standpoint, it's a north of $400 million run rate. And as we look at the detail in the quarter, we are seeing the proportionate share of that show up. It's not necessarily obvious from the externally reported data just because of the other things happening like consolidation of DCP into our results and so on. But of that $400 million-plus run rate, half of that or even a little bit more is showing up in Refining, which is where you would expect it to be, given that, that's the largest spend area in the company anyway. We're doing this through a combination of organization work. We completed that last year and we're seeing that benefit flow through this quarter between the sort of centralization of some of our activities across the organization. We've done a lot of work around our processes where we've been looking for ways to standardize and simplify the way we do work and, in some cases, just eliminate work. And so we've optimized the sort of overall business support model around all of those activities. And then we continue to work on our external spend, the third-party sourcing activities and leveraging the technologies that we really put the foundation in place with Advantage 66 in terms of the digital progress we have made in those areas. So, a lot of different elements to that, and we'll give more specifics this time next quarter as we have the half year results available. John, this is Kevin. I would just say, I mean, your points are valid. We'll see -- we'll benefit from lower maintenance turnaround costs. And the natural gas prices are settling in at a pretty low level, and so you would expect to see a drop 1Q to 2Q. We're not giving specific guidance on the number. Now the other side of that is utilization will be higher, so some of the variable costs, you'll see a small impact from. But that's a good thing. But net-net, I think you should see a small -- a modest sequential decline. Yes. John, I wouldn't be too concerned about buyback pace being driven by the funding the buyback because we are at a $7 billion cash balance at the end of the first quarter. We had drawn -- we had issued $1.25 billion of notes but we have the term loan facility, which has not been drawn yet. And so we will draw on that as we fund the buy-in. So even all other things unchanged, we'll still have a healthy cash balance at that point in time. We're still generating cash. And so I think that our buyback pace should still be at a very respectable level in the second quarter. The balance sheet is in a good position. The operating cash flow is still strong. We've seen some weakening in Refining margins. But relative to our mid-cycle assumptions, the business is still looking really good. So I'm not too concerned about the buyback pace being impacted by the DCP buy-in. Yes. Paul, the big driver of the change this quarter, especially comparing to last quarter is around the product, clean product realizations or clean product differentials. And that was a particular negative item in the fourth quarter because the way we do our market crack for Atlantic Basin, we use a New York Harbor-based crack and the distillate crack or the jet crack was particularly strong in New York Harbor. It was weaker in Europe. And our capacity is approximately 50-50 between New York, Northeast and Europe. And so our Europe distillate production is causing a negative relative to that market. And so that pulled down the overall capture, and that shows up in other -- we had a little bit of a similar phenomenon going on in the West Coast as well, where we used an LA marker for the entire West Coast, which includes Northern California and the Pacific Northwest. And so when those markets are out of sync with each other, that can drive differentials in our actual product realizations, and that will show up in that other. That's the biggest single driver in there, Paul. Yes."

Welcome, everyone, to our third quarter earnings call. The strength of our results in a challenging refining market demonstrates the benefits of our differentiated downstream portfolio. During the quarter, we continued to execute on our strategic priorities and delivered strong operating performance. Since July 2022, we have returned $12.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We're approaching our $13 billion to $15 billion target. In refining, we've reduced our cost by $1 per barrel and we continue to run our system well. The improvement in clean product yield reflects our investments in high return low capital projects. We continue to evaluate all of our assets as part of our strategic priorities and ongoing portfolio optimization. We recently agreed to sell our 49% interest in a Switzerland-based retail joint venture for approximately $1.24 billion. Our asset dispositions are now expected to exceed the $3 billion target. We plan to use the cash proceeds to support our strategic priorities including returns to shareholders and debt reduction. During the quarter, we achieved the targets on two of the six priorities ahead of schedule. First, we have accomplished our $1.4 billion business transformation cost reduction target. We've driven a permanent shift in the way we work and we remain diligent with a culture of continuous improvement. Our employees have done an incredible job delivering on this commitment and the results are clear as Kevin will cover later. Secondly, we achieved our $400 million synergy target across our NGL wellhead-to-market value chain. This brings the total uplift in mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA to $1.4 billion from acquiring and successfully integrating DCP Midstream. Slide 4, shows the growth of our Midstream business. We have advanced our wellhead-to-market strategy through organic projects and strategic transactions that provided significant synergies and strong returns. Our Sweeny Hub became the second largest NGO fractionation hub in the U.S. with the completion of Frac 4 in 2022. The DCP transactions strengthened this competitive position by fully integrating our value chain. In the third quarter of 2024, we further expanded the business with the acquisition of Pinnacle Midstream. We also approved the construction of an adjacent processing plant with startup expected in mid-2025. On a trailing 12-month basis, Midstream's adjusted EBITDA has increased to $3.7 billion from $2.1 billion three years ago. In addition, Midstream adjusted EBITDA is ahead of 2024 guidance despite weaker natural gas and NGL prices. The stable cash generation from this business covers the company's dividend and our sustaining capital. We continue to high grade our portfolio and capitalize on our growth platform to generate strong returns and significant free cash flow. Before I wrap up my opening comments, I want to acknowledge our previously announced plans to cease operations at the Los Angeles refinery in the fourth quarter of 2025. The uncertainty of the long-term sustainability of the refinery and market dynamics were key factors in this decision. We are evaluating the future use of the property and will work with the State of California to continue to supply transportation fuels to meet customer demand. As we work towards decommissioning, we're grateful for our employees continued focus on safety and operating excellence. We are committed to treating all of our employees and contractors fairly and respectfully throughout the process. We continue to deliver on our strategic priorities and targets. I look forward to providing an update on the next earnings call. Now, over to Kevin.\nKevin Mitchell: Thank you, Mark. Slide 5 provides cost detail at the total company level through the end of the third quarter compared to the same period of 2022. We have supported growth while mitigating inflationary impacts through business transformation and synergy capture. Through the first nine months of the year, we have realized approximately $700 million in cost reductions including our share of WRB costs. In addition, we have reduced logistics spend by $200 million, these costs flow through gross margin. We lowered sustaining capital spend and continue to prioritize safe and reliable operations. Slide 6, shows the business transformation reduction to refining cost per barrel. Adjusted controllable costs excluding turnarounds are $5.84 per barrel year-to-date; we have eliminated $1 per barrel of costs, achieving our target ahead of schedule. Slide 7, covers key financial metrics. Earnings were $346 million. Adjusted earnings were $859 million, or $2.04 per share. The adjusted results exclude special items, which include a legal accrual in the third quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $1.1 billion and returned $1.3 billion to shareholders. I will now move to Slide 8, to cover the segment results. Adjusted earnings decreased $125 million compared with the prior quarter. Midstream results decreased mostly due to seasonal maintenance costs and lower equity earnings, reflecting the sale of our interest in the Rockies Express pipeline. These decreases were partially offset by higher margins on LPG Exports. In Chemicals, results increased mainly due to higher polyethylene chain margins and lower costs. Lower refining results primarily reflect weaker crack spreads. Capture of the new indicator was 92% in line with the previous quarter. In addition, the plan to cease operations at our Los Angeles refinery resulted in the acceleration of depreciation. The impact in the third quarter was $25 million. Going forward, we expect approximately $230 million per quarter of additional depreciation through the fourth quarter of 2025. Marketing and specialties results were higher, mostly due to seasonally stronger margins. In renewable fuels, results decreased due to lower realized margins. The Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex produced 44,000 barrels per day of renewable fuels during the third quarter. Slide 9, shows the change in cash flow. Cash from operations, excluding working capital was $1.5 billion, supported by the stability of our Midstream and Marketing and Specialties businesses. Working capital was a use of $381 million, mainly reflecting the impact of falling commodity prices. In July, we acquired Pinnacle Midstream for $567 million. Also during the quarter, we received cash proceeds of approximately $200 million from the sale of non-core midstream assets. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, in Chemicals, we expect the global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low to mid-90s and turnaround expense to be between $125 million and $135 million. Full year turnaround expense is now expected to be $485 million to $495 million. This is a reduction of more than $100 million from our original guidance. We anticipate corporate and other costs to come in between $300 million and $330 million. Now, we will open the line for questions, after which Mark will wrap up the call.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from John Royall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nJohn Royall: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So my first question is just on your decision to shutter your remaining conventional capacity in California. Can you just talk about what went into that decision and how much did recent regulatory changes play into that decision? Or was this something that you had planned even after that?\nMark Lashier: Good morning, John. As we've stated in our strategic priorities, that we will do an ongoing evaluation of all of our assets. And so the LA decision really was part of that. And the Los Angeles refinery has been under significant market pressure. And the refinery, if you think back historically was originally designed to process in State California crude production and that's declined by about 75%. So the continued outlook in California in the face of declining diesel and gasoline demand was a pretty tough one. And so when we took that given outlook for the markets and also factor in California's stated policy to move away from fossil fuels, we expected California to be a pretty challenging refining market going forward. And we also have the typical maintenance and regulatory spending that we face and that's only going up. And so there are a lot of factors that go into these decisions and these decisions are only made after we do an exhaustive review of all the alternatives. And that exhaustive review led us to idle the refinery as we announced earlier this month. And so it wasn't any kind of knee jerk reaction in the face of any policy changes in California. This has been a long-term analysis.\nJohn Royall: Great. Thank you, Mark. And then my follow-ups on the balance sheet and maybe you could just talk about your outlook for the balance sheet and perhaps where you think you could finish the year on leverage following the sale of the Swiss business and potentially the Germany and Austria business and recognizing there are a lot of moving pieces around working capital and some other things. But just any guidance on where you could finish the year on the balance sheet?\nKevin Mitchell: Yes, John, it's Kevin. So certainly expect to finish the year with a stronger cash or net debt position than where we are currently. And that will be partly reflected by proceeds from asset dispositions, but the bulk of that is going to be 2025. So we expect the Swiss business, that transaction to close in the first quarter of next year, and the Germany, Austria retail business, we're still in active negotiations around that, and so that will be a 2025 item as well. But nonetheless, the proceeds from dispositions give us a lot more added flexibility as we think about balance sheet priorities, continuing to return cash to shareholders and also investment in the business. And just as a reminder, from a capital allocation standpoint, the first priority is sustaining capital that's about $1 billion per year. The second priority is the dividend, that's approximately $2 billion per year. And everything after that is available for investing in the company and growth, returning cash to shareholders, of which the dividend obviously is a part of that, but share repurchases and then the balance sheet and debt reduction. So we're a bit off of our target leverage metric, and we expect to get closer to that. It'll take a little while when you look at the different components of the debt and the equity on that, but we expect to be moving our way towards that objective.\nOperator: The next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger, please, go ahead.\nRoger Read: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Kevin, I have two questions for you here. I'll just throw them together. One is, we think about the stated savings, the $1.4 billion on the synergies, the -- or, I'm sorry, on the overall cost reduction plan, the $0.4 billion from the synergies with DCP offset by the inflation that's in Slides 5 and 6, I think, which it sounds like you're using a standard CPI there. I just would like to maybe dig into a little bit of how do we look at those two moving parts, one, pretty substantial savings, two, inflation that's out there, you mentioned it comes out of the operating costs, but those can also be impacted by seasonality, by maintenance and so forth. But how we should really look at that on a net basis and what's the maybe inflationary pressure going forward?\nKevin Mitchell: Yes. I think as you look at that, and as you point out, we highlighted the inflationary impact; we also highlight the market impact. And you could say those are two versions of similar factors. They're market driven; they're outside of our control. One of them has been a headwind for the last couple of years. The other one has been a tailwind for us with lower natural gas prices, primarily. And so what we're trying to focus on, as you would expect are those things that are directly within our control and that's reflected in that cost reduction bar on the chart. On market, I wouldn't be completely dismissive of that being outside of our control because we are also, as part of our cost reduction initiatives focused on energy reduction in terms of from a volume quantity standpoint. And so that is something that we're very focused on as well. It's also consistent with our environmental GHG objectives around that. But on a go-forward basis, I think the worst of the inflationary pressures are behind us and we'd expect that that has somewhat normalized on a go-forward basis. So lesser headwinds than we have experienced over the last couple of years.\nRoger Read: And then, just as a follow-up that, the $100 million reduction in the turnaround costs, is any of that related to the LA issue, the shutdown, or is that just outperformance during the year?\nRich Harbison: Hey Roger, this is Rich. There's really two key factors in that $100 million reduction in our outlook. Half of its attributed to this enhanced inspection process that we've been putting in place over the last several years. It's allowed us to actually extend the intervals between turnarounds. So some of that data was coming in this year on some planned turnarounds, and after we had a chance to evaluate it, we were able to defer those turnarounds. That's roughly half of that $100 million. And the other half of the $100 million is the organization's execution of the work. They've -- we've actually gotten much more efficient at our execution through a number of initiatives that we put in place with turnarounds and we're seeing the fruits of that labor come through now, so.\nOperator: The next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil, please go ahead.\nNeil Mehta: Yes. Good morning, team. Just want to follow-up on the comments around balance sheet and capital allocation. And you guys have made a tremendous amount of progress in returning capital to shareholders via buyback and dividends. But how do you think about the pace of that going forward and what appears to be a softer commodity environment?\nKevin Mitchell: Yes, Neil, it's -- for the last year-and-a-half or longer, we have been very focused on the commitment that we put out there, the $13 billion to $15 billion target, and that has somewhat informed our decisions around the pace of buybacks. As we get to the end of that, I think we will move to more of a, in excess of 50% of operating cash flow being the so return to shareholder metric. We talked about that I think on the last call that of the go-forward assumption around this is 50% or more of cash from operations being returned to shareholders. I think that's a good way to think about this as you model out into 2025 from -- for that metric.\nNeil Mehta: Okay. That's helpful. And then we saw very solid strength in the Chemicals business relative to some of your peers this quarter. And then marketing ticked up, I would imagine some of that's just because crude softened at the end of the quarter. But can you talk about those two businesses and the outlook as we think about the sequential into fourth quarter and early next year?\nMark Lashier: Well, Neil, I'll take the chemicals side of that. And we've seen CPChem's performance strong. They're able to operate at high rates when others have had to cut back because of costs. I think that they don't have any operation or much operations exposure in Europe, which is beneficial. And they've got their advantaged feedstock position, low cost ethane in two locations in the world that they've really been able to lean into. You do see some seasonal softness coming in this time of year, which is pretty typical. And that with lower crude prices makes naphtha producers the floor a little bit impacted there as well. But on the long-term, we see continued improvement in the macro for chemicals. They're coming out of that trough of a year or so ago; they continue to make good progress. They continue to see demand from their perspective and their ability to capture the market increasing and we see that going forward.\nBrian Mandell: Hey Neil, this is Brian. On the marketing side, Q3 is typically marketing's strongest quarter and during the quarter marketing had improved margins in the U.S. across both wholesale and franchise channels, driven as you mentioned by falling spot prices. We also saw some stronger volumes additionally in the lubricants business base oil margins also improved with falling feedstock prices. But going forward, expectations for the M&S segment in Q4 are just a seasonal pullback in earnings consistent with what we call mid-cycle Q4 earnings.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Ryan, your line is now open.\nRyan Todd: Great. Thanks. Maybe I think one for me, I guess, on the refining side, you've made a lot of progress in terms of reducing cost structure, improving reliability and utilization rate and even improving capture rate of your refining business. But refining earnings are still struggling in the current environment. I think they're struggling for everybody. But as you -- we're clearly below mid-cycle margins right now. But it still seems like you're a little ways from achieving your target for the refining business even in a mid-cycle environment. I guess, any thoughts on where do you think you are in terms of progress there and what still -- what should we still be looking for over the next 12 months in order to drive the kind of the next leg of improvement and refining profitability?\nMark Lashier: Yes, Ryan, this is Mark. I'll just comment at a high level that I do believe that we're still on that journey. We've pretty dramatically enhanced our cost position and we'll continue to do so. We are focused on being competitive and continuing that journey. And we've also been very deliberate in just working away at these small projects that have quick payouts that enhance our ability to capture the market. And we've got -- in our strategic priorities, we've got things that we see in 2025, things that we see happening by 2026. And so we've got a long list of things that we can continue to work away at in refining to enhance our competitive position and increase our ability to capture value from the marketplace.\nRich Harbison: Yes, so maybe I'll just add a little more color to that. This is Rich. So we had three primary improvement focuses in refining. First, is the cost reduction and that's a slog, right? It's getting in the mud pit, digging it out and pulling out these expenses that are very sticky, takes a lot of organizational effort to do that. I'm very happy with the organization's performance on this. And we've exceeded our expectations, original expectations, and now we've removed over $600 million of cost out of the cost profile for refining. So we're not declaring infinite success with that. We will move to what I'll call a continuous improvement mode on the cost. But I will shift the organization's attention now to the earnings per barrel focus here as we move into the future. And that is taking advantage of what Mark was talking about, which are these small capital projects with high return and we will continue to execute those. We still have a laundry list of those projects to go. But there is also efforts that we utilize our existing equipment and making sure that we are extracting the highest level of value out of that. We see some opportunities across the system. We are going to focus on that and continue to extract that value out. And then of course, Brian's organization is working diligently. This integrated model that we have is really about extracting the value out of the entire value chain. And the commercial organization is the glue that keeps that together. And we've got a lot of number of initiatives that we're working on, on that front. You add all these up; they're well over $1 billion of impact to our earnings at mid-cycle pricing. So I'm very confident that when we get to mid -- back to mid-cycle pricing scenarios that you'll see the performance of the refining organization hit the $4 billion to $5 billion range of earnings.\nRyan Todd: Great. Thank you. And then maybe one more, as we look at renewable diesel and we think about the path to improvement there, can you maybe walk through how you think about the path to improvement in 2025 both in terms of the broader market? What are some of the levers or kind of moving pieces that you think drive improvement in terms of the macro backdrop and then maybe Rodeo specifically? What are things that you're looking to do that will drive improvement in terms of the profitability there?\nBrian Mandell: Sure. This is Brian, Ryan. Maybe to start kind of where we are today, we're still in startup mode for the Renewable segment. So I think we've had some startup costs. We're also running higher or lower CI, but we're also running some higher CI now in Q4. I think if you think about renewable diesel margins going into Q4 and beyond, we think margins are going to strengthen for a number of reasons, feedstock prices remain depressed. There are a number of plants that continue to struggle. Some of the RD production is going to be converted into renewable jet production like some of our competitors on the Gulf Coast and we will do as well. There are less imports into the U.S. tighter West Coast car diesel market with refinery production issues. We've been seen some renewable diesel from our competitors come from the Gulf Coast into the West Coast and then just the stronger credit markets with the tightening of those credit markets and the disincentivizing of biodiesel production. So all those things together I think will drive renewable diesel margins stronger as we go-forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from Manav Gupta with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nManav Gupta: Good morning. I wanted to focus a little bit on your central corridor earnings. You were up $65 million quarter-over-quarter or 26% quarter-over-quarter. That is something we haven't seen in the Mid-Con region. It's a very strong help us understand what were the factors helping you out. And we understand you have very good assets over there, but generally talk to us what really helped you out to deliver such a strong performance in Central corridor.\nRich Harbison: Hey Manav, it's Rich. Thanks for pointing that out. We're very happy with the performance of the Central Corridor operation. There's a couple of factors here that played into the outperform. One of the -- margins were higher, which increased mainly due to a favorable impact on our inventory hedges. So with the WTI price falling quarter-over-quarter, that hedge was a positive tailwind for us on that. We also had the benefits of the WCS heavy crude dips, which are included in our indicator but that benefit was also seen in the Mid-Con area as well. There was a 10% increase quarter-over-quarter in the cracks for the region. So we did see that positive move there. And we did see lower product differentials, though, as a result of that as well. Our secondary products also played into this tailwind for the quarter. We saw improved pricing in both the NGLs and the heavy intermediates. And this is all -- we all pulled this all together really with very good operating performance for the region. We had 100% crude utilization and 89% clean product yields, which are two very, very good performances by the assets.\nManav Gupta: Perfect. My quick follow-up here is you are at $2.7 billion on asset sale of the $3 billion, but you still have a marketing package out there in Europe. So how should we think about asset sales proceeds for the next 9 months or 12 months?\nRich Harbison: I think the way you should think about it, Manav, is we -- it's part of that portfolio optimization. It's ongoing. We've defined what we think are non-core assets. And I would say that, that $3 billion was considered as a floor that we would hit. And we will continue to evaluate non-core assets and move forward with any dispositions that we view as favorable for us.\nManav Gupta: Perfect. So $3 billion was the floor, not the target, sorry, thank you, thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Matthew, please go ahead.\nMatthew Blair: Thank you, and good morning. Your Refining capture hold up pretty well in the third quarter at 92% versus 93% in Q2. Typically, in the fourth quarter, Refinery see some tailwinds here, just from things like lower -- or sorry, higher butane blending volumes. Could you talk about your expectations for capture in the fourth quarter? Do you think it's reasonable to expect a small improvement quarter-over-quarter? Or is it too early to say?\nMark Lashier: I think it's too early to say, Matthew, just one month into the quarter, there's still opportunity for some volatility as we go through the end of the year.\nMatthew Blair: Sounds good. And then the West Coast seemed pretty challenging for Phillips and some of your peers in the third quarter. I think the capture fell to 63% versus strong levels in Q2. You obviously made a decision to close the Los Angeles refinery. Can you talk about the headwinds in the third quarter in the West Coast? And whether there's been any improvement so far in the fourth quarter?\nRich Harbison: Yes. This is Rich. I'll talk about some of the headwinds we saw on the West Coast. There's a lot of moving parts, actually. So primarily, we saw a weaker market cracks and weaker feedstock advantages. So those were both the keys to driving lower earnings in that region. Margins decreased with our West Coast indicator falling about 46%. So you saw that if you're tracking along in our indicator, those were primarily driven by Portland and Los Angeles gasoline cracks. Crude deliveries also played into this as well. There was a prior month injection of crude delivered by pipeline coming out of the north from Canada. And in a declining price environment, we also -- we see an impact in that as well versus the benchmark. Secondary product impacts primarily related to heavy intermediate drawdown of inventory. In the second quarter, we built heavy intermediate inventories as a result of maintenance activity at both Los Angeles and Ferndale. And then the drawdown actually occurred in the third quarter, and that happened to occur in a declining price environment as well, impacting the market capture. We are also experiencing some continuing costs associated with the wind down of the Rodeo crude operation. I don't want to forget about that. We expect the majority of this work to be complete by year-end as we prepare a number of the assets for demolition. The demolition costs are currently reserved in our ARO, but that cost to prepare for that demolition is something that we'll see ongoing through the end of this year. And as Kevin indicated in his recap earlier, there was a couple of entries into the quarter that impacted earnings as well from the LAR announcement to idle operations. One is the accelerated depreciation, that $25 million in the quarter. The other was a special item of $41 million, recognizing some benefit obligations associated with that announcement. That all said, the assets actually operated well for the quarter at 93% clean product yield and a 94% crude utilization for the assets, so primarily market-driven factors there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen. Jason, your line is now open.\nJason Gabelman: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask first on the Refining business. And back in the 2022 Analyst Day, there was some guidance for 5% margin capture improvement by 2025. And I think there was some kind of optimization across the portfolio involved in that and some discrete projects involved in that. It sounds like maybe those projects have been a bit delayed. I can't really tell. But how much has capture improved from 2022 tough to compare given the change in indicator. And would you say you're on track with the projects that, that underpinned that capture improvement?\nRich Harbison: Yes. This is Rich again. Short story is we're on track. And how that's all coming together is a series of small capital projects with high return. I mentioned those a little bit earlier. But in 2022 and 2023, we completed a series of projects, roughly 12 to 15 each year. And these are return projects and assuming mid-cycle pricing returned about 3% improvement in market capture associated with those projects. In 2024, we have additional 15 projects that we're executing right now. And those projects will add about 2% of market capture to a mid-cycle priced earnings profile. So add those all up the three years program on this, it comes up to the 5%. That 5% number is equivalent to essentially $400 million of earnings at mid-cycle pricing. So if you -- if we see that environment, I'm very confident that we will see that, that impact and that actually hit into the market capture numbers that we're seeing through the existing indicator, and we'll have to go back and recreate a bridge to the traditional indicator.\nJason Gabelman: Okay. Thanks. My follow-up question is going back to some of the commentary on distributions next year and the balance between deleveraging and buying back shares. There's a few targets out there in terms of debt. There's 25% to 30% net debt to cap. There's $18 billion of net debt. What's kind of the preferred metric investors should look at to determine what the buyback capacity is next year? And how do you feel about the balance sheet going into next year, given all the concern around the refining market environment? Thanks.\nKevin Mitchell: Yes, Jason, it's Kevin. Let me make a couple of comments on that. The leverage target is the 25% to 30% level, but we acknowledge that, that may take a while to get there given the current environment and the absolute -- not just debt level, but also it's debt and equity that drive that calculation. We also are looking at absolute debt at a sub $18 billion on a net debt basis. So we're -- at the end of the third quarter, we were at an $18 billion net debt level, and we'd like to be a little bit lower than that. We do think that we're going to have a fair amount of flexibility going into next year because while the refining environment is weaker than we would like. The other businesses are performing very well. We have the broader portfolio and you're seeing the benefits of that. And we also have some healthy cash that will become available through the asset disposition. So while we've announced $2.7 billion, less than half of that has actually been realized at this point in time. So we've got a fair amount still to come in and there's other transactions that we're working on. So I think we'll still have a lot of flexibility to be able to meet our cash return objectives and make progress on the balance sheet, which as you know is one of our strategic priorities as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Wolfe Research. Doug, please go ahead.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Mark, I don't know if you want to take this one, but if we go back and look at the targets you laid out back in 2022, the disposal program, I guess, the acquisition of DCP wasn't in the area, but the disposal program was not explicit in your EBITDA targets. Can you give us some idea -- I'm guessing it's a small number, but what the EBITDA losses from the $2.7 billion of disposals so far.\nMark Lashier: Yes, no, thanks for mentioning that, Doug. As we step back and look at our earnings capacity at mid-cycle projection at $14 billion by the end of 2025. We also recognize that there's parts that are moving in and out of the portfolio. And where we're landing is sometime early next year, we're going to look at the gives and takes -- puts and takes around that number, and we'll come out with a revised mid-cycle earnings capacity and just recognizing that that number is not a projection of our earnings in 2025, but really our mid-cycle earnings capacity in 2025, and we'll be updating everyone on that.\nDoug Leggate: You can't put a number around $2.7 billion at this point?\nMark Lashier: We're not prepared to do that right now. We'll revise that early next year.\nDoug Leggate: Okay. Thank you. And I guess my follow-up is actually related to that $14 billion. I want to make sure that we don't misspeak about that been a target for 2025. It's obviously a mid-cycle capacity, as you pointed out. But embedded in there is a little over $5 billion of Refining at mid-cycle. And you've obviously -- you've been in the press and quite vocal about your view of what the capacity person takes are globally for the industry. And I'm just curious when you think -- maybe we need to wait until next year, but if you think forward about what you had historically seen as mid-cycle, what some of us thought might be a better mid-cycle that's obviously been kiboshed by the last couple of quarters, obviously. But are you -- I guess, I'm curious whether you think there is still a case for a higher mid-cycle or whether we're battling to hold on to what was the last 10 years as a mid-cycle average.\nMark Lashier: Well, there certainly a lot has changed in the last 10 years. And I think part of our review is we will step back and see what has happened in mid-cycle with respect to inflation inside the crack spreads, where all that comes down. I think it's very different than it was 10 years ago, but we do see enhanced strength in our ability to capture value in our refining assets, and we believe in the long list of things that Rich has talked about and the combination of creating more integration value, our ability of our commercial group to capture more value from the marketplace and a different posture around how we trade around our assets has significantly enhanced our mid-cycle earnings capability in refining. And if you look at 2025, yes, we don't believe that we'll be at mid-cycle in 2025, but we also believe that going forward beyond 2025 that we're going to see global demand growth that will exceed the net impact of capacity additions and rationalizations. And you're seeing more rationalization announcements coming at us and very little beyond the two big refineries that are coming on now, very little capacity addition beyond 2025. And so we've got a fairly bullish outlook in the medium-term.\nDoug Leggate: Appreciate your comments, Mark. I look forward to that update. Thanks so much.\nMark Lashier: Thanks, Doug.\nOperator: The next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTheresa Chen: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. First, on the cost side for the chem business, with ethane in contango due to natural gas being into contango, also perhaps, and because we have incremental residue capacity coming out of the Permian, allowing for the option to project into 2025. How do you see that impacting chem margins from a macro perspective through 2025? And related to that, just given your processing footprint and your option to project or extract ethane for at least some of your volumes, could that may be a way to bolster earnings across the integrated value chain, midstream and chem in a way that competitors cannot?\nDon Baldridge: Hi Theresa, this is Don. I think from an ethane standpoint as it relates to CPChem, I think the advantage of ethane will continue to be there near-term and long-term. So I feel good about that outlook and how that will continue to be beneficial for CPChem's position in the chemical market. With regard to our assets and how we think about it, we do have, obviously, with our gas processing assets, a lot of flexibility in terms of ethane recovery and rejection, and we make those decisions on a day-by-day basis based on market conditions and what our downstream infrastructure is associated with those assets and how to maximize both the throughput as well as the profitability as we push those barrels downstream. So we think we've got, as an integrated player, a really good play kit to utilize and optimize across that gas to ethane and then ethane as a feedstock into the petchem industry. So we think it's going to be an opportunity set that we'll be able to execute on here in the near-term as well as on down through the future.\nTheresa Chen: Got it. And turning to the residue side in the Permian. I'd love to get a sense of how you view your exposure there? And you've sold a gas transmission asset outside of the Permian. Do you view your interest in GCX as core to your business, keeping in mind that the two other interests in GCX have consistently transacted with a double-digit multiple and the pipe also recently FID an expansion that's going to cost nearly $0.5 billion on a 100% basis. Is that the best use of your capital? And I'd love to hear your thoughts there.\nDon Baldridge: Well, first, I'd say we are very excited to see the customer support behind the GCX expansion. We do think that's a big vote of confidence as to the productivity and the outlook of volume growth in the Permian, which obviously we're a beneficiary of given our footprint there. And we are an active participant in the residue gas marketing space and moving gas out of that basin. So we're pleased with where things situate from that standpoint. And then I mean, probably just reiterate what Mark has said, I mean, we regularly evaluate our portfolio and look for opportunities to high grade where it makes sense. We think that's just the right way to ensure our capital is allocated to the best opportunities. So it will just be part of -- in terms of our GCX interest, it will be no different than the other assets in our portfolio. We'll continually evaluate and make a decision when the time and the opportunities make sense.\nOperator: The next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul, please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nPaul Cheng: Hey guys, good morning. I think the first question\u2026\nMark Lashier: Good morning, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: Hi, good morning, Mark. The first question is for Kevin. I think in the past, you have talked about a $4 billion to $5 billion on the cash balance. I don't know whether that is still the longer-term objective. And also, I'm just curious that given the volatility in the market we are seeing and your -- today, you're already saying that the debt level is a bit higher than what you prefer in the longer-term. Should we still paying out more than 50% of the cash flow or that at least we should say maybe the payout will be lesser for the -- after you finish the $13 billion to $15 billion of the commitment. So that's the first question. The second question is for Rich. You mentioned the Central Corridor; you benefit from the WTI hedges. I presume you are not referring to the CMI -- the CMA, you are actually physical derivative that you get into. Is that just you need for your Central Corridor operation or that you're doing other kind of hedges in the rest of your operation? Thank you.\nKevin Mitchell: Yes. Paul, it's Kevin. I'll take your first question. I think the $4 billion to $5 billion; it sounds like one of our competitors uses that number for cash. We've said $2 billion to $3 billion is our sort of ideal cash level, which gives us adequate flexibility. And of course, we've also got plenty of other liquidity available to us. So $2 billion to $3 billion is the number that we've been saying in terms of cash balance. And as you can see we were slightly lower than that at the end of the third quarter. On a go-forward basis on cash returns, 50% still feels pretty reasonable as an objective, 50% or more. The dividend is $2 billion. And so that's -- while in theory, that's -- there's flexibility on that. That's not how we think about it. That's a -- we view that as a very much a commitment. And the 50% still leaves adequate room for the other things we want to accomplish. I would also emphasize that we continue to be very disciplined around our capital program, our growth capital. So back two years ago, we said for the next couple of years, 2022 and 2023, we'd have a $2 billion capital budget. While we haven't laid out our capital budget for 2025 yet, we expect that we'll -- we're going to continue to have that discipline around how we make those decisions. So I think when you put all that together, the 50% is still a reasonable number.\nBrian Mandell: Hey Paul, this is Brian. Just on the accounting -- for GAAP accounting, you have to mark your hedges and you don't mark the physical until it's sold or moved. And so in a falling market, the hedges make money and the physical doesn't get marked. So that will get marked in the following quarter.\nPaul Cheng: Yes. But Brian, is it only for the Central Corridor that you have that or that in other business -- in other region, you also have hedges?\nBrian Mandell: Yes, we have it in all regions.\nPaul Cheng: So you have it in all regions?\nMark Lashier: It's just much more significant. That's correct.\nKevin Mitchell: The volume are higher.\nMark Lashier: Yes, yes.\nKevin Mitchell: And there was a big move on WTI on this list.\nPaul Cheng: So it's only the WTI your hedges?\nBrian Mandell: Yes.\nPaul Cheng: Okay.\nBrian Mandell: We generally hedge with WTI crude, correct.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Hi, I believe that the enterprise TW products pipeline has started up to PADD 4. Are you seeing that impact in PADD 4 margins yet?\nBrian Mandell: No, not yet.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Okay. And then my follow-up is on, I think you kind of referenced this in the comments, but LPG Export have gotten extremely wide, as I'm sure that you're aware. And I think they're expected to stay that way for a few quarters until more export capacity comes online. How much exposure does PSX have to arc and does that increase over the next few quarters?\nDon Baldridge: Yes, this is Don. Thanks, Jean Ann. At Freeport, we are experiencing strong demand for LPGs and I would just say we have a portfolio mix of short and long-term contracts there at Freeport as well as really across our whole NGL value chain. So this portfolio approach lets us capitalize on opportunities like we see today across the system. It sort of helps navigate where at any point in time across the NGL value chain, you have some positives from a margin standpoint and some headwinds, so it really helps kind of level out across that value chain, but we are seeing real positive healthy dock fees given the spread today to international markets, the ample supply of vessels and then just a tight existing dock capacity across the Gulf Coast. So we'll get a share of that, and we believe it's a pretty healthy outlook, as you mentioned, for the foreseeable quarters.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Great. I'll leave it there. Thanks for taking my questions.\nDon Baldridge: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joe Laetsch with Morgan Stanley. Joe, please go ahead.\nJoe Laetsch: Hey, good morning, team, and thanks for taking my questions. So on the macro side, thanks to your comments earlier on the supply outlook. Could you just talk to what you're seeing on the demand side for gasoline diesel in jet within your system as well as your outlook from here?\nBrian Mandell: Sure. Hey, this is Brian. Starting with gasoline, global gasoline year-to-date, we're seeing about 1% higher than 2023. European demands a bright spot with sales of gasoline-powered and gasoline hybrid vehicles supporting higher growth in 3Q versus prior 3Q about 4% up. U.S. demand performed well, too, growing over 1% 3Q to -- former 3Q, part of that is the retail prices that were falling considerably with the spot prices. On distillate, year-to-date, distillate global demand was about 1.5% lower -- in the U.S., we saw in 3Q about 2% lower than 3Q. We're seeing some cautiously optimistic comments from some of the freight companies. UPS, for instance, came out last week; it reported positive revenue and profit growth in the third quarter, which followed nearly two years of subpar performance. Also in the global container business, the global container volumes are up. In fact, in August, they hit a record high, so seeing some positive signs there. Jet, year-to-date global jet demand is about 8.5% higher than 2023, driven largely by Asia. Europe and U.S. flight demand is back to 2019 levels, but jet demand isn't quite back to those levels, mostly because of the aircraft efficiency in the fleet.\nJoe Laetsch: Great. Thank you. And then just shifting to renewable, some peers have talked about seeing a premium for SAF over RD. What are you seeing from a commercial demand standpoint for SAF at Rodeo?\nBrian Mandell: Yes. We also see a premium for renewable jet production. I'll caution that in Q4, we're likely not to produce renewable jet we're currently running off higher CI feedstocks for the plant as we prepare for the production tax credit next year, but we expect to be in steady state at renewable diesel -- renewable complex by Q1 of next year. And so by then, you should see us producing renewable jet.\nJoe Laetsch: Great. Thank you, all.\nRich Harbison: Yes. Maybe just to add a little bit to that color there. We did actually produce sustainable aviation fuel in September. So we have in the past indicated that, that was our intention. We did successfully produce a sustainable aviation field. There's this market anomaly that Brian is talking about here in the fourth quarter that will limit that production. But we will fully intend to be a supplier of sustainable aviation fuel to the marketplace.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mark Lashier for closing comments.\nMark Lashier: Thanks for all your questions. We delivered strong performance across our differentiated downstream portfolio. Business transformation achieved $1.4 billion of run rate cost reductions and lowered our refining cost by $1 per barrel. Midstream achieved its synergy target and provide stable earnings with attractive growth opportunities. We expect to exceed our $3 billion asset disposition target, having signed agreements to generate $2.7 billion in proceeds to-date. We continue to evaluate assets as part of our ongoing portfolio optimization. I'm proud of our employees' significant achievements toward our commitments. We're confident in our strategy and continued execution on the remaining targets. Thank you for your interest in Phillips 66. If you have questions after today's call, please call Jeff or Owen.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This concludes our call, and you may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Brian Mandell",
            "content": "Hey Neil, this is Brian. On the marketing side, Q3 is typically marketing's strongest quarter and during the quarter marketing had improved margins in the U.S. across both wholesale and franchise channels, driven as you mentioned by falling spot prices. We also saw some stronger volumes additionally in the lubricants business base oil margins also improved with falling feedstock prices. But going forward, expectations for the M&S segment in Q4 are just a seasonal pullback in earnings consistent with what we call mid-cycle Q4 earnings. Sure. This is Brian, Ryan. Maybe to start kind of where we are today, we're still in startup mode for the Renewable segment. So I think we've had some startup costs. We're also running higher or lower CI, but we're also running some higher CI now in Q4. I think if you think about renewable diesel margins going into Q4 and beyond, we think margins are going to strengthen for a number of reasons, feedstock prices remain depressed. There are a number of plants that continue to struggle. Some of the RD production is going to be converted into renewable jet production like some of our competitors on the Gulf Coast and we will do as well. There are less imports into the U.S. tighter West Coast car diesel market with refinery production issues. We've been seen some renewable diesel from our competitors come from the Gulf Coast into the West Coast and then just the stronger credit markets with the tightening of those credit markets and the disincentivizing of biodiesel production. So all those things together I think will drive renewable diesel margins stronger as we go-forward. Hey Paul, this is Brian. Just on the accounting -- for GAAP accounting, you have to mark your hedges and you don't mark the physical until it's sold or moved. And so in a falling market, the hedges make money and the physical doesn't get marked. So that will get marked in the following quarter. Yes, we have it in all regions. Yes.

            "name": "Rich Harbison",
            "content": "Hey Roger, this is Rich. There's really two key factors in that $100 million reduction in our outlook. Half of its attributed to this enhanced inspection process that we've been putting in place over the last several years. It's allowed us to actually extend the intervals between turnarounds. So some of that data was coming in this year on some planned turnarounds, and after we had a chance to evaluate it, we were able to defer those turnarounds. That's roughly half of that $100 million. And the other half of the $100 million is the organization's execution of the work. They've -- we've actually gotten much more efficient at our execution through a number of initiatives that we put in place with turnarounds and we're seeing the fruits of that labor come through now, so. Yes, so maybe I'll just add a little more color to that. This is Rich. So we had three primary improvement focuses in refining. First, is the cost reduction and that's a slog, right? It's getting in the mud pit, digging it out and pulling out these expenses that are very sticky, takes a lot of organizational effort to do that. I'm very happy with the organization's performance on this. And we've exceeded our expectations, original expectations, and now we've removed over $600 million of cost out of the cost profile for refining. So we're not declaring infinite success with that. We will move to what I'll call a continuous improvement mode on the cost. But I will shift the organization's attention now to the earnings per barrel focus here as we move into the future. And that is taking advantage of what Mark was talking about, which are these small capital projects with high return and we will continue to execute those. We still have a laundry list of those projects to go. But there is also efforts that we utilize our existing equipment and making sure that we are extracting the highest level of value out of that. We see some opportunities across the system. We are going to focus on that and continue to extract that value out. And then of course, Brian's organization is working diligently. This integrated model that we have is really about extracting the value out of the entire value chain. And the commercial organization is the glue that keeps that together. And we've got a lot of number of initiatives that we're working on, on that front. You add all these up; they're well over $1 billion of impact to our earnings at mid-cycle pricing. So I'm very confident that when we get to mid -- back to mid-cycle pricing scenarios that you'll see the performance of the refining organization hit the $4 billion to $5 billion range of earnings. Hey Manav, it's Rich. Thanks for pointing that out. We're very happy with the performance of the Central Corridor operation. There's a couple of factors here that played into the outperform. One of the -- margins were higher, which increased mainly due to a favorable impact on our inventory hedges. So with the WTI price falling quarter-over-quarter, that hedge was a positive tailwind for us on that. We also had the benefits of the WCS heavy crude dips, which are included in our indicator but that benefit was also seen in the Mid-Con area as well. There was a 10% increase quarter-over-quarter in the cracks for the region. So we did see that positive move there. And we did see lower product differentials, though, as a result of that as well. Our secondary products also played into this tailwind for the quarter. We saw improved pricing in both the NGLs and the heavy intermediates. And this is all -- we all pulled this all together really with very good operating performance for the region. We had 100% crude utilization and 89% clean product yields, which are two very, very good performances by the assets. I think the way you should think about it, Manav, is we -- it's part of that portfolio optimization. It's ongoing. We've defined what we think are non-core assets. And I would say that, that $3 billion was considered as a floor that we would hit. And we will continue to evaluate non-core assets and move forward with any dispositions that we view as favorable for us. Yes. This is Rich. I'll talk about some of the headwinds we saw on the West Coast. There's a lot of moving parts, actually. So primarily, we saw a weaker market cracks and weaker feedstock advantages. So those were both the keys to driving lower earnings in that region. Margins decreased with our West Coast indicator falling about 46%. So you saw that if you're tracking along in our indicator, those were primarily driven by Portland and Los Angeles gasoline cracks. Crude deliveries also played into this as well. There was a prior month injection of crude delivered by pipeline coming out of the north from Canada. And in a declining price environment, we also -- we see an impact in that as well versus the benchmark. Secondary product impacts primarily related to heavy intermediate drawdown of inventory. In the second quarter, we built heavy intermediate inventories as a result of maintenance activity at both Los Angeles and Ferndale. And then the drawdown actually occurred in the third quarter, and that happened to occur in a declining price environment as well, impacting the market capture. We are also experiencing some continuing costs associated with the wind down of the Rodeo crude operation. I don't want to forget about that. We expect the majority of this work to be complete by year-end as we prepare a number of the assets for demolition. The demolition costs are currently reserved in our ARO, but that cost to prepare for that demolition is something that we'll see ongoing through the end of this year. And as Kevin indicated in his recap earlier, there was a couple of entries into the quarter that impacted earnings as well from the LAR announcement to idle operations. One is the accelerated depreciation, that $25 million in the quarter. The other was a special item of $41 million, recognizing some benefit obligations associated with that announcement. That all said, the assets actually operated well for the quarter at 93% clean product yield and a 94% crude utilization for the assets, so primarily market-driven factors there. Yes. This is Rich again. Short story is we're on track. And how that's all coming together is a series of small capital projects with high return. I mentioned those a little bit earlier. But in 2022 and 2023, we completed a series of projects, roughly 12 to 15 each year. And these are return projects and assuming mid-cycle pricing returned about 3% improvement in market capture associated with those projects. In 2024, we have additional 15 projects that we're executing right now. And those projects will add about 2% of market capture to a mid-cycle priced earnings profile. So add those all up the three years program on this, it comes up to the 5%. That 5% number is equivalent to essentially $400 million of earnings at mid-cycle pricing. So if you -- if we see that environment, I'm very confident that we will see that, that impact and that actually hit into the market capture numbers that we're seeing through the existing indicator, and we'll have to go back and recreate a bridge to the traditional indicator. Yes. Maybe just to add a little bit to that color there. We did actually produce sustainable aviation fuel in September. So we have in the past indicated that, that was our intention. We did successfully produce a sustainable aviation field. There's this market anomaly that Brian is talking about here in the fourth quarter that will limit that production. But we will fully intend to be a supplier of sustainable aviation fuel to the marketplace."

            "name": "Mark Lashier",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff. Welcome, everyone, to our third quarter earnings call. The strength of our results in a challenging refining market demonstrates the benefits of our differentiated downstream portfolio. During the quarter, we continued to execute on our strategic priorities and delivered strong operating performance. Since July 2022, we have returned $12.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We're approaching our $13 billion to $15 billion target. In refining, we've reduced our cost by $1 per barrel and we continue to run our system well. The improvement in clean product yield reflects our investments in high return low capital projects. We continue to evaluate all of our assets as part of our strategic priorities and ongoing portfolio optimization. We recently agreed to sell our 49% interest in a Switzerland-based retail joint venture for approximately $1.24 billion. Our asset dispositions are now expected to exceed the $3 billion target. We plan to use the cash proceeds to support our strategic priorities including returns to shareholders and debt reduction. During the quarter, we achieved the targets on two of the six priorities ahead of schedule. First, we have accomplished our $1.4 billion business transformation cost reduction target. We've driven a permanent shift in the way we work and we remain diligent with a culture of continuous improvement. Our employees have done an incredible job delivering on this commitment and the results are clear as Kevin will cover later. Secondly, we achieved our $400 million synergy target across our NGL wellhead-to-market value chain. This brings the total uplift in mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA to $1.4 billion from acquiring and successfully integrating DCP Midstream. Slide 4, shows the growth of our Midstream business. We have advanced our wellhead-to-market strategy through organic projects and strategic transactions that provided significant synergies and strong returns. Our Sweeny Hub became the second largest NGO fractionation hub in the U.S. with the completion of Frac 4 in 2022. The DCP transactions strengthened this competitive position by fully integrating our value chain. In the third quarter of 2024, we further expanded the business with the acquisition of Pinnacle Midstream. We also approved the construction of an adjacent processing plant with startup expected in mid-2025. On a trailing 12-month basis, Midstream's adjusted EBITDA has increased to $3.7 billion from $2.1 billion three years ago. In addition, Midstream adjusted EBITDA is ahead of 2024 guidance despite weaker natural gas and NGL prices. The stable cash generation from this business covers the company's dividend and our sustaining capital. We continue to high grade our portfolio and capitalize on our growth platform to generate strong returns and significant free cash flow. Before I wrap up my opening comments, I want to acknowledge our previously announced plans to cease operations at the Los Angeles refinery in the fourth quarter of 2025. The uncertainty of the long-term sustainability of the refinery and market dynamics were key factors in this decision. We are evaluating the future use of the property and will work with the State of California to continue to supply transportation fuels to meet customer demand. As we work towards decommissioning, we're grateful for our employees continued focus on safety and operating excellence. We are committed to treating all of our employees and contractors fairly and respectfully throughout the process. We continue to deliver on our strategic priorities and targets. I look forward to providing an update on the next earnings call. Now, over to Kevin. Good morning, John. As we've stated in our strategic priorities, that we will do an ongoing evaluation of all of our assets. And so the LA decision really was part of that. And the Los Angeles refinery has been under significant market pressure. And the refinery, if you think back historically was originally designed to process in State California crude production and that's declined by about 75%. So the continued outlook in California in the face of declining diesel and gasoline demand was a pretty tough one. And so when we took that given outlook for the markets and also factor in California's stated policy to move away from fossil fuels, we expected California to be a pretty challenging refining market going forward. And we also have the typical maintenance and regulatory spending that we face and that's only going up. And so there are a lot of factors that go into these decisions and these decisions are only made after we do an exhaustive review of all the alternatives. And that exhaustive review led us to idle the refinery as we announced earlier this month. And so it wasn't any kind of knee jerk reaction in the face of any policy changes in California. This has been a long-term analysis. Well, Neil, I'll take the chemicals side of that. And we've seen CPChem's performance strong. They're able to operate at high rates when others have had to cut back because of costs. I think that they don't have any operation or much operations exposure in Europe, which is beneficial. And they've got their advantaged feedstock position, low cost ethane in two locations in the world that they've really been able to lean into. You do see some seasonal softness coming in this time of year, which is pretty typical. And that with lower crude prices makes naphtha producers the floor a little bit impacted there as well. But on the long-term, we see continued improvement in the macro for chemicals. They're coming out of that trough of a year or so ago; they continue to make good progress. They continue to see demand from their perspective and their ability to capture the market increasing and we see that going forward. Yes, Ryan, this is Mark. I'll just comment at a high level that I do believe that we're still on that journey. We've pretty dramatically enhanced our cost position and we'll continue to do so. We are focused on being competitive and continuing that journey. And we've also been very deliberate in just working away at these small projects that have quick payouts that enhance our ability to capture the market. And we've got -- in our strategic priorities, we've got things that we see in 2025, things that we see happening by 2026. And so we've got a long list of things that we can continue to work away at in refining to enhance our competitive position and increase our ability to capture value from the marketplace. I think it's too early to say, Matthew, just one month into the quarter, there's still opportunity for some volatility as we go through the end of the year. Yes, no, thanks for mentioning that, Doug. As we step back and look at our earnings capacity at mid-cycle projection at $14 billion by the end of 2025. We also recognize that there's parts that are moving in and out of the portfolio. And where we're landing is sometime early next year, we're going to look at the gives and takes -- puts and takes around that number, and we'll come out with a revised mid-cycle earnings capacity and just recognizing that that number is not a projection of our earnings in 2025, but really our mid-cycle earnings capacity in 2025, and we'll be updating everyone on that. We're not prepared to do that right now. We'll revise that early next year. Well, there certainly a lot has changed in the last 10 years. And I think part of our review is we will step back and see what has happened in mid-cycle with respect to inflation inside the crack spreads, where all that comes down. I think it's very different than it was 10 years ago, but we do see enhanced strength in our ability to capture value in our refining assets, and we believe in the long list of things that Rich has talked about and the combination of creating more integration value, our ability of our commercial group to capture more value from the marketplace and a different posture around how we trade around our assets has significantly enhanced our mid-cycle earnings capability in refining. And if you look at 2025, yes, we don't believe that we'll be at mid-cycle in 2025, but we also believe that going forward beyond 2025 that we're going to see global demand growth that will exceed the net impact of capacity additions and rationalizations. And you're seeing more rationalization announcements coming at us and very little beyond the two big refineries that are coming on now, very little capacity addition beyond 2025. And so we've got a fairly bullish outlook in the medium-term. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, Paul. It's just much more significant. That's correct. Yes, yes. Thanks for all your questions. We delivered strong performance across our differentiated downstream portfolio. Business transformation achieved $1.4 billion of run rate cost reductions and lowered our refining cost by $1 per barrel. Midstream achieved its synergy target and provide stable earnings with attractive growth opportunities. We expect to exceed our $3 billion asset disposition target, having signed agreements to generate $2.7 billion in proceeds to-date. We continue to evaluate assets as part of our ongoing portfolio optimization. I'm proud of our employees' significant achievements toward our commitments. We're confident in our strategy and continued execution on the remaining targets. Thank you for your interest in Phillips 66. If you have questions after today's call, please call Jeff or Owen."

            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Slide 5 provides cost detail at the total company level through the end of the third quarter compared to the same period of 2022. We have supported growth while mitigating inflationary impacts through business transformation and synergy capture. Through the first nine months of the year, we have realized approximately $700 million in cost reductions including our share of WRB costs. In addition, we have reduced logistics spend by $200 million, these costs flow through gross margin. We lowered sustaining capital spend and continue to prioritize safe and reliable operations. Slide 6, shows the business transformation reduction to refining cost per barrel. Adjusted controllable costs excluding turnarounds are $5.84 per barrel year-to-date; we have eliminated $1 per barrel of costs, achieving our target ahead of schedule. Slide 7, covers key financial metrics. Earnings were $346 million. Adjusted earnings were $859 million, or $2.04 per share. The adjusted results exclude special items, which include a legal accrual in the third quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $1.1 billion and returned $1.3 billion to shareholders. I will now move to Slide 8, to cover the segment results. Adjusted earnings decreased $125 million compared with the prior quarter. Midstream results decreased mostly due to seasonal maintenance costs and lower equity earnings, reflecting the sale of our interest in the Rockies Express pipeline. These decreases were partially offset by higher margins on LPG Exports. In Chemicals, results increased mainly due to higher polyethylene chain margins and lower costs. Lower refining results primarily reflect weaker crack spreads. Capture of the new indicator was 92% in line with the previous quarter. In addition, the plan to cease operations at our Los Angeles refinery resulted in the acceleration of depreciation. The impact in the third quarter was $25 million. Going forward, we expect approximately $230 million per quarter of additional depreciation through the fourth quarter of 2025. Marketing and specialties results were higher, mostly due to seasonally stronger margins. In renewable fuels, results decreased due to lower realized margins. The Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex produced 44,000 barrels per day of renewable fuels during the third quarter. Slide 9, shows the change in cash flow. Cash from operations, excluding working capital was $1.5 billion, supported by the stability of our Midstream and Marketing and Specialties businesses. Working capital was a use of $381 million, mainly reflecting the impact of falling commodity prices. In July, we acquired Pinnacle Midstream for $567 million. Also during the quarter, we received cash proceeds of approximately $200 million from the sale of non-core midstream assets. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, in Chemicals, we expect the global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low to mid-90s and turnaround expense to be between $125 million and $135 million. Full year turnaround expense is now expected to be $485 million to $495 million. This is a reduction of more than $100 million from our original guidance. We anticipate corporate and other costs to come in between $300 million and $330 million. Now, we will open the line for questions, after which Mark will wrap up the call. Yes, John, it's Kevin. So certainly expect to finish the year with a stronger cash or net debt position than where we are currently. And that will be partly reflected by proceeds from asset dispositions, but the bulk of that is going to be 2025. So we expect the Swiss business, that transaction to close in the first quarter of next year, and the Germany, Austria retail business, we're still in active negotiations around that, and so that will be a 2025 item as well. But nonetheless, the proceeds from dispositions give us a lot more added flexibility as we think about balance sheet priorities, continuing to return cash to shareholders and also investment in the business. And just as a reminder, from a capital allocation standpoint, the first priority is sustaining capital that's about $1 billion per year. The second priority is the dividend, that's approximately $2 billion per year. And everything after that is available for investing in the company and growth, returning cash to shareholders, of which the dividend obviously is a part of that, but share repurchases and then the balance sheet and debt reduction. So we're a bit off of our target leverage metric, and we expect to get closer to that. It'll take a little while when you look at the different components of the debt and the equity on that, but we expect to be moving our way towards that objective. Yes. I think as you look at that, and as you point out, we highlighted the inflationary impact; we also highlight the market impact. And you could say those are two versions of similar factors. They're market driven; they're outside of our control. One of them has been a headwind for the last couple of years. The other one has been a tailwind for us with lower natural gas prices, primarily. And so what we're trying to focus on, as you would expect are those things that are directly within our control and that's reflected in that cost reduction bar on the chart. On market, I wouldn't be completely dismissive of that being outside of our control because we are also, as part of our cost reduction initiatives focused on energy reduction in terms of from a volume quantity standpoint. And so that is something that we're very focused on as well. It's also consistent with our environmental GHG objectives around that. But on a go-forward basis, I think the worst of the inflationary pressures are behind us and we'd expect that that has somewhat normalized on a go-forward basis. So lesser headwinds than we have experienced over the last couple of years. Yes, Neil, it's -- for the last year-and-a-half or longer, we have been very focused on the commitment that we put out there, the $13 billion to $15 billion target, and that has somewhat informed our decisions around the pace of buybacks. As we get to the end of that, I think we will move to more of a, in excess of 50% of operating cash flow being the so return to shareholder metric. We talked about that I think on the last call that of the go-forward assumption around this is 50% or more of cash from operations being returned to shareholders. I think that's a good way to think about this as you model out into 2025 from -- for that metric. Yes, Jason, it's Kevin. Let me make a couple of comments on that. The leverage target is the 25% to 30% level, but we acknowledge that, that may take a while to get there given the current environment and the absolute -- not just debt level, but also it's debt and equity that drive that calculation. We also are looking at absolute debt at a sub $18 billion on a net debt basis. So we're -- at the end of the third quarter, we were at an $18 billion net debt level, and we'd like to be a little bit lower than that. We do think that we're going to have a fair amount of flexibility going into next year because while the refining environment is weaker than we would like. The other businesses are performing very well. We have the broader portfolio and you're seeing the benefits of that. And we also have some healthy cash that will become available through the asset disposition. So while we've announced $2.7 billion, less than half of that has actually been realized at this point in time. So we've got a fair amount still to come in and there's other transactions that we're working on. So I think we'll still have a lot of flexibility to be able to meet our cash return objectives and make progress on the balance sheet, which as you know is one of our strategic priorities as well. Yes. Paul, it's Kevin. I'll take your first question. I think the $4 billion to $5 billion; it sounds like one of our competitors uses that number for cash. We've said $2 billion to $3 billion is our sort of ideal cash level, which gives us adequate flexibility. And of course, we've also got plenty of other liquidity available to us. So $2 billion to $3 billion is the number that we've been saying in terms of cash balance. And as you can see we were slightly lower than that at the end of the third quarter. On a go-forward basis on cash returns, 50% still feels pretty reasonable as an objective, 50% or more. The dividend is $2 billion. And so that's -- while in theory, that's -- there's flexibility on that. That's not how we think about it. That's a -- we view that as a very much a commitment. And the 50% still leaves adequate room for the other things we want to accomplish. I would also emphasize that we continue to be very disciplined around our capital program, our growth capital. So back two years ago, we said for the next couple of years, 2022 and 2023, we'd have a $2 billion capital budget. While we haven't laid out our capital budget for 2025 yet, we expect that we'll -- we're going to continue to have that discipline around how we make those decisions. So I think when you put all that together, the 50% is still a reasonable number. The volume are higher. And there was a big move on WTI on this list."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jeff Dietert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Jeff, you may begin.\nJeff Dietert: Welcome to the Phillips 66 second quarter earnings conference call. Participants on today's call will include Mark Lashier, Chairman and CEO; Kevin Mitchell, CFO; Don Baldridge, Midstream and Chemicals; Rich Harbison, Refining; and Brian Mandell, Marketing and Commercial. Today's presentation can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website, along with supplemental financial and operating information. Slide 2 contains our Safe-Harbor statement. We will be making forward-looking statements during today's call. Actual results may differ materially from today's comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here as well as in our SEC filings. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Lashier: Thanks, Jeff. Welcome, everyone, to our second quarter earnings call. First, I'd like to introduce Don Baldridge, our new EVP of Midstream and Chemicals. He previously served as the Interim CEO of DCP and brings a wealth of Midstream experience to Phillips 66. I also want to wish Tim Roberts the best in his retirement and thank him for his contributions to Phillips 66, including being instrumental in executing our NGL wellhead-to-market strategy. Let's turn to our second quarter performance. We continue to systematically execute on our strategic priorities, focusing on what we control. The improvements are visible in our results. Since July 2022, we've returned over $11 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We expect to achieve our $13 billion to $15 billion target by the end of the year. Share repurchases will continue to be a priority in our capital allocation plan. We are committed to returning over 50% of our operating cash flows to shareholders. In refining, we're enhancing performance and reducing our cost structure. Crude utilization during the quarter was our highest at over -- in over five years at 98% and clean product yield was 86%. In addition, we've lowered our costs by nearly $1 per barrel. In Midstream, we continue to benefit from synergy capture as we execute on our NGL wellhead-to-market strategy. Earlier this month, we closed on our acquisition of Pinnacle Midstream. It was a bolt-on to our natural gas-gathering and processing business and grows our stable earnings with high-quality 100% fee-based long-term contracts. The assets are strategically located near our existing Permian footprint in the liquids-rich Midland Basin. In the second quarter, we sold our 25% non-operated interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline for $685 million. We generated over $1 billion from asset dispositions toward our previously announced target of more than $3 billion. By the end of the second quarter, the Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex reached full rates with the startup of the second hydrocracker and both pre-treatment units. The complex is processing approximately 50,000 barrels per day of renewable feedstocks. On the next two slides, I'll focus on the improvements we've made to our cost structure. We're approaching our $1.4 billion run rate savings target and the results are hitting the bottom line. Slide 4 provides cost detail at the total company level compared with the first half of 2022. We've supported growing our business while mitigating inflationary impacts through business transformation. We've realized approximately $400 million in cost reductions, including our share of WRB costs. Additionally, we've been successful in driving efficiencies in our logistics spend that flow-through margin, as well as lowering our sustaining capital spend. Slide 5 highlights how our business transformation efforts have translated into a lower refining cost per barrel. Adjusted controllable costs, excluding turnarounds were $5.93 per barrel. We're closing in on our target to lower cost by $1 per barrel. We continue to increase shareholder value through strong operating performance and disciplined capital allocation as we deliver on our strategic priorities. I want to recognize our employees for their hard work and dedication to driving value creation for shareholders. Kevin, over to you.\nKevin Mitchell: Thank you, Mark. Slide 6 covers the key financial metrics. Adjusted earnings were $984 million or $2.31 per share. We generated operating cash flow of $2.1 billion and returned $1.3 billion to shareholders. I will now move to Slide 7 to cover the segment results. In the second quarter, we made changes to our segment reporting, including a new segment for our renewable fuels business. The new segment includes the Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex, as well as contributions from the optimization of renewable feedstocks, fuel sales, and credits. We also moved our investment in NOVONIX from the Midstream segment to Corporate and Other. Our slides and other reporting materials reflect these changes and prior-period results have been recast for comparative purposes. Adjusted earnings increased $162 million compared with the prior quarter. Midstream results were up mainly due to higher volumes, including record NGL pipeline and fractionation volumes. In addition, costs were lower reflecting DCP synergy capture. In chemicals, results increased from higher margins. Refining was slightly lower than last quarter. Higher volumes and reduced operating costs mostly offset the impact of lower crack spreads driven by weaker distillate prices. Marketing and Specialties results were higher mostly due to seasonally stronger margins and volumes. Slide 8 shows the change in cash flow. We had strong cash flow aided by working capital and proceeds from asset dispositions. Working capital was a benefit of $916 million, mainly reflecting changes in accounts receivables and payables that include the impact of falling commodity prices. We received $685 million in cash proceeds from the sale of our 25% interest in REX pipeline. Looking ahead to the third quarter, in chemicals, we expect the Global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90%s. In refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low-90%s and turnaround expense to be between $140 million and $160 million. We anticipate Corporate and Other costs to come in between $330 million and $350 million. For the full year, we expect refining turnaround expense to be between $500 million and $530 million. This is a reduction from previous guidance. And finally, in early August, we will begin publishing a monthly refining market indicator on our Investor Relations website. Now we will open the line for questions, after which Mark will wrap up the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nRoger Read: Yes, thank you. Good morning. I guess I'd like to dive in on the cost-cutting -- the cost-savings realizations. You kind of showed a $1 barrel in refining. I just wanted to understand as you look at it, how much of it is, you're running better, which helps on a per barrel basis, and how much of it is structural and we should think about built-in for the long run here.\nMark Lashier: Yes, Roger, we really view it primarily as structural. Of course, there's going to be the influence of our utilization rate. The denominator gets bigger, the number goes down. But we are focused on driving inefficiencies out of our business across the board. And so it's not only sustainable, we are going to continue to improve on that as we go forward. We're going to focus on controlling the things that we can control, drive cost, and efficiency out without impairing our reliability or our utilization. And so that confidence is based on the cost reductions you're seeing. If we -- as the utilization moves around, the numbers will move around, but over time, they will continue to trend down.\nRich Harbison: Yes, maybe I'll just add a little bit more detail to that, Roger. This is Rich over -- in the Refining group. The first half of the year, we reduced our adjusted controllable cost by $0.83 a barrel and maybe that's best explained by the people that are doing it and maybe a couple of examples here of what we're doing. So, we have over 1,000 employees that have engaged in this process with over 1,000 initiatives that have been driven into our ways of working and actually reducing inefficiencies from the business. And probably no better way to say that than maybe an example here. So, one of the examples is actually using our midstream experience. We do tank turnarounds in refining. We do a lot of tank turnarounds, but our costs were very high on that compared to our midstream part of our organization. So we took the best practices out of the midstream organization, applied them to the refining organization, we were able to drive $5 million a year out of the tank turnaround process. That's one concrete example of how we're changing how we work. There's also another example of our hydrogen plant operations. And we went through an engineering process and reviewed a lot of the engineering principles used to operate that piece of equipment and we changed the steam to carbon ratio through a detailed review. And that ultimately ends up reducing fuel usage, which drove $5.6 million a year of fuel usage out of our cost profile. You add all these thousands of initiatives up and they're well over $600 million of structural costs that's been removed from the system. So I'm very confident that that money, that dollar, that spend has been removed from our cost profile. And it's because of this fantastic work that's been done by our employees. And as Mark indicated, this dollar per barrel will move around with utilization, but that structural change of that cost profile has been removed.\nMark Lashier: Yes, Roger and we've got this mindset now of relentless pursuit of cost efficiencies, but really relentless pursuit of value-creation across the board. And that's what's going to sustain this. We're not -- we're going to transition from business transformation to business excellence as we go forward and you're going to see a sustained focus on value-creation through lower costs and greater efficiencies.\nRoger Read: I appreciate that. Maybe shifting gears a little bit since it's now broken out separately, Rodeo Renewable diesel. Give us kind of an idea of how you think that progresses, right? First, you prove you can run it, which clearly you're doing here at 50,000 barrels a day. Now I would have presume it's about getting the advantaged feedstock through the system. Maybe just an idea of where you are with that in terms of the PTU and kind of the market dynamics there to get that business maybe to, let's say, breakeven and then profitable?\nMark Lashier: Absolutely, Roger. Thanks for the question. First of all, I just want to congratulate the team at Rodeo. They did an incredible job of safely commissioning and ramping up the new facility ahead of schedule, working through all the typical challenges of commissioning. We've got everything online, including both the pre-treatment units. And like I said earlier, we're processing 50,000 barrels a day of renewable feedstocks. And as we speak, we're transitioning to lower CI materials as we optimize the economic performance of the assets. And so we're well positioned on the West Coast to deliver those renewable fuels all the way out to the retail end-user and we'll also be producing renewable jets that we can feed into sustainable aviation fuel. So, the commercial team works globally to secure consistent supplies of a wide range of feedstocks to ensure that we can optimize on the most economic feedslate possible and we've got the pull through to our retail stations that we've built-out in our last-mile strategy around this asset. So we believe that we're well-positioned with a very large-scale facility, has scale advantages, logistics advantages, and market access advantages, and we're going to exploit all those going forward.\nRich Harbison: Yes. So maybe just a little bit more color here. This is Rich again. The pre-treatment unit provides the flexibility and ability to really look at the various feedstocks out there in the marketplace. So we will begin the transition to lower our CI feedstocks, our carbon intensity of our feedstocks. We've been running roughly the soybean in the 50, 55 range. And we're going to work on lowering that here in the third quarter and that continues to lower in the fourth quarter. I wouldn't want to make sure we caution everybody though, not to be overly focused on carbon intensity because value is really driven by multiple factors that include a deliver feedstock cost to the Rodeo facility, the yield structure through the pre-treatment and eventually through the hydrocracking process as well as the carbon intensity value. So, those are all combined into the value proposition. We will also start the production of sustainable aviation fuel or renewable jet in the third quarter here and continue to offer that. We will offer that to the marketplace in the fourth quarter of this year. The facility will be able to blend up to 20,000 barrels a day of sustainable aviation fuel. The Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex, it's open for business. We're pretty excited about it. It's been a journey to get here. And maybe I'll pass it over to Brian a little bit and he can add some more color to the marketplace.\nBrian Mandell: Well, some comments on the marketplace. Biofuels margins were positive in Q2, but they were kind of on the lower end of the range. Even though U.S. renewable diesel fuel consumption was up 10% versus Q1, and we even saw an open up to Europe. So, what I'd say is looking further in the future, we think RD margins will begin to improve, have a list of reasons. First, more renewable jet will be produced. As Rich said, we're working on that in Q3 and Q4 at our own plant and that will reduce the supply of renewable diesel. We see more marginal biodiesel producers continuing to shut. Our RIN prices may increase to make up for the PTC impacts. Demand for distillates in general, we think will begin to firm and the basis will firm, West Coast basis has been very low. Veg oils prices, we think are likely to fall with the addition of crushing plants in the U.S. and Canada. And finally, the PTC program could potentially back-out international imports of renewable diesel. So I would, I guess, end by saying with all that said, there still remains a lot of regulatory uncertainty for next year, including credit programs, potential tariffs, clean-energy policy, and policies aimed at protecting farmers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, Mark and team. Very solid set of results. One of the big deltas versus our model was in Midstream. And so I wanted to give you guys an opportunity to talk about the momentum you're seeing there, particularly with the NGL price realizations and volumes. And any color about what we should carry forward here?\nMark Lashier: Thanks, Neil. Yes, the Midstream had a great quarter, strong volumes and they're benefiting from the synergy capture and the business transformation cost reductions they're experiencing as well. So I'll turn it over to Don and he'll get his first shot in the barrel here.\nDon Baldridge: Hi, Neil, thanks for the question. Yes, when you look at our second quarter results, certainly the improved costs are a standout. I mean, I think that's a testament to our continued focus on the DCP integration work. We completed the last major milestone of our DCP integration in Q1. So, that was really around our back office and our IT system. So that's positioned us well for some organizational efficiencies and cost savings that give us a lot of confidence in hitting our synergy capture for the DCP transaction. But as you mentioned, our NGL volume performance was quite strong throughout the quarter. That's really a testament to the team running quite well, all of our assets. We've got just a lot of positive momentum in the basins that we're connected to and able to run that volume through our system. So, it's really great to see that. From a pricing standpoint, actually, pricing was a little off for the quarter compared to the previous one, but I think it's really the throughput and the fee-based performance that's driving the business. And I'd say as we pivot to Q3, there's some seasonality in our Q2, some one-timers. But as you look at Q3, we'll have some volume impact with the Hurricane Beryl, taken some power outages at some of the some of the systems that we're connected to, so that would have a volume impact. But I think we are in a good spot and really feel like we're executing well on our wellhead-to-market strategy.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, team. And then the follow-up is just on asset sales. Can you remind us where we stand around -- specifically around the retail and marketing sale in Europe and how we're tracking towards the $3 billion target broadly.\nMark Lashier: Yes, thanks, Neil. We are in active discussions around those assets. There's been strong interest. We have got a number of players interested in those assets. And so we won't really comment further, but it would be a significant step in our asset disposition program.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Royall with JPMorgan. John, please go ahead.\nJohn Royall: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So my first question is on your path back to your leverage target. I think you're sitting at 36% today and I think you've made clear the priority is return of capital in terms of hitting the return of capital target versus the leverage target of this year. But looking into next year, is there a path to get you back to target levels? Are the expected asset sales enough to get you there? Or is there a possibility you could see an adjustment down on returns of capital to get yourself back in that range? And I think Mark reiterated the 50% target in his comments on the return of capital, but just any commentary there would be helpful.\nKevin Mitchell: Yes, John, it's Kevin. So as you alluded, we will hit the $13 billion to $15 billion target range this year. We're well on our way to that. As we all know, the refining margin right now is a weaker environment than we've seen in a little while, but nonetheless, we're still confident in our ability to return cash and meet targets. But that does mean the balance sheet may take a little impact in the near term. But when we look ahead to next year, we're quite confident in the cash-generating capabilities of the business. We have EBITDA growth coming and we also expect to generate cash from asset dispositions. So when you put all that together, we feel quite confident that we can both return greater than operating cash flow to shareholders, which we have committed as a target. And at the same time, manage the balance sheet to where we want it to be. We're not giving absolute dollar cash return targets for next year. At this point, that will be something we'll evaluate in the second half of the year. But we think by the time we get through next year, we'll be in a good spot with regards to cash returns to shareholders and balance sheet.\nJohn Royall: Great. Thanks, Kevin. And then my follow-up on the M&A side. The Pinnacle acquisition, I think, demonstrated that you're looking at both the buy-side and the sell-side in terms of M&A. And can you talk more about the buy-side? Is there more to do maybe around the midstream business or what else might you look to bolt-on or maybe the Pinnacle was -- acquisition was more of a one-off and we shouldn't expect more acquisitions.\nMark Lashier: Yes. Thanks, John. We've laid out and built out this Wellhead-to-market midstream backbone, and we think that we have the ability to leverage into assets like Pinnacle. Pinnacle, I would say, instead of being a one off, it kind of epitomizes what we're looking for there. Assets that connected to our system can generate more value than they would be standing alone with their existing owners. And Pinnacle was a great acquisition because we were able to pick up this asset that is immediately accretive, that's backed by solid fee-based contracts, and it also affords us an opportunity to almost on a shovel-ready basis to add to that position organically. So it's kind of an inorganic and organic play and we're able to get it at good value and be accretive from the get-go. And so I think things like that in that ballpark are exactly the kinds of opportunities we're looking for to enhance our wellhead-to-market position, particularly in the Permian Basin.\nJohn Royall: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Ryan, please go ahead.\nRyan Todd: Yes, thanks. Maybe the first one for me, as we think about, you're a few months into operations now with the TMX pipeline. Can you maybe talk about what you've seen in terms of impact on Canadian crude availability, pricing, impacts on the West Coast dynamics at all? And then maybe more broadly, your outlook for heavy crude differentials over the back half of this year?\nBrian Mandell: Yes. Hi, this is Brian. I'd say that so far the pipeline is running 650,000 to 675,000 barrels, heading to 700,000 barrels by end of the year. About two-thirds of the incremental TMX barrels have been going to Asia, which has been a bit of a surprise for us and about a third to the West Coast. We benefit from barrels to the West Coast in both our Ferndale and particularly in our L.A. refineries. I think as we think about going forward, we've seen additions of Canadian production of up to 200,000 barrels by the end of year we think. And so we think basically those barrels will continue to grow. And in 2, 2.5 years, 3 years, we think increased Canadian production will put more pressure on the pipelines. The pipelines will be full once again and that will widen out the differentials.\nRyan Todd: Great. Thanks for that detail. And then maybe just a question is, if we frame your refining utilization guidance for the third quarter, it's a bit lower than what you were running during the second quarter. Is this primarily driven by turnaround activity or some commercial pullback in operations given margin headwinds? And maybe put that in the context of more broadly, what you're seeing in terms of kind of the refining macro as you look over the next quarter or two?\nRich Harbison: No, I'll start here with the third -- this is Rich. I'll start with the third quarter guidance there on utilization. We're actually guiding down right now because we do see softening in the market, and particularly in some regions on the coast, both West and East Coast. But we're also going to take this opportunity as well to do some discretionary maintenance as the market has softened a little bit. And that's fully intended to ensure we remain in a position to be able to run strong when the market returns and conditions improve. But we do see a little bit of softening right now in the marketplace. On a more broader approach, I'll probably -- I'll turn that over to Brian there to talk about the broader macro components.\nBrian Mandell: Sure, So just thinking about a gasoline diesel jet, maybe start with gasoline. What we're seeing is global gasoline demand up about 1%, but down about 1% in the U.S. Our gasoline margins in Q2 were about where they were in Q1, but have been firming in the last few weeks with some larger refineries and extended outages. We've seen U.S. gasoline inventories fall now to below five-year averages and exports running about 900,000 barrels a day. But as Rich mentioned, we've been seeing economic run cuts, recent DOEs have shown a stronger implied gasoline and diesel demand. But week-to-week, the DOEs can be somewhat noisy. So we think with fall turnarounds and everything I've mentioned, this should help balance out the markets on gasoline. On the diesel, global diesel demand has been down about 1% to 1.5%, but maybe slightly more in the U.S. and Europe of late. We've seen the U.S. truck tonnage recover some. It was off 2.7% in Jan through April, and in May, it was up 1.8%. So U.S. distillate stocks have also fallen a good bit under five-year average now. And then finally, the really bright spot is the global jet demand remains strong, 10% year-over-year, strong passenger throughput. In fact, in the U.S., throughput is now above 2019 levels, U.S. jet demand up about 4%. And I'd say, finally, although jet inventories are high in the U.S., U.S. jet cracks are generally leading gasoline and diesel in all regions.\nMark Lashier: Yes, at the 50,000-foot level, Ryan, I think that your refineries across the U.S. industry ran very well last quarter. And you think about what we've gone through in the last few years, the economics have been very strong for the U.S. refining fleet. Everybody's had the cash flow to repair and clean up all of their equipment and it all came together, I think, last quarter, and then you have a little bit of the impact of some of the long-anticipated new volumes coming into market. But as we look out into the medium and long term, we see several things. U.S. remains advantaged versus much of the rest of the world. There's limited capacity growth beyond 2025 and global demand continues to increase. So, when we look at the medium and long term, supply and demand will realign and we remain bullish on the medium, long-term refining fundamentals. So I think we've got even better days to come.\nRyan Todd: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead, Matthew.\nMatthew Blair: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, on the refining side, your capture did move down in the second quarter, which seemed pretty understandable, just given some of the challenges on co-products, as well as narrowing crude diffs. Could you talk about the trends on capture so far in the third quarter? Do you expect things to improve here? And also, you mentioned in the midstream side a little bit of a headwind from the hurricane. Were any of your refining assets impacted in the third quarter?\nRich Harbison: Hi, Matt, this is Rich. Let me -- I'll start with the second question first. The hurricane impacts for our operation were minimal to none, I would characterize them. They -- there was no substantial impact to any of the refining assets. There were some logistics -- surrounding support logistics impacts, primarily on the electrical supply front, which were very short-term lived. And we were able to get those assets supplied up with some electricity and back online and back in the market very, very quickly. Third quarter, it's off to a reasonable start. Certainly some carryover from the second quarter, but generally, we don't provide that much level of guidance in the level of third quarter. As far as operationally, we don't have any -- other than our turnaround guidance that we've provided there and the outlooks, and our utilization where we think it will be is reflective of what we see the market. Kevin here can provide a little bit more detail on that from his point of view.\nKevin Mitchell: Yes, Matt, I was just going to emphasize the point that I made earlier on that, next, we will start publishing our new refining indicator, which is a -- it will be a closer reflection of our actual assets, geographies, yield structures, crude slates. And so, we'll be -- we'll publish that for July next week. And so, we would expect our actual realized margin to track closer with that new indicator than our historic, more generic 3-2-1 crack. So you'll get a little bit of a look next week when we get that out on our website.\nMatthew Blair: Looking forward to it. Thanks. And then on the chem side, could you talk about your expectations for polyethylene pricing in the back half of the year? I'm seeing spot prices that are already up almost $0.02 a pound even since the start of Q3. And any sort of insights you have on just overall PE demand, and inventory levels would be helpful, too. Thanks.\nMark Lashier: Yes, absolutely, Matt. CPChem continues to operate really, really well, and they're seeing strengthening demand in North America, as well as strengthening exports, which would certainly support the view that margins would continue to recover. European producers are struggling with the current cost environment, and Middle East producers face some export challenges because of the Red Sea-Suez Canal access; all on balance, favorable to CPChem. So we're seeing those margins gradually improve and we continue to be constructive medium to long term as the value chain works out of that trough that we saw a few quarters ago. And I think we do see the inventory position improving, particularly domestically, which -- also, since the U.S. is a large exporter now, lower domestic inventories indicates that the world markets are stronger, too.\nMatthew Blair: Great. Thank you.\nMark Lashier: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJason Gabelman: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. The first one I wanted to ask is on the mid-cycle EBITDA guidance that you have previously spoken about at -- I think it's $13 billion to $14 billion, if I'm not mistaken. How is that trending so far? Do you still feel confident in that outlook? And where do you see some divergences between the outlook and the different segments? Thanks.\nMark Lashier: Yes. Thanks, Jason. We continue to believe that $14 billion is the EBITDA that we can generate at mid-cycle conditions and that we will be in position by 2025, given the mid-cycle conditions, to achieve that $14 billion. Now, I want to be clear that this isn't guidance for 2025 that we believe that we will have the projects, the cost structure, the initiatives in place to achieve the $14 billion if we were at mid-cycle across the board. And whether or not we'll be at mid-cycle in all of our operating units in 2025 is another discussion. I think you've seen the strong performance in midstream. We see midstream at or above mid-cycle. Strong performance in marketing and specialties. Chemicals is recovering, but not likely to be at mid-cycle. We don't believe -- well, we haven't really established a mid-cycle for renewable fuels, but we don't believe that the renewable fuels segment will be at what we are inferring as a mid-cycle for that segment. And I think the big question is around refining. And we continue to execute projects to upgrade the value of the streams that we control, to enhance the market capture through our commercial operations. We continue to lower our costs, and we talked about how sustainable those cost improvements are. And that's what gives us the confidence that we will that see refining able to contribute to that $14 billion of mid-cycle EBITDA.\nJason Gabelman: Great. Thanks. And my follow-up's specifically on midstream. It's been pretty volatile since the close of the DCP deal, $100 million-plus EBITDA swings quarter-to-quarter in a segment that we typically think of as being more stable quarter-to-quarter. Could you just give us a sense of why that volatility has been occurring and if you expect the segment to be this volatile moving forward? Thanks.\nDon Baldridge: Yes, this is Don Baldridge. I think some of that volatility is really a reflection of the integration efforts and timing of the integration. And so, as I mentioned, we're just finishing up the last major milestone in Q1 of our IT and back office systems. And I think that's going to really help us kind of normalize and eliminate a lot of the variability that you may have seen through the timing and sequence of the integration efforts. So my expectation is that we're on track to the $3.6 billion EBITDA guidance. If you look at our kind of trailing four quarters, we're on that path, and I think you're going to see us stabilize around that $675 million a quarter of IBT. So that's how we see it, and I think we're well positioned to start delivering on that.\nJason Gabelman: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: The next question comes from Doug Leggate with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks, guys. I apologize, my line dropped earlier, so I think I lost my place, but I appreciate you taking my questions. So, guys, I wanted to come back to the question of the medium-term refining outlook. I think you know where we've been historically on this. But our concern right now is that everybody, including yourself, is running really well. Whiting is back, for example. Utilization is on top of new capacity that's been added both here and elsewhere. And I guess, my question is, when you talk about medium term, does it require another major turnaround cycle to clean up the capacity congestion we're seeing? Because it seems that the U.S. can handle 95% utilization as a generic level.\nMark Lashier: I think as I talked about earlier, Doug, you're seeing a number of positive factors around utilization aligned in the last quarter. And historically, it's just not been sustainable to see that level of utilization across the industry. So, everything is clean, shiny, bright, new, and operating very well across the industry. And I think that you will see that, yes, it will roll into a normal turnaround cycle as things naturally evolve. So I don't think you'll see the kind of utilizations we witnessed on a sustainable basis across the industry.\nDoug Leggate: Yes, it seems that everybody is running well post COVID, it seems. But I appreciate that. We'll continue to watch it. I guess, I listened to your comments about renewable diesel and the $14 billion. And obviously, mid-cycle is a moving target. But can you help us with what you're seeing since the plant came up versus, let's say, that $700 million benchmark? Do you have any line of sight on RINs sorting themselves out to the point where that becomes a realistic target, or do you feel like you need to reset that lower at some point?\nMark Lashier: Yes, I think that RINs, LCFS, producer's tax credits, all are in -- are responding to the increased volumes. And the various jurisdictions will, over time, respond to ensure that there's incentives to run. Brian is our expert in those matters, but we're constructive on it in the long run.\nBrian Mandell: Yes. And I'd say we're not ready to adjust our mid-cycle yet. We'll see. But you have to have the credits to incentivize people to run renewable diesel. And so, we think, over time, those incentives will be there.\nMark Lashier: Yes. And part of what you're seeing now is just the length in distillate. So, that's a big part of renewable diesel that has to -- all those incentives have to float on top, just the base value of distillate. And there's quite a bit of volume that's been brought to the market and I think you'll see markets respond and realign around that.\nDoug Leggate: Great. Thanks for your answers, guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nPaul Cheng: Hi, guys, good afternoon or good morning, your time. First, Tim, congratulations on the retirement and thank you for the help. And also, thanks for the -- giving -- breaking out renewable diesel business and also that -- some of the new chart in your presentation is helpful. Two questions. First, TMX, do you gentlemen believe that the impact in the West Coast market is already fully felt at this point or that you think additional changes may still come? And from that standpoint, how that impact your West Coast refining operation, if any? Have you changed the way how you run it? That's the first question.\nBrian Mandell: So, maybe I'll start. I think that TMX is almost up to what we think will be full capacity, 700,000 barrels a day. So we think, currently, if Asia continues taking the same two-thirds of the barrels, we're basically seeing the impact that it will have. And as far as our refineries, I've mentioned that we've got more barrels in the Ferndale, but its biggest impact has been on LA, where we're able to get more barrels into LA at advantaged prices.\nPaul Cheng: And just curious, I mean, if we're looking at California, I think three months ago, we had this conversation, where we thought in the summer, California will be very strong margin, given you shut down Rodeo early in the year. But that was not the case. And so, do you have any sense that, I mean, how the demand seems? You have retail operation in California. Can you tell us that how is the California market shaking up in terms of demand?\nBrian Mandell: Yes. So, I would say that after we shut Rodeo, the gasoline production there to make our renewable diesel, many market players, including us, Phillips 66, saw a need and an opportunity to resupply the market to ensure that California gasoline demand was met. And so, during Q2, more supply than needed made its way into the market and it put pressure on the basis and the margin basis came off $0.80 per gallon. But as the markets adjust to less domestic supply and more international supply, which will come in and ensure the market remains balanced, so timing of ships and imports into the market may cause some volatility from time to time, as we saw recently with the oversupply, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: But I mean, how is your retail service station over there? How they perform? In terms of the same-store sales, can -- is there any information you can share?\nBrian Mandell: Yes. Demand in the West Coast has been off some, but the stores and the performance and marketing have been strong. So, I would say that we're seeing some same-store sales demand off slightly, but not much. And we've seen the business doing well.\nPaul Cheng: I see. Okay, good news. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTheresa Chen: Hi. Going back to the early discussion of the Permian NGL build-out, for additional processing capacity growth from here, how do you balance the ability to grow organically versus inorganically, just given your midstream competitors on the NGL side right in the same area of the Midland, spending around $200 million per 200 MMcf per day processing plant built organically versus purchasing at over 2x that rate, plus the option to build another plant? Does the Pinnacle acquisition give you more organic opportunities in general or will a lot of this have to come inorganically?\nMark Lashier: Yes, Theresa, I think that when you think about the Pinnacle acquisition, it does just that. And yes, we understand that a -- the newbuild multiple would be lower than the multiple you'd have to pay for a going concern. And you have to remember that we also brought in some very good high-quality, long-term fee-based contracts. And so, with an inorganic acquisition, you get to turn that earnings on instantaneously and you've got the contracts already there in place, and they're solid and you know exactly what you're getting. Organic growth, of course, there's a time lag. And so, you build it, you've got the construction risk, the time lag risk, and then you've got to go out and contract it. We're not adverse to doing that, but we think where we can bring in high-quality existing assets, backed by strong contracts tied right in the middle of our system, it makes tremendous sense. And we'll continue to look at organic opportunities as well. So it's not an and, it's not an either/or, but if the opportunity is right, we'll acquire. If we need to build, we'll build.\nTheresa Chen: Got it. And as we look from now to the end of the decade and the sheer volume of upcoming Permian to Mont Belvieu NGL contract roll-off or Permian to Gulf Coast in general, how should we think about the weighted average rate on Sand Hills with all the legacy contracts in mind compared with the current going rate of, call it, mid-single digit cents per gallon?\nDon Baldridge: Sure. This is Don. Yes, if you look at our pipeline system, almost 80% of that is contracted under long term, over five years in duration. And so, as we see contract terms shift, we're pretty comfortable with our outlook. There's some obviously, volumes that we recontract on a go-forward regular basis that are closer to the current market. But we feel pretty good about our outlook in terms of our earnings power across our -- over our broad NGL long-haul pipelines.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Laetsch with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJoe Laetsch: Hi, team. Thanks for taking my questions. So I wanted to ask more on the regional dynamic side. So I know you mentioned some weakness on the coasts, but what are you seeing in the central corridor in terms of balances and margins there?\nRich Harbison: Thanks, Joe. This is Rich. So on the coasts, let's start on the Atlantic Basin side. Margin decreases did materialize and they really centered around the distillate pricing. And then we also saw some impacts on our secondary products. And what was happening on the secondary products was their prices were dropping as crude prices were rising. So, that was the bigger impact to market capture and margin collection on the Atlantic Basin. Now that -- on our operation, that was partially offset by strong operating performance. The assets ran at 98% utilization and they also had a high clean product yield of 87%. So our efforts to continue to improve the business are offsetting these swings in -- that we're seeing in the marketplace. On the West Coast, volumes were primarily higher for us due to the absence of a first-quarter turnaround at our Los Angeles refinery. The West Coast utilization was sitting at a nice 93% and the clean product yields were also up at 86%. So the plants were running well and putting product on the market. What we saw on our West Coast, the change in refining was primarily due to moving the San Francisco refinery Rodeo into the renewable fuels segment. So, we saw that move some costs out of refining and into the renewable fuel segment. But the West Coast operation always to remember, it is our highest operation -- cost operating -- high-cost operation in our portfolio. And Mark -- or Brian has gone through the demand and the margins on the West Coast. So I think that was enough color on that front. But we see that shift from San Francisco out of the refining into the renewable segment, kind of cleaning up our profile on the West Coast there. And then the Central Coast -- or central corridor, I should say, the margins, what I saw in my numbers were the margins were relatively flat with two things occurring in that. We saw a benefit of an inventory impact that was a headwind in the first quarter. There was a $100 million inventory swing. So we saw that. So when we're looking at it quarter-over-quarter, that impact was not existing in the second quarter and that was mostly offsetting lower feedstock advantages doing to the -- our discussion around Trans Mountain Pipeline and the lower Canadian crude differentials. Our assets in the central corridor ran very well at 102% utilization, which is an outstanding performance by that part of the organization.\nJoe Laetsch: Great. Thanks for all the detail there. Shifting gears a little bit. I was hoping you could talk to the outlook for the marketing and specialties business here. So, 2Q and 3Q are typically seasonally stronger periods, but anything you could share on the setup for the rest of the year? And then I also think there were some minor changes with Rodeo getting broken out. So any color there would be great. Thank you.\nBrian Mandell: Yes. This is Brian. We had a good quarter in Q2 with earnings increases seasonally from Q1. Our marketing business in U.S. and Europe along with lubricants business all showing improvements from prior quarter on the back of seasonality and falling prices. So we think that will continue in Q3. Seasonality in Q3 is usually good for the [technical difficulty]. And to your point on the renewable segment, we've moved the value of the marketing renewables business to the new segment, which is about $30 million to $50 million per quarter.\nJoe Laetsch: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mark Lashier for closing comments.\nMark Lashier: Thank you for all your questions. Our team is executing across the board and delivering on our strategic priorities. The business transformation that we've been going through is driving $1 billion of cost reductions per year and lowering our refining costs per barrel. And we've got strong refining availability that contributed to our highest crude utilization rate in over five years and Midstream reported near-record results, benefiting from strong operating performance and continued synergy capture. At Rodeo, we're processing approximately 50,000 barrels per day of renewable feedstocks. We're optimizing our portfolio to generate incremental shareholder value and increase shareholder returns. Thank you for your interest in Phillips 66. If you have questions after today's call, please call Jeff or Owen.\nOperator: Thank you everyone for joining us today. This concludes our call and you may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Don Baldridge",
            "content": "Hi, Neil, thanks for the question. Yes, when you look at our second quarter results, certainly the improved costs are a standout. I mean, I think that's a testament to our continued focus on the DCP integration work. We completed the last major milestone of our DCP integration in Q1. So, that was really around our back office and our IT system. So that's positioned us well for some organizational efficiencies and cost savings that give us a lot of confidence in hitting our synergy capture for the DCP transaction. But as you mentioned, our NGL volume performance was quite strong throughout the quarter. That's really a testament to the team running quite well, all of our assets. We've got just a lot of positive momentum in the basins that we're connected to and able to run that volume through our system. So, it's really great to see that. From a pricing standpoint, actually, pricing was a little off for the quarter compared to the previous one, but I think it's really the throughput and the fee-based performance that's driving the business. And I'd say as we pivot to Q3, there's some seasonality in our Q2, some one-timers. But as you look at Q3, we'll have some volume impact with the Hurricane Beryl, taken some power outages at some of the some of the systems that we're connected to, so that would have a volume impact. But I think we are in a good spot and really feel like we're executing well on our wellhead-to-market strategy. Yes, this is Don Baldridge. I think some of that volatility is really a reflection of the integration efforts and timing of the integration. And so, as I mentioned, we're just finishing up the last major milestone in Q1 of our IT and back office systems.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Brian Mandell",
            "content": "Well, some comments on the marketplace. Biofuels margins were positive in Q2, but they were kind of on the lower end of the range. Even though U.S. renewable diesel fuel consumption was up 10% versus Q1, and we even saw an open up to Europe. So, what I'd say is looking further in the future, we think RD margins will begin to improve, have a list of reasons. First, more renewable jet will be produced. As Rich said, we're working on that in Q3 and Q4 at our own plant and that will reduce the supply of renewable diesel. We see more marginal biodiesel producers continuing to shut. Our RIN prices may increase to make up for the PTC impacts. Demand for distillates in general, we think will begin to firm and the basis will firm, West Coast basis has been very low. Veg oils prices, we think are likely to fall with the addition of crushing plants in the U.S. and Canada. And finally, the PTC program could potentially back-out international imports of renewable diesel. So I would, I guess, end by saying with all that said, there still remains a lot of regulatory uncertainty for next year, including credit programs, potential tariffs, clean-energy policy, and policies aimed at protecting farmers. Yes. Hi, this is Brian. I'd say that so far the pipeline is running 650,000 to 675,000 barrels, heading to 700,000 barrels by end of the year. About two-thirds of the incremental TMX barrels have been going to Asia, which has been a bit of a surprise for us and about a third to the West Coast. We benefit from barrels to the West Coast in both our Ferndale and particularly in our L.A. refineries. I think as we think about going forward, we've seen additions of Canadian production of up to 200,000 barrels by the end of year we think. And so we think basically those barrels will continue to grow. And in 2, 2.5 years, 3 years, we think increased Canadian production will put more pressure on the pipelines. The pipelines will be full once again and that will widen out the differentials. Sure, So just thinking about a gasoline diesel jet, maybe start with gasoline. What we're seeing is global gasoline demand up about 1%, but down about 1% in the U.S. Our gasoline margins in Q2 were about where they were in Q1, but have been firming in the last few weeks with some larger refineries and extended outages. We've seen U.S. gasoline inventories fall now to below five-year averages and exports running about 900,000 barrels a day. But as Rich mentioned, we've been seeing economic run cuts, recent DOEs have shown a stronger implied gasoline and diesel demand. But week-to-week, the DOEs can be somewhat noisy. So we think with fall turnarounds and everything I've mentioned, this should help balance out the markets on gasoline. On the diesel, global diesel demand has been down about 1% to 1.5%, but maybe slightly more in the U.S. and Europe of late. We've seen the U.S. truck tonnage recover some. It was off 2.7% in Jan through April, and in May, it was up 1.8%. So U.S. distillate stocks have also fallen a good bit under five-year average now. And then finally, the really bright spot is the global jet demand remains strong, 10% year-over-year, strong passenger throughput. In fact, in the U.S., throughput is now above 2019 levels, U.S. jet demand up about 4%. And I'd say, finally, although jet inventories are high in the U.S., U.S. jet cracks are generally leading gasoline and diesel in all regions. Yes. And I'd say we're not ready to adjust our mid-cycle yet. We'll see. But you have to have the credits to incentivize people to run renewable diesel. And so, we think, over time, those incentives will be there. So, maybe I'll start. I think that TMX is almost up to what we think will be full capacity, 700,000 barrels a day. So we think, currently, if Asia continues taking the same two-thirds of the barrels, we're basically seeing the impact that it will have. And as far as our refineries, I've mentioned that we've got more barrels in the Ferndale, but its biggest impact has been on LA, where we're able to get more barrels into LA at advantaged prices. Yes. So, I would say that after we shut Rodeo, the gasoline production there to make our renewable diesel, many market players, including us, Phillips 66, saw a need and an opportunity to resupply the market to ensure that California gasoline demand was met. And so, during Q2, more supply than needed made its way into the market and it put pressure on the basis and the margin basis came off $0.80 per gallon. But as the markets adjust to less domestic supply and more international supply, which will come in and ensure the market remains balanced, so timing of ships and imports into the market may cause some volatility from time to time, as we saw recently with the oversupply, Paul. Yes. Demand in the West Coast has been off some, but the stores and the performance and marketing have been strong. So, I would say that we're seeing some same-store sales demand off slightly, but not much. And we've seen the business doing well. Yes. This is Brian. We had a good quarter in Q2 with earnings increases seasonally from Q1. Our marketing business in U.S. and Europe along with lubricants business all showing improvements from prior quarter on the back of seasonality and falling prices. So we think that will continue in Q3. Seasonality in Q3 is usually good for the [technical difficulty]. And to your point on the renewable segment, we've moved the value of the marketing renewables business to the new segment, which is about $30 million to $50 million per quarter."

            "name": "Rich Harbison",
            "content": "Yes, maybe I'll just add a little bit more detail to that, Roger. This is Rich over -- in the Refining group. The first half of the year, we reduced our adjusted controllable cost by $0.83 a barrel and maybe that's best explained by the people that are doing it and maybe a couple of examples here of what we're doing. So, we have over 1,000 employees that have engaged in this process with over 1,000 initiatives that have been driven into our ways of working and actually reducing inefficiencies from the business. And probably no better way to say that than maybe an example here. So, one of the examples is actually using our midstream experience. We do tank turnarounds in refining. We do a lot of tank turnarounds, but our costs were very high on that compared to our midstream part of our organization. So we took the best practices out of the midstream organization, applied them to the refining organization, we were able to drive $5 million a year out of the tank turnaround process. That's one concrete example of how we're changing how we work. There's also another example of our hydrogen plant operations. And we went through an engineering process and reviewed a lot of the engineering principles used to operate that piece of equipment and we changed the steam to carbon ratio through a detailed review. And that ultimately ends up reducing fuel usage, which drove $5.6 million a year of fuel usage out of our cost profile. You add all these thousands of initiatives up and they're well over $600 million of structural costs that's been removed from the system. So I'm very confident that that money, that dollar, that spend has been removed from our cost profile. And it's because of this fantastic work that's been done by our employees. And as Mark indicated, this dollar per barrel will move around with utilization, but that structural change of that cost profile has been removed. Yes. So maybe just a little bit more color here. This is Rich again. The pre-treatment unit provides the flexibility and ability to really look at the various feedstocks out there in the marketplace. So we will begin the transition to lower our CI feedstocks, our carbon intensity of our feedstocks. We've been running roughly the soybean in the 50, 55 range. And we're going to work on lowering that here in the third quarter and that continues to lower in the fourth quarter. I wouldn't want to make sure we caution everybody though, not to be overly focused on carbon intensity because value is really driven by multiple factors that include a deliver feedstock cost to the Rodeo facility, the yield structure through the pre-treatment and eventually through the hydrocracking process as well as the carbon intensity value. So, those are all combined into the value proposition. We will also start the production of sustainable aviation fuel or renewable jet in the third quarter here and continue to offer that. We will offer that to the marketplace in the fourth quarter of this year. The facility will be able to blend up to 20,000 barrels a day of sustainable aviation fuel. The Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex, it's open for business. We're pretty excited about it. It's been a journey to get here. And maybe I'll pass it over to Brian a little bit and he can add some more color to the marketplace. No, I'll start here with the third -- this is Rich. I'll start with the third quarter guidance there on utilization. We're actually guiding down right now because we do see softening in the market, and particularly in some regions on the coast, both West and East Coast. But we're also going to take this opportunity as well to do some discretionary maintenance as the market has softened a little bit. And that's fully intended to ensure we remain in a position to be able to run strong when the market returns and conditions improve. But we do see a little bit of softening right now in the marketplace. On a more broader approach, I'll probably -- I'll turn that over to Brian there to talk about the broader macro components. Hi, Matt, this is Rich. Let me -- I'll start with the second question first. The hurricane impacts for our operation were minimal to none, I would characterize them. They -- there was no substantial impact to any of the refining assets. There were some logistics -- surrounding support logistics impacts, primarily on the electrical supply front, which were very short-term lived. And we were able to get those assets supplied up with some electricity and back online and back in the market very, very quickly. Third quarter, it's off to a reasonable start. Certainly some carryover from the second quarter, but generally, we don't provide that much level of guidance in the level of third quarter. As far as operationally, we don't have any -- other than our turnaround guidance that we've provided there and the outlooks, and our utilization where we think it will be is reflective of what we see the market. Kevin here can provide a little bit more detail on that from his point of view. Thanks, Joe. This is Rich. So on the coasts, let's start on the Atlantic Basin side. Margin decreases did materialize and they really centered around the distillate pricing. And then we also saw some impacts on our secondary products. And what was happening on the secondary products was their prices were dropping as crude prices were rising. So, that was the bigger impact to market capture and margin collection on the Atlantic Basin. Now that -- on our operation, that was partially offset by strong operating performance. The assets ran at 98% utilization and they also had a high clean product yield of 87%. So our efforts to continue to improve the business are offsetting these swings in -- that we're seeing in the marketplace. On the West Coast, volumes were primarily higher for us due to the absence of a first-quarter turnaround at our Los Angeles refinery. The West Coast utilization was sitting at a nice 93% and the clean product yields were also up at 86%. So the plants were running well and putting product on the market. What we saw on our West Coast, the change in refining was primarily due to moving the San Francisco refinery Rodeo into the renewable fuels segment. So, we saw that move some costs out of refining and into the renewable fuel segment. But the West Coast operation always to remember, it is our highest operation -- cost operating -- high-cost operation in our portfolio. And Mark -- or Brian has gone through the demand and the margins on the West Coast. So I think that was enough color on that front. But we see that shift from San Francisco out of the refining into the renewable segment, kind of cleaning up our profile on the West Coast there. And then the Central Coast -- or central corridor, I should say, the margins, what I saw in my numbers were the margins were relatively flat with two things occurring in that. We saw a benefit of an inventory impact that was a headwind in the first quarter. There was a $100 million inventory swing. So we saw that. So when we're looking at it quarter-over-quarter, that impact was not existing in the second quarter and that was mostly offsetting lower feedstock advantages doing to the -- our discussion around Trans Mountain Pipeline and the lower Canadian crude differentials. Our assets in the central corridor ran very well at 102% utilization, which is an outstanding performance by that part of the organization."

            "content": "Thanks, Jeff. Welcome, everyone, to our second quarter earnings call. First, I'd like to introduce Don Baldridge, our new EVP of Midstream and Chemicals. He previously served as the Interim CEO of DCP and brings a wealth of Midstream experience to Phillips 66. I also want to wish Tim Roberts the best in his retirement and thank him for his contributions to Phillips 66, including being instrumental in executing our NGL wellhead-to-market strategy. Let's turn to our second quarter performance. We continue to systematically execute on our strategic priorities, focusing on what we control. The improvements are visible in our results. Since July 2022, we've returned over $11 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We expect to achieve our $13 billion to $15 billion target by the end of the year. Share repurchases will continue to be a priority in our capital allocation plan. We are committed to returning over 50% of our operating cash flows to shareholders. In refining, we're enhancing performance and reducing our cost structure. Crude utilization during the quarter was our highest at over -- in over five years at 98% and clean product yield was 86%. In addition, we've lowered our costs by nearly $1 per barrel. In Midstream, we continue to benefit from synergy capture as we execute on our NGL wellhead-to-market strategy. Earlier this month, we closed on our acquisition of Pinnacle Midstream. It was a bolt-on to our natural gas-gathering and processing business and grows our stable earnings with high-quality 100% fee-based long-term contracts. The assets are strategically located near our existing Permian footprint in the liquids-rich Midland Basin. In the second quarter, we sold our 25% non-operated interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline for $685 million. We generated over $1 billion from asset dispositions toward our previously announced target of more than $3 billion. By the end of the second quarter, the Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex reached full rates with the startup of the second hydrocracker and both pre-treatment units. The complex is processing approximately 50,000 barrels per day of renewable feedstocks. On the next two slides, I'll focus on the improvements we've made to our cost structure. We're approaching our $1.4 billion run rate savings target and the results are hitting the bottom line. Slide 4 provides cost detail at the total company level compared with the first half of 2022. We've supported growing our business while mitigating inflationary impacts through business transformation. We've realized approximately $400 million in cost reductions, including our share of WRB costs. Additionally, we've been successful in driving efficiencies in our logistics spend that flow-through margin, as well as lowering our sustaining capital spend. Slide 5 highlights how our business transformation efforts have translated into a lower refining cost per barrel. Adjusted controllable costs, excluding turnarounds were $5.93 per barrel. We're closing in on our target to lower cost by $1 per barrel. We continue to increase shareholder value through strong operating performance and disciplined capital allocation as we deliver on our strategic priorities. I want to recognize our employees for their hard work and dedication to driving value creation for shareholders. Kevin, over to you. Yes, Roger, we really view it primarily as structural. Of course, there's going to be the influence of our utilization rate. The denominator gets bigger, the number goes down. But we are focused on driving inefficiencies out of our business across the board. And so it's not only sustainable, we are going to continue to improve on that as we go forward. We're going to focus on controlling the things that we can control, drive cost, and efficiency out without impairing our reliability or our utilization. And so that confidence is based on the cost reductions you're seeing. If we -- as the utilization moves around, the numbers will move around, but over time, they will continue to trend down. Yes, Roger and we've got this mindset now of relentless pursuit of cost efficiencies, but really relentless pursuit of value-creation across the board. And that's what's going to sustain this. We're not -- we're going to transition from business transformation to business excellence as we go forward and you're going to see a sustained focus on value-creation through lower costs and greater efficiencies. Absolutely, Roger. Thanks for the question. First of all, I just want to congratulate the team at Rodeo. They did an incredible job of safely commissioning and ramping up the new facility ahead of schedule, working through all the typical challenges of commissioning. We've got everything online, including both the pre-treatment units. And like I said earlier, we're processing 50,000 barrels a day of renewable feedstocks. And as we speak, we're transitioning to lower CI materials as we optimize the economic performance of the assets. And so we're well positioned on the West Coast to deliver those renewable fuels all the way out to the retail end-user and we'll also be producing renewable jets that we can feed into sustainable aviation fuel. So, the commercial team works globally to secure consistent supplies of a wide range of feedstocks to ensure that we can optimize on the most economic feedslate possible and we've got the pull through to our retail stations that we've built-out in our last-mile strategy around this asset. So we believe that we're well-positioned with a very large-scale facility, has scale advantages, logistics advantages, and market access advantages, and we're going to exploit all those going forward. Thanks, Neil. Yes, the Midstream had a great quarter, strong volumes and they're benefiting from the synergy capture and the business transformation cost reductions they're experiencing as well. So I'll turn it over to Don and he'll get his first shot in the barrel here. Yes, thanks, Neil. We are in active discussions around those assets. There's been strong interest. We have got a number of players interested in those assets. And so we won't really comment further, but it would be a significant step in our asset disposition program. Yes. Thanks, John. We've laid out and built out this Wellhead-to-market midstream backbone, and we think that we have the ability to leverage into assets like Pinnacle. Pinnacle, I would say, instead of being a one off, it kind of epitomizes what we're looking for there. Assets that connected to our system can generate more value than they would be standing alone with their existing owners. And Pinnacle was a great acquisition because we were able to pick up this asset that is immediately accretive, that's backed by solid fee-based contracts, and it also affords us an opportunity to almost on a shovel-ready basis to add to that position organically. So it's kind of an inorganic and organic play and we're able to get it at good value and be accretive from the get-go. And so I think things like that in that ballpark are exactly the kinds of opportunities we're looking for to enhance our wellhead-to-market position, particularly in the Permian Basin. Yes, at the 50,000-foot level, Ryan, I think that your refineries across the U.S. industry ran very well last quarter. And you think about what we've gone through in the last few years, the economics have been very strong for the U.S. refining fleet. Everybody's had the cash flow to repair and clean up all of their equipment and it all came together, I think, last quarter, and then you have a little bit of the impact of some of the long-anticipated new volumes coming into market. But as we look out into the medium and long term, we see several things. U.S. remains advantaged versus much of the rest of the world. There's limited capacity growth beyond 2025 and global demand continues to increase. So, when we look at the medium and long term, supply and demand will realign and we remain bullish on the medium, long-term refining fundamentals. So I think we've got even better days to come. Yes, absolutely, Matt. CPChem continues to operate really, really well, and they're seeing strengthening demand in North America, as well as strengthening exports, which would certainly support the view that margins would continue to recover. European producers are struggling with the current cost environment, and Middle East producers face some export challenges because of the Red Sea-Suez Canal access; all on balance, favorable to CPChem. So we're seeing those margins gradually improve and we continue to be constructive medium to long term as the value chain works out of that trough that we saw a few quarters ago. And I think we do see the inventory position improving, particularly domestically, which -- also, since the U.S. is a large exporter now, lower domestic inventories indicates that the world markets are stronger, too. Thanks, Matt. Yes. Thanks, Jason. We continue to believe that $14 billion is the EBITDA that we can generate at mid-cycle conditions and that we will be in position by 2025, given the mid-cycle conditions, to achieve that $14 billion. Now, I want to be clear that this isn't guidance for 2025 that we believe that we will have the projects, the cost structure, the initiatives in place to achieve the $14 billion if we were at mid-cycle across the board. And whether or not we'll be at mid-cycle in all of our operating units in 2025 is another discussion. I think you've seen the strong performance in midstream. We see midstream at or above mid-cycle. Strong performance in marketing and specialties. Chemicals is recovering, but not likely to be at mid-cycle. We don't believe -- well, we haven't really established a mid-cycle for renewable fuels, but we don't believe that the renewable fuels segment will be at what we are inferring as a mid-cycle for that segment. And I think the big question is around refining. And we continue to execute projects to upgrade the value of the streams that we control, to enhance the market capture through our commercial operations. We continue to lower our costs, and we talked about how sustainable those cost improvements are. And that's what gives us the confidence that we will that see refining able to contribute to that $14 billion of mid-cycle EBITDA. I think as I talked about earlier, Doug, you're seeing a number of positive factors around utilization aligned in the last quarter. And historically, it's just not been sustainable to see that level of utilization across the industry. So, everything is clean, shiny, bright, new, and operating very well across the industry. And I think that you will see that, yes, it will roll into a normal turnaround cycle as things naturally evolve. So I don't think you'll see the kind of utilizations we witnessed on a sustainable basis across the industry. Yes, I think that RINs, LCFS, producer's tax credits, all are in -- are responding to the increased volumes. And the various jurisdictions will, over time, respond to ensure that there's incentives to run. Brian is our expert in those matters, but we're constructive on it in the long run. Yes. And part of what you're seeing now is just the length in distillate. So, that's a big part of renewable diesel that has to -- all those incentives have to float on top, just the base value of distillate. And there's quite a bit of volume that's been brought to the market and I think you'll see markets respond and realign around that. Yes, Theresa, I think that when you think about the Pinnacle acquisition, it does just that. And yes, we understand that a -- the newbuild multiple would be lower than the multiple you'd have to pay for a going concern. And you have to remember that we also brought in some very good high-quality, long-term fee-based contracts. And so, with an inorganic acquisition, you get to turn that earnings on instantaneously and you've got the contracts already there in place, and they're solid and you know exactly what you're getting. Organic growth, of course, there's a time lag. And so, you build it, you've got the construction risk, the time lag risk, and then you've got to go out and contract it. We're not adverse to doing that, but we think where we can bring in high-quality existing assets, backed by strong contracts tied right in the middle of our system, it makes tremendous sense. And we'll continue to look at organic opportunities as well. So it's not an and, it's not an either/or, but if the opportunity is right, we'll acquire. If we need to build, we'll build. Thank you for all your questions. Our team is executing across the board and delivering on our strategic priorities. The business transformation that we've been going through is driving $1 billion of cost reductions per year and lowering our refining costs per barrel. And we've got strong refining availability that contributed to our highest crude utilization rate in over five years and Midstream reported near-record results, benefiting from strong operating performance and continued synergy capture. At Rodeo, we're processing approximately 50,000 barrels per day of renewable feedstocks. We're optimizing our portfolio to generate incremental shareholder value and increase shareholder returns. Thank you for your interest in Phillips 66. If you have questions after today's call, please call Jeff or Owen."

            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Slide 6 covers the key financial metrics. Adjusted earnings were $984 million or $2.31 per share. We generated operating cash flow of $2.1 billion and returned $1.3 billion to shareholders. I will now move to Slide 7 to cover the segment results. In the second quarter, we made changes to our segment reporting, including a new segment for our renewable fuels business. The new segment includes the Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex, as well as contributions from the optimization of renewable feedstocks, fuel sales, and credits. We also moved our investment in NOVONIX from the Midstream segment to Corporate and Other. Our slides and other reporting materials reflect these changes and prior-period results have been recast for comparative purposes. Adjusted earnings increased $162 million compared with the prior quarter. Midstream results were up mainly due to higher volumes, including record NGL pipeline and fractionation volumes. In addition, costs were lower reflecting DCP synergy capture. In chemicals, results increased from higher margins. Refining was slightly lower than last quarter. Higher volumes and reduced operating costs mostly offset the impact of lower crack spreads driven by weaker distillate prices. Marketing and Specialties results were higher mostly due to seasonally stronger margins and volumes. Slide 8 shows the change in cash flow. We had strong cash flow aided by working capital and proceeds from asset dispositions. Working capital was a benefit of $916 million, mainly reflecting changes in accounts receivables and payables that include the impact of falling commodity prices. We received $685 million in cash proceeds from the sale of our 25% interest in REX pipeline. Looking ahead to the third quarter, in chemicals, we expect the Global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90%s. In refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low-90%s and turnaround expense to be between $140 million and $160 million. We anticipate Corporate and Other costs to come in between $330 million and $350 million. For the full year, we expect refining turnaround expense to be between $500 million and $530 million. This is a reduction from previous guidance. And finally, in early August, we will begin publishing a monthly refining market indicator on our Investor Relations website. Now we will open the line for questions, after which Mark will wrap up the call. Yes, John, it's Kevin. So as you alluded, we will hit the $13 billion to $15 billion target range this year. We're well on our way to that. As we all know, the refining margin right now is a weaker environment than we've seen in a little while, but nonetheless, we're still confident in our ability to return cash and meet targets. But that does mean the balance sheet may take a little impact in the near term. But when we look ahead to next year, we're quite confident in the cash-generating capabilities of the business. We have EBITDA growth coming and we also expect to generate cash from asset dispositions. So when you put all that together, we feel quite confident that we can both return greater than operating cash flow to shareholders, which we have committed as a target. And at the same time, manage the balance sheet to where we want it to be. We're not giving absolute dollar cash return targets for next year. At this point, that will be something we'll evaluate in the second half of the year. But we think by the time we get through next year, we'll be in a good spot with regards to cash returns to shareholders and balance sheet. Yes, Matt, I was just going to emphasize the point that I made earlier on that, next, we will start publishing our new refining indicator, which is a -- it will be a closer reflection of our actual assets, geographies, yield structures, crude slates. And so, we'll be -- we'll publish that for July next week. And so, we would expect our actual realized margin to track closer with that new indicator than our historic, more generic 3-2-1 crack. So you'll get a little bit of a look next week when we get that out on our website."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Dietert, Vice President, Investor Relations. \n Jeff, you may begin. \nJeffrey Dietert: Welcome to Phillips 66 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Participants on today's call will include Mark Lashier, President and CEO; Kevin Mitchell, the CFO; Tim Roberts, Midstream and Chemicals; Rich Harbison, Refining; and Brian Mandell, Marketing and Commercial. Today's presentation materials can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website, along with supplemental financial and operating information. \n Slide 2 contains our safe harbor statement. We will be making forward-looking statements during today's call. Actual results may differ materially from today's comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here as well as in our SEC filings. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark. \nMark Lashier: Thanks, Jeff. Welcome, everyone, to our first quarter earnings call. We continued to progress our strategic priorities and we returned significant cash to our shareholders. While our crude utilization rates were strong during the quarter, our results were affected by maintenance that limited our ability to make higher-value products. We were also impacted by the renewable fuels conversion at Rodeo as well as the effect of rising commodity prices on our inventory hedge positions. \n Currently, our assets are running near historical highs, and we are ready to meet peak summer demand. Before we provide an update on our strategic priorities, we want to recognize our Midstream, Refining and Chemicals businesses, which have all received honors for their exemplary safety performance in 2023. \n Our Midstream gathering and processing business received the Top 2023 GPA Safety Award in the large operator division. In Refining, the Rodeo and Sweeny facilities both received the AFPM Distinguished Safety Award, which is the highest annual safety award in the industry. This was Sweeny refinery's third straight year to receive the honor. \n The Ponca City Refinery earned the Elite Platinum Award and the Lake Charles Refinery secured the Elite Gold Award. In Chemicals, CPChem received 2 AFPM Safety Awards. I'm very proud of our employees and the employees of CPChem for their commitment to safety. I would like to congratulate them on a job well done. \n Today, beginning on Slide 4, we'll highlight the progress we've made on our strategic priorities. Next, we'll discuss our first quarter financial results. Then we look forward to your questions. \n We previously announced plans to monetize assets that no longer meet our long-term objectives, and we set a target to generate over $3 billion in proceeds. The expected proceeds will support our strategic priorities, including returns to shareholders. This quarter, we launched a process to divest our retail marketing business in Germany and Austria and communicated the plans to employees. Completion of the dispositions is subject to satisfactory market conditions and customary approvals. \n We have distributed almost $10 billion through share repurchases and dividends since July of 2022. Over the remaining 3 quarters of 2024, we expect to achieve our $13 billion to $15 billion target. Share repurchases will continue to be an important component of our capital allocation. We're committed to return over 50% of our operating cash flows to shareholders. \n Recently, we announced a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend, contributing to a 16% compound annual growth rate since 2012. The dividend increase reflects the confidence we have in our growing mid-cycle cash flow generation and our disciplined approach to capital allocation, including a secure, competitive and growing dividend. \n In Refining, we continue to run at crude utilization rates above the industry average for the fifth consecutive quarter. We remain focused on improving performance, increasing market capture and reducing costs to enhance our earnings per barrel. We have achieved over $560 million or more than $0.80 per barrel in run rate cost reductions from business transformation. We expect to achieve our full $1 per barrel run rate target by the end of the year. \n In Midstream, our NGL wellhead-to-market business is focused on capturing operating and commercial synergies of over $400 million by year-end 2024. Midstream's estimated 2024 mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA is $3.6 billion, providing stable cash generation that covers the company's top capital priorities: funding sustaining capital and the dividend. \n During the first quarter, we achieved a major milestone with the start-up of our Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex. Slide 5 summarizes our journey to transform the San Francisco refinery into one of the world's largest renewable fuels facilities. The facility benefits as a superior location to secure renewable feedstocks and market renewable fuels. The project leverages existing assets and is expected to generate strong returns. \n We began producing renewable diesel from our Unit 250 hydrotreater in April of 2021. We have gained valuable operational experience and market knowledge that positions us for success in our expanding renewable fuels business. Unit 250 continues to exceed expectations and has increased production to approximately 10,000 barrels per day. \n Our Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex is producing 30,000 barrels per day of renewable fuels. We're on track to increase production capability to full rates of approximately 50,000 barrels per day by the end of the second quarter. Once complete, we'll have the ability to produce renewable jet, a key component of sustainable aviation fuel. \n We're proud of the team's strong project execution and appreciate their commitment to operating excellence in achieving this significant milestone. The Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex positions Phillips 66 as a world leader in renewable fuels. \n Slide 6 provides an update on business transformation progress. Our run rate savings were $1.24 billion at the end of the first quarter, comprised of $940 million of cost reductions and $300 million of sustaining capital efficiencies. \n Through the first quarter, we've achieved $750 million in annualized cost reductions. The majority of these cost reductions relate to refining operating and SG&A expenses as well as benefits to equity earnings and gross margin. We are on track to realize $1 billion of cost reductions in 2024 to sustain higher cash generation. \n Before I turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results, I want to stress that the market fundamentals are good, our assets are running well, and we have a clear path to achieving our strategic priorities and growing cash flows. \nKevin Mitchell: Thank you, Mark. Slide 7 summarizes our first quarter results. Adjusted earnings were $822 million or $1.90 per share. Operating cash flow, excluding working capital, was $1.2 billion. We received distributions from equity affiliates of $348 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $628 million, including $171 million for a Midstream joint venture debt repayment. We distributed $1.6 billion to shareholders through $1.2 billion of share repurchases and $448 million of dividends. Net debt-to-capital ratio was 38%. \n Slide 8 highlights the change in results by segment from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. During the period, adjusted earnings decreased $540 million, mostly due to lower results in Refining, Midstream and Marketing and Specialties, partially offset by improved results in Chemicals. \n In Midstream, first quarter adjusted pretax income of $613 million was down $141 million from the prior quarter, reflecting lower results in transportation and NGL. Transportation results were down mainly due to a decrease in throughput and deficiency revenues, partially offset by seasonally lower maintenance costs. The NGL business decreased primarily due to a decline in margins as well as lower volumes, reflecting impacts from winter storms.  \n Chemicals adjusted pretax income increased $99 million to $205 million in the first quarter. This increase was mostly due to higher polyethylene margins, driven by improved sales prices and the decline in feedstock costs as well as lower turnaround costs. Global O&P utilization was 96%. \n Refining first quarter adjusted pretax income was $228 million, down $569 million from the fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower realized margins. Our commercial results were less favorable than the previous quarter, in part due to inventory hedging impacts in a rising price environment and less advantageous pipeline arbs. \n In addition, realized margins decreased due to lower Gulf Coast clean product realizations. Our Refining results and market capture of 69% were also negatively impacted by maintenance activities on downstream conversion units as well as the renewable fuels conversion at Rodeo. \n Marketing and Specialties adjusted first quarter pretax income was $345 million, a decrease of $87 million from the previous quarter. The decrease was mainly due to lower domestic marketing and lubricant margins. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 21%. \n Slide 9 shows the change in cash during the first quarter. We started the quarter with a $3.3 billion cash balance. Cash from operations, excluding working capital, was $1.2 billion. There was a working capital use of $1.4 billion, mainly reflecting a $2.6 billion increase in inventory, partially offset by benefits and accounts payables and receivables, which included the impact of rising commodity prices. \n Net debt issuances were $802 million. We returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Additionally, we funded $628 million of capital spending. Our ending cash balance was $1.6 billion. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items for the second quarter. \n In Chemicals, we expect the second quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the second quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. Turnaround expense is expected to be between $100 million and $120 million, excluding Rodeo. We anticipate second quarter Corporate and Other costs to come in between $330 million and $350 million, reflecting higher net interest expense. \n Now we will open the line for questions, after which Mark will make closing comments. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. \nNeil Mehta: I guess the first question was just Refining in the quarter. The capture rates were really noisy at 69%. I know you guys target 75%. It looks like a lot of that was on the West Coast because of Rodeo and then also secondary products. So you alluded to some of this in the prepared remarks, but maybe you can just talk a little bit about what happened there and your confidence about the progression as we work our way through the year. \nMark Lashier: Yes, Neil, that's a great question. Thank you for asking that. The way I'm looking at this is those first quarter headwinds that you mentioned in Refining are all related to activities that will position us to deliver medium- and long-term tailwinds in support of our strategic priorities. And so it's some of the fundamental work going on around Rodeo and some of the work around our turnarounds are critically important. \n And Rich and Kevin can drive into that a little bit more. And including some of the activities in commercial that we underwent over the last several quarters, that will contribute to our long-term success. So Rich, do you want to dive in? \nRichard Harbison: Yes, Mark. And Neil, when I reflect back on the quarter, I look at the metrics, and we ran pretty well. But the market capture, obviously, was challenged, and it was primarily driven by activity in the Gulf Coast and the West Coast. We achieved about an 84% clean product yield, which, for our assets, is pretty good. It's actually 1% higher year-over-year. \n So it is a sign that our margin projects are actually playing into the bottom line here as we move forward. However, quarter-over-quarter, we were 3% lower than the fourth quarter. 1% of that very clearly is seasonal. It's butane blending related to our conversion as we move towards summer gasoline over the quarter. \n Another 2% is really related to our turnaround activity, and this was principally focused in the downstream catalytic units across our system, and it was concentrated in the Gulf Coast area. This has really 2 effects when it comes to market capture and clean product yield. It reduces our ability to produce higher-value products,  and it increases our intermediate inventories over the period. \n Now on the West Coast, we have the conversion of the Rodeo facility, which is a compounding event. Essentially, it effectively had a $180 million loss and adjusted pretax income in the quarter as we transformed the business. And if you think about the business, it went from active to idle to reactive across this first quarter. The good news is we're near completion of the Rodeo conversion, and I actually would say we're well into the wind-up phase now. \n So to summarize, I guess, the Rodeo start-up is on schedule, ramping up production. Approximately 50,000 barrels a day of renewable fuels will be achieved out of that facility in the second quarter. And we positioned our units across the system to run full conversion rates with fresh catalysts and ample intermediate inventories for the upcoming driving season. \n Kevin, did you want to add anything? \nKevin Mitchell: Yes. Let me just put a couple of numbers to some of these items. So in terms of some commercial impacts that we talk about, on Gulf Coast product pricing differentials, in absolute terms, that was a $50 million headwind in the first quarter. The inventory hedges that I referenced in the earlier comments, which primarily impacts Central Corridor, that was a $100 million headwind in the first quarter. These are not variances, these are absolutes in the quarter. \n And then on the West Coast, Rodeo, in overall terms, was a $180 million negative or loss for the quarter. So the West Coast results are bearing that drag from the impact of the Rodeo conversion. \nMark Lashier: Yes. And I think, just to put that in context, we're taking a disadvantaged refinery and converting it into one of the world's largest renewable fuels facilities. And so to bridge to that, we took the heavy lift this quarter, and now we're well positioned to start delivering value again from the Rodeo facility as we continue to push it to full rates through the second quarter. \n And then on the Gulf Coast, the way you have to think about that is we're still maximizing our crude utilization throughput, but that crude turned into intermediates instead of clean products by design because of the turnaround work we had underway. So now we've got that inventory of intermediates poised to be converted into clean products as we continue to ramp back up into the summer season. So we're well positioned going forward. \nNeil Mehta: That's a lot of good color. The follow-up is just on balance sheet, Q1 is always a noisy quarter for working capital. And that cash flow bridge, Kevin, is really helpful. But just your perspective on where you want to get your net debt to capital over time, what's the path to get there, including potential asset sales? And then how do we think about working capital getting into that equation? So big picture question around that metric. \nKevin Mitchell: Yes, Neil, so let me hit on the working capital piece first. So negative $1.4 billion in aggregate, about $2.6 million of that is a function of inventory build. And so we did have some partial offsetting benefit in payables and receivables, and that was driven by 2 items. \n One, the rising price, the absolute rising price environment generally is positive for net AP/AR. So we saw some benefit there. But we also benefited on receivables by collecting, in the first quarter, cash from fourth quarter inventory drawdown, and that was several hundred million dollars that showed up in there. \n But on the inventory build, it's a sizable build, and I would say, it's really a function of both commercial opportunity inventory as well as some operational-driven inventory. And the way to think about that is the operational barrels will turn into margin at a future point in time, like the intermediates that we've talked about. \n The commercial inventory build, those will generate a return that will be in excess of anything we will realize on cash balances. And fundamentally, it's all still sitting in a liquid asset on the balance sheet. So that kind of talks to the working capital. And consistent with normal practice, you would expect that inventory to come back down in the -- towards the end of the year, and you'll see some of that cash coming back to us. \n In terms of balance sheet and the leverage levels, we are above our targeted range, so 25% to 30% target range. Still comfortable with that target. You'll notice that we've been leaning into the share repurchases quite heavily, and that's a function of our confidence in the business, in the outlook, our growth that we see coming in terms of the $14 billion of mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA. And so it feels like still a pretty compelling opportunity for us to be buying shares back even if, in the near term, it's at the expense of that leverage metric. So still expect to get there to that level. That's still our objective. \n And the other comment I'd make on leverage, the other metric, the other way we look at this is the non -- or the much less commodity-sensitive businesses, the Midstream and the Marketing and Specialties business, is our ability for those businesses to basically be able to bear the debt that the company has. So on a combined basis, that's circa $6 billion of EBITDA generation. \n And if you think of a typical leverage multiple for businesses like that, call it 3x, that's $18 billion of net debt, which is roughly where we are. And so that's the other measure we look at. And that keeps the Refining business avoid that volatility being part of that, the way we look at that debt level. So it keeps us very comfortable from a balance sheet standpoint. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Roger Read of Wells Fargo Securities. \nRoger Read: I'd like to, if we could, maybe look at -- I guess it's a combination of the OpEx that we're seeing in Refining and, I guess, let's say, juxtaposed against the progress you're making in overall cost reduction. So during the first quarter going from $630 million to $715 million on a cumulative basis, if I look at cash OpEx, it's kind of stable over the last 3 quarters. \n Recognize a lot of stuff's going on, but if you could help us kind of put those 2 together and maybe where you see the impact on cash OpEx, or maybe if it's embedded in the actual Refining margin. Where we're seeing the cost savings manifest in Refining? \nMark Lashier: Yes. I think that, certainly, the majority of our business transformation cost impact is showing up in Refining, and we've been out delivering our targets, overdelivering against our targets and certainly continue that into 2024. There's always a lag, and we talk about run rate and then we talk about realized, and we're going to make sure that you keep track, too. \n The run rate is where the speedometer is at this point in time. The realized is what we're actually seeing show up in the numbers, and we've seen good progress in Refining. And we'll continue to see that throughout this year as we rise up to our forecasted $1.1 billion in cost and $300 million in capital synergies, capital savings. And so Rich can drive into those cost numbers for you, Roger, and give you some color around that. \nRichard Harbison: Yes. So the end of last year, Roger, we, on a run rate basis, passed the $500 million or $0.75 -- roughly $0.75 a barrel number on run rate last year and realized about $0.41 of that last year. As we fast forward now into -- through the first quarter here, we see that realized number creeping up to the $500 million -- actually, slightly over the $500 million number. So it's coming in at that $0.75. And it's roughly that delay that Mark's talking about, roughly a 90-day delay in achieving that. \n So when we go back and we validate those spends -- and remember, those spends are over 900 separate initiatives that we've completed across the organization. We go back and revalidate these. So we are seeing those start flowing to the bottom line for Refining. And if you look at our year-over-year OpEx, it is noticeably lower even in the face of inflation, pretty heavy inflationary period here that we faced over the period of time. \n So we're happy with the progress. On a run rate basis, at the end of the first quarter, we've achieved $560 million of run rate, which equates to about $0.80. And that's on a trajectory for the year-end of $1 a barrel target that's set for the organization, which is roughly $650 million by the end of the year. So we're well on that pace to achieve that, and the program is pressing forward. \n And like I had mentioned earlier, it's a seriatim of hundreds, if not thousands, of initiatives to execute, and it's really intended to drive work and efficiencies out of our work process. And as that happens, we want to make sure that, that changes how we do our work. It influences how we make decisions, but it should not compromise safety, reliability or earnings power for the organization. \nMark Lashier: Yes, Roger, and I really want to drive home what Rich just said, that the cultural impact on the organization has been impressive, particularly out in the field, whether it's Midstream, Refining, wherever you are. And we have a workforce that has bought into it, and it's committed to driving higher levels of performance. They understand right out at the front lines, they understand what our strategic priorities are and how they can contribute to us getting there. And so they're digging in, and they're looking at those opportunities every day. \n And across the organization, we continue to simplify work, to make work easier for people to get done. So get people the right digital opportunity so they can make better decisions faster, whether it's commercial or whether it's an operator on the front line. And the organization, we're also simplifying. And we want to ensure that we've got a streamlined organization that will support sustainable success around both cost and performance, and we're seeing that live as we move forward. \nRoger Read: No, I appreciate the detail there, everybody. I guess, just a follow-up question. On the announcement of the potential sale of the European retail assets, how does that affect the partial ownership you have in Refining assets on mainland Europe, MiRO, specifically? \nKevin Mitchell: Yes, Roger, it's Kevin. So we're selling the Germany and Austria retail assets, like we said. That's a company-owned, dealer-operated model, primarily almost 1,000 sites across those 2 countries. That's a high-performing business, top-rated many years in a row, 10% of market share in each country. A great business, but doesn't really integrate with the sort of core strategic focus areas that we have as a company. So just a little bit of background as to why those assets. \n It does not include our ownership in the MiRO Refinery in Germany. And the reason for that is the majority of buyers for those type of retail assets would not be interested in refinery ownership. If there's a buyer that is interested, then that's a separate conversation, and we'll handle that separately. But this package right now is focused on those marketing assets. \nOperator: The next question comes from Ryan Todd of Piper Sandler. \nRyan Todd: Maybe if I could start with one on Rodeo. I mean congrats on getting the project -- the Rodeo Renewed project up and running. You mentioned the loss in the first quarter, and I know like early days are challenging, it's ramped for its full capacity and optimized performance. \n But can you walk through maybe what to expect over the next few quarters there? When do you anticipate hitting full production capacity? How do you anticipate the feedstock mix to change over the next few quarters as you run more advantaged feeds? And how should we think about that negative $180 million moving towards profitability from a time line point of view as we look over the course of this year? \nRichard Harbison: Sure, Ryan. I got that. This is Rich here. So maybe first, I'll start with a time line of the Rodeo facility. As you know, we've been ramping this facility down and hit a milestone in February of this year, with a complete shutdown of the facility after 128 years of legacy of running as a crude processing site. That first transition occurred on the first hydrocracker, and they went into renewable fuels feedstock production in March of this year. \n So that first phase is up and running, and that's, that milestone we're talking about here. And that's allowed the facility, in complement with the Unit 250 operation that Mark mentioned in the earlier comments, with the first hydrocracker to produce about 30,000 barrels a day of renewable fuels. The second hydrocracker and the pretreatment unit will both finish construction in the May time frame, and we will start those up in the June time frame. \n So by the end of the second quarter, the facility will be at full production rates. Now what does that all mean when it comes to margin? So margin in this business is driven a lot by the carbon intensity of the feedstocks. And Brian's team has been actively engaged in that over the last couple of years on aggregating the number of feedstocks. \n So the way we see this is, we will start with essentially the pretreated material in the second quarter at a higher CI, roughly 50 CI number. And over the third quarter, we see the carbon intensity of our feedstocks continually ramping down through that third quarter. But by the end of the third quarter, I would expect to see us in the lower to mid-CI range of 30s, in that range. And that's primarily driven by processing more recycled fats, oils and greases that are aggregated throughout the world. \n So -- and then as a supplement to all of that, we're seeing a growing interest in sustainable aviation fuel as well. So we have positioned the facility to begin production of sustainable aviation fuel, which is a key component is the renewable jet that's blended into that. And that production will be capable starting in the third quarter as well. And we do expect to be a prominent supplier in the market on that.\n So the good news is Rodeo's through that start-up process, that shutdown/start-up process, and now we're in the ramp-up phase, I'll call it. It's online, and we're ramping up production right now. \nMark Lashier: Yes. Ryan, when we get up to full rates, we'll be able to produce something on the order of 10,000 barrels a day of renewable jet fuel, which gets blended up then to sustainable aviation fuel in the marketplace. And this kit is going to be designed for continuous optimization, whether it's the split between jet and diesel fuel or the feedstocks coming in. \n Because of the feed pretreatment unit we'll have, we'll have great flexibility. And so we'll optimize on CI, cost and revenue and as well as the incentives that are out there. So it's going to be an interesting facility to have in our kit, and we're looking forward to getting it fully online and generating cash. \nRichard Harbison: I think it's supplemented as well by the last-mile strategy that Brian's team has put in place. That prevents leakage of value as we deliver the product to the end user there, and that should play out nicely as we increase production from the facility. \nRyan Todd: And do you have -- have you signed contracts on the SAF front? Are you in ongoing negotiations there with partners? \nBrian Mandell: We're concurrently in negotiations with partners. We've seen a lot of interest in SAF. \nRyan Todd: Great. Maybe just one, changing gears to chems, on the Chemical side, the better-than-expected performance of CPChem. Can you talk about kind of the drivers of improvement there? Is it primarily feedstock-related? Are you seeing any signs of underlying improvement in market conditions and maybe how you're looking at the rest of the year? \nTimothy Roberts: Yes. Ryan, this is Tim Roberts, and I'll chat about that. I'll cover 3 things because I think there'll be other questions around it. First one I wanted to talk about is actually more on the leadership side. I just wanted to recognize Bruce Chinn, who was the recently retired CEO at CPChem. He did a really good job there, great leadership, great drive for excellence, and he'll be missed.\n We have an internal candidate, Steve Prusak, who's assumed the role of CEO. Steve has been very successful in all phases of the Chemical business, and we are highly confident in his ability to lead and take CPChem to the next level of industry-leading performance. So that, I want to thank both of those guys.\n Now on the macro side, let me talk about that, and then I'll get specific to CPChem. Macro, clearly, the heavy-light spread with regard to being light feed versus heavy feed, it's really been a boon to those that can crack the light feedstock, especially CPChem, who's well positioned not only in the U.S. Gulf Coast but in the Middle East. And so it's -- the advantage is pretty wide right now. And so they've been able to take advantage of it. In fact, the industry in the U.S., if you're cracking light, you like it.\n However, I will tell you, we are not at mid-cycle margins. It has come off the bottom, which is good. A lot of that is really related to more about feedstock. So natural gas has come off. It's come down. And subsequently, ethane's come down with it, as has some propane and butane as well. And so subsequently, that gap has gotten bigger, and then, anyway, that's showing up, and then, also, the lower feedstock and natural gas relative to utility cost.\n So the combination of those 2, as well as just a little bit of support on polyethylene pricing, not a lot, but enough to help widen up that chain margin a little bit. So I think that's been good. We still think, though, that although we're off the bottom, we still think it's hard to see us getting to mid-cycle anytime during 2025. But certainly, supply-demand fundamentals, as destocking goes, we do see that it's -- sometime after 2025, you can see it rebalance and then get back into a mid-cycle environment.\n Specifically to CPChem, though, I do want to highlight as well with them that they've had a couple of their mid-cap projects that did come onstream late last year, C3 splitter, the 1-hexene unit, and then they also added another furnace to one of the large crackers there. And 1-hexene and C3, they're adding earnings in the first quarter. So they're up, they're running. They have run it higher than nameplate capacity, which has been really good, and again, generating earnings that are showing up at CPChem's results. \n And we're in really a start-up mode with the furnace. That work is complete. They're starting it up, going through the normal shakedown you will have with those units. And we're hoping, in 2Q, you'll see something more material on the earnings side there, too. \nMark Lashier: Yes. Ryan, you're seeing live the last almost 25 years of what CPChem has done to position themselves to be able to run flat out at the bottom of the cycle. And they did that, and they did that profitably. And you're seeing rationalization of assets in Europe while they're running at flat-out rates. \n And so that's encouraging from a CPChem perspective. We need to see that in this down cycle to see some of the less competitive assets come out of the system, and that's going to be constructive. And that will help accelerate the industry out of the bottom of the cycle and to greener pastures out in the next couple of years. \nTimothy Roberts: And Mark, to add on to that point, I think that's a great point. What you're seeing is that a lot of your higher-cost folks, they're running at reduced rates or they're shut down and extending maintenance or running at reduced rates. And we've even seen some facilities, namely in Europe, 2 announcements of 2 crackers that will be shutting down from some competition there because they're at the wrong place in the cost curve, whereas CPChem is on the right place in the cost curve. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Manav Gupta of UBS. \nManav Gupta: Guys, so you did a  good job of explaining the variability in earnings quarter-on-quarter on Refining. Can we go through some of that in the Midstream? We saw a big variation on the NGL and Other side. I mean transportation wasn't off that much, but help us understand what drove the variability in the second part of that business. \nTimothy Roberts: Yes. Manav, thanks for the question. This is Tim Roberts again, and let me go ahead and address. I mean first thing I want to lay out there is that last quarter on the earnings call, I talked about guiding towards $675 million per quarter IBT, and we're staying with that. I mean that still feels good, $3.6 billion to the year. That's where we're at. So I just wanted to make sure we were -- that hasn't changed. Now if you look at 4Q and 1Q, 4Q was a strong quarter, okay? That was the first thing. \n You had some onetime things that showed up in that fourth quarter. And in first quarter, what impacted it and especially the variance, number one, winter storm. So the winter storm, it impacted us and impacted other people, too. And really, the impact was, and I think it's worth noting, were really not to our assets, it was to the producers. So we really weren't seeing the volumes come down the pipe due to freeze-offs and a variety of other different issues. \n So it took a while for those volumes to get back up and get running again and then subsequently start working their way through the system. So about $30 million impact there. And then also, we had some commercial true-ups from fourth quarter to first quarter, commercial true-ups, accruals and some inventory timing that showed up between fourth quarter to first quarter. \n And so if you put those 2 quarters together, you really are getting in somewhere north of that $675 million number where we're at. We think we'll be on a more normalized basis as we go into 2Q. And you'll see some inventory timing issues will show up. It's not big, but some will show up in the second quarter as a positive. But generally, that's kind of how we look at it. We're still in that $675 million is the right number as we see throughout the year. \nManav Gupta: Perfect. My quick follow-up is on the diesel macro. We have seen some pullback in cracks. Wasn't fully anticipated because we expected Russia volumes to drop, which they did not. So I know Jeff does a lot of detailed work on this, so if you could help us with your crystal ball as to what's going on in the diesel world. And do you expect the cracks to get stronger in the year? \nBrian Mandell: Manav, this is Brian Mandell. I would say that we've had a number of issues. We had a warm northeast U.S. winter, then refineries came back and they were running really well. Prices for diesel are in contango. We have seen about 200,000 barrels a day of Russian distillate off the market. But we are constructive. We do think the market will come back. You're seeing -- starting to see run cuts in Europe and Asia with hydrocracking and hydroskimming margins at breakeven.\n As we move into driving season, we could see more gasoline mode. In fact, you're seeing gasoline over distillate on the coast in the U.S., East and West Coast. And that could drive less distillate moving to more jet production from diesel, particularly fixing ahead into China's Labor Day, Golden Week, and we see real strong jet demand. And then continue to geopolitical issues, if Russia's hit again, that means that diesel exports as well. So we think that things are going to look better coming out of kind of this trough here. \nOperator: Our next question today comes from John Royall of JPMorgan. \nJohn Royall: I had a follow-up on the retail sale in Europe. Are there any other assets on the international marketing side that might be less strategic that could shake out there? And on the U.S. Marketing side, is the majority of that business too integrated with the Refining operations to separate? I'm just trying to get a sense of the strategic direction in Marketing in light of this new sales process. \nKevin Mitchell: Yes, John. From a Europe standpoint, the other marketing businesses are in Switzerland, where we have a joint venture with Coop, and in the U.K. And the two are very different in that the Switzerland business is somewhat of a stand-alone retail business, but it's also in a joint venture structure, and so the dynamics are a little bit different around that. \n The U.K., that marketing business is very integrated with our Refining in the U.K. So it's much more akin to the U.S. model, where the Marketing business serves to help ensure product placement coming out of the Humber Refinery. And that's really the case for the U.S. Marketing business as well. It's very much integrated with the Refining system across the different regions. \nJohn Royall: Great. And then my next question is on the West Coast. And I think Mark sort of alluded to this a little in his response to Neil. But how should we think about the structural capture rate on the West Coast? And how it's going to be different now with the Rodeo officially an RD unit and not a refinery? Should we expect it to be higher than what we've seen historically as a result? \nRichard Harbison: Well, do you want me to start with that? \nMark Lashier: Sure. \nRichard Harbison: Come over the top. This is Rich Harbison. So there's a reason, John, we've gone to Rodeo and converted it into a renewable fuels stock. It has not been a meaningful contributor to the earnings profile on the West Coast for quite some time now. So that -- we're looking forward to getting that change fully implemented. And we do think that will have a marked change to the West Coast profitability.\n The Los Angeles and the Ferndale facilities will continue to operate, and they've been good contributors to the West Coast. But I'll say, in general, the West Coast is a challenging market to make money on the Refining side of the business. Our Los Angeles Refinery has been challenged with the declining supply of California domestic crudes, which has taken away a lot of the original crude advantage for that facility when it was originally built. \n Now the TMX pipeline is opening up, so there's a change in the crude flow dynamics, which has the potential to have a positive impact on the Los Angeles facility. And we'll see how that dynamic works out here over the next few months as these crude flows change around. But changing and pulling the Rodeo refinery out will have a marked change on the West Coast. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Blair of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. \nMatthew Blair: Are you able to  share the approximate EBITDA contribution of those German and Austrian retail assets up for sale? And then the cash from the sale, would that be earmarked for, like, share buybacks? And if so, would that mean an increase to the $13 billion to $15 billion target? \nKevin Mitchell: Yes, Matt, this is Kevin. The EBITDA, I'll give you the numbers that are on the information that we're providing to the prospective buyers. It's a -- the range is EUR 300 million to EUR 350 million, which the conversion for that is $325 million to $375 million. If you pick the midpoint, $350 million of EBITDA is probably your best number to go with on that.\n In terms of cash generation, as we've previously stated, our cash return target of $13 billion to $15 billion was not dependent on proceeds from asset sales. So it does have the potential to increase that. But I would also say, we haven't made any definitive decisions on exactly how that cash would be deployed. And also, the timing is still quite uncertain at this point anyway. These processes usually take a while to run through. So that will be something that we will make a determination on near the time when that cash inflow becomes real. \nMatthew Blair: That's great. And then the $180 million hit from the Rodeo conversion, I think that's a little bit higher than what we're expecting. What drove that increase? And can you provide any sort of breakout on like how much of that was in gross margins versus OpEx versus depreciation? And then also, is it fair to assume that the current Rodeo plant is EBITDA negative since it's not running the low CI feeds yet? \nKevin Mitchell: So on the first question, we're not going to give that level of asset-specific breakout. And I would say, the $180 million does not include -- the absolute loss on a GAAP basis is a bigger number, again, because we had some impairments related to assets that are taken out of service. So the $180 million is on the -- consistent with the way we report our adjusted earnings. And it does show up in the different areas, but we're not going to provide that level of line item breakout.\n The second question was around EBITDA while we're in ramp-up mode. My observation, and others can supplement this is, clearly, when we're in ramp-up mode, we're running the higher CI feedstocks. We don't yet have the full economies of scale because we're in ramp-up mode. EBITDA generation is going to be challenged than the early phases. But as we go through that series of bringing all the units up, production coming up to the 50,000 barrels per day, the feedstocks migrating to the more -- the lower carbon intensity, we should start to see that transition into positive EBITDA contribution. \nRichard Harbison: Supported by sustainable aviation fuel. \nKevin Mitchell: That's right. It's another uplift, yes. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. \nPaul Cheng: I have to apologize, but I want to go back into the West Coast. Can you share that what is the OpEx, excluding Rodeo? And also what is Rodeo going to look like once it's fully ramped up in terms of the OpEx? That's the first question. \nKevin Mitchell: OpEx, excluding Rodeo, yes, Paul, I think the best way to answer that is because we don't give that level of asset level detail out. But we will be providing more reporting transparency on a going-forward basis that will enable you to see the kind of level of information that your -- the questions that you're asking for. \n In future periods, we will be providing more transparency around the Rodeo renewable fuels business separate from West Coast Refining. And so I would just say, I know that doesn't help you in terms of modeling right now, but just watch this space because we will be providing more transparency around that. \nPaul Cheng: Right. Kevin, can I ask that, from the first to the second quarter, I understand there's some onetime OpEx related with that transition in the first quarter. So the OpEx, should we assume that it's going to stay at this level as the first quarter or that is actually going to be down? \nKevin Mitchell: Well, it's probably down a little. There's still going to be an elevated element of that, and there's some what we would classify as turnaround-related costs associated with the conversion as well that will show up at Rodeo. But the trend is downward. We're past the peak spend, I guess, is the way to say it. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Gabelman of Cowen and Company. \nJason Gabelman: Yes. The first one is just on commercial performance. And I think you had discussed a desire to integrate different plans in terms of how you buy crude and sell product and try to maximize profitability across the portfolio, rather than at a site level. I'm just wondering if you could provide an update on that journey, and if you've seen any of that earnings benefit come through in the results. And then second, just a quick clarification. Can you remind us what your target cash balance is? \nBrian Mandell: Jason, it's Brian Mandell. I'll give you some kind of flavor of our journey for commercial. Our commercial supply and trading organization is, as you know, an integrated global business. We have offices in Houston, Calgary, London and Singapore. And as you mentioned, our focus is now to fully optimize and capture the optionality value embedded in all of the assets and then to capture that kind of integration value between the various business segments to drive additional value for the company.\n Last year, internally, we announced a reorganization of our commercial group, the goal of reducing our back office costs and continuing to advance our capabilities and value generations. We've made some really strong hires this year. We also have a companion organization that we call value chain optimization group, VCO for short, whose function is to work across the integrated value chain to ensure that we continue to make the best corporate general interest decisions.\n And ultimately, we're kind of focused on driving increased earnings, maximizing our return on capital employed and increasing the market capture for our Refining segment, and doing all this while thinking about continuous improvement and continually growing the business. \nKevin Mitchell: And Jason, on the cash number, the target cash balance, the same as we've said in the past, $2 billion to $3 billion. We were slightly below that level at the end of the quarter. I'd also say, the first quarter is typically a heavy drain on cash quarter. So as we look ahead, we're still very comfortable with that target level. \nOperator: And our final question today comes from Theresa Chen of Barclays. \nTheresa Chen: First, on the near-term outlook for capture in second quarter and maybe third as well. Just thinking about the different moving parts, you have presumably less noise from the onetime items impacting first quarter, whether it be from turnarounds or Rodeo. But you do have WCS narrowing based on your sensitivity and the magnitude that we've seen to date, that should be a sizable headwind. \n And then later, maybe with TMX ramping online, to be able to bring barrels to PADD 5 indirectly or directly, that should help your West Coast assets. Just help us think about how to reconcile these variables as we look to capture in the near term, please. \nMark Lashier: I think at a high level, Theresa, we are laser focused on the things we can control, and that's what we focus on, and that's what Rich and Brian focus on. I think that the things out of our control would be  speculative. But I think Rich can talk about what we're doing to -- and what we see over the next couple of quarters with respect to market capture potential, and Brian can chime in from a commercial perspective. \nRichard Harbison: Yes. So Theresa, we talked -- this is Rich again. We talked a little bit about some of the headwinds on market capture, which, when I think about market capture from a Refining perspective, it's our clean product yield. So -- and then it's the products that we make. Are we moving up the product value chain on that? \n So first quarter, certainly, some headwinds with some downstream conversion unit turnaround activity. Good news is we've refreshed all that catalysts now, and they're ready to run here. Some of that did bleed a little bit into the second quarter. But as we roll into the summer driving season, you'll see our clean product yield and product values in about the best place we can put them.\n Now we continue to invest in these as well. We've seen over the last 2 years that we've completed a number of projects on this front, and continue that program through this year as well with a target of increasing our market capture by 5% from a mid-cycle basis. \n Through last year, we put projects in that have raised that bar by 3%, and we expect to close the balance of that out of the 5 this year with an additional 15 projects that are currently in construction at the sites. So when we think about the market capture this quarter at 69%, I see that as a lower part of our market and something to build on as we move through the rest of the quarter as the facilities come out of turnaround cycle. \nBrian Mandell: And Theresa, this is Brian Mandell. Just to add some color on the commercial side. I would say, we're seeing, this year, gasoline and diesel roughly flat to last year in terms of demand. Jet fuel, a little bit stronger this year. I talked about our commercial organization, how kind of moving up that curve to take advantage of the optionality in our assets, we'll continue to do that.\n And then thinking about WCS, you made a good comment. I would say that WCS will remain volatile. What we have appetite, we can move around different grades. So we can run Canadian heavy, we can run Canadian lights as well. We have an integrated system, a big commercial footprint. And if the WCS is unfavorable, particularly on our Gulf Coast plants or West Coast plants, we can switch to other grades such as Latin American grades and AG grade. So a lot of flexibility in our system. \nTheresa Chen: Got it. And if I could ask a follow-up related to Kevin's earlier comments about what the appropriate leverage is for the company and the commentary related to how some of your more cash flows stable businesses can bear more leverage. Can you just share with us what portion of your Midstream business at this point, what portion of the EBITDA is paid by third-party customers and not Phillips Refining paying those Midstream? \nTimothy Roberts: Theresa, I'll verify the number, but we're well into, I would say, it's 65% to 70% third parties. \nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mark Lashier for closing remarks. \nMark Lashier: Thank you, all, for your great questions. The market fundamentals that we're looking at are supportive, and our assets are running strong since the completion of seasonal maintenance activities. Our integrated portfolio is well positioned to capture market opportunities and to meet the peak summer demand. \n We've got a clear path forward to achieve our strategic priorities that support $4 billion of growth from our 2022 mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA to our $14 billion target by 2025. We're confident in our ability to grow cash flows and create significant long-term value for shareholders. Thank you for your interest in Phillips 66. If you have questions after today's call, please call Jeff or Owen. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Richard Harbison",
            "content": "Yes, Mark. And Neil, when I reflect back on the quarter, I look at the metrics, and we ran pretty well. But the market capture, obviously, was challenged, and it was primarily driven by activity in the Gulf Coast and the West Coast. We achieved about an 84% clean product yield, which, for our assets, is pretty good. It's actually 1% higher year-over-year. \n So it is a sign that our margin projects are actually playing into the bottom line here as we move forward. However, quarter-over-quarter, we were 3% lower than the fourth quarter. 1% of that very clearly is seasonal. It's butane blending related to our conversion as we move towards summer gasoline over the quarter. \n Another 2% is really related to our turnaround activity, and this was principally focused in the downstream catalytic units across our system, and it was concentrated in the Gulf Coast area. This has really 2 effects when it comes to market capture and clean product yield. It reduces our ability to produce higher-value products,  and it increases our intermediate inventories over the period. \n Now on the West Coast, we have the conversion of the Rodeo facility, which is a compounding event. Essentially, it effectively had a $180 million loss and adjusted pretax income in the quarter as we transformed the business. And if you think about the business, it went from active to idle to reactive across this first quarter. The good news is we're near completion of the Rodeo conversion, and I actually would say we're well into the wind-up phase now. \n So to summarize, I guess, the Rodeo start-up is on schedule, ramping up production. Approximately 50,000 barrels a day of renewable fuels will be achieved out of that facility in the second quarter. And we positioned our units across the system to run full conversion rates with fresh catalysts and ample intermediate inventories for the upcoming driving season. \n Kevin, did you want to add anything? Yes. So the end of last year, Roger, we, on a run rate basis, passed the $500 million or $0.75 -- roughly $0.75 a barrel number on run rate last year and realized about $0.41 of that last year. As we fast forward now into -- through the first quarter here, we see that realized number creeping up to the $500 million -- actually, slightly over the $500 million number. So it's coming in at that $0.75. And it's roughly that delay that Mark's talking about, roughly a 90-day delay in achieving that. \n So when we go back and we validate those spends -- and remember, those spends are over 900 separate initiatives that we've completed across the organization. We go back and revalidate these. So we are seeing those start flowing to the bottom line for Refining. And if you look at our year-over-year OpEx, it is noticeably lower even in the face of inflation, pretty heavy inflationary period here that we faced over the period of time. \n So we're happy with the progress. On a run rate basis, at the end of the first quarter, we've achieved $560 million of run rate, which equates to about $0.80. And that's on a trajectory for the year-end of $1 a barrel target that's set for the organization, which is roughly $650 million by the end of the year. So we're well on that pace to achieve that, and the program is pressing forward. \n And like I had mentioned earlier, it's a seriatim of hundreds, if not thousands, of initiatives to execute, and it's really intended to drive work and efficiencies out of our work process. And as that happens, we want to make sure that, that changes how we do our work. It influences how we make decisions, but it should not compromise safety, reliability or earnings power for the organization. Sure, Ryan. I got that. This is Rich here. So maybe first, I'll start with a time line of the Rodeo facility. As you know, we've been ramping this facility down and hit a milestone in February of this year, with a complete shutdown of the facility after 128 years of legacy of running as a crude processing site. That first transition occurred on the first hydrocracker, and they went into renewable fuels feedstock production in March of this year. \n So that first phase is up and running, and that's, that milestone we're talking about here. And that's allowed the facility, in complement with the Unit 250 operation that Mark mentioned in the earlier comments, with the first hydrocracker to produce about 30,000 barrels a day of renewable fuels. The second hydrocracker and the pretreatment unit will both finish construction in the May time frame, and we will start those up in the June time frame. \n So by the end of the second quarter, the facility will be at full production rates. Now what does that all mean when it comes to margin? So margin in this business is driven a lot by the carbon intensity of the feedstocks. And Brian's team has been actively engaged in that over the last couple of years on aggregating the number of feedstocks. \n So the way we see this is, we will start with essentially the pretreated material in the second quarter at a higher CI, roughly 50 CI number. And over the third quarter, we see the carbon intensity of our feedstocks continually ramping down through that third quarter. But by the end of the third quarter, I would expect to see us in the lower to mid-CI range of 30s, in that range. And that's primarily driven by processing more recycled fats, oils and greases that are aggregated throughout the world. \n So -- and then as a supplement to all of that, we're seeing a growing interest in sustainable aviation fuel as well. So we have positioned the facility to begin production of sustainable aviation fuel, which is a key component is the renewable jet that's blended into that. And that production will be capable starting in the third quarter as well. And we do expect to be a prominent supplier in the market on that.\n So the good news is Rodeo's through that start-up process, that shutdown/start-up process, and now we're in the ramp-up phase, I'll call it. It's online, and we're ramping up production right now. I think it's supplemented as well by the last-mile strategy that Brian's team has put in place. That prevents leakage of value as we deliver the product to the end user there, and that should play out nicely as we increase production from the facility. Well, do you want me to start with that? Come over the top. This is Rich Harbison. So there's a reason, John, we've gone to Rodeo and converted it into a renewable fuels stock. It has not been a meaningful contributor to the earnings profile on the West Coast for quite some time now. So that -- we're looking forward to getting that change fully implemented. And we do think that will have a marked change to the West Coast profitability.\n The Los Angeles and the Ferndale facilities will continue to operate, and they've been good contributors to the West Coast. But I'll say, in general, the West Coast is a challenging market to make money on the Refining side of the business. Our Los Angeles Refinery has been challenged with the declining supply of California domestic crudes, which has taken away a lot of the original crude advantage for that facility when it was originally built. \n Now the TMX pipeline is opening up, so there's a change in the crude flow dynamics, which has the potential to have a positive impact on the Los Angeles facility. And we'll see how that dynamic works out here over the next few months as these crude flows change around. But changing and pulling the Rodeo refinery out will have a marked change on the West Coast. Supported by sustainable aviation fuel. Yes. So Theresa, we talked -- this is Rich again. We talked a little bit about some of the headwinds on market capture, which, when I think about market capture from a Refining perspective, it's our clean product yield. So -- and then it's the products that we make. Are we moving up the product value chain on that? \n So first quarter, certainly, some headwinds with some downstream conversion unit turnaround activity. Good news is we've refreshed all that catalysts now, and they're ready to run here. Some of that did bleed a little bit into the second quarter. But as we roll into the summer driving season, you'll see our clean product yield and product values in about the best place we can put them.\n Now we continue to invest in these as well.

            "content": "We're concurrently in negotiations with partners. We've seen a lot of interest in SAF. Manav, this is Brian Mandell. I would say that we've had a number of issues. We had a warm northeast U.S. winter, then refineries came back and they were running really well. Prices for diesel are in contango. We have seen about 200,000 barrels a day of Russian distillate off the market. But we are constructive. We do think the market will come back. You're seeing -- starting to see run cuts in Europe and Asia with hydrocracking and hydroskimming margins at breakeven.\n As we move into driving season, we could see more gasoline mode. In fact, you're seeing gasoline over distillate on the coast in the U.S., East and West Coast. And that could drive less distillate moving to more jet production from diesel, particularly fixing ahead into China's Labor Day, Golden Week, and we see real strong jet demand. And then continue to geopolitical issues, if Russia's hit again, that means that diesel exports as well. So we think that things are going to look better coming out of kind of this trough here. Jason, it's Brian Mandell. I'll give you some kind of flavor of our journey for commercial. Our commercial supply and trading organization is, as you know, an integrated global business. We have offices in Houston, Calgary, London and Singapore. And as you mentioned, our focus is now to fully optimize and capture the optionality value embedded in all of the assets and then to capture that kind of integration value between the various business segments to drive additional value for the company.\n Last year, internally, we announced a reorganization of our commercial group, the goal of reducing our back office costs and continuing to advance our capabilities and value generations. We've made some really strong hires this year. We also have a companion organization that we call value chain optimization group, VCO for short, whose function is to work across the integrated value chain to ensure that we continue to make the best corporate general interest decisions.\n And ultimately, we're kind of focused on driving increased earnings, maximizing our return on capital employed and increasing the market capture for our Refining segment, and doing all this while thinking about continuous improvement and continually growing the business.

            "name": "Mark Lashier",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff. Welcome, everyone, to our first quarter earnings call. We continued to progress our strategic priorities and we returned significant cash to our shareholders. While our crude utilization rates were strong during the quarter, our results were affected by maintenance that limited our ability to make higher-value products. We were also impacted by the renewable fuels conversion at Rodeo as well as the effect of rising commodity prices on our inventory hedge positions. \n Currently, our assets are running near historical highs, and we are ready to meet peak summer demand. Before we provide an update on our strategic priorities, we want to recognize our Midstream, Refining and Chemicals businesses, which have all received honors for their exemplary safety performance in 2023. \n Our Midstream gathering and processing business received the Top 2023 GPA Safety Award in the large operator division. In Refining, the Rodeo and Sweeny facilities both received the AFPM Distinguished Safety Award, which is the highest annual safety award in the industry. This was Sweeny refinery's third straight year to receive the honor. \n The Ponca City Refinery earned the Elite Platinum Award and the Lake Charles Refinery secured the Elite Gold Award. In Chemicals, CPChem received 2 AFPM Safety Awards. I'm very proud of our employees and the employees of CPChem for their commitment to safety. I would like to congratulate them on a job well done. \n Today, beginning on Slide 4, we'll highlight the progress we've made on our strategic priorities. Next, we'll discuss our first quarter financial results. Then we look forward to your questions. \n We previously announced plans to monetize assets that no longer meet our long-term objectives, and we set a target to generate over $3 billion in proceeds. The expected proceeds will support our strategic priorities, including returns to shareholders. This quarter, we launched a process to divest our retail marketing business in Germany and Austria and communicated the plans to employees. Completion of the dispositions is subject to satisfactory market conditions and customary approvals. \n We have distributed almost $10 billion through share repurchases and dividends since July of 2022. Over the remaining 3 quarters of 2024, we expect to achieve our $13 billion to $15 billion target. Share repurchases will continue to be an important component of our capital allocation. We're committed to return over 50% of our operating cash flows to shareholders. \n Recently, we announced a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend, contributing to a 16% compound annual growth rate since 2012. The dividend increase reflects the confidence we have in our growing mid-cycle cash flow generation and our disciplined approach to capital allocation, including a secure, competitive and growing dividend. \n In Refining, we continue to run at crude utilization rates above the industry average for the fifth consecutive quarter. We remain focused on improving performance, increasing market capture and reducing costs to enhance our earnings per barrel. We have achieved over $560 million or more than $0.80 per barrel in run rate cost reductions from business transformation. We expect to achieve our full $1 per barrel run rate target by the end of the year. \n In Midstream, our NGL wellhead-to-market business is focused on capturing operating and commercial synergies of over $400 million by year-end 2024. Midstream's estimated 2024 mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA is $3.6 billion, providing stable cash generation that covers the company's top capital priorities: funding sustaining capital and the dividend. \n During the first quarter, we achieved a major milestone with the start-up of our Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex. Slide 5 summarizes our journey to transform the San Francisco refinery into one of the world's largest renewable fuels facilities. The facility benefits as a superior location to secure renewable feedstocks and market renewable fuels. The project leverages existing assets and is expected to generate strong returns. \n We began producing renewable diesel from our Unit 250 hydrotreater in April of 2021. We have gained valuable operational experience and market knowledge that positions us for success in our expanding renewable fuels business. Unit 250 continues to exceed expectations and has increased production to approximately 10,000 barrels per day. \n Our Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex is producing 30,000 barrels per day of renewable fuels. We're on track to increase production capability to full rates of approximately 50,000 barrels per day by the end of the second quarter. Once complete, we'll have the ability to produce renewable jet, a key component of sustainable aviation fuel. \n We're proud of the team's strong project execution and appreciate their commitment to operating excellence in achieving this significant milestone. The Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex positions Phillips 66 as a world leader in renewable fuels. \n Slide 6 provides an update on business transformation progress. Our run rate savings were $1.24 billion at the end of the first quarter, comprised of $940 million of cost reductions and $300 million of sustaining capital efficiencies. \n Through the first quarter, we've achieved $750 million in annualized cost reductions. The majority of these cost reductions relate to refining operating and SG&A expenses as well as benefits to equity earnings and gross margin. We are on track to realize $1 billion of cost reductions in 2024 to sustain higher cash generation. \n Before I turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results, I want to stress that the market fundamentals are good, our assets are running well, and we have a clear path to achieving our strategic priorities and growing cash flows. Yes, Neil, that's a great question. Thank you for asking that. The way I'm looking at this is those first quarter headwinds that you mentioned in Refining are all related to activities that will position us to deliver medium- and long-term tailwinds in support of our strategic priorities. And so it's some of the fundamental work going on around Rodeo and some of the work around our turnarounds are critically important. \n And Rich and Kevin can drive into that a little bit more. And including some of the activities in commercial that we underwent over the last several quarters, that will contribute to our long-term success. So Rich, do you want to dive in? Yes. And I think, just to put that in context, we're taking a disadvantaged refinery and converting it into one of the world's largest renewable fuels facilities. And so to bridge to that, we took the heavy lift this quarter, and now we're well positioned to start delivering value again from the Rodeo facility as we continue to push it to full rates through the second quarter. \n And then on the Gulf Coast, the way you have to think about that is we're still maximizing our crude utilization throughput, but that crude turned into intermediates instead of clean products by design because of the turnaround work we had underway. So now we've got that inventory of intermediates poised to be converted into clean products as we continue to ramp back up into the summer season. So we're well positioned going forward. Yes. I think that, certainly, the majority of our business transformation cost impact is showing up in Refining, and we've been out delivering our targets, overdelivering against our targets and certainly continue that into 2024. There's always a lag, and we talk about run rate and then we talk about realized, and we're going to make sure that you keep track, too. \n The run rate is where the speedometer is at this point in time. The realized is what we're actually seeing show up in the numbers, and we've seen good progress in Refining. And we'll continue to see that throughout this year as we rise up to our forecasted $1.1 billion in cost and $300 million in capital synergies, capital savings. And so Rich can drive into those cost numbers for you, Roger, and give you some color around that. Yes, Roger, and I really want to drive home what Rich just said, that the cultural impact on the organization has been impressive, particularly out in the field, whether it's Midstream, Refining, wherever you are. And we have a workforce that has bought into it, and it's committed to driving higher levels of performance. They understand right out at the front lines, they understand what our strategic priorities are and how they can contribute to us getting there. And so they're digging in, and they're looking at those opportunities every day. \n And across the organization, we continue to simplify work, to make work easier for people to get done. So get people the right digital opportunity so they can make better decisions faster, whether it's commercial or whether it's an operator on the front line. And the organization, we're also simplifying. And we want to ensure that we've got a streamlined organization that will support sustainable success around both cost and performance, and we're seeing that live as we move forward. Yes. Ryan, when we get up to full rates, we'll be able to produce something on the order of 10,000 barrels a day of renewable jet fuel, which gets blended up then to sustainable aviation fuel in the marketplace. And this kit is going to be designed for continuous optimization, whether it's the split between jet and diesel fuel or the feedstocks coming in. \n Because of the feed pretreatment unit we'll have, we'll have great flexibility. And so we'll optimize on CI, cost and revenue and as well as the incentives that are out there. So it's going to be an interesting facility to have in our kit, and we're looking forward to getting it fully online and generating cash. Yes. Ryan, you're seeing live the last almost 25 years of what CPChem has done to position themselves to be able to run flat out at the bottom of the cycle. And they did that, and they did that profitably. And you're seeing rationalization of assets in Europe while they're running at flat-out rates. \n And so that's encouraging from a CPChem perspective. We need to see that in this down cycle to see some of the less competitive assets come out of the system, and that's going to be constructive. And that will help accelerate the industry out of the bottom of the cycle and to greener pastures out in the next couple of years. Sure. I think at a high level, Theresa, we are laser focused on the things we can control, and that's what we focus on, and that's what Rich and Brian focus on. I think that the things out of our control would be  speculative. But I think Rich can talk about what we're doing to -- and what we see over the next couple of quarters with respect to market capture potential, and Brian can chime in from a commercial perspective. Thank you, all, for your great questions. The market fundamentals that we're looking at are supportive, and our assets are running strong since the completion of seasonal maintenance activities. Our integrated portfolio is well positioned to capture market opportunities and to meet the peak summer demand. \n We've got a clear path forward to achieve our strategic priorities that support $4 billion of growth from our 2022 mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA to our $14 billion target by 2025. We're confident in our ability to grow cash flows and create significant long-term value for shareholders. Thank you for your interest in Phillips 66. If you have questions after today's call, please call Jeff or Owen. Thank you."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Timothy Roberts",
            "content": "Yes. Ryan, this is Tim Roberts, and I'll chat about that. I'll cover 3 things because I think there'll be other questions around it. First one I wanted to talk about is actually more on the leadership side. I just wanted to recognize Bruce Chinn, who was the recently retired CEO at CPChem. He did a really good job there, great leadership, great drive for excellence, and he'll be missed.\n We have an internal candidate, Steve Prusak, who's assumed the role of CEO. Steve has been very successful in all phases of the Chemical business, and we are highly confident in his ability to lead and take CPChem to the next level of industry-leading performance. So that, I want to thank both of those guys.\n Now on the macro side, let me talk about that, and then I'll get specific to CPChem. Macro, clearly, the heavy-light spread with regard to being light feed versus heavy feed, it's really been a boon to those that can crack the light feedstock, especially CPChem, who's well positioned not only in the U.S. Gulf Coast but in the Middle East. And so it's -- the advantage is pretty wide right now. And so they've been able to take advantage of it. In fact, the industry in the U.S., if you're cracking light, you like it.\n However, I will tell you, we are not at mid-cycle margins. It has come off the bottom, which is good. A lot of that is really related to more about feedstock. So natural gas has come off. It's come down. And subsequently, ethane's come down with it, as has some propane and butane as well. And so subsequently, that gap has gotten bigger, and then, anyway, that's showing up, and then, also, the lower feedstock and natural gas relative to utility cost.\n So the combination of those 2, as well as just a little bit of support on polyethylene pricing, not a lot, but enough to help widen up that chain margin a little bit. So I think that's been good. We still think, though, that although we're off the bottom, we still think it's hard to see us getting to mid-cycle anytime during 2025. But certainly, supply-demand fundamentals, as destocking goes, we do see that it's -- sometime after 2025, you can see it rebalance and then get back into a mid-cycle environment.\n Specifically to CPChem, though, I do want to highlight as well with them that they've had a couple of their mid-cap projects that did come onstream late last year, C3 splitter, the 1-hexene unit, and then they also added another furnace to one of the large crackers there. And 1-hexene and C3, they're adding earnings in the first quarter. So they're up, they're running. They have run it higher than nameplate capacity, which has been really good, and again, generating earnings that are showing up at CPChem's results. \n And we're in really a start-up mode with the furnace. That work is complete. They're starting it up, going through the normal shakedown you will have with those units. And we're hoping, in 2Q, you'll see something more material on the earnings side there, too. And Mark, to add on to that point, I think that's a great point. What you're seeing is that a lot of your higher-cost folks, they're running at reduced rates or they're shut down and extending maintenance or running at reduced rates. And we've even seen some facilities, namely in Europe, 2 announcements of 2 crackers that will be shutting down from some competition there because they're at the wrong place in the cost curve, whereas CPChem is on the right place in the cost curve. Yes. Manav, thanks for the question. This is Tim Roberts again, and let me go ahead and address. I mean first thing I want to lay out there is that last quarter on the earnings call, I talked about guiding towards $675 million per quarter IBT, and we're staying with that. I mean that still feels good, $3.6 billion to the year. That's where we're at. So I just wanted to make sure we were -- that hasn't changed. Now if you look at 4Q and 1Q, 4Q was a strong quarter, okay? That was the first thing. \n You had some onetime things that showed up in that fourth quarter. And in first quarter, what impacted it and especially the variance, number one, winter storm. So the winter storm, it impacted us and impacted other people, too. And really, the impact was, and I think it's worth noting, were really not to our assets, it was to the producers. So we really weren't seeing the volumes come down the pipe due to freeze-offs and a variety of other different issues. \n So it took a while for those volumes to get back up and get running again and then subsequently start working their way through the system. So about $30 million impact there. And then also, we had some commercial true-ups from fourth quarter to first quarter, commercial true-ups, accruals and some inventory timing that showed up between fourth quarter to first quarter. \n And so if you put those 2 quarters together, you really are getting in somewhere north of that $675 million number where we're at. We think we'll be on a more normalized basis as we go into 2Q. And you'll see some inventory timing issues will show up. It's not big, but some will show up in the second quarter as a positive. But generally, that's kind of how we look at it. We're still in that $675 million is the right number as we see throughout the year. Theresa, I'll verify the number, but we're well into, I would say, it's 65% to 70% third parties."

            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Slide 7 summarizes our first quarter results. Adjusted earnings were $822 million or $1.90 per share. Operating cash flow, excluding working capital, was $1.2 billion. We received distributions from equity affiliates of $348 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $628 million, including $171 million for a Midstream joint venture debt repayment. We distributed $1.6 billion to shareholders through $1.2 billion of share repurchases and $448 million of dividends. Net debt-to-capital ratio was 38%. \n Slide 8 highlights the change in results by segment from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. During the period, adjusted earnings decreased $540 million, mostly due to lower results in Refining, Midstream and Marketing and Specialties, partially offset by improved results in Chemicals. \n In Midstream, first quarter adjusted pretax income of $613 million was down $141 million from the prior quarter, reflecting lower results in transportation and NGL. Transportation results were down mainly due to a decrease in throughput and deficiency revenues, partially offset by seasonally lower maintenance costs. The NGL business decreased primarily due to a decline in margins as well as lower volumes, reflecting impacts from winter storms.  \n Chemicals adjusted pretax income increased $99 million to $205 million in the first quarter. This increase was mostly due to higher polyethylene margins, driven by improved sales prices and the decline in feedstock costs as well as lower turnaround costs. Global O&P utilization was 96%. \n Refining first quarter adjusted pretax income was $228 million, down $569 million from the fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower realized margins. Our commercial results were less favorable than the previous quarter, in part due to inventory hedging impacts in a rising price environment and less advantageous pipeline arbs. \n In addition, realized margins decreased due to lower Gulf Coast clean product realizations. Our Refining results and market capture of 69% were also negatively impacted by maintenance activities on downstream conversion units as well as the renewable fuels conversion at Rodeo. \n Marketing and Specialties adjusted first quarter pretax income was $345 million, a decrease of $87 million from the previous quarter. The decrease was mainly due to lower domestic marketing and lubricant margins. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 21%. \n Slide 9 shows the change in cash during the first quarter. We started the quarter with a $3.3 billion cash balance. Cash from operations, excluding working capital, was $1.2 billion. There was a working capital use of $1.4 billion, mainly reflecting a $2.6 billion increase in inventory, partially offset by benefits and accounts payables and receivables, which included the impact of rising commodity prices. \n Net debt issuances were $802 million. We returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Additionally, we funded $628 million of capital spending. Our ending cash balance was $1.6 billion. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items for the second quarter. \n In Chemicals, we expect the second quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the second quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. Turnaround expense is expected to be between $100 million and $120 million, excluding Rodeo. We anticipate second quarter Corporate and Other costs to come in between $330 million and $350 million, reflecting higher net interest expense. \n Now we will open the line for questions, after which Mark will make closing comments. Yes. Let me just put a couple of numbers to some of these items. So in terms of some commercial impacts that we talk about, on Gulf Coast product pricing differentials, in absolute terms, that was a $50 million headwind in the first quarter. The inventory hedges that I referenced in the earlier comments, which primarily impacts Central Corridor, that was a $100 million headwind in the first quarter. These are not variances, these are absolutes in the quarter. \n And then on the West Coast, Rodeo, in overall terms, was a $180 million negative or loss for the quarter. So the West Coast results are bearing that drag from the impact of the Rodeo conversion. Yes, Neil, so let me hit on the working capital piece first. So negative $1.4 billion in aggregate, about $2.6 million of that is a function of inventory build. And so we did have some partial offsetting benefit in payables and receivables, and that was driven by 2 items. \n One, the rising price, the absolute rising price environment generally is positive for net AP/AR. So we saw some benefit there. But we also benefited on receivables by collecting, in the first quarter, cash from fourth quarter inventory drawdown, and that was several hundred million dollars that showed up in there. \n But on the inventory build, it's a sizable build, and I would say, it's really a function of both commercial opportunity inventory as well as some operational-driven inventory. And the way to think about that is the operational barrels will turn into margin at a future point in time, like the intermediates that we've talked about. \n The commercial inventory build, those will generate a return that will be in excess of anything we will realize on cash balances. And fundamentally, it's all still sitting in a liquid asset on the balance sheet. So that kind of talks to the working capital. And consistent with normal practice, you would expect that inventory to come back down in the -- towards the end of the year, and you'll see some of that cash coming back to us. \n In terms of balance sheet and the leverage levels, we are above our targeted range, so 25% to 30% target range. Still comfortable with that target. You'll notice that we've been leaning into the share repurchases quite heavily, and that's a function of our confidence in the business, in the outlook, our growth that we see coming in terms of the $14 billion of mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA. And so it feels like still a pretty compelling opportunity for us to be buying shares back even if, in the near term, it's at the expense of that leverage metric. So still expect to get there to that level. That's still our objective. \n And the other comment I'd make on leverage, the other metric, the other way we look at this is the non -- or the much less commodity-sensitive businesses, the Midstream and the Marketing and Specialties business, is our ability for those businesses to basically be able to bear the debt that the company has. So on a combined basis, that's circa $6 billion of EBITDA generation. \n And if you think of a typical leverage multiple for businesses like that, call it 3x, that's $18 billion of net debt, which is roughly where we are. And so that's the other measure we look at. And that keeps the Refining business avoid that volatility being part of that, the way we look at that debt level. So it keeps us very comfortable from a balance sheet standpoint. Yes, Roger, it's Kevin. So we're selling the Germany and Austria retail assets, like we said. That's a company-owned, dealer-operated model, primarily almost 1,000 sites across those 2 countries. That's a high-performing business, top-rated many years in a row, 10% of market share in each country. A great business, but doesn't really integrate with the sort of core strategic focus areas that we have as a company. So just a little bit of background as to why those assets. \n It does not include our ownership in the MiRO Refinery in Germany. And the reason for that is the majority of buyers for those type of retail assets would not be interested in refinery ownership. If there's a buyer that is interested, then that's a separate conversation, and we'll handle that separately. But this package right now is focused on those marketing assets. Yes, John. From a Europe standpoint, the other marketing businesses are in Switzerland, where we have a joint venture with Coop, and in the U.K. And the two are very different in that the Switzerland business is somewhat of a stand-alone retail business, but it's also in a joint venture structure, and so the dynamics are a little bit different around that. \n The U.K., that marketing business is very integrated with our Refining in the U.K. So it's much more akin to the U.S. model, where the Marketing business serves to help ensure product placement coming out of the Humber Refinery. And that's really the case for the U.S. Marketing business as well. It's very much integrated with the Refining system across the different regions. Yes, Matt, this is Kevin. The EBITDA, I'll give you the numbers that are on the information that we're providing to the prospective buyers. It's a -- the range is EUR 300 million to EUR 350 million, which the conversion for that is $325 million to $375 million. If you pick the midpoint, $350 million of EBITDA is probably your best number to go with on that.\n In terms of cash generation, as we've previously stated, our cash return target of $13 billion to $15 billion was not dependent on proceeds from asset sales. So it does have the potential to increase that. But I would also say, we haven't made any definitive decisions on exactly how that cash would be deployed. And also, the timing is still quite uncertain at this point anyway. These processes usually take a while to run through. So that will be something that we will make a determination on near the time when that cash inflow becomes real. So on the first question, we're not going to give that level of asset-specific breakout. And I would say, the $180 million does not include -- the absolute loss on a GAAP basis is a bigger number, again, because we had some impairments related to assets that are taken out of service. So the $180 million is on the -- consistent with the way we report our adjusted earnings. And it does show up in the different areas, but we're not going to provide that level of line item breakout.\n The second question was around EBITDA while we're in ramp-up mode. My observation, and others can supplement this is, clearly, when we're in ramp-up mode, we're running the higher CI feedstocks. We don't yet have the full economies of scale because we're in ramp-up mode. EBITDA generation is going to be challenged than the early phases. But as we go through that series of bringing all the units up, production coming up to the 50,000 barrels per day, the feedstocks migrating to the more -- the lower carbon intensity, we should start to see that transition into positive EBITDA contribution. That's right. It's another uplift, yes. OpEx, excluding Rodeo, yes, Paul, I think the best way to answer that is because we don't give that level of asset level detail out. But we will be providing more reporting transparency on a going-forward basis that will enable you to see the kind of level of information that your -- the questions that you're asking for. \n In future periods, we will be providing more transparency around the Rodeo renewable fuels business separate from West Coast Refining. And so I would just say, I know that doesn't help you in terms of modeling right now, but just watch this space because we will be providing more transparency around that. Well, it's probably down a little. There's still going to be an elevated element of that, and there's some what we would classify as turnaround-related costs associated with the conversion as well that will show up at Rodeo. But the trend is downward. We're past the peak spend, I guess, is the way to say it. And Jason, on the cash number, the target cash balance, the same as we've said in the past, $2 billion to $3 billion. We were slightly below that level at the end of the quarter. I'd also say, the first quarter is typically a heavy drain on cash quarter. So as we look ahead, we're still very comfortable with that target level."
