[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. \n It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed. \nKiley Rawlins: Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer; and Dave Kimbell, President. \n Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that statements on this conference call, which are not historical facts, may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today, March 11, 2021. We have no obligation to update or revise our forward-looking statements, except as required by law, and you should not expect us to do so. \n In today's comments, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS, which have been presented to reflect our view of our ongoing operations by adjusting fiscal 2020 results for store impairment charges, costs associated with the permanent closure of 19 stores and the decision to suspend our expansion into Canada as well as other restructuring costs, and adjusting both 2020 and 2019 for stock compensation and other tax credits. A reconciliation of these measures to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release, which is available on -- in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ulta.com. \n Following prepared remarks from our leadership team, we will open the call for questions. As our prepared remarks will be longer than usual, we plan to end our call today at 5:15 Central Time. [Operator Instructions] As always, the IR team will be available for any follow-up questions you have after the call. \n Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mary. Mary? \nMary Dillon: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start today with comments about our leadership transition plans and then share highlights from our fourth quarter and full year results. Then Dave will discuss our priorities for 2021, and Scott will review the financial results and our outlook. \n Starting with the succession plans we announced this afternoon. I am very excited to announce that in June, Dave Kimbell will become CEO of Ulta Beauty, and I will transition to Executive Chair of the Board. In addition, Kecia Steelman will be elevated to Chief Operating Officer in June. In conjunction with these changes, Bob DiRomualdo will retire from his role as Chair of the Board as planned, and Lorna Nagler will assume the role of Lead Independent Director. These changes reflect a thorough and thoughtful succession planning process I have engaged in with our Board of Directors over multiple years and are designed to ensure strategic and leadership continuity as Ulta Beauty moves into its next chapter of growth. I personally want to thank our Board for their care, consideration and oversight of this important process. \n After serving as CEO for nearly 8 years, I believe the time is right for me and for Ulta Beauty to make this change. We have a differentiated business model that has proven its strength over and over again throughout our 30-plus year history and position Ulta Beauty as a leader in the beauty industry. We've developed and sustained a world-class, guest-centric, values-based, high-performance culture. \n We're emerging from the 2020 pandemic with a strong foundation and good operational momentum, and we have a talented, diverse and experienced team of leaders to drive our next phase of growth. While I'm proud of what we've achieved over these past 8 years, I truly believe now is the time for my successor and their leadership team to continue the journey. \n Since joining Ulta Beauty as Chief Marketing Officer in 2014, Dave has continued to expand his leadership responsibilities, ultimately assuming the role of President in 2019. Highly regarded in the beauty industry, Dave is a results-driven, guest-focused, inclusive leader who've to motivate teams and activate strategies to move our business forward. Dave's passion for Ulta Beauty, our guests and our associates is extraordinary, and I believe there was no one more prepared or better suited to lead Ulta Beauty into the future. \n Kecia Steelman joined Ulta Beauty in 2014 as Senior Vice President of Operations before assuming the role of Chief Store Operations Officer in 2015. In this role, she has overseen all aspects of store and salon operations, leading passionate associates to consistently deliver great experiences for our guests, even as we nearly doubled our footprint. As Chief Operating Officer, Kecia will have responsibility for store and services operations, supply chain, external partnerships, including Ulta Beauty at Target and key enterprise-wide continuous improvement initiatives. \n Dave and Kecia will be supported by an executive team with deep expertise and Ulta Beauty experience. My focus has been and will continue to be on Ulta Beauty. And in my new role as Executive Chair, I'll advise and support Dave on key issues, including strategy, external relationships and organizational development. My plan is to remain in the Executive Chair role for 1 year. I am optimistic and excited about the long-term growth opportunity for Ulta Beauty, and I'm confident that under Dave's leadership, Ulta Beauty will keep shaping and leading the beauty industry for many years to come. \n Now let's talk about our fourth quarter performance. The Ulta Beauty team delivered better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter. For the quarter, net sales were $2.2 billion, and GAAP diluted EPS was $3.03 per share. Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter was $3.41 per share. Strong enterprise-wide execution of our plans, combined with improving trends in consumer demand, resulted in momentum across multiple metrics, including sales, transactions and profitability. \n We experienced less disruption from COVID than we anticipated in the quarter, and top line trends improved across all channels and all categories, resulting in a comp store sales decline of 4.8%, an improvement compared to the 8.9% decline in the third quarter. We kicked off the holiday season in early November with our multichannel See the Joy campaign, targeted marketing and promotional activity and an extended Black Friday event. We continue to lean into our successful We Love Our Members events throughout holiday, rewarding guests with member-only offers promoted broadly across channels to reinforce the value of the program and to engage our members. \n And we leveraged our CRM and analytics capabilities to expand our reach and maximize productivity. We drove strong sell-through of holiday merchandise and core product, and transitioned quickly after holiday to support our strategic Love Your Skin and Jumbo Love events. The planned expansion of our gift card program drove robust year-over-year growth in gift card sales during the holiday period and delivered elevated redemption activity in stores post-holiday. \n Our e-commerce business increased more than 70%. With increased fulfillment capacity in place, our DC and store teams did an excellent job supporting record level of e-commerce demand. Limitations on in-store capacity and reduced operating hours are still in place, but we're encouraged by the momentum we're seeing in store traffic. \n From a category perspective, we continue to increase our market share across most major prestige beauty categories. Starting with one of our strategic growth categories, skincare delivered a low double-digit comp. In addition to broader self-care and wellness trends, newness and engagement and social media platforms are driving interest in newer brands like The Ordinary and Urban Skin Rx as well as established brands like CeraVe and First Aid Beauty. Fragrance and bath delivered strong double-digit comp growth delivered -- driven by newness and a strong base fragrance business from brands like Chanel and Dior. Bath also continued to benefit from self-care trends, newness and social media engagement. \n Comp sales in haircare were down slightly in the quarter, primarily reflecting planned changes to our Jumbo Love event, which negatively impacted top line growth but delivered significant profit improvement. Excluding the event, comp sales in the haircare category were positive for the quarter, driven by hair color, color care, texture and innovation. Prestige hair continues to be an area of focus. And in January, we launched Briogeo, a black-owned clean brand formulated for all hair types in all stores and online. \n Comp sales in the makeup category were negative but improved sequentially, reflecting less year-over-year product newness and continued mask wearing and limitations on makeup wearing occasions. While new launches were limited, we do see guests eager to engage with newness from established brands like Too Faced and NYX as well as new brands, including Laura Mercier, KVD Beauty and HOURGLASS. \n Sales from our services business were down more than 40% in the fourth quarter due to a decline in transactions, while average ticket continued to be higher. Our services business remains adversely impacted by COVID-related capacity constraints and local restrictions, but we're starting to see some local markets increase capacity thresholds. \n While we ended fiscal 2020 with 30.7 million loyalty members, about 10% fewer than last year, we maintained strong retention levels of our high-value platinum and diamond members. The reduction in total members was anticipated given store closures earlier in the year and ongoing store traffic challenges. Importantly, we saw a rebound in new membership this quarter as our store associates delivered stronger conversion versus last year. \n Reactivation trends also rebounded due to amplified marketing and promotional efforts across print and digital channels. We also saw good growth in our credit card program, increasing our member penetration by about 400 basis points versus last year, reflecting strong acquisition and retention of our highly engaged credit card members. \n We ended the year with noteworthy changes in our member channel mix. While 2/3 of our members continue to be in-store-only shoppers this year, our mix of omnichannel members nearly doubled to 23% of members, and our online-only members grew to 12% of members. \n While Scott will take you through the details of the P&L in a few minutes, I want to highlight 2 areas of focus that are delivering tangible results for our profitability. First, we continue to see strong success in optimizing our promotions. We offered a number of compelling promotions during holiday, but we further leveraged our CRM capabilities to be more targeted and more profitable with our offers. Post-holiday, we saw an opportunity to be more strategic and employ relevant storytelling to drive guest engagement. For our Love Your Skin and Jumbo Love event, we took a content-forward approach across print and digital channels to focus on education and routines, highlighted newness like never before and refined the focus of offers in brand participation. As a result of these efforts, we delivered meaningful improvement in our merchandise margin. \n Second, we continued to take steps to reset our cost structure. After a thorough and thoughtful evaluation of work and capabilities across every corporate function, this quarter, we eliminated approximately 340 roles, resulting in a charge in the quarter of approximately $10 million. Even as we made difficult decisions to eliminate certain roles, we also reorganized select teams, expanded some roles and introduced a number of new positions in key investment areas aligned to our strategic priorities. We expect these decisions will result in approximately $50 million of SG&A savings in 2021. These decisions were incredibly difficult, but I'm proud of the respect, care and compassion that went into the process. I'm confident these changes, combined with planned investments to enhance our enterprise capabilities, will position Ulta Beauty for continued success in the short and long term. \n And now turning to the full year. From a financial perspective, total sales were $6.2 billion; comp store sales decreased 17.9%; and GAAP diluted EPS was $3.11 per share. Adjusted diluted EPS for the year was $4.68 per share. While fiscal 2020 was not the year we originally planned, I am proud of how our teams adjusted and responded to the unprecedented challenges, and I want to express my sincere appreciation to my leadership team and all Ulta Beauty associates for their flexibility, agility and unwavering commitment to our guests and to each other. \n Facing a very dynamic operating environment early in 2020, we moved quickly to align on 6 strategic priorities intended to expand our market share and extend our competitive advantages. We made meaningful progress across each of these priorities in 2020. \n Our teams continue to deliver great omnichannel experiences for our guests. After temporarily closing all of our stores in March in response to the spread of the virus, we began welcoming back guests and associates to stores in May with our new shop safe standards in all stores and enhanced digital shopping capabilities to keep our guests and our associates safe. \n While store traffic remained challenged, sales through our digital channels doubled in fiscal 2020. To meet this increased demand, we expanded our e-commerce fulfillment capabilities, including the opening of our Jacksonville fast fulfillment center, expansion of our ship from store capabilities and introduction of curbside pickup. Reflecting increased safety concerns, we restricted the use of testers in stores but accelerated our virtual try-on capabilities. \n We expanded GLAMlab, our virtual try-on tool, beyond cosmetics to include hair color, false lashes and the Benefit Brow Bar. We expanded our shade library to include more than 11,000 shades. We introduced QR code so that guests could virtually try on shades while in store. We also introduced a digital skin analysis tool to assess guest skincare needs and offer personalized product and regimen recommendations. In 2020, more than 11 million guests engaged with these tools, trying on more than 100 million shades through the app and ulta.com. \n In a year that saw the contraction of the U.S. prestige beauty market, Ulta Beauty gained dollar share, specifically in key categories, such as makeup, skincare and fragrance based on NPD's point-of-sale data for the 52 weeks ending January 30, 2021. We expanded our assortment in key growth categories like skincare, haircare and wellness to provide guests with engaging newness and innovation. And we launched Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty in stores and at ulta.com, certifying more than 230 brands across 4 key pillars: clean ingredients; cruelty-free; vegan; and sustainable packaging. \n Our marketing teams pivoted quickly to reflect the environment. And as a result, we maintained our unaided awareness in the mid-50% range and increased our aided awareness. \n We drove innovation in our Ultamate Rewards loyalty program, launching new member appreciation events, implementing new reactivation campaigns and reinforcing the value of the program across all communication channels. Behind the scenes, we expanded our CRM capabilities, leveraging new propensity modeling applications to optimize the return on print investment and reengage with labs and at-risk members in our marketing outreach. \n We took actions in fiscal 2020 also to adjust our cost structure. We delivered meaningful reductions in occupancy costs through aggressive negotiations and effective portfolio management, and we permanently closed 19 stores to further strengthen our store portfolio. We made changes to our store management structure to improve efficiency and productivity, and we took steps to rightsize our corporate structure. \n We announced, of course, an exclusive partnership with Target Corporation that will disrupt the beauty category and change how guests experience beauty. \n And finally, we published our first ESG report, sharing our efforts and commitments in 4 key pillars: people, product, community and the environment. While we're early in our journey, I am proud of the progress we've made in these areas, particularly as it relates to diversity and inclusion. Diversity and inclusion have always been important at Ulta Beauty as we want all associates to feel they can be their true authentic selves. \n Given the events that unfolded throughout 2020, addressing racial and social injustice has become more important than ever. At the end of fiscal 2020, 91% of our associates were women and 47% of our associates were people of color. On our leadership team, 64% were female and 18% were people of color. We recently announced new commitments to help us progress further in our journey to support greater diversity, inclusivity and equity. Our team is deeply committed to leading purposefully with and for underrepresented voices across retail and beauty. \n Fiscal 2020 was a difficult year, but the progress we've made positions us well to grow and lead in a post-COVID environment. \n And now I'd like to introduce Dave Kimbell, who will share more about our plans and priorities for fiscal '21. Dave? \nDavid Kimbell: Thanks, Mary. \n Before I discuss our priorities for 2021, I want to thank you, Mary, for your world-class and exceptional leadership of Ulta Beauty, and personally, for your mentorship. Your impact on our company has been tremendous. Under your leadership, Ulta Beauty has grown to become a beloved beauty destination, known as a welcoming and accessible place for guests and an inclusive workplace, offering outstanding career opportunities for associates. I'm grateful to have worked alongside you for many years and look forward to your ongoing support and guidance as I transition to my new role in June. \n I also want to express my sincere appreciation to our Board of Directors for the opportunity to become Ulta Beauty's next CEO and to all of our associates and partners for their continued support. \n In addition, I want to offer congratulations to Kecia on her well-deserved promotion to Chief Operating Officer. I look forward to leading with Kecia and our experienced diverse executive team in service of our Ulta Beauty associates, our guests and our shareholders. \n I am passionate about the beauty category, the vibrant and dynamic business we have built, and the role we play in the beauty industry and in our guests' lives. Ulta Beauty is the leading destination for beauty discovery and meaningful human experiences, and I am excited and humbled by the opportunity to lead such a strong organization through the next phase of its growth. \n As Mary said earlier, fiscal 2020 was a difficult year, but our teams met the challenges with agility, creativity and an unwavering focus on serving our guests. As a result, we begin 2021 with a strong foundation from which we can accelerate our growth and shape how guests experience beauty in the post-COVID environment. \n As we think about growth opportunities in the new normal, we are focused on 6 strategic priorities to continue expanding our market share gains and extending our competitive advantages. \n First, we are committed to meeting guests wherever they want to shop, whether it's in physical stores or on digital platforms. To support this commitment, we're building capabilities to win in an increasingly omnichannel world. This is not a new journey for us. And as Mary noted, we made a lot of progress in 2020. As we look forward to 2021, we plan to continue to expand and refresh our store fleet, including opening approximately 40 net new stores this year; further accelerate our e-commerce business through elevated marketing, loyalty engagement and advancement on our journey to create a more personalized experience for our guests on all our digital platforms; continue to evolve our supply chain to enable more flexibility while also supporting our omnichannel strategies; and as the newest pillar in our omnichannel strategy, successfully open Ulta Beauty at Target. \n Since our November announcement about the new partnership with Target, our teams continue to make progress to bring our vision to life. Our brands are excited to partner with us, and we have more brands than originally considered for the space, with strong support from our largest brand partners as well as several brands, which are exclusive to Ulta Beauty across makeup, skin, skincare, haircare and fragrance. We remain confident that this partnership is an innovative, forward-looking approach to further delight our existing members while also acquiring new members from the millions of guests shop in Target every day. We continue to see great social engagement and enthusiasm for Ulta Beauty at Target, and we're on track to launch online in about 100 stores in the fall, scaling to hundreds of stores in the next few years. \n Our second strategic priority is to reimagine how guests experience and discover beauty across all touch points. COVID-19 has not changed the importance of beauty, and we are confident in the future growth of the category. Beauty enthusiasts still value the human connection and physical experience of beauty but want to balance safety with the desire to discover and play with product. Reflecting these factors, we are elevating the end-to-end guest experience at Ulta Beauty. \n In 2021, we intend to safely reintroduce testers in select areas of the store and work closely with our brand partners to develop innovative sampling programs; drive enhancements to our digital experiences, further investing in our app, including guided education and recommendation experiences like our skin advisor; implement layout changes in select new stores to elevate key growth categories; unify the presentation of skincare makeup and improve the focus pickup experience; and as our associates have the greatest impact on the guest experience, we plan to implement training for our team, focused on priority categories like skincare as well as key skills to further strengthen human connections with our guests. \n Our third priority is to drive winning category strategies to engage and delight beauty enthusiasts and expand our market share. Our curation of a diverse assortment focused on newness, exclusivity and leading brands has enabled us to grow our market share over time. Building on the progress we made in 2020, we plan to continue to strengthen our assortment in key growth categories like skincare and haircare while protecting our strength in makeup; scale our Conscious Beauty platform; introduce a new wellness shop to offer guests self-care for the mind, body and spirit; and double our number of black-owned brands while investing to increase awareness and support of those brands. \n Our fourth priority is to deepen Ulta Beauty love, loyalty and engagement. Over time, we've evolved our brand purpose to build stronger connections with our guests and the changes and challenges our guests experienced in 2020 provide us with a unique opportunity to reinforce our brand purpose. And of course, our loyalty program is central to our efforts to build brand love for Ulta Beauty. \n In fiscal 2021, we are focused on creating culturally relevant content that leverages the power of beauty to deeply engage with guests across channels, including expanding our Where Dreams Begin campaign and building out our MUSE platform, which was developed to celebrate, honor and amplify black voices in beauty; expanding Beauty School at Ulta Beauty, our content-forward entertainment digital platform to drive hyper-relevant product and services engagement; increasing member growth across channels through new guest acquisition, lapsed member reengagement and targeted retention efforts; and we will accelerate spend and engagement through further personalization efforts, including advancing offer optimization in print and digital channels. \n Our fifth priority is to drive holistic cost optimization. Like others, we face ongoing headwinds from macro cost, including wage pressure and transportation costs. We are also navigating category and channel shifts. In fiscal 2020, we actively took steps to reshape our organization and adjust our cost structure while also investing in new capabilities that will drive future growth. Building on these efforts, we will continue to pursue process optimization opportunities in merchandising and supply chain while also looking for ways to reduce occupancy and operating costs. Importantly, we will continue to invest some of these savings in support of our strategic priorities to drive growth. \n Our final priority is to develop our talent and strengthen our culture. This is not a new priority. Our talent and culture are always in focus, and we know that our associates bring to life the Ulta Beauty brand for our guests. I am incredibly proud of how our teams led through 2020 with respect, empathy and courage. \n Looking to 2021, we will continue to work to create an environment where every associate feels they can fully contribute, and every guest is optimally served regardless of differences. We will expand our training and development to inspire and empower our associates, and we will continue to enhance and magnify our diversity and inclusion efforts. \n In closing, I am excited and optimistic about the future of Ulta Beauty. Our business is emerging from 2020 with good momentum and a strong foundation in place. We are positioned to thrive going forward, and I am confident our team will continue to lead with creativity, passion and continued care for each other and our guests while leading the beauty industry, capturing market share and driving profitable growth. \n And now I'll turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the quarter's financial results and our outlook for fiscal 2021. Scott? \nScott Settersten: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. \n Before I review our financial results and provide our outlook for the year, I just wanted to take a moment on behalf of the entire executive team and all of our associates to congratulate Dave on his upcoming appointment as our next CEO. We are excited for Dave as he takes this next step in his already successful career and have the utmost confidence in his ability to lead Ulta Beauty through its next phase of growth. \n Now beginning with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter declined 4.6%, and total company comp declined 4.8%. As Mary mentioned, we are incredibly pleased with our performance as top line results for the quarter were much better than our internal expectations. \n Average ticket increased 8.3%, primarily driven by an increase in units per transaction. Transactions declined 12.2%. As we have seen in recent quarters, we experienced nice conversion in both channels. We continue to be impacted by softer traffic to stores as well as capacity limitations and fewer operating hours compared to last year. However, we are encouraged by the sequential improvement in store traffic during the fourth quarter. \n As expected, e-commerce growth slowed relative to the third quarter as demand in stores improved but still delivered very strong growth versus last year. Our e-commerce operations delivered a sales increase of 72% for the quarter as guests continue to take advantage of our omnichannel capabilities. Buy online, pick up in store and curbside were strong again this quarter, particularly in the weeks leading up to Christmas, and totaled about 15% of e-commerce sales for the quarter. \n Gross profit margin was 35.1%, an increase of about 10 basis points compared to 35% a year ago. The largest driver of gross margin performance was an increase in merchandise margin, which was driven primarily by lower promotional activity as we chose not to repeat certain promotional activity from last year and continue to refine our promotional strategies. \n We also experienced a positive outcome from our holiday purchasing strategy, which reduced our exposure to limited edition holiday sets and leaned more into core product, resulting in higher sell-through and minimal post-season markdowns and clearance. \n Lastly, we continue to see benefits from our cost optimization efforts across the organization. The increase in merchandise margin was partially offset by the impact of channel shift. However, we are pleased with the profitability improvement in our e-commerce business driven by continued strong adoption of our BOPIS and curbside capabilities as well as the impact from our efforts to refine our promotional strategy. We also experienced deleverage of fixed costs due to lower sales, although the headwinds improved from what we experienced earlier in the year given the better sales trend and actions taken by our real estate team to strengthen our portfolio and reduce occupancy costs, including lease negotiation efforts and our decision to permanently close 19 stores. \n SG&A expenses decreased to $514.1 million compared to $515.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The largest drivers of the decrease were lower store payroll and benefits, and lower variable store expenses as we adjusted to softer store traffic. These reductions were partially offset by higher marketing expense as we continue to prioritize and invest in digital and social channels and resume print advertising in preparation for the holiday season. We also experienced an increase in corporate overhead, primarily due to higher incentive compensation, reflecting our financial performance versus our internal targets, partially offset by reduced spending across multiple areas. \n We incurred about $18 million in PPE and COVID-related expenses during the quarter. This quarter, we recorded a charge of $30.4 million for impairment, restructuring and other costs. Last quarter, we suspended our planned expansion to Canada, and our teams completed the wind down effort during the fourth quarter. This resulted in a $13.2 million charge related to lease termination costs, long-lived asset impairment charges and severance. We also recorded $10 million in severance associated with the charges -- changes made to our corporate and field management organization, $5.6 million in lease termination costs related to the previously announced permanent closure of 19 stores and $1.5 million due to the impairment of tangible long-lived assets and operating lease assets associated with certain stores. \n GAAP operating income decreased to $224.3 million compared to $287.8 million a year ago. Adjusted operating income was $254.7 million or 11.6% of sales. Diluted GAAP earnings per share was $3.03 compared to $3.89 for last year's fourth quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $3.41 compared to $3.83 a year ago. \n Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total inventory decreased 9.7% compared to last year as we adjusted purchasing to maintain flexibility and manage inventory. For the year, we invested $152 million in capital expenditures, including approximately $70 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $49 million for supply chain and IT, and about $33 million for store maintenance and other. We ended the year with $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. \n Reflecting our confidence, we resumed our stock buyback program in the fourth quarter and repurchased approximately 148,000 shares of stock. We have $1.5 billion remaining under our current repurchase authorization. \n Turning to our outlook for 2021. While we are encouraged by recent sales momentum, visibility into the timing of a demand recovery remains limited. We expect much of 2021 will continue to be negatively impacted by masking requirements and social distancing. And while we expect sales trends will improve as we progress throughout the year and COVID-19 vaccines become more accessible, we are planning for total sales to be slightly lower than 2019. That being said, we plan to be nimble and agile, and we'll be prepared to capitalize should the environment improve earlier than we expect. \n Now specifically for 2021. We expect to open approximately 40 net new stores, remodel 11 stores and relocate approximately 10 stores. Note that when the pandemic hit last year, we moved quickly to defer most of the new stores planned for 2020. As a result, more than half of our new stores are expected to open in the first quarter. \n We anticipate net sales for the year will be between $7.2 billion and $7.3 billion, with comp sales planned in the 15 to 17 percentage range. We expect comp results will vary significantly between the front half and the back half of the year as we lap store closures that occurred in the first half of 2020. With this in mind, we anticipate comp growth will be in the low to mid-30s for the first half of 2021 and then moderate to low- to mid-single-digit growth for the second half. We expect operating margin rate for the year will be around 9% of sales as we lap easier top line comparisons due to COVID-19-related store closures in 2020. \n To give you a little more color on the expected puts and takes driving our operating margin expectation, overall, we expect the largest driver of operating margin expansion will come from gross margin. For the year, we anticipate an improving sales trend from our brick-and-mortar operations, resulting in less headwind from channel shift and leverage of fixed costs. We are planning e-commerce penetration to be in the low to mid-20s for the year. We also expect merchandise margin will improve modestly as we continue to optimize our promotional strategy and continue to pursue efficiency for growth opportunities. We also expect SG&A will deleverage, driven primarily by higher store payroll, as we anniversary the $52 million benefit from the CARES Act in fiscal 2020. \n In addition, we expect to see payroll deleverage from store management changes made in 2020 and ongoing wage pressures. Recall that in the fourth quarter of 2020, we realigned our store management structure to create a more cost-efficient store model. As a result of these changes, we will see a reduction of salon payroll, which is part of cost of goods sold, and an increase in retail payroll, which is included in SG&A relative to last year. The deleverage of retail payroll should partially offset by lower corporate overhead, reflecting changes we made in 2020 to reset our corporate cost structure. We anticipate advertising will be relatively flat for the year as a percent of sales. \n These assumptions result in guidance for diluted earnings per share in the range of $8.85 to $9.30 per share, including the impact of approximately $850 million in share repurchases. We plan to spend between $200 million and $250 million in CapEx, including approximately $115 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $77 million for supply chain and IT, and about $33 million for store maintenance and other. \n I would note that our guidance for 2021 assumes a consistent federal tax rate and no material increases in the federal minimum wage and does not include assumptions for any impact related to a resurgence of COVID-19. \n Before we take your questions, I want to announce that we plan to host an analyst and investor conference this fall to share our longer-term plans and outlook. We'll share more of the logistical details later this summer. \n And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: Congratulations, Mary and Dave, on the news today. My question is centered around the guidance for the 15% to 17% comp growth for 2021. I just wondered to the extent that you could comment how you expect the cadence or the role of haircare and skincare driving that comp versus makeup. \nDavid Kimbell: Yes, Kate. Yes. Great question and one that we're spending a lot of time on. As we look out over the course of the year, we continue to be encouraged by the engagement that we're seeing from our guests across channels, both in stores and online. Our non-makeup businesses have been strong throughout -- really, throughout 2020 and certainly in the fourth quarter with skincare, fragrance, haircare, bath, all performing at or above our expectations. And we anticipate that continuing throughout this year. \n There is -- continues to be a fair amount of uncertainty about makeup. And I'd say that's, as we look out over the year, while we have a lot of confidence in the long term of makeup and we know that there will be innovation and growth and new behaviors that will drive long-term growth, and we see signs of engagement through our consumer research, and we anticipate pent-up demand and excitement from guests -- from consumers as they feel more comfortable participating in society and going out and celebrating and doing all the things that I think we know is coming. The question for us is when that will come. And we've built in a number of models where we're certainly prepared for that renewed engagement in makeup. We haven't fully seen it yet even though we've seen signs of it. But we have a whole line of sight towards driving innovation with our brand partners, highlighting through our marketing and communication, leveraging our digital tools, our virtual try-on tools and then being prepared from -- with close coordination with our brand partners on inventory as we see makeup grow. \n So uncertainty by when because it's been a bit of a ride even before COVID on makeup, but we're confident in the long term and prepared for that growth. And all of that is reflected in our guidance for 2021. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: And so, Mary, you're still young. You own a lot of stock in the company, and the business is clearly poised to recover here in 2021. So I think a lot of investors look at the announcement and think this is at least a year early. Can you share your thoughts on why -- further why now? Why investors shouldn't think that way? And any thoughts on how you're thinking about your next career steps beyond June '22 when you leave the board? \nMary Dillon: Well, Chris, I'll take that as a compliment. I'm teasing you. Listen, this has been planned for a while with the Board in terms of the kind of governance and succession planning that we all do. I just feel that this is the right time for me personally. I'm excited. I'm going to be the Executive Chair for a year. So I'm excited about that as well. I'm staying very close to the strategies in the future as well. \n We're coming out of 2020 strong. The foundation of the business is very strong. Most importantly, Dave is ready to take on the next chapter of growth as the CEO of the company. So it just felt to us and to me like a natural time to make this transition. I'm very confident, very confident about the future of Ulta Beauty. And we're excited. I'm also excited that Kecia Steelman is going to have new responsibilities as Chief Operating Officer. So all told, I think this is about as seamless of a succession story as you can come up with, and that we're really excited about it. \nChristopher Horvers: I guess from the personal side, I mean, do you view this as also a good time for you to take another transition into your career? As you think about beyond Ulta, do you still think you're sort of going to stay in the game here as a retail executive? Or any thoughts there would be really helpful. I know it's a personal question. \nMary Dillon: There is so many questions. Yes. No, listen, I'm focused on Ulta Beauty right now, and I'm very excited about that. And that's why I'm going to be the Executive Chair. I'll be the CEO through June and the Executive Chair for a year after that. And we'll see. I'm excited to the next -- for the next chapter, but I don't really have any plans yet. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. \nOmar Saad: I would add my congratulations to everyone as well. I'd be curious -- this is kind of a specific question on makeup, but I'd just be curious what you're seeing given this kind of uncertainty around what the recovery is going to look like and when it's going to start to happen. But a lot of the products you sell have expiration dates on them, expiration periods. I'd be curious if you're seeing any consumers come back into the store or online and kind of throwing out the expired makeup that hasn't been used in the last year and starting to replenish that part of their closet, if you will. \nDavid Kimbell: Well, first, yes, we don't -- we haven't had any issues for sure with expired products or too much inventory or anything like that. But your point about consumers refreshing their stock, their cabinets at home is, we believe, a behavior that is happening throughout 2020. There's been -- as there's been slower engagement in makeup pre-pandemic and then certainly all the disruption that happened throughout 2020, we see a renewal coming in just how people will engage -- how our guests will engage in makeup. The behaviors, the fashions, the looks, the styles will continue to evolve. We're excited and optimistic about that emergence. As I said earlier, the timing is a bit uncertain, but we see it coming. \n And we feel that with that -- our guests are -- they love makeup. They love beauty. They love diving into different categories. They love newness. And I think because the makeup category has been challenged, as a reflection of less engagement for probably the last couple of years, we know our beauty enthusiasts are excited about it. So we'll see that exact behavior you talked about of cleaning out your stock, replacing it with new, leaning into newness, which there is tons coming, and then kind of embracing new looks and new styles as that moves forward. So we think that will be part of the total story. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. \nDana Telsey: And Mary, congratulations on a wonderful career at Ulta, and who knows what comes next. \nMary Dillon: Thank you, Dana. \nDana Telsey: And Dave, congratulations to you on assuming the new role also. As you think about the changes that happened in 2020 going into 2021, how do you think of the digital channel and e-commerce and the margins that you've had in the past? Any opportunity for margins on e-com and digital to improve go forward and how we get there? \nDavid Kimbell: Well, we're thrilled with our digital and e-commerce experience. The growth has been strong for many years and, of course, was extraordinary in 2020 as our guests embrace that channel. And our entire team worked tirelessly to make sure that we are able to service our guests with really unexpected growth in demand. So -- and that engagement will pay off for Ulta Beauty for a long time, not only in the short-term sales, but history shows that as we get our guests engage in multiple aspects of our business, not just in stores, but in stores and online and participating in salon and other aspects, their total loyalty to Ulta Beauty, their total spend, their frequency increases dramatically. And so we're confident that, that will pay off. And so overall, it is a very good outcome for our business to have more people engaged in our digital channels and driving that growth. \n We are, of course, focused on -- there are margin pressures on that part of the business. Again, overall, a very positive part of our business, but -- and so we're focused on that. And we have an entire kind of process to try to continue to optimize costs through promotional activity and cost to serve, and we see that as an important part of the business. \n And Scott, do you want to give a little more color on how we're approaching that? \nScott Settersten: No, no. We've seen -- we've demonstrated in the fourth quarter some of the benefits from promotional optimization, which, again, a lot of that occurs in the digital channel just by the very nature of the shopping experience there. So we believe there's plenty of opportunity to improve the profitability of that channel of our business, both on the promotional side, but also on the supply chain effectiveness side of the business. \n So the FFC strategy, the ship from store strategy, getting closer to our end customers will help. But also just overall scale as that business continues to grow, we believe, will help drive some rate improvement there over the long term. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Crago with Citi Research. \nKelly Crago: Mary, Dave, congratulations. Mary, you will be missed. \n My first question or my question is really around the gross margin. A couple of different areas I want to focus on. I guess, number one, is there a chance that gross margin could reach back to F '19 levels in F '21? \n And then just drilling down a little bit further on the rent and occupancy line. Could you first talk about some of the abatements you got this year and how we should think about the rent and occupancy line in '21? \n And then on the merch margin, I think you said that you expect the merchandise margin to be up for the year. Is that going to be pretty consistent throughout the year given it seems as your [ strategy ] can pull on to some of these lower promotional [ savings ] going forward? \nScott Settersten: Yes. So there's a lot connected to that question, but the overall theme about gross margin getting back to 2019, again, there's a lot of puts and takes. If you go back to the -- our prepared remarks, just we gave a lot of detail -- provided a lot of detail on that. I would say our initial outlook is not to get back to 2019. Part of it is the geography change on the services manager moving out of gross margin. So that's a plus up for us, but there is something -- the sales -- lower sales overall, at least our initial outlook there, creates a bit of deleverage there when we look back and try to compare to 2019. So there is quite a laundry list of things besides channel mix, which is one of the biggest drivers when we look at '21 versus '19. Again, a reminder, 2019 e-commerce was in the mid-teens as a percent of total sales, and we're thinking it's going to be in the mid-20s for 2021. So a lot of puts and takes there. \n I mean I would go back to the comment we made about sales upside. So we are optimistic. We feel good about exiting the fourth quarter. And if sales come back stronger, especially in the makeup part of our business, then there's potentially some good tailwinds there. And that, again, sales helps scale and helps drive leverage. \nKelly Crago: Got it. And then just on the merchandise margin side, is it -- do you expect it to be consistently up throughout the year? Or is it sort of weighted to the first half given some of the pressures you saw in the first quarter last year? \nScott Settersten: Yes. I think it'll be a little stronger first half of the year because we're lapping some large disruptions over a year ago and then building momentum throughout the course of the year. So again, there's a lot of levers that we have to pull and push as we navigate through the course of the year with promotion cadence and some of our major events. So again, we're be looking to optimize the total business as we navigate throughout the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: Congratulations, Mary and Dave. I want to ask a question that I think you'll probably defer to the Analyst Day. So I guess, Dave, in the next chapter of growth where margin can go, and part of the question is, it looks like your sales level is not going to be that far below 2019, and it looks like your SG&A level is somewhat back to 2019 levels. So I guess, what level of sales can you get back to 2019 level of margin? \nDavid Kimbell: Well, you're right, we'll talk a lot more about the future growth and what we have seen coming ahead at the Analyst Day in the fall, and we're excited to share those plans with you. We do see pressure now that Scott just -- Scott has described on the guidance that we've given around our overall profitability for 2021, and said that over time, we see that we're focused on improving that. We're optimistic that we can improve that, and we see that continued growth as we manage through some of those short-term disruptions. \n So we'll have much more detail in the outlook, on the planning and the timing of our sales outlook beyond this year. We're focused right now on driving our business through the reemergence as we get in through 2021. \nScott Settersten: And I would just add to that, that we are -- and we've talked about this over the course of the last couple of phone calls, I mean, that we're -- the executive team and all the senior leaderships are focused on getting back to double-digit EBIT margins. We're very confident we can do that. I think you can look at the fourth quarter result and see it's within striking distance. Again, that's a little bit of an outlier because of the level of sales there and some of the leverage it creates by nature. But we're confident that as 2021, the plan is put together, again, in a prudent and reasonable fashion here initially, and hopefully, the crisis passes by us a little bit quicker, and we can get some win in our sales and hopefully drive a better result overall than what we're planning for today. \nSimeon Gutman: Yes. And Dave, when Mary did the keynote for shop talk a couple of years back, she came out dancing. So yes. \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. I'll work on that, Simeon. Thanks. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink with Jefferies. \nStephanie Schiller Wissink: And I'll add our congratulations as well to the whole team. Dave, this is a question for you. It's on the changes in the loyalty balance. I think, Mary, you mentioned a 10% reduction in customers within the program. Can you help us just think through, is that a function of how you define customers -- active customers, meaning someone that hasn't shopped with you within your defined period? Or are those customers that have opted out of the loyalty program? And if so, is that giving you any indication about how you have to think about retaining or reengaging those customers that you may have lost? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. Of course, our loyalty program is key to our success and has been for a long time and will be well into the future. We believe we've got just a world-class loyalty program. The engagement, it remains incredibly high. We think we've got one of the best loyalty programs in all of retail. \n There's been no change to how we define our guests. Our definition is to be counted as a member, you need to have shopped at least once in any of our touch points in the last 12 months. So that hasn't changed. But what we are seeing is we -- as -- particularly early in this crisis when our stores were closed, so a little over -- really about a year ago and for the next few months, we'll start lapping that. Our store-only guests, we lost some of the less engaged -- less tenured, less engaged members that either stepped out of beauty for a little bit or shopped at some of the retailers that were open and did not pivot to our e-commerce business. We've had a big focus in reengaging them. We know who they are. We know that they didn't have a bad experience with Ulta. They just changed behavior in the short term. \n And so some of this is the math as we start to lap. We're lapping -- we're strong months, 12 strong months in 2019 with some of the challenges we had in 2020. And so we'll continue to work through that over these next few months. Said that there's nothing in any of our research that suggests our guests are any less engaged in beauty over time, in Ulta Beauty or anything that we've done. And one of the biggest and most important parts of that is our diamond and platinum guests, our most engaged guests, have maintained really best-in-class retention, really, very committed and connected to Ulta Beauty. \n So we have a whole team that's focused. Really everything we do is for our loyalty guests. The communication we have through personalization, the broad scale marketing, our assortment evolution, they love our newness, and the merchant team has done a great job. Our stores are focused on ensuring that every guest gets a great experience. So we're confident. \n There's a bit of a lapping element going on. And as we work through those short-term disruption, but the long-term outlook for loyalty is very positive. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: And congratulations to everybody. As part of the succession process, was there a thought to guide conservatively for the year ahead to help with the transition and provide more flexibility for 2021 as folks will be in their new roles? Or does it simply reflect the fact that Ulta's long-term operating profit margin won't be as high as it's been, in part to e-commerce penetration being in the low to mid-20% range versus 2019 when it was in the 13% range? \nMary Dillon: Well, I would say this. We guide, to the best of our ability, to what we think is going to happen with some range around that. So if you look at the guidance, we feel encouraged and optimistic about the momentum on the business. But as we said, there's a great deal of uncertainty still ahead, and we've embedded some of that uncertainty into our outlook as we would normally under any circumstances, not just due to a transition. \n As we said, we still lack clear visibility into the exact timing of an improvement in our largest category, which is makeup. So while we see something -- I think Dave explained it really well. We see some green shoots, and we're excited about the pipeline, but the timing is uncertain. So with all the puts and takes, both in managing costs, which I think we're doing well, but also investing in the future of the business, that leads us to the guidance that we provided. We think it's achievable. We're ready to move quickly if things get even faster in terms of the economic recovery and consumer recovery. But we think this is very reasonable guidance. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. \nPaul Trussell: My congratulations as well Mary, Dave and Kecia, and also to the team. On the MUSE campaign, this household is a fan. Just wanted to inquire about a few updates. One, 40 store openings this year, just maybe if you can put that in context of how you think about long-term door growth and potential kind of reacceleration in the outer years and maybe incorporate just any updates on Canada into that? And then similarly, just any updates as you've had further conversations with your vendor partners around the Target shop-in-shop and that partnership and what your expectations are for when that launches. \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. So yes, I'll start here. The -- first of all, thanks for the shout-out on MUSE. The team -- we're all really proud of that work. And I'm sure some of our team is listening, and they'll be glad to hear that. \n On stores, we have 40 stores this year, and we remain consistent with the guidance that we've had that over time can grow in to 1,500 to 1,700 stores. No update, no changes to Canada specifically as related to that. That's all on pause, and we have no news related to that. \n We continue to be optimistic and positive about the outlook of physical retail, and we'll continue to find just terrific locations across the country. The 40 that we're opening this year, we're -- we feel really, really good about, and we see plenty of growth ahead of us. So that's the plan on stores. \n That's connected in ways to our Target business. So your question about how that's coming along, we're just really, really pleased with that partnership. The relationship we have with Target as we've been building this together has just been exceptional, and we're really thrilled with the feedback that we've had from -- on the concept from our consumers. They are pumped up about this and excited for it to come to life. We really see this as just a completely new way to engage our consumers in the prestige segment, and in beauty overall, it's definitely not. I mean we've worked so hard to make sure this is not just more of the same from a retail standpoint, which we think is really critical in this time of disruption in the marketplace. \n So this is going to be completely new, totally different, focused on the best of the best in prestige, highly curated assortment, beautiful presentation, exceptional staffing, and we're anticipating high consumer engagement, compelling guest experience and, for us, acquiring millions of new members over time. \n We're not sharing much more detail than what I shared in the script earlier today. We'll be sharing that as we get a bit closer. But I can assure you that our plans are on track. We're ready to launch Ulta Beauty. And we have tremendous support from our brand partners, both big, the biggest brand partners that we have, and small and emerging brands. In fact, we're going to launch with more brands than we originally considered. We have the brands that we wanted to launch this with and more, and we're excited about it. So it's coming together great. We think it's going to be an awesome experience. We're thrilled to be partnering with Target. They've been nothing but just exceptional partners to build this with, and we're excited to go create this next chapter in the future of beauty. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. \nMichael Binetti: And let me add my congrats. Mary, we'll miss you a lot. And Dave, we look forward to working with you. Congrats on the new role. \n I guess maybe my first one will be for Scott. But I'm wondering if you can help us understand any of the metrics around how much of the SG&A that you guys have in the plan that you guided us to this year is what you'd call investment. I know -- I think Dave described it as investments partially offsetting some of the tailwinds on the margin. But if we just look at EBIT dollars per store, I think you're at like $740,000 in 2019, and the guidance looks like it's closer to $500,000. So I'm just curious, it seems like a lot of the focus here is in SG&A. \n And then, Mary, in the markets that have been less restrictive or opened up more quickly, what are you seeing there as leading indicators that leads you describing the beauty category -- the color cosmetics category as low visibility or uncertain as you guide us with your thoughts on how the rest of the markets will start to reopen? \nMary Dillon: Yes. I wouldn't say that we've seen a material difference in performance across markets for the most part. I mean there's certainly been weather disruptions and everything with COVID. We've been watching it closely. And I think just with makeup, we just know it's a category that's been under pressure even prior to COVID. And then we have a long period of time where folks are changing their makeup routines. And so we know that the category has lots of newness and innovation to come, and it's large. People are very engaged in the category. We're just not sure exactly when people are going to start wearing makeup, more makeup for social occasions and things like that. So we're watching it closely. \n But it's a great aspect of our business model that we are across so many categories that the self-care, the skincare, the bath and fragrance categories have performed, as you know, exceptionally well. So we're well balanced, and we're poised to take advantage of the uptick, which we think will come. \nScott Settersten: And on the SG&A part of the question. So again, it depends what you're trying to measure against, 2020 or 2019. I guess I'll keep it in context to 2019, be specific that there's roughly 50 net new stores in the store fleet compared to 2019 by the time we get the end of 2020. So there's a natural fixed cost element of that, that runs through gross margin, and then there's a variable cost piece of that, right, on payroll for stores and all the signage and other variable costs that it takes to operate a store. So that's embedded in there. \n A top line that's slightly weaker than 2019 is what our initial outlook is. So that's a big element of it. The service manager recategorization, right, out of gross margin down into SG&A. So it's a help on the gross margin line, but it is a headwind on the SG&A line, but it's an overall win for the company because we're more effective in it. It is plus up on operating margin overall. \n The investment, I mean, we don't -- we've never shied away from that. I mean, yes, 2019, it's a recovery year. That's how we're looking at it. Makeup is a big part of our business. As Dave and Mary both said, there's a lot of uncertainty on when it will come back. We're optimistic that it will, but there's just a question of timing, and that's a big part of our business. And then there's continuing investments in just all the infrastructure, especially in the digital and IT space, which, again, is a key component to being able to deliver a great omnichannel experience to the guests and to make sure that we're continuing to innovate for the long term and to help drive future growth for the business. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. \nSteven Forbes: Let me extend my congratulations as well. Maybe I wanted to sort of focus on the outlook for ad spend. So a quick 2-part here. Scott, you mentioned flat year-over-year. Maybe just tell us, if you can, on what the expense ratio was for 2020. And then more importantly, for maybe all of you, as I think about the reopening opportunity here, right, to drive new customer acquisition, to drive services adoption, right, and maybe reaccelerate those member trends, it just seems like there's a very large opportunity ahead of us. So I'd love to just hear about why not be more aggressive, right, or sort of how you're thinking about overall ad spend, whether it's payback or -- just love to hear just higher level thoughts on how you're sort of viewing this reopening opportunity, right, in terms of customer acquisition vehicle. \nScott Settersten: Yes. So maybe I can start there. So again, I would just say we're being flexible. Like we were in 2020 when the COVID crisis was on us, we pulled back significantly, especially in area of print and reallocated resources into the digital space, I think, smartly, right, looking at the results of that. So again, this is an area when we talk about EFG, efficiencies for growth, the print -- the whole advertising bucket is another large area of opportunity for us over the long term. And so we continue to look for ways to optimize both print, just the cost of print overall, but also the distribution and the postage and working with our vendor partners on new, better ways to be thinking about how we go to market over the long term. So that's part and parcel of our everyday activities, I guess, I would say. And again, we're thinking it's going to be flattish year-over-year as a percent of sales. So -- but always a work in progress. \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. And just to reiterate on the -- yes, your points about reopening and guest reengaging in the category. We feel confident in what we're seeing but uncertain about the pace and the return, particularly in our biggest category of makeup. And so we feel, as Mary has said, I think, as Scott has said, we feel the guidance that we have is right, but we're also prepared to adjust. \n We've -- becoming increased -- 2020 just further enhanced our skills at agility and being prepared to take whatever comes at us. And so we're ready to drive growth and lead the industry and -- but also feel like the guidance that we've given is correct. \nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. \nIrwin Boruchow: Congrats to everyone as well. Just 2 quick ones. So Dave, for you, on store productivity, can you talk to us -- I think you were doing around $500 a foot pre-COVID. Can you -- not necessarily this year, but maybe over the next 2 to 3 years, where do you see store productivity kind of normalizing to given the rise in e-com? \n And to that point, Scott, on the guidance, it seems to imply that e-com sales, you're expecting them to decline year-over-year in dollars based on the mix. Could you maybe give some color about what's embedded on e-com revenue, either first half, back half or full year? Anything would be helpful. \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. Store productivity, I'm not going to give any specifics right now because we've got a lot to figure out of where things settle out and settle down. Having said that, we remain really committed and positive about the physical store channel for Ulta Beauty and in beauty in general. And so we're watching that closely. We're seeing positive trends as guests are getting reengaged. We know our guests are telling us and then increasingly demonstrating that they want to get back in a physical way, but we know e-com will play a bigger part of it, too. So I imagine that'll be a big part of our discussion in the fall as we kind of talk about a longer-term outlook, but it's a big focus for sure. \nScott Settersten: Yes. I would just, yes, add on to that exactly. In the fall, we'd have more to share on that with investors. I mean the fact is that the trends in the store, the traffic trends, have been negative now for a while. And so we're going to have to watch how consumers -- how that rebounds here as 2021 plays out and how that fits into the overall digital part of our business and omnichannel equation. \n As far as the e-com question goes, Ike, so yes, you're on the right track there. We're guiding 20 -- mid-20-ish kind of penetration for the year, which, again, we're not apologizing for based on what we just delivered in 2020. That business is twice the size it was a year ago this time. And the team is ready, and we're ready to scale that up and take advantage of opportunities that are presented to us. And now we're just focused on making sure we take care of the store fleet, the teams that are out there and make sure as customers come back and shop us in brick-and-mortar, that we're delivering a great guest experience and continue to keep them engaged with the brand. \nMary Dillon: Okay. I think we're done with the questions. Thank you. So I just want to thank everybody for joining us today. \n The future is really bright for Ulta Beauty. We have a strong and differentiated business model. We're emerging from the 2020 pandemic with good momentum. We're strategically investing in our business to drive further market share gains, and we have strong leadership for the next chapter of growth. I'm really proud of the job that the Ulta Beauty store, distribution center and corporate associates did all year to deliver this amazing but tough year. \n I remain very excited about the long-term growth opportunity. I'm confident Ulta Beauty will continue to shape and lead the beauty industry. I'm excited about the next chapter ahead for all of us. It's the right time for me personally, the right time for Dave and Kecia and the right time for Ulta Beauty as the team continues to drive growth for many years to come. \n We look forward to speaking with all of you again in May when we report on our first quarter results. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "David Kimbell",
            "content": "Thanks, Mary. \n Before I discuss our priorities for 2021, I want to thank you, Mary, for your world-class and exceptional leadership of Ulta Beauty, and personally, for your mentorship. Your impact on our company has been tremendous. Under your leadership, Ulta Beauty has grown to become a beloved beauty destination, known as a welcoming and accessible place for guests and an inclusive workplace, offering outstanding career opportunities for associates. I'm grateful to have worked alongside you for many years and look forward to your ongoing support and guidance as I transition to my new role in June. \n I also want to express my sincere appreciation to our Board of Directors for the opportunity to become Ulta Beauty's next CEO and to all of our associates and partners for their continued support. \n In addition, I want to offer congratulations to Kecia on her well-deserved promotion to Chief Operating Officer. I look forward to leading with Kecia and our experienced diverse executive team in service of our Ulta Beauty associates, our guests and our shareholders. \n I am passionate about the beauty category, the vibrant and dynamic business we have built, and the role we play in the beauty industry and in our guests' lives. Ulta Beauty is the leading destination for beauty discovery and meaningful human experiences, and I am excited and humbled by the opportunity to lead such a strong organization through the next phase of its growth. \n As Mary said earlier, fiscal 2020 was a difficult year, but our teams met the challenges with agility, creativity and an unwavering focus on serving our guests. As a result, we begin 2021 with a strong foundation from which we can accelerate our growth and shape how guests experience beauty in the post-COVID environment. \n As we think about growth opportunities in the new normal, we are focused on 6 strategic priorities to continue expanding our market share gains and extending our competitive advantages. \n First, we are committed to meeting guests wherever they want to shop, whether it's in physical stores or on digital platforms. To support this commitment, we're building capabilities to win in an increasingly omnichannel world. This is not a new journey for us. And as Mary noted, we made a lot of progress in 2020. As we look forward to 2021, we plan to continue to expand and refresh our store fleet, including opening approximately 40 net new stores this year; further accelerate our e-commerce business through elevated marketing, loyalty engagement and advancement on our journey to create a more personalized experience for our guests on all our digital platforms; continue to evolve our supply chain to enable more flexibility while also supporting our omnichannel strategies; and as the newest pillar in our omnichannel strategy, successfully open Ulta Beauty at Target. \n Since our November announcement about the new partnership with Target, our teams continue to make progress to bring our vision to life. Our brands are excited to partner with us, and we have more brands than originally considered for the space, with strong support from our largest brand partners as well as several brands, which are exclusive to Ulta Beauty across makeup, skin, skincare, haircare and fragrance. We remain confident that this partnership is an innovative, forward-looking approach to further delight our existing members while also acquiring new members from the millions of guests shop in Target every day. We continue to see great social engagement and enthusiasm for Ulta Beauty at Target, and we're on track to launch online in about 100 stores in the fall, scaling to hundreds of stores in the next few years. \n Our second strategic priority is to reimagine how guests experience and discover beauty across all touch points. COVID-19 has not changed the importance of beauty, and we are confident in the future growth of the category. Beauty enthusiasts still value the human connection and physical experience of beauty but want to balance safety with the desire to discover and play with product. Reflecting these factors, we are elevating the end-to-end guest experience at Ulta Beauty. \n In 2021, we intend to safely reintroduce testers in select areas of the store and work closely with our brand partners to develop innovative sampling programs; drive enhancements to our digital experiences, further investing in our app, including guided education and recommendation experiences like our skin advisor; implement layout changes in select new stores to elevate key growth categories; unify the presentation of skincare makeup and improve the focus pickup experience; and as our associates have the greatest impact on the guest experience, we plan to implement training for our team, focused on priority categories like skincare as well as key skills to further strengthen human connections with our guests. \n Our third priority is to drive winning category strategies to engage and delight beauty enthusiasts and expand our market share. Our curation of a diverse assortment focused on newness, exclusivity and leading brands has enabled us to grow our market share over time. Building on the progress we made in 2020, we plan to continue to strengthen our assortment in key growth categories like skincare and haircare while protecting our strength in makeup; scale our Conscious Beauty platform; introduce a new wellness shop to offer guests self-care for the mind, body and spirit; and double our number of black-owned brands while investing to increase awareness and support of those brands. \n Our fourth priority is to deepen Ulta Beauty love, loyalty and engagement. Over time, we've evolved our brand purpose to build stronger connections with our guests and the changes and challenges our guests experienced in 2020 provide us with a unique opportunity to reinforce our brand purpose. And of course, our loyalty program is central to our efforts to build brand love for Ulta Beauty. \n In fiscal 2021, we are focused on creating culturally relevant content that leverages the power of beauty to deeply engage with guests across channels, including expanding our Where Dreams Begin campaign and building out our MUSE platform, which was developed to celebrate, honor and amplify black voices in beauty; expanding Beauty School at Ulta Beauty, our content-forward entertainment digital platform to drive hyper-relevant product and services engagement; increasing member growth across channels through new guest acquisition, lapsed member reengagement and targeted retention efforts; and we will accelerate spend and engagement through further personalization efforts, including advancing offer optimization in print and digital channels. \n Our fifth priority is to drive holistic cost optimization. Like others, we face ongoing headwinds from macro cost, including wage pressure and transportation costs. We are also navigating category and channel shifts. In fiscal 2020, we actively took steps to reshape our organization and adjust our cost structure while also investing in new capabilities that will drive future growth. Building on these efforts, we will continue to pursue process optimization opportunities in merchandising and supply chain while also looking for ways to reduce occupancy and operating costs. Importantly, we will continue to invest some of these savings in support of our strategic priorities to drive growth. \n Our final priority is to develop our talent and strengthen our culture. This is not a new priority. Our talent and culture are always in focus, and we know that our associates bring to life the Ulta Beauty brand for our guests. I am incredibly proud of how our teams led through 2020 with respect, empathy and courage. \n Looking to 2021, we will continue to work to create an environment where every associate feels they can fully contribute, and every guest is optimally served regardless of differences. We will expand our training and development to inspire and empower our associates, and we will continue to enhance and magnify our diversity and inclusion efforts. \n In closing, I am excited and optimistic about the future of Ulta Beauty. Our business is emerging from 2020 with good momentum and a strong foundation in place. We are positioned to thrive going forward, and I am confident our team will continue to lead with creativity, passion and continued care for each other and our guests while leading the beauty industry, capturing market share and driving profitable growth. \n And now I'll turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the quarter's financial results and our outlook for fiscal 2021. Scott? Yes, Kate. Yes. Great question and one that we're spending a lot of time on. As we look out over the course of the year, we continue to be encouraged by the engagement that we're seeing from our guests across channels, both in stores and online. Our non-makeup businesses have been strong throughout -- really, throughout 2020 and certainly in the fourth quarter with skincare, fragrance, haircare, bath, all performing at or above our expectations. And we anticipate that continuing throughout this year. \n There is -- continues to be a fair amount of uncertainty about makeup. And I'd say that's, as we look out over the year, while we have a lot of confidence in the long term of makeup and we know that there will be innovation and growth and new behaviors that will drive long-term growth, and we see signs of engagement through our consumer research, and we anticipate pent-up demand and excitement from guests -- from consumers as they feel more comfortable participating in society and going out and celebrating and doing all the things that I think we know is coming. The question for us is when that will come. And we've built in a number of models where we're certainly prepared for that renewed engagement in makeup. We haven't fully seen it yet even though we've seen signs of it. But we have a whole line of sight towards driving innovation with our brand partners, highlighting through our marketing and communication, leveraging our digital tools, our virtual try-on tools and then being prepared from -- with close coordination with our brand partners on inventory as we see makeup grow. \n So uncertainty by when because it's been a bit of a ride even before COVID on makeup, but we're confident in the long term and prepared for that growth. And all of that is reflected in our guidance for 2021. Well, first, yes, we don't -- we haven't had any issues for sure with expired products or too much inventory or anything like that. But your point about consumers refreshing their stock, their cabinets at home is, we believe, a behavior that is happening throughout 2020. There's been -- as there's been slower engagement in makeup pre-pandemic and then certainly all the disruption that happened throughout 2020, we see a renewal coming in just how people will engage -- how our guests will engage in makeup. The behaviors, the fashions, the looks, the styles will continue to evolve. We're excited and optimistic about that emergence. As I said earlier, the timing is a bit uncertain, but we see it coming. \n And we feel that with that -- our guests are -- they love makeup. They love beauty. They love diving into different categories. They love newness. And I think because the makeup category has been challenged, as a reflection of less engagement for probably the last couple of years, we know our beauty enthusiasts are excited about it. So we'll see that exact behavior you talked about of cleaning out your stock, replacing it with new, leaning into newness, which there is tons coming, and then kind of embracing new looks and new styles as that moves forward. So we think that will be part of the total story. Well, we're thrilled with our digital and e-commerce experience. The growth has been strong for many years and, of course, was extraordinary in 2020 as our guests embrace that channel. And our entire team worked tirelessly to make sure that we are able to service our guests with really unexpected growth in demand. So -- and that engagement will pay off for Ulta Beauty for a long time, not only in the short-term sales, but history shows that as we get our guests engage in multiple aspects of our business, not just in stores, but in stores and online and participating in salon and other aspects, their total loyalty to Ulta Beauty, their total spend, their frequency increases dramatically. And so we're confident that, that will pay off. And so overall, it is a very good outcome for our business to have more people engaged in our digital channels and driving that growth. \n We are, of course, focused on -- there are margin pressures on that part of the business. Again, overall, a very positive part of our business, but -- and so we're focused on that. And we have an entire kind of process to try to continue to optimize costs through promotional activity and cost to serve, and we see that as an important part of the business. \n And Scott, do you want to give a little more color on how we're approaching that? Well, you're right, we'll talk a lot more about the future growth and what we have seen coming ahead at the Analyst Day in the fall, and we're excited to share those plans with you. We do see pressure now that Scott just -- Scott has described on the guidance that we've given around our overall profitability for 2021, and said that over time, we see that we're focused on improving that. We're optimistic that we can improve that, and we see that continued growth as we manage through some of those short-term disruptions. \n So we'll have much more detail in the outlook, on the planning and the timing of our sales outlook beyond this year. We're focused right now on driving our business through the reemergence as we get in through 2021. Yes. I'll work on that, Simeon. Thanks. Yes. Of course, our loyalty program is key to our success and has been for a long time and will be well into the future. We believe we've got just a world-class loyalty program. The engagement, it remains incredibly high. We think we've got one of the best loyalty programs in all of retail. \n There's been no change to how we define our guests. Our definition is to be counted as a member, you need to have shopped at least once in any of our touch points in the last 12 months. So that hasn't changed. But what we are seeing is we -- as -- particularly early in this crisis when our stores were closed, so a little over -- really about a year ago and for the next few months, we'll start lapping that. Our store-only guests, we lost some of the less engaged -- less tenured, less engaged members that either stepped out of beauty for a little bit or shopped at some of the retailers that were open and did not pivot to our e-commerce business. We've had a big focus in reengaging them. We know who they are. We know that they didn't have a bad experience with Ulta. They just changed behavior in the short term. \n And so some of this is the math as we start to lap. We're lapping -- we're strong months, 12 strong months in 2019 with some of the challenges we had in 2020. And so we'll continue to work through that over these next few months. Said that there's nothing in any of our research that suggests our guests are any less engaged in beauty over time, in Ulta Beauty or anything that we've done. And one of the biggest and most important parts of that is our diamond and platinum guests, our most engaged guests, have maintained really best-in-class retention, really, very committed and connected to Ulta Beauty. \n So we have a whole team that's focused. Really everything we do is for our loyalty guests. The communication we have through personalization, the broad scale marketing, our assortment evolution, they love our newness, and the merchant team has done a great job. Our stores are focused on ensuring that every guest gets a great experience. So we're confident. \n There's a bit of a lapping element going on. And as we work through those short-term disruption, but the long-term outlook for loyalty is very positive. Yes. So yes, I'll start here. The -- first of all, thanks for the shout-out on MUSE. The team -- we're all really proud of that work. And I'm sure some of our team is listening, and they'll be glad to hear that. \n On stores, we have 40 stores this year, and we remain consistent with the guidance that we've had that over time can grow in to 1,500 to 1,700 stores. No update, no changes to Canada specifically as related to that. That's all on pause, and we have no news related to that. \n We continue to be optimistic and positive about the outlook of physical retail, and we'll continue to find just terrific locations across the country. The 40 that we're opening this year, we're -- we feel really, really good about, and we see plenty of growth ahead of us. So that's the plan on stores. \n That's connected in ways to our Target business. So your question about how that's coming along, we're just really, really pleased with that partnership. The relationship we have with Target as we've been building this together has just been exceptional, and we're really thrilled with the feedback that we've had from -- on the concept from our consumers. They are pumped up about this and excited for it to come to life. We really see this as just a completely new way to engage our consumers in the prestige segment, and in beauty overall, it's definitely not. I mean we've worked so hard to make sure this is not just more of the same from a retail standpoint, which we think is really critical in this time of disruption in the marketplace. \n So this is going to be completely new, totally different, focused on the best of the best in prestige, highly curated assortment, beautiful presentation, exceptional staffing, and we're anticipating high consumer engagement, compelling guest experience and, for us, acquiring millions of new members over time. \n We're not sharing much more detail than what I shared in the script earlier today. We'll be sharing that as we get a bit closer. But I can assure you that our plans are on track. We're ready to launch Ulta Beauty. And we have tremendous support from our brand partners, both big, the biggest brand partners that we have, and small and emerging brands. In fact, we're going to launch with more brands than we originally considered. We have the brands that we wanted to launch this with and more, and we're excited about it. So it's coming together great. We think it's going to be an awesome experience. We're thrilled to be partnering with Target. They've been nothing but just exceptional partners to build this with, and we're excited to go create this next chapter in the future of beauty. Yes. And just to reiterate on the -- yes, your points about reopening and guest reengaging in the category. We feel confident in what we're seeing but uncertain about the pace and the return, particularly in our biggest category of makeup. And so we feel, as Mary has said, I think, as Scott has said, we feel the guidance that we have is right, but we're also prepared to adjust. \n We've -- becoming increased -- 2020 just further enhanced our skills at agility and being prepared to take whatever comes at us. And so we're ready to drive growth and lead the industry and -- but also feel like the guidance that we've given is correct. Yes. Store productivity, I'm not going to give any specifics right now because we've got a lot to figure out of where things settle out and settle down. Having said that, we remain really committed and positive about the physical store channel for Ulta Beauty and in beauty in general. And so we're watching that closely. We're seeing positive trends as guests are getting reengaged. We know our guests are telling us and then increasingly demonstrating that they want to get back in a physical way, but we know e-com will play a bigger part of it, too. So I imagine that'll be a big part of our discussion in the fall as we kind of talk about a longer-term outlook, but it's a big focus for sure."

            "name": "Scott Settersten",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. \n Before I review our financial results and provide our outlook for the year, I just wanted to take a moment on behalf of the entire executive team and all of our associates to congratulate Dave on his upcoming appointment as our next CEO. We are excited for Dave as he takes this next step in his already successful career and have the utmost confidence in his ability to lead Ulta Beauty through its next phase of growth. \n Now beginning with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter declined 4.6%, and total company comp declined 4.8%. As Mary mentioned, we are incredibly pleased with our performance as top line results for the quarter were much better than our internal expectations. \n Average ticket increased 8.3%, primarily driven by an increase in units per transaction. Transactions declined 12.2%. As we have seen in recent quarters, we experienced nice conversion in both channels. We continue to be impacted by softer traffic to stores as well as capacity limitations and fewer operating hours compared to last year. However, we are encouraged by the sequential improvement in store traffic during the fourth quarter. \n As expected, e-commerce growth slowed relative to the third quarter as demand in stores improved but still delivered very strong growth versus last year. Our e-commerce operations delivered a sales increase of 72% for the quarter as guests continue to take advantage of our omnichannel capabilities. Buy online, pick up in store and curbside were strong again this quarter, particularly in the weeks leading up to Christmas, and totaled about 15% of e-commerce sales for the quarter. \n Gross profit margin was 35.1%, an increase of about 10 basis points compared to 35% a year ago. The largest driver of gross margin performance was an increase in merchandise margin, which was driven primarily by lower promotional activity as we chose not to repeat certain promotional activity from last year and continue to refine our promotional strategies. \n We also experienced a positive outcome from our holiday purchasing strategy, which reduced our exposure to limited edition holiday sets and leaned more into core product, resulting in higher sell-through and minimal post-season markdowns and clearance. \n Lastly, we continue to see benefits from our cost optimization efforts across the organization. The increase in merchandise margin was partially offset by the impact of channel shift. However, we are pleased with the profitability improvement in our e-commerce business driven by continued strong adoption of our BOPIS and curbside capabilities as well as the impact from our efforts to refine our promotional strategy. We also experienced deleverage of fixed costs due to lower sales, although the headwinds improved from what we experienced earlier in the year given the better sales trend and actions taken by our real estate team to strengthen our portfolio and reduce occupancy costs, including lease negotiation efforts and our decision to permanently close 19 stores. \n SG&A expenses decreased to $514.1 million compared to $515.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The largest drivers of the decrease were lower store payroll and benefits, and lower variable store expenses as we adjusted to softer store traffic. These reductions were partially offset by higher marketing expense as we continue to prioritize and invest in digital and social channels and resume print advertising in preparation for the holiday season. We also experienced an increase in corporate overhead, primarily due to higher incentive compensation, reflecting our financial performance versus our internal targets, partially offset by reduced spending across multiple areas. \n We incurred about $18 million in PPE and COVID-related expenses during the quarter. This quarter, we recorded a charge of $30.4 million for impairment, restructuring and other costs. Last quarter, we suspended our planned expansion to Canada, and our teams completed the wind down effort during the fourth quarter. This resulted in a $13.2 million charge related to lease termination costs, long-lived asset impairment charges and severance. We also recorded $10 million in severance associated with the charges -- changes made to our corporate and field management organization, $5.6 million in lease termination costs related to the previously announced permanent closure of 19 stores and $1.5 million due to the impairment of tangible long-lived assets and operating lease assets associated with certain stores. \n GAAP operating income decreased to $224.3 million compared to $287.8 million a year ago. Adjusted operating income was $254.7 million or 11.6% of sales. Diluted GAAP earnings per share was $3.03 compared to $3.89 for last year's fourth quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $3.41 compared to $3.83 a year ago. \n Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total inventory decreased 9.7% compared to last year as we adjusted purchasing to maintain flexibility and manage inventory. For the year, we invested $152 million in capital expenditures, including approximately $70 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $49 million for supply chain and IT, and about $33 million for store maintenance and other. We ended the year with $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. \n Reflecting our confidence, we resumed our stock buyback program in the fourth quarter and repurchased approximately 148,000 shares of stock. We have $1.5 billion remaining under our current repurchase authorization. \n Turning to our outlook for 2021. While we are encouraged by recent sales momentum, visibility into the timing of a demand recovery remains limited. We expect much of 2021 will continue to be negatively impacted by masking requirements and social distancing. And while we expect sales trends will improve as we progress throughout the year and COVID-19 vaccines become more accessible, we are planning for total sales to be slightly lower than 2019. That being said, we plan to be nimble and agile, and we'll be prepared to capitalize should the environment improve earlier than we expect. \n Now specifically for 2021. We expect to open approximately 40 net new stores, remodel 11 stores and relocate approximately 10 stores. Note that when the pandemic hit last year, we moved quickly to defer most of the new stores planned for 2020. As a result, more than half of our new stores are expected to open in the first quarter. \n We anticipate net sales for the year will be between $7.2 billion and $7.3 billion, with comp sales planned in the 15 to 17 percentage range. We expect comp results will vary significantly between the front half and the back half of the year as we lap store closures that occurred in the first half of 2020. With this in mind, we anticipate comp growth will be in the low to mid-30s for the first half of 2021 and then moderate to low- to mid-single-digit growth for the second half. We expect operating margin rate for the year will be around 9% of sales as we lap easier top line comparisons due to COVID-19-related store closures in 2020. \n To give you a little more color on the expected puts and takes driving our operating margin expectation, overall, we expect the largest driver of operating margin expansion will come from gross margin. For the year, we anticipate an improving sales trend from our brick-and-mortar operations, resulting in less headwind from channel shift and leverage of fixed costs. We are planning e-commerce penetration to be in the low to mid-20s for the year. We also expect merchandise margin will improve modestly as we continue to optimize our promotional strategy and continue to pursue efficiency for growth opportunities. We also expect SG&A will deleverage, driven primarily by higher store payroll, as we anniversary the $52 million benefit from the CARES Act in fiscal 2020. \n In addition, we expect to see payroll deleverage from store management changes made in 2020 and ongoing wage pressures. Recall that in the fourth quarter of 2020, we realigned our store management structure to create a more cost-efficient store model. As a result of these changes, we will see a reduction of salon payroll, which is part of cost of goods sold, and an increase in retail payroll, which is included in SG&A relative to last year. The deleverage of retail payroll should partially offset by lower corporate overhead, reflecting changes we made in 2020 to reset our corporate cost structure. We anticipate advertising will be relatively flat for the year as a percent of sales. \n These assumptions result in guidance for diluted earnings per share in the range of $8.85 to $9.30 per share, including the impact of approximately $850 million in share repurchases. We plan to spend between $200 million and $250 million in CapEx, including approximately $115 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $77 million for supply chain and IT, and about $33 million for store maintenance and other. \n I would note that our guidance for 2021 assumes a consistent federal tax rate and no material increases in the federal minimum wage and does not include assumptions for any impact related to a resurgence of COVID-19. \n Before we take your questions, I want to announce that we plan to host an analyst and investor conference this fall to share our longer-term plans and outlook. We'll share more of the logistical details later this summer. \n And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. No, no. We've seen -- we've demonstrated in the fourth quarter some of the benefits from promotional optimization, which, again, a lot of that occurs in the digital channel just by the very nature of the shopping experience there. So we believe there's plenty of opportunity to improve the profitability of that channel of our business, both on the promotional side, but also on the supply chain effectiveness side of the business. \n So the FFC strategy, the ship from store strategy, getting closer to our end customers will help. But also just overall scale as that business continues to grow, we believe, will help drive some rate improvement there over the long term. Yes. So there's a lot connected to that question, but the overall theme about gross margin getting back to 2019, again, there's a lot of puts and takes. If you go back to the -- our prepared remarks, just we gave a lot of detail -- provided a lot of detail on that. I would say our initial outlook is not to get back to 2019. Part of it is the geography change on the services manager moving out of gross margin. So that's a plus up for us, but there is something -- the sales -- lower sales overall, at least our initial outlook there, creates a bit of deleverage there when we look back and try to compare to 2019. So there is quite a laundry list of things besides channel mix, which is one of the biggest drivers when we look at '21 versus '19. Again, a reminder, 2019 e-commerce was in the mid-teens as a percent of total sales, and we're thinking it's going to be in the mid-20s for 2021. So a lot of puts and takes there. \n I mean I would go back to the comment we made about sales upside. So we are optimistic. We feel good about exiting the fourth quarter. And if sales come back stronger, especially in the makeup part of our business, then there's potentially some good tailwinds there. And that, again, sales helps scale and helps drive leverage. Yes. I think it'll be a little stronger first half of the year because we're lapping some large disruptions over a year ago and then building momentum throughout the course of the year. So again, there's a lot of levers that we have to pull and push as we navigate through the course of the year with promotion cadence and some of our major events. So again, we're be looking to optimize the total business as we navigate throughout the year. And I would just add to that, that we are -- and we've talked about this over the course of the last couple of phone calls, I mean, that we're -- the executive team and all the senior leaderships are focused on getting back to double-digit EBIT margins. We're very confident we can do that. I think you can look at the fourth quarter result and see it's within striking distance. Again, that's a little bit of an outlier because of the level of sales there and some of the leverage it creates by nature. But we're confident that as 2021, the plan is put together, again, in a prudent and reasonable fashion here initially, and hopefully, the crisis passes by us a little bit quicker, and we can get some win in our sales and hopefully drive a better result overall than what we're planning for today. And on the SG&A part of the question. So again, it depends what you're trying to measure against, 2020 or 2019. I guess I'll keep it in context to 2019, be specific that there's roughly 50 net new stores in the store fleet compared to 2019 by the time we get the end of 2020. So there's a natural fixed cost element of that, that runs through gross margin, and then there's a variable cost piece of that, right, on payroll for stores and all the signage and other variable costs that it takes to operate a store. So that's embedded in there. \n A top line that's slightly weaker than 2019 is what our initial outlook is. So that's a big element of it. The service manager recategorization, right, out of gross margin down into SG&A. So it's a help on the gross margin line, but it is a headwind on the SG&A line, but it's an overall win for the company because we're more effective in it. It is plus up on operating margin overall. \n The investment, I mean, we don't -- we've never shied away from that. I mean, yes, 2019, it's a recovery year. That's how we're looking at it. Makeup is a big part of our business. As Dave and Mary both said, there's a lot of uncertainty on when it will come back. We're optimistic that it will, but there's just a question of timing, and that's a big part of our business. And then there's continuing investments in just all the infrastructure, especially in the digital and IT space, which, again, is a key component to being able to deliver a great omnichannel experience to the guests and to make sure that we're continuing to innovate for the long term and to help drive future growth for the business. Yes. So maybe I can start there. So again, I would just say we're being flexible. Like we were in 2020 when the COVID crisis was on us, we pulled back significantly, especially in area of print and reallocated resources into the digital space, I think, smartly, right, looking at the results of that. So again, this is an area when we talk about EFG, efficiencies for growth, the print -- the whole advertising bucket is another large area of opportunity for us over the long term. And so we continue to look for ways to optimize both print, just the cost of print overall, but also the distribution and the postage and working with our vendor partners on new, better ways to be thinking about how we go to market over the long term. So that's part and parcel of our everyday activities, I guess, I would say. And again, we're thinking it's going to be flattish year-over-year as a percent of sales. So -- but always a work in progress. Yes. I would just, yes, add on to that exactly. In the fall, we'd have more to share on that with investors. I mean the fact is that the trends in the store, the traffic trends, have been negative now for a while. And so we're going to have to watch how consumers -- how that rebounds here as 2021 plays out and how that fits into the overall digital part of our business and omnichannel equation. \n As far as the e-com question goes, Ike, so yes, you're on the right track there. We're guiding 20 -- mid-20-ish kind of penetration for the year, which, again, we're not apologizing for based on what we just delivered in 2020. That business is twice the size it was a year ago this time. And the team is ready, and we're ready to scale that up and take advantage of opportunities that are presented to us. And now we're just focused on making sure we take care of the store fleet, the teams that are out there and make sure as customers come back and shop us in brick-and-mortar, that we're delivering a great guest experience and continue to keep them engaged with the brand."

            "content": "Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start today with comments about our leadership transition plans and then share highlights from our fourth quarter and full year results. Then Dave will discuss our priorities for 2021, and Scott will review the financial results and our outlook. \n Starting with the succession plans we announced this afternoon. I am very excited to announce that in June, Dave Kimbell will become CEO of Ulta Beauty, and I will transition to Executive Chair of the Board. In addition, Kecia Steelman will be elevated to Chief Operating Officer in June. In conjunction with these changes, Bob DiRomualdo will retire from his role as Chair of the Board as planned, and Lorna Nagler will assume the role of Lead Independent Director. These changes reflect a thorough and thoughtful succession planning process I have engaged in with our Board of Directors over multiple years and are designed to ensure strategic and leadership continuity as Ulta Beauty moves into its next chapter of growth. I personally want to thank our Board for their care, consideration and oversight of this important process. \n After serving as CEO for nearly 8 years, I believe the time is right for me and for Ulta Beauty to make this change. We have a differentiated business model that has proven its strength over and over again throughout our 30-plus year history and position Ulta Beauty as a leader in the beauty industry. We've developed and sustained a world-class, guest-centric, values-based, high-performance culture. \n We're emerging from the 2020 pandemic with a strong foundation and good operational momentum, and we have a talented, diverse and experienced team of leaders to drive our next phase of growth. While I'm proud of what we've achieved over these past 8 years, I truly believe now is the time for my successor and their leadership team to continue the journey. \n Since joining Ulta Beauty as Chief Marketing Officer in 2014, Dave has continued to expand his leadership responsibilities, ultimately assuming the role of President in 2019. Highly regarded in the beauty industry, Dave is a results-driven, guest-focused, inclusive leader who've to motivate teams and activate strategies to move our business forward. Dave's passion for Ulta Beauty, our guests and our associates is extraordinary, and I believe there was no one more prepared or better suited to lead Ulta Beauty into the future. \n Kecia Steelman joined Ulta Beauty in 2014 as Senior Vice President of Operations before assuming the role of Chief Store Operations Officer in 2015. In this role, she has overseen all aspects of store and salon operations, leading passionate associates to consistently deliver great experiences for our guests, even as we nearly doubled our footprint. As Chief Operating Officer, Kecia will have responsibility for store and services operations, supply chain, external partnerships, including Ulta Beauty at Target and key enterprise-wide continuous improvement initiatives. \n Dave and Kecia will be supported by an executive team with deep expertise and Ulta Beauty experience. My focus has been and will continue to be on Ulta Beauty. And in my new role as Executive Chair, I'll advise and support Dave on key issues, including strategy, external relationships and organizational development. My plan is to remain in the Executive Chair role for 1 year. I am optimistic and excited about the long-term growth opportunity for Ulta Beauty, and I'm confident that under Dave's leadership, Ulta Beauty will keep shaping and leading the beauty industry for many years to come. \n Now let's talk about our fourth quarter performance. The Ulta Beauty team delivered better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter. For the quarter, net sales were $2.2 billion, and GAAP diluted EPS was $3.03 per share. Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter was $3.41 per share. Strong enterprise-wide execution of our plans, combined with improving trends in consumer demand, resulted in momentum across multiple metrics, including sales, transactions and profitability. \n We experienced less disruption from COVID than we anticipated in the quarter, and top line trends improved across all channels and all categories, resulting in a comp store sales decline of 4.8%, an improvement compared to the 8.9% decline in the third quarter. We kicked off the holiday season in early November with our multichannel See the Joy campaign, targeted marketing and promotional activity and an extended Black Friday event. We continue to lean into our successful We Love Our Members events throughout holiday, rewarding guests with member-only offers promoted broadly across channels to reinforce the value of the program and to engage our members. \n And we leveraged our CRM and analytics capabilities to expand our reach and maximize productivity. We drove strong sell-through of holiday merchandise and core product, and transitioned quickly after holiday to support our strategic Love Your Skin and Jumbo Love events. The planned expansion of our gift card program drove robust year-over-year growth in gift card sales during the holiday period and delivered elevated redemption activity in stores post-holiday. \n Our e-commerce business increased more than 70%. With increased fulfillment capacity in place, our DC and store teams did an excellent job supporting record level of e-commerce demand. Limitations on in-store capacity and reduced operating hours are still in place, but we're encouraged by the momentum we're seeing in store traffic. \n From a category perspective, we continue to increase our market share across most major prestige beauty categories. Starting with one of our strategic growth categories, skincare delivered a low double-digit comp. In addition to broader self-care and wellness trends, newness and engagement and social media platforms are driving interest in newer brands like The Ordinary and Urban Skin Rx as well as established brands like CeraVe and First Aid Beauty. Fragrance and bath delivered strong double-digit comp growth delivered -- driven by newness and a strong base fragrance business from brands like Chanel and Dior. Bath also continued to benefit from self-care trends, newness and social media engagement. \n Comp sales in haircare were down slightly in the quarter, primarily reflecting planned changes to our Jumbo Love event, which negatively impacted top line growth but delivered significant profit improvement. Excluding the event, comp sales in the haircare category were positive for the quarter, driven by hair color, color care, texture and innovation. Prestige hair continues to be an area of focus. And in January, we launched Briogeo, a black-owned clean brand formulated for all hair types in all stores and online. \n Comp sales in the makeup category were negative but improved sequentially, reflecting less year-over-year product newness and continued mask wearing and limitations on makeup wearing occasions. While new launches were limited, we do see guests eager to engage with newness from established brands like Too Faced and NYX as well as new brands, including Laura Mercier, KVD Beauty and HOURGLASS. \n Sales from our services business were down more than 40% in the fourth quarter due to a decline in transactions, while average ticket continued to be higher. Our services business remains adversely impacted by COVID-related capacity constraints and local restrictions, but we're starting to see some local markets increase capacity thresholds. \n While we ended fiscal 2020 with 30.7 million loyalty members, about 10% fewer than last year, we maintained strong retention levels of our high-value platinum and diamond members. The reduction in total members was anticipated given store closures earlier in the year and ongoing store traffic challenges. Importantly, we saw a rebound in new membership this quarter as our store associates delivered stronger conversion versus last year. \n Reactivation trends also rebounded due to amplified marketing and promotional efforts across print and digital channels. We also saw good growth in our credit card program, increasing our member penetration by about 400 basis points versus last year, reflecting strong acquisition and retention of our highly engaged credit card members. \n We ended the year with noteworthy changes in our member channel mix. While 2/3 of our members continue to be in-store-only shoppers this year, our mix of omnichannel members nearly doubled to 23% of members, and our online-only members grew to 12% of members. \n While Scott will take you through the details of the P&L in a few minutes, I want to highlight 2 areas of focus that are delivering tangible results for our profitability. First, we continue to see strong success in optimizing our promotions. We offered a number of compelling promotions during holiday, but we further leveraged our CRM capabilities to be more targeted and more profitable with our offers. Post-holiday, we saw an opportunity to be more strategic and employ relevant storytelling to drive guest engagement. For our Love Your Skin and Jumbo Love event, we took a content-forward approach across print and digital channels to focus on education and routines, highlighted newness like never before and refined the focus of offers in brand participation. As a result of these efforts, we delivered meaningful improvement in our merchandise margin. \n Second, we continued to take steps to reset our cost structure. After a thorough and thoughtful evaluation of work and capabilities across every corporate function, this quarter, we eliminated approximately 340 roles, resulting in a charge in the quarter of approximately $10 million. Even as we made difficult decisions to eliminate certain roles, we also reorganized select teams, expanded some roles and introduced a number of new positions in key investment areas aligned to our strategic priorities. We expect these decisions will result in approximately $50 million of SG&A savings in 2021. These decisions were incredibly difficult, but I'm proud of the respect, care and compassion that went into the process. I'm confident these changes, combined with planned investments to enhance our enterprise capabilities, will position Ulta Beauty for continued success in the short and long term. \n And now turning to the full year. From a financial perspective, total sales were $6.2 billion; comp store sales decreased 17.9%; and GAAP diluted EPS was $3.11 per share. Adjusted diluted EPS for the year was $4.68 per share. While fiscal 2020 was not the year we originally planned, I am proud of how our teams adjusted and responded to the unprecedented challenges, and I want to express my sincere appreciation to my leadership team and all Ulta Beauty associates for their flexibility, agility and unwavering commitment to our guests and to each other. \n Facing a very dynamic operating environment early in 2020, we moved quickly to align on 6 strategic priorities intended to expand our market share and extend our competitive advantages. We made meaningful progress across each of these priorities in 2020. \n Our teams continue to deliver great omnichannel experiences for our guests. After temporarily closing all of our stores in March in response to the spread of the virus, we began welcoming back guests and associates to stores in May with our new shop safe standards in all stores and enhanced digital shopping capabilities to keep our guests and our associates safe. \n While store traffic remained challenged, sales through our digital channels doubled in fiscal 2020. To meet this increased demand, we expanded our e-commerce fulfillment capabilities, including the opening of our Jacksonville fast fulfillment center, expansion of our ship from store capabilities and introduction of curbside pickup. Reflecting increased safety concerns, we restricted the use of testers in stores but accelerated our virtual try-on capabilities. \n We expanded GLAMlab, our virtual try-on tool, beyond cosmetics to include hair color, false lashes and the Benefit Brow Bar. We expanded our shade library to include more than 11,000 shades. We introduced QR code so that guests could virtually try on shades while in store. We also introduced a digital skin analysis tool to assess guest skincare needs and offer personalized product and regimen recommendations. In 2020, more than 11 million guests engaged with these tools, trying on more than 100 million shades through the app and ulta.com. \n In a year that saw the contraction of the U.S. prestige beauty market, Ulta Beauty gained dollar share, specifically in key categories, such as makeup, skincare and fragrance based on NPD's point-of-sale data for the 52 weeks ending January 30, 2021. We expanded our assortment in key growth categories like skincare, haircare and wellness to provide guests with engaging newness and innovation. And we launched Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty in stores and at ulta.com, certifying more than 230 brands across 4 key pillars: clean ingredients; cruelty-free; vegan; and sustainable packaging. \n Our marketing teams pivoted quickly to reflect the environment. And as a result, we maintained our unaided awareness in the mid-50% range and increased our aided awareness. \n We drove innovation in our Ultamate Rewards loyalty program, launching new member appreciation events, implementing new reactivation campaigns and reinforcing the value of the program across all communication channels. Behind the scenes, we expanded our CRM capabilities, leveraging new propensity modeling applications to optimize the return on print investment and reengage with labs and at-risk members in our marketing outreach. \n We took actions in fiscal 2020 also to adjust our cost structure. We delivered meaningful reductions in occupancy costs through aggressive negotiations and effective portfolio management, and we permanently closed 19 stores to further strengthen our store portfolio. We made changes to our store management structure to improve efficiency and productivity, and we took steps to rightsize our corporate structure. \n We announced, of course, an exclusive partnership with Target Corporation that will disrupt the beauty category and change how guests experience beauty. \n And finally, we published our first ESG report, sharing our efforts and commitments in 4 key pillars: people, product, community and the environment. While we're early in our journey, I am proud of the progress we've made in these areas, particularly as it relates to diversity and inclusion. Diversity and inclusion have always been important at Ulta Beauty as we want all associates to feel they can be their true authentic selves. \n Given the events that unfolded throughout 2020, addressing racial and social injustice has become more important than ever. At the end of fiscal 2020, 91% of our associates were women and 47% of our associates were people of color. On our leadership team, 64% were female and 18% were people of color. We recently announced new commitments to help us progress further in our journey to support greater diversity, inclusivity and equity. Our team is deeply committed to leading purposefully with and for underrepresented voices across retail and beauty. \n Fiscal 2020 was a difficult year, but the progress we've made positions us well to grow and lead in a post-COVID environment. \n And now I'd like to introduce Dave Kimbell, who will share more about our plans and priorities for fiscal '21. Dave? Well, Chris, I'll take that as a compliment. I'm teasing you. Listen, this has been planned for a while with the Board in terms of the kind of governance and succession planning that we all do. I just feel that this is the right time for me personally. I'm excited. I'm going to be the Executive Chair for a year. So I'm excited about that as well. I'm staying very close to the strategies in the future as well. \n We're coming out of 2020 strong. The foundation of the business is very strong. Most importantly, Dave is ready to take on the next chapter of growth as the CEO of the company. So it just felt to us and to me like a natural time to make this transition. I'm very confident, very confident about the future of Ulta Beauty. And we're excited. I'm also excited that Kecia Steelman is going to have new responsibilities as Chief Operating Officer. So all told, I think this is about as seamless of a succession story as you can come up with, and that we're really excited about it. There is so many questions. Yes. No, listen, I'm focused on Ulta Beauty right now, and I'm very excited about that. And that's why I'm going to be the Executive Chair. I'll be the CEO through June and the Executive Chair for a year after that. And we'll see. I'm excited to the next -- for the next chapter, but I don't really have any plans yet. Thank you, Dana. Well, I would say this. We guide, to the best of our ability, to what we think is going to happen with some range around that. So if you look at the guidance, we feel encouraged and optimistic about the momentum on the business. But as we said, there's a great deal of uncertainty still ahead, and we've embedded some of that uncertainty into our outlook as we would normally under any circumstances, not just due to a transition. \n As we said, we still lack clear visibility into the exact timing of an improvement in our largest category, which is makeup. So while we see something -- I think Dave explained it really well. We see some green shoots, and we're excited about the pipeline, but the timing is uncertain. So with all the puts and takes, both in managing costs, which I think we're doing well, but also investing in the future of the business, that leads us to the guidance that we provided. We think it's achievable. We're ready to move quickly if things get even faster in terms of the economic recovery and consumer recovery. But we think this is very reasonable guidance. Yes. I wouldn't say that we've seen a material difference in performance across markets for the most part. I mean there's certainly been weather disruptions and everything with COVID. We've been watching it closely. And I think just with makeup, we just know it's a category that's been under pressure even prior to COVID. And then we have a long period of time where folks are changing their makeup routines. And so we know that the category has lots of newness and innovation to come, and it's large. People are very engaged in the category. We're just not sure exactly when people are going to start wearing makeup, more makeup for social occasions and things like that. So we're watching it closely. \n But it's a great aspect of our business model that we are across so many categories that the self-care, the skincare, the bath and fragrance categories have performed, as you know, exceptionally well. So we're well balanced, and we're poised to take advantage of the uptick, which we think will come. Okay. I think we're done with the questions. Thank you. So I just want to thank everybody for joining us today. \n The future is really bright for Ulta Beauty. We have a strong and differentiated business model. We're emerging from the 2020 pandemic with good momentum. We're strategically investing in our business to drive further market share gains, and we have strong leadership for the next chapter of growth. I'm really proud of the job that the Ulta Beauty store, distribution center and corporate associates did all year to deliver this amazing but tough year. \n I remain very excited about the long-term growth opportunity. I'm confident Ulta Beauty will continue to shape and lead the beauty industry. I'm excited about the next chapter ahead for all of us. It's the right time for me personally, the right time for Dave and Kecia and the right time for Ulta Beauty as the team continues to drive growth for many years to come. \n We look forward to speaking with all of you again in May when we report on our first quarter results. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. \n It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. \nKiley Rawlins: Thank you, Sumali. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for our discussion of Ulta Beauty's results for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Hosting today's call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Dave Kimbell, President, will join us for the Q&A session. \n Before we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company's safe harbor language. The statements contained in this conference call which are not historical facts may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual, future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC. \n We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today, December 3, 2020. We have no obligation to update or revise our forward-looking statements, except as required by law, and you should not expect us to do so. \n In today's comments, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted diluted EPS, which has been presented to reflect our view of our ongoing operations by adjusting for impairment and restructuring-related costs. A reconciliation of these measures to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release, which is available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ulta.com. \n We'll begin this afternoon with prepared remarks from Mary and Scott. Following our comments, we'll open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] As always, Patrick and I will be available for any follow-up questions after the call. \n Now I'll turn the call over to Mary. Mary? \nMary Dillon: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. \n Today, we reported financial results that reflect the strength of the Ulta Beauty model and improving trends in consumer demand. I continue to be very proud of how well our teams are responding and navigating through this difficult period. And I want to thank all of our Ulta Beauty associates for their continued agility, creativity and commitment to serving our guests and taking care of each other during this unprecedented period. \n For the third quarter, net sales were $1.6 billion and GAAP diluted EPS was $1.32 per share. Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.64 per share. \n Building on the momentum we saw at the end of the second quarter, third quarter comp store sales declined 8.9%. The mid-single-digit comp declines we experienced in August continued through September, with October sales impacted by our decision not to repeat certain promotional activity from last year. \n As we discussed on our last earnings call, we're working to optimize promotional events to remain competitive while also improving profitability. In the third quarter, we executed several promotional events that drove strong guest engagement and profitable sales. \n We launched our first-ever We Love Our Members event to reengage and welcome Ultamate Rewards members back to Ulta Beauty, having completed our phased store reopening process. We rewarded guests with member-only points and services offers and amplified the offers across owned, earned and paid channels to reinforce the value of our rewards program. We successfully executed a more focused 21 Days of Beauty, one of our most strategic events intended to drive mass migration to prestige products. To excite and reengage guests, we accelerated our digital and streaming first approach to support expanded messaging for our compelling beauty steals, newness and exclusive products. \n We expanded the focus of our Fall Haul event beyond makeup to include key self-care categories while reducing the length of the event to drive greater productivity. And to further elevate our hair authority through our Gorgeous Hair event, we leverage engaging storytelling around healthy hair, color care and black-owned brands. \n Now turning to our performance by category. We continue to increase our market share across most major prestige beauty categories. Starting with one of our strategic growth categories, skincare delivered positive comp growth driven by newer brands like The Ordinary, TULA and Beekman 1802 as well as existing brands like CeraVe, First Aid Beauty and La Roche-Posay. From our proprietary consumer insights work, we know most beauty enthusiasts are maintaining or expanding their skincare routines as a form of self-care. Increased interest for home skincare treatments as well as newness and innovation in body treatments, face serums and eye creams are driving strong category growth. Leaning into these trends and the opportunity to increase our market share in this category, we continue to expand our assortment while also increasing space and marketing support for this key growth category. \n Fragrance and bath was our strongest category this quarter, delivering double-digit comp growth, driven by newness, exclusive and unique Ulta Beauty programs. Guests responded well to our fragrance gift with purchase programs as well as our Fragrance Crush program, which highlights a favorite fragrance each month. Sales of fragrance also benefited from our exclusive launch of R.E.M. from Ariana Grande and innovation from established brands like YSL and Marc Jacobs. The bath category continues to deliver strong growth. And this quarter, we introduced newness from brands like Truly, Hempz, Ulta Beauty Collection and Tree Hut.\n Reflecting ongoing DIY beauty and self-care trends, haircare and hairstyling tools also delivered positive comp sales growth this quarter. Within haircare, color continued to deliver strong growth driven by brands like Arctic Fox and Madison Reed. Textured hair brands, Curlsmith and Pattern by Tracee Ellis Ross, also delivered nice growth. Our leader business also continued to perform well, and newness from Dyson and the continued popularity of one-step tools drove strong growth in styling tools this quarter as guests leverage more options to achieve different looks. \n Makeup continued to be challenged given shifts in consumer behavior and delays in planned newness and innovation. Despite these headwinds, subcategories that focus above the mask continued to perform better, including lashes, brow and eye. Newness, while more limited than last year, continues to be important to guests, with nostalgic themes like Ulta Beauty Harry Potter collection, Makeup Revolution's Nightmare Before Christmas and ColourPop's Hocus Pocus collection, all resonating really well with guests. \n Although the pandemic has accelerated channel shift, our consumer insights and results continue to confirm that our members prefer to shop in physical stores for beauty even as they have increased their adoption of online shopping. As expected, with stores opened for the full quarter, store traffic trends improved and e-commerce growth moderated from trends we saw in the first half of the year. \n For the quarter, our e-commerce business delivered sales growth of about 90%. And buy online, pickup in store was strong again this quarter. \n Turning now to services. Our services business continues to be adversely impacted by COVID-related capacity constraints and local restrictions. At the end of the third quarter, salon and brow services were available in nearly all stores, but we've not resumed skin or makeup services based on ongoing safety concerns. Although trends improved from the second quarter, sales from our services business were down more than 30% in the third quarter primarily due to a decline in transactions. Average ticket was higher, reflecting pent-up demand for cut, color and style services. \n At the end of the quarter, we had 31.7 million active members in our Ultamate Rewards Program, essentially flat with the second quarter and about 6% lower than the third quarter last year. While we're pleased with our new member acquisition and reengagement trends this quarter, we will continue to focus on reactivation of members who haven't shopped with us since the pandemic began. \n Now importantly, retention rates among our platinum and diamond members who are most engaged with our brand remain very strong. We continue to see an increase in members shopping with us online. As we've discussed before, omnichannel members are our most engaged and most productive members, historically spending 3x more per year than store-only guests. In the third quarter, omnichannel members were about 22% of the total compared to about 12% in the third quarter last year. \n As our teams continue to manage the day-to-day operations in the current environment, we're also building the foundation for profitable growth in 2021 and beyond. Specifically, we're focused on 5 strategic priorities to expand our market share gains and extend our competitive advantages. And during the third quarter, we made progress on each of these priorities. \n Starting with our continued focus on building the capabilities to win in an omnichannel world. We are committed to meeting guests wherever they want to shop. In April, in response to COVID-related constraints, our digital and store teams moved quickly to launch a new curbside pickup option. To make it easier for our guests and our store teams, we have recently enhanced this option with the launch of a curbside customer alert notification. We've refreshed curbside signage and established dedicated Ulta Beauty parking spaces at select stores. We've also expanded our store locator functionality to include greater visibility to store-specific service offerings and separate store and curbside hours. And in the Ulta Beauty app, we now provide store-specific occupancy levels for greater transparency and guest safety. \n To support our growing e-commerce business, this quarter, we opened our Jacksonville fast fulfillment center, expanded e-commerce operations in our Chambersburg, Greenwood and Dallas distribution centers and expanded our ship-from-store program to 105 stores. These investments have increased our e-commerce shipping capacity and will improve delivery speed to guests. \n This quarter, we also completed the rollout of our new booking tool for services in the app and on ulta.com. This new digital application enables guests to easily book or reschedule salon, brow and other service appointments. Adoption of the tool continues to increase, and nearly 1/3 of our service appointments were booked through this new tool in the most recent quarter, resulting in more convenience for our guests and more efficiency for our associates. \n Our second priority is to reimagine how guest experience and discover beauty in the new normal. Product discovery is a hallmark of the beauty shopping experience, and we're welcoming more guests to experience the fun of GLAMlab, our virtual try-on tool. Our store associates have done a great job introducing GLAMlab to guests as a safe alternative to testers in stores, which are currently for display purposes only. To help facilitate even more in-store engagement, we've introduced new QR codes on select shelf strips that take guests directly into the GLAMlab experience, making it even easier for guests to virtually try on products while they're in stores. \n Building on our successful virtual try-on capabilities, last quarter, we introduced a skin analysis tool, which uses augmented reality technology and artificial intelligence to assess skincare needs and offer personalized product recommendations. This quarter, we enhanced this tool to include new routine recommendations and the ability for guests to save analyses to track changes. In addition to offering guest digital tools, we're also testing one-on-one video consultations across all beauty categories in collaboration with our brand partners and our own services team members. \n Our third priority is to engage and delight beauty enthusiasts with a curated beauty assortment focused on exclusivity and leading brands. Reflecting the growing importance of clean beauty, in October, we launched Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty at all stores and on ulta.com and on our app, and the enthusiasm and feedback from our guests and brand partners has been tremendous. This holistic initiative provides greater transparency to help guests choose brands and products that reflect their personal values and individual needs. \n Through this initiative, we're certifying brands across 4 key pillars: clean ingredients, cruelty-free, vegan and sustainable packaging, and highlighting participating brands for their positive impact on communities. And today, more than 200 brands are participating in the program, and more than half have been certified in more than 1 pillar. As part of the launch, we established the Conscious Beauty Advisory Council, a coalition of experts at the forefront of clean beauty, product development and packaging sustainability. With the help of our advisory council, we will ensure that Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty will continue to evolve and grow as expectations and standards for clean beauty continue to change. \n In tandem with the launch of Conscious Beauty, we collaborated with Credo Beauty, a pioneer in Clean to introduce the Credo Collection at Ulta Beauty, a curated collection of prestige and masstige brands. Available in select stores and in ulta.com, this collection features 9 clean brands handpicked by the Credo experts across multiple categories, including skincare, haircare and cosmetics. \n Our fourth priority is to leverage insights from our Ultamate Rewards Program to cultivate brand love and loyalty, deepen guest engagement and increase spend per member. We continue to build content that reflects our brand purpose and drives meaningful connection with our guests. After suspending most of our marketing efforts in the first half of the year while stores were closed, this quarter, we launched Where Dreams Begin, a campaign that reflects the next chapter of our brand journey. Launched across linear television and digital streaming platforms, the work reinforces our brand purpose and celebrates optimism, togetherness, self-care and self-expression in a world increasingly challenged by uncertainty and division. We continue to enhance our ability to create personalized offers and recommendations based on a holistic, data-led understanding of guest preferences and behaviors. This quarter, we increased our use of propensity modeling to help reactivate members, and we continue to strengthen our ability to optimize offers in e-mail and online, enabling us to maximize the return on select promotions. \n Our fifth and final strategic priority is to drive holistic cost optimization. We continue to work to create a more cost-efficient store labor model. As we discussed on the last earnings call, we made the difficult decision to eliminate 2 store leadership roles, the salon manager and the prestige manager, and created a new service manager role responsible for services, events and prestige retail. Effective November 1, this new structure creates a stronger linkage between services and products. \n This quarter, we also made another difficult decision to suspend our expansion to Canada. This was not an easy decision to make and in no way reflects a lack of confidence in the international growth opportunity for Ulta Beauty. Our teams work diligently to position us for a successful entry into Canada next year, and I'm proud of what they accomplished in such a short period of time. However, after much consideration, we determined that prioritizing our efforts to strengthen and grow our U.S. operations must be our top priority in the current operating environment. \n So these are just a few of the examples we've taken to adjust our model to reflect the challenges and opportunities we see today. We've also maintained significant limitations on corporate hiring and controllable expenses, and we continue to look across the enterprise for additional ways we can optimize our cost structure while also investing in new capabilities to support future growth. \n We've made a lot of progress in pursuit of our strategic priorities, which positions us to drive continued market share growth in the fourth quarter and beyond. \n Certainly, 2020 has been a year like no other, and it's difficult to predict exactly what the holiday season will bring this year. With Shop Safe Standards in all stores and enhanced digital shopping options, our teams are ready to meet our guests wherever and however they want to shop with us this holiday season. \n We're encouraged by the sales trends we've seen so far in the quarter, but uncertainty remains as we navigate ongoing disruption from a resurgence in the virus and continued economic uncertainty. As we execute through this holiday season, our top priorities are to reengage existing members and capture new guests with relevant content, compelling offers and unique products, and also to deliver engaging omnichannel experiences. \n Ulta Beauty is well positioned for this gift-giving season as consumers seek moments of joy, connection and self-care. Our holiday campaign is focused on helping guests see the joy this holiday season. Leveraging influencers from our Ulta Beauty Collective, we're sharing ways to practice self-care. We're celebrating community and relationships with gifting ideas, and we're highlighting the magic and generosity of the season. We kicked off the holiday season at the beginning of November with the distribution of our holiday print magazine, a reimagining of our holiday offers and multiple member appreciation events. \n Building on newness and exclusives introduced earlier this year, we've launched several new brands just in time for holiday season. In skincare, we're excited to launch Alicia Keys' new brand, Keys Soulcare, exclusively at Ulta Beauty, with a limited selection of products for the holiday season. The full assortment will be available in early 2021. In makeup, we're excited to welcome HOURGLASS, a cruelty-free luxury beauty brand to the Ulta Beauty family. And while we offer Chanel fragrances in stores, we're excited to announce we've recently launched Chanel fragrances on ulta.com for holiday gifting and beyond. \n To help our guests give the best gifts this year, we have introduced a new digital gift guide, including a 3-step quiz to inspire and help find the perfect gift. And for those who prefer to give gift cards, we've expanded our designs to include more inclusive options, and we've expanded our distribution in third-party outlets as well for added guest convenience. \n In anticipation that more guests will utilize digital channels this season, we've made curbside and BOPIS pickup easier than ever. These enhancements, combined with the investments we've made to increase our ship-to-home capacity, position us well to deliver a great omnichannel experience this holiday season. \n The operating environment continues to be dynamic and challenging. As COVID-19 prevalence increases, so are market-specific government restrictions, resulting in some reductions in operating hours, limitations on in-store capacity and, in some cases, mandated store closures. Our priority is to ensure the safety and well-being of our associates, guests and brand partners, and we'll continue to monitor the situation closely and adjust our operations as needed. \n Now before I turn the call over to Scott, I want to highlight the exciting new partnership I'm sure you've all read about. In 2021, Ulta Beauty will partner with another powerhouse retailer, Target Corporation, to disrupt the retail industry and redefine how guests experience beauty. Next fall, we'll introduce Ulta Beauty at Target, a shop-in-shop experience online and in select Target locations. With 1,000 square feet of space, Ulta Beauty at Target will offer a curated assortment of established, emerging and prestige brands across multiple categories. Our vision is to create an extension of our welcoming Ulta Beauty experience with dedicated Target team members trained to provide elevated service and offer deep product expertise with a dedicated space that inspires trial and discovery. Leaning into the power of our respective loyalty programs, we intend to reward guests with benefits across both programs for all purchases made within the shop. \n Leveraging a royalty structure, this unique collaboration brings together Ulta Beauty's category authority and brand relationships with Target's traffic-driving business model and industry-leading fulfillment services. Together, we will deliver industry-leading guest experiences across multiple touch points, provide the prestige beauty category and participating brands with an unparalleled platform for growth, drive market disruption and capture more market share. For Ulta Beauty, this partnership will build on our strength as the nation's largest beauty retailer, bring our beauty authority to life in a new way and create additional touch points for millions of loyal and new guests to discover and engage with Ulta Beauty, ultimately leading to more members as well as greater spend per member. \n Expanding our omnichannel capabilities to more deeply connect with guests is a strategic priority for us. We believe this new channel will create more opportunity to drive demand for the full beauty experience for discovery, services and play available in all Ulta Beauty stores. Importantly, we'll be able to leverage our robust CRM capabilities to engage guests who shop Ulta Beauty at Target with targeted personalized communications to highlight and enhance their total Ulta Beauty experience. \n In closing, we know guests are changing how they shop for beauty, but their engagement with the category remains strong. In fact, the role of beauty is more important now than ever. In this new normal, beauty has become more than makeup, more than product. Today, beauty is a critical link to acts of self-care and wellness. And as a well-loved brand with a diverse assortment and a wide range of price points, outstanding service offerings and knowledgeable and passionate associates, Ulta Beauty is well positioned to lead and shape how guests experience beauty in this new normal. \n And now I'll turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? \nScott Settersten: Thanks, Mary, and good afternoon, everyone. \n We appreciate your support of Ulta Beauty and hope you and your loved ones are staying safe and healthy. I will reiterate Mary's comments and thank all of our dedicated associates for their tireless efforts in safely serving our guests and keeping our operations running smoothly during this difficult time. \n I'll begin with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter declined 7.8%, and total company comp declined 8.9%. Given the challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are very pleased with this performance as top line results for the quarter were better than our internal expectations. \n Average ticket increased 7.6%, primarily driven by an increase in units per transaction, while transactions declined 15.4%. We experienced nice conversion in both channels but continued to be impacted by softer traffic to stores. \n As expected, e-commerce growth slowed relative to the second quarter but continued to deliver very strong growth versus last year. Our e-commerce operations delivered a comp increase of 90% for the quarter as guests continue to take advantage of our omnichannel capabilities. Buy online, pickup in store was strong again this quarter, totaling about 16% of e-commerce sales, approximately double the penetration in the third quarter last year. \n From a mix perspective, makeup was 45% of sales, down 600 basis points from last year. Skincare, bath and fragrance collectively increased 500 basis points to 26% of sales. Haircare products and styling tools increased 300 basis points to 21% of sales, while the services category was down 200 basis points to about 4% of sales. \n As Mary indicated, our service business continued to be negatively impacted by COVID-related capacity constraints. \n Gross profit margin was 35.1%, a decline of about 200 basis points compared to 37.1% a year ago. Similar to what we have seen since the onset of the pandemic, the largest driver of gross margin deleverage was fixed cost due to lower sales. I would note that the trend improved from what we experienced in the second quarter due to the stronger sales trend. Channel shift was also a large contributor to gross margin deleverage again this quarter, albeit less than we experienced in the second quarter as stores were open for the entire quarter. These headwinds were partially offset by an increase in merchandise margin, which was primarily driven by our lower promotional activity as well as continuing benefits from our efficiencies for growth or EFG efforts. \n SG&A expenses decreased to $416.4 million compared to $449.2 million in the third quarter of last year. The largest driver of the decrease was lower store payroll and benefits as we reduced investments in labor to reflect lower demand. Store expenses were also lower as we adjusted and managed to softer traffic in stores. \n Marketing expense was also lower year-over-year, reflecting reduced spend on print, offset by higher investment in digital channels. These reductions more than offset a modest increase in corporate overhead and PPE and COVID-related expenses. The increase in corporate overhead primarily reflects higher compensation and benefit expense partially offset by investments to support strategic growth initiatives made last year. \n As a reminder, in the third quarter of last year, incentive compensation expense decreased versus the prior year, reflecting financial performance that was below targeted levels as well as a lower stock price. \n This quarter, we recorded a charge of $23.6 million for impairment, restructuring and other costs. As Mary mentioned earlier, we suspended our planned expansion to Canada, resulting in a $15.9 million charge related to long-lived asset impairments, lease termination costs and severance. Our teams continue to wind down this effort, and we now expect to incur between $30 million to $40 million of Canada exit expenses in fiscal 2020. \n In the third quarter, we also recorded $5.7 million in severance associated with the elimination of the salon manager and prestige manager roles and recorded $2 million of lease termination costs related to the previously announced permanent closure of 19 stores. \n Preopening expense was $4.2 million in the quarter, a decrease from $6.5 million a year ago. We resumed new store openings in early August and opened 17 stores in the third quarter compared to 31 new stores a year ago. Interest expense related to the drawdown of our revolver totaled $1.4 million compared to interest income of $900,000 a year ago. \n Diluted GAAP earnings per share was $1.32 compared with $2.25 reported for last year's third quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding charges related to impairment, restructuring and other costs, was $1.64 compared to $2.23 a year ago, which excludes stock compensation and other tax credits. \n Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. For the quarter, total inventory decreased 11% compared to the third quarter last year, and inventory per store decreased 12.5% year-over-year as we adjusted to recent demand trends and reduced holiday receipts. To maintain flexibility and manage inventory risk, we have reduced our exposure to limited edition holiday sets and are leaning more into core product. We ended the quarter with $560.9 million in cash and cash equivalents. \n At the beginning of the pandemic, we drew down $800 million on our $1 billion revolver and suspended our stock buyback program as precautionary measures to increase liquidity. Reflecting on our confidence that we have sufficient liquidity to support our operations and investment priorities, we repaid $800 million of borrowings that were outstanding under the facility on September 2. We remain confident in our ability to generate strong cash flow, and we may resume our stock buyback program this quarter, depending on market and operating conditions. We currently have $1.58 billion remaining under our current repurchase authorization. \n Turning now to the rest of 2020. The overall operating environment remains uncertain, and it continues to be difficult to forecast our business with precision. Therefore, we are not providing EPS guidance at this time. However, I want to provide some color on how we are thinking about the fourth quarter. \n We are encouraged by the sales results for November. However, the operating environment continues to be dynamic, and it is difficult to predict how the effects of the pandemic, including any lockdowns or restrictions, may impact consumer demand through the rest of the quarter. As such, we now expect our fourth quarter comps to be in the range of down 12% to 14%, slightly better than the expectation of mid-teen comp declines we shared on our last earnings call. \n Two callouts as you think about your models. As Mary shared, we have realigned our store management structure to create a more cost-efficient store model. As a result of these changes, we will see a reduction of salon payroll and cost of goods sold and an increase in store payroll and SG&A relative to last year. Second, we expect to incur $15 million to $20 million of PPE and COVID-related expenses in the fourth quarter. Overall, we expect SG&A dollars in the fourth quarter will be similar to last year's levels. \n We continue to adjust our capital spending plan. Our updated plan for 2020 is to invest between $150 million and $160 million in capital expenditures, including approximately $65 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $65 million for supply chain and IT, and about $25 million for store maintenance and other. We expect to open approximately 30 new stores and relocate 5 stores in 2020. We are still finalizing our plans for next year but continue to expect to open at least 30 new stores in 2021. We remain confident in the long-term opportunity to continue to expand our store fleet. \n One final comment. We recognize that our long-term profitability potential is top of mind with investors, and I want to take this opportunity to reiterate our confidence that Ulta Beauty is a double-digit margin business. However, given the uncertainty and lack of visibility as to when the operating environment will stabilize and recover from the pandemic, it is difficult to say with certainty when we will return to double-digit margins. \n To start, we have healthy product margins, and our merchant teams continue to work to improve merchandise margins as we expand and enhance our assortment through both negotiation efforts as well as EFG opportunities. As sales stabilize and return to growth, we'll be able to leverage fixed costs. In addition to our ongoing EFG efforts, our real estate team is capturing significant benefits from lease renegotiation efforts, reflecting the market impacts of COVID-19, and these efforts will help us reduce occupancy costs over the longer term. \n Although e-commerce will likely continue to be a headwind to overall EBIT margins, we are improving e-commerce profitability as we increase utilization of BOPIS, leverage size and scale with growth and get closer to our guests through the expansion of our supply chain network. And we see additional opportunities to mitigate rate impacts in the future. \n As we discussed on our last earnings call, we continue to make progress on our journey to strengthen the effectiveness and profitability of our promotions. And we are actively taking steps in the near term to rightsize our cost structure in the new operating environment. Longer term, we are also working to identify additional opportunities across the enterprise to optimize our cost structure while also supporting investment to support growth capabilities. \n And now I'll turn the call back over to the operator to moderate the Q&A session. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler. \nErinn Murphy: My question, Mary, is for you on the Target partnership. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the brand production process and the inventory buying process between both Target as well as Ulta, and then how do you intend to integrate the Ulta Rewards Program at Target from a technology perspective? \nMary Dillon: Great. Thank you. Well, let me just start about the fact by reiterating we're very, very excited about the partnership. We've got a strong business model and track record to start with and feel very confident about our long-term growth prospects. And of course, we're really thrilled to unlock even more excitement for guests and growth with our Target partnership. \n Just to recap, we're thrilled. It's an amazing retailer. Brian Cornell is a fantastic CEO, and they've got a fantastic team. These are 2 very strong retail brands that are loved by consumers. And the concept of Ulta Beauty inside Target, 9 out of 10 people loved it, complementary brand DNA and team DNA. And of course, I think we both bring very different strengths to the equation from Ulta. It's our beauty authority, our best-in-class understanding of the beauty category, and for Target, certainly, the scale of Target and the millions of guests that will discover Ulta Beauty at Target is a huge benefit for us as well, as well as their omnichannel capabilities. \n As we think about bringing this forward, I think our brand -- we're early in the process with our brand negotiations and discussions. It's a lot of positive, a lot of enthusiasm. I think as a category and for brands, it's a great new platform for growth and for new customers, millions of new customers who discover brands. And so we feel very optimistic about that. Target will own the inventory. And that -- I think we've talked about that publicly. So that's what we really own the brand relationships, and that's part of the partnership that we developed from the start. \n Early on in terms of integration of technology, but certainly a very important part of this is that our -- is that the customers that participate in the Ulta Beauty at Target will be able to earn -- will be able to sign up if they're not currently members in Ultamate Rewards. If they're Ultamate Rewards members, earn loyalty points as well as Target loyalty points. And then for Ultamate Rewards, redeem those at Ulta Beauty. So we think that's a critical part as we think about the way to really create a flywheel here that works -- creates a win, win, win, I'd say, for guests and for Ulta Beauty and for Target. \nOperator: Our next question is from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. \nJoseph Altobello: So first question, in terms of the experience that you guys had in October, you mentioned comps were down mid-singles in August, September and saw a little bit of a down draft in October given the fact that you guys didn't repeat a promotion you did last year. Was that different from what you expected? And I'm curious, did it cause you guys to rethink your promotion strategy as we head into the holiday season? \nMary Dillon: Yes. I would say it's not -- wasn't a surprise. I mean we made a very specific decision to pull back some level of promotion. And adjusted without the promotion, of course, the comps are even stronger. So we think it's an important step, and just continuing to refine our promotion strategies to make them be as ultimately profitable as possible, but it's not a pullback on our ability to be very competitive. So the holiday season, we started early because we needed to get people to start early in November, right, given the capacity constraints. And we've got a very robust program throughout the holiday season that we think is very competitive. And so far, as I said in the script, we feel good about the results that we're seeing. So I think it played out exactly as we had expected. \nJoseph Altobello: And in terms of the guide for Q4, you mentioned the comp down 12% to 14%. It does sound like November was off to a fairly decent start. So maybe help us understand why you're assuming a pretty significant slowdown in December. \nMary Dillon: Yes. Well, stepping back, again, we're pleased with the momentum that we're seeing, and the demand signals are strong. And we did feel good about how we started in November. It's a pretty simple answer to your question. We're in the middle of this unprecedented pandemic. And as you know, we just reached peak levels of hospitalizations yesterday in the U.S. So it's uncertain. \n Certainly, we know we're set up well. Our e-commerce business is performing extremely well. Our stores are doing a great job. But there's uncertainty about what will happen, I guess, I'd say as we get closer to the holiday in terms of store traffic, and that would be true for everybody. So we're just trying to meet the guests where they are, be pragmatic about this. Certainly, the news about the vaccine is positive, but there's many difficult weeks ahead. So we feel good, but we're also being cautious about the uncertainty that's going to, we think, play out in the next several weeks and few months. \nOperator: Our next question is from Oliver Chen from Cowen. \nOliver Chen: The e-commerce growth continues to be outstanding, but it decelerated from prior amazing quarters. So what are you seeing there in terms of category performance? And what's happened in different areas of growth in that business? I would also just love more details on Ultamate Rewards in that member count and how that may trend and what's under your control in terms of keeping the member count at or above 31.7 million. \nMary Dillon: Sure. Well, Oliver, that's a 3-pronged question. That's impressive. And I'll -- maybe Dave and I will tag team a little bit. E-commerce traffic and comp, we -- we're very pleased with how that's going, and in fact, expected it to moderate somewhat as we open up stores. And that -- we like that. It's -- obviously, as people are coming back to stores, historically, what we've seen is omnichannel guests are our best guests because they add the e-commerce purchase on top and really spend 3x as much as somebody who is store-only. So as we open up stores, expected to see some moderation of e-commerce demand, but it's still up 90% last quarter. So we feel very good about that. \n In terms of -- I think the second part of your question was about category performance on e-com, which Dave will be happy to take, and then we can just get into Ultamate Rewards at the end of the 3-pronged question. \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. Oliver, category performance on e-com really mirrors the total company performance that we highlighted in the script. So strength across skincare, haircare, bath, fragrance, exceptionally strong and continued challenges although some bright spots in makeup. So nothing different about our e-commerce business versus our store from a category standpoint with real strength and growth coming outside of the makeup category. So we're pleased with that. \n As it relates to the -- our loyalty program, I'll just start with saying we are really -- remain incredibly proud of what we believe is one of the best loyalty programs in all of retail. And even with some of the challenges we faced this year, we know our guests continue to love the program. They're highly engaged in that program. Our brand partners continue to find a lot of value through the access and the insights that they get by engaging in that program. Our elite guests, our diamond and platinum guests are still highly engaged. It is working at a very high level, and we're really glad that we -- we've always been glad to have it, and we certainly have been happy to have that as part of our arsenal this year as we face this unprecedented times. \n But yes, we did see a decline this year, primarily due to store closures. That hurts our new member conversion, and it also impacts retention because, as you know, while our e-commerce business is growing, and we have a significant increase in penetration of our member base at our e-commerce, it's still a majority store-based user loyalty program. And some of those guests, particularly the least engaged, the non-elite guests, we have seen a bit of a hit on retention with those least tenured guests. \n Importantly, as I think Mary mentioned in the script, our retention with our most tenured guests, the platinum and diamond, remains very strong, and we're seeing a lot of strong performance in that. So with nearly 32 million members, we're -- we feel like it's still very strong, and we're focused on reactivating guests, continuing to drive strong engagement with our engaged guests and those elite guests. But as a reminder, we do calculate loyalty -- the number of our loyalty program over rolling 12 months. And so as each month goes by, we're still lapping a pre-COVID period through this -- through the next several months. So we're working hard to reengage our guests, but we'll continue to be lapping a period where we weren't facing the challenges, particularly in our store fleet. So we're anticipating some challenges with our less tenured guests for a little while but focused on retaining them and seeing strength as we emerge out of this in 2021. \nOperator: Our next question is from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: So I guess, Scott, just going back to some of the commentary that you provided for guidance for Q4. I was curious if you can provide maybe the puts and takes for gross margins. And then related to that, I just want to get a sense of what you guys are seeing right now in the promotional environment during the holiday season. \nScott Settersten: All right. Thanks, Rupesh. So first, I think with fourth quarter, it's important to keep in mind what the sales guidance is. So again, we expect a softer top line in Q4 versus Q3. Again, that's compared to last year's trends, right? So that comes with inherent margin pressure, generally speaking. \n We anticipate gross margin to leverage in Q4 similar to Q3 levels, with many of the same drivers that we've seen through the last couple of quarters primarily deleverage of fixed cost in the stores and across the supply chain, on lower sales volumes. And then this -- we can have some nice offsets with improving merchandise margins similar to what we saw in Q3. \n I guess as long as I'm talking about margins, I'll just pivot over to SG&A as well. Just as a reminder, we've made some comments in the call about the shift in the payroll, right, from -- related to the services manager going from cost of goods sold down to SG&A. So that's something to keep in mind as you update your model and just a little bit more color there. So we expect -- in SG&A, we do expect more deleverage in Q4 versus Q3, with the pressure being from store payroll and benefits as we ramp up store labor again and make sure we deliver excellent guest experience during the holiday season and then some increasing store expenses primarily due to the COVID and PPE-related costs. \n Lastly there, I'd say on the advertising or marketing side, there was a shift. We talked about this earlier in the year. So marketing is going to be heavier in the fourth quarter as we go into holiday. We view that as opportunistic spend versus what we saw earlier in the year. \nDavid Kimbell: Then on your promotional question for the holidays, of course, as we've talked about before, holiday is always a very promotional time frame for every retailer. And we see it as not just competing against other beauty retailers, but really other categories as well as we're competing for the gift-giving occasions. So naturally, we see an increase in promotionality. We also, as Mary mentioned, have -- we've pulled up our promotions and changed the cadence a bit, and we're seeing that across the category as well as more effort to spread promotional activity around, to give guests more opportunities to feel more comfortable shopping both in store and online to manage their gift-giving and personal occasions. \n Overall, we see it as competitive. We've seen some competitors be a bit more promotional. We've seen brands a bit more aggressive in some limited time offers, in their DTC. I wouldn't classify that as a dramatic or radical shift in promotionality. And as always, we're watching the market very closely. We've got great tools in place. We feel like the efforts we've implemented so far this holiday season this quarter have been effective. And we're confident in the promotional plans that we have, both leading up through the rest of Christmas and then post holiday as well. So feel good about the position and certainly managing and monitoring it on a daily basis. \nScott Settersten: And Rupesh, I just want to clarify, I did mean deleverage. So gross margin deleverage in Q4 versus Q3, same with SG&A. \nOperator: Our next question is from Simeon Siegel with BMO Capital Markets. \nSimeon Siegel: Maybe a little higher level. Mary or Dave, I get pandemic might be a weird time to ask this, but how are you thinking about where you are in terms of the target -- your target customer share of wallet versus where you've told us historically? And then maybe any views you have on how the selling landscape might change post pandemic? So just thinking about potentially shrinking department stores but growing online beauty, maybe DTC brands, big box, et cetera. Just any of the changes you're seeing there. And then, Scott, did you say what you expect to save from Canada next year? \nMary Dillon: Okay. Thank you. It's another 3-pronged question. Starting with the broader environment, I would say, we are always in a strategic planning mode, right? Looking around the corners, thinking about the future, looking at what's happening with consumer behavior, channel behavior, competitive behavior. There's no question about that. The pandemic has accelerated many things that were on the horizon anyways and certainly increased e-commerce shopping, no surprise, disruption in some physical shopping, which is coming back. And we think there's a bit of a shakeout -- maybe accelerated shakeout in terms of who the winners and losers will be long term in terms of retail format. \n So part of what we -- a big part of what we do is think about how can we meet guests in new ways and new channels, new formats to meet them where they're going to be. And that has been a strategy for us already, which is increasing our omnichannel capabilities. So whether it's BOPIS, curbside, e-commerce, shipping capacity, digital tools, but we certainly -- that's another great opportunity for us with the Target partnership is to really disrupt at a time that there is disruption happening and accelerate the opportunities for us to drive growth through accessing new customers in new omnichannel ways. \n So D2C brand, certainly, there's strength in that segment as well. We think overall, e-commerce will be bigger than it would have been, it's been pulled forward. I think we all know that. But we see that our customer in this category also still really wants the in-store shopping experience. And so that's kind of exciting for us as we are always thinking about what that store of the future and experience of the future would look like. \n And frankly, I'm very happy that we had digital tools available like GLAMlab to immediately pivot to virtual try-on for makeup and now skincare in a way that is very helpful right now. So I think we're well positioned given the shifts. I don't think the shifts are done. I think we just have to assume that we have to continue to look around corners for new shifts and opportunities. Share of wallet, do you want to take that? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. I'd just say certainly, it's, as you said in your question, a really disrupted time to try to measure consumer dynamics. And so we're watching closely on share of wallet. What we do know is we continue to gain share, and we talked about this, I think, in previous calls and discussions, gaining share on the prestige side, we're across categories within prestige, makeup, skincare, haircare. We've seen that consistently. \n As we talked in previous calls, we lost -- we feel like we lost some share as our stores were shut earlier in the pandemic in the mass side, and our mass competitors remained open, which would imply a bit of a short-term hit on share of wallet, but we're seeing that business strengthen and perform really well in Q3. And so confident in that. So we're going to wait for the dust to fully settle on 2020 to really assess the impact of share of wallet. What we do know is we came into this pandemic with real momentum and strength across categories and price points, gaining share, gaining share of wallet, gaining customer growth. There's been disruption, but we think our model, as Mary said, is quite strong. We think we're very well positioned to accelerate out of this and continue the path of driving growth and share across all dimensions. \nScott Settersten: And then finally, on the Canada piece, we haven't really quantified any element of the Canadian expansion plans here over the last couple of years we've been talking about this. So suffice it to say, it's a start-up investment like a lot of other things, and there's typically some deleverage that comes along with that during their early phases. That wasn't -- so we will avoid that next year, obviously, by not moving ahead with that. But back to Mary's comments, that's not the reason why we stepped away from that. I mean it was just a question of what were the highest priorities and where should we be focusing our efforts in light of all the disruption we're dealing with these days. \nOperator: And our last question would be from Mark Altschwager with Baird. \nMark Altschwager: Great. I guess a 2-pronged one related to stores. Maybe just first is, with respect to the store opening plans, you mentioned at least 30 next year, what are the factors you're considering today that would most impact the final plan for 2021? And is there a scenario where you could get back to something closer to the prior cadence? And then the second part, just related to Target. From a store perspective, I mean, if that partnership is successful, does it change your view on the longer-term store target for Ulta? \nScott Settersten: Yes. So I guess maybe I'll go to the last piece of that first. So no, it doesn't change our outlook really on that range that we've been talking about and reaffirming over the last few years. So 1,500 to 1,700 stores in the U.S. We still feel comfortable that that's very doable range even with the new Target announcement here recently. So as you can well imagine, real estate being one of our core competencies, this has been on the front burner, just thinking about the impact to store growth in the future and how -- what changes this might drive us to. So we don't see any big pendulum swing with respect to that, although that's something we'll keep our eyes on, right, as we move down the pathway with the Target team. \n And so as far as next year, the cadence, so yes, at least 30 stores, markets partly related to our ability to work with our landlord partners. I mean you know a lot of these leases we're working years in advance, right? So there are signed leases and commitments to move forward with certain projects. So again, we're relooking at all of those, all the signed agreements that we have and all the others that are in the queue, just to make sure we're making good decisions and going with the best of the best kind of locations that we feel very confident in. So it's a thoughtful process, but we feel like we've got really great capabilities there analytically, and our real estate team is best in class. So we feel confident in the future. \nMary Dillon: I'm just going to add one thing to Scott's answer, which is on top of it, the way that we thought about the Target partnership, I'd say, is really an amplifier to our business model. As Scott said, we believe we can still build out the number of stores that we've mapped out. And this yet gives us yet another point of distribution, a way to reach millions of new guests with a trial and discovery version of Ulta Beauty, right, that we amplify back to the Ulta Beauty full business model as well. And so as we map out the future of those locations, plus our store locations, working in partnership with Target to make this a win for everybody. \nOperator: And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mary Dillon for closing remarks. \nMary Dillon: Thank you for joining us today. I'd like to close by thanking all of the Ulta Beauty associates across our stores, distribution centers and offices for their truly relentless effort to navigate through this challenging environment while also working hard to get our stores, website and DCs ready for the holiday season. We know this holiday season will be like no other, but our team is ready and excited to help our guests see the joy of the season. And we hope that you, your colleagues and your loved ones stay safe and healthy. We look forward to speaking to all of you again in March when we report our fourth quarter and full year results. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "David Kimbell",
            "content": "Yes. Oliver, category performance on e-com really mirrors the total company performance that we highlighted in the script. So strength across skincare, haircare, bath, fragrance, exceptionally strong and continued challenges although some bright spots in makeup. So nothing different about our e-commerce business versus our store from a category standpoint with real strength and growth coming outside of the makeup category. So we're pleased with that. \n As it relates to the -- our loyalty program, I'll just start with saying we are really -- remain incredibly proud of what we believe is one of the best loyalty programs in all of retail. And even with some of the challenges we faced this year, we know our guests continue to love the program. They're highly engaged in that program. Our brand partners continue to find a lot of value through the access and the insights that they get by engaging in that program. Our elite guests, our diamond and platinum guests are still highly engaged. It is working at a very high level, and we're really glad that we -- we've always been glad to have it, and we certainly have been happy to have that as part of our arsenal this year as we face this unprecedented times. \n But yes, we did see a decline this year, primarily due to store closures. That hurts our new member conversion, and it also impacts retention because, as you know, while our e-commerce business is growing, and we have a significant increase in penetration of our member base at our e-commerce, it's still a majority store-based user loyalty program. And some of those guests, particularly the least engaged, the non-elite guests, we have seen a bit of a hit on retention with those least tenured guests. \n Importantly, as I think Mary mentioned in the script, our retention with our most tenured guests, the platinum and diamond, remains very strong, and we're seeing a lot of strong performance in that. So with nearly 32 million members, we're -- we feel like it's still very strong, and we're focused on reactivating guests, continuing to drive strong engagement with our engaged guests and those elite guests. But as a reminder, we do calculate loyalty -- the number of our loyalty program over rolling 12 months. And so as each month goes by, we're still lapping a pre-COVID period through this -- through the next several months. So we're working hard to reengage our guests, but we'll continue to be lapping a period where we weren't facing the challenges, particularly in our store fleet. So we're anticipating some challenges with our less tenured guests for a little while but focused on retaining them and seeing strength as we emerge out of this in 2021. Then on your promotional question for the holidays, of course, as we've talked about before, holiday is always a very promotional time frame for every retailer. And we see it as not just competing against other beauty retailers, but really other categories as well as we're competing for the gift-giving occasions. So naturally, we see an increase in promotionality. We also, as Mary mentioned, have -- we've pulled up our promotions and changed the cadence a bit, and we're seeing that across the category as well as more effort to spread promotional activity around, to give guests more opportunities to feel more comfortable shopping both in store and online to manage their gift-giving and personal occasions. \n Overall, we see it as competitive. We've seen some competitors be a bit more promotional. We've seen brands a bit more aggressive in some limited time offers, in their DTC. I wouldn't classify that as a dramatic or radical shift in promotionality. And as always, we're watching the market very closely. We've got great tools in place. We feel like the efforts we've implemented so far this holiday season this quarter have been effective. And we're confident in the promotional plans that we have, both leading up through the rest of Christmas and then post holiday as well. So feel good about the position and certainly managing and monitoring it on a daily basis. Yes. I'd just say certainly, it's, as you said in your question, a really disrupted time to try to measure consumer dynamics. And so we're watching closely on share of wallet. What we do know is we continue to gain share, and we talked about this, I think, in previous calls and discussions, gaining share on the prestige side, we're across categories within prestige, makeup, skincare, haircare. We've seen that consistently. \n As we talked in previous calls, we lost -- we feel like we lost some share as our stores were shut earlier in the pandemic in the mass side, and our mass competitors remained open, which would imply a bit of a short-term hit on share of wallet, but we're seeing that business strengthen and perform really well in Q3. And so confident in that. So we're going to wait for the dust to fully settle on 2020 to really assess the impact of share of wallet. What we do know is we came into this pandemic with real momentum and strength across categories and price points, gaining share, gaining share of wallet, gaining customer growth. There's been disruption, but we think our model, as Mary said, is quite strong. We think we're very well positioned to accelerate out of this and continue the path of driving growth and share across all dimensions."

            "name": "Scott Settersten",
            "content": "Thanks, Mary, and good afternoon, everyone. \n We appreciate your support of Ulta Beauty and hope you and your loved ones are staying safe and healthy. I will reiterate Mary's comments and thank all of our dedicated associates for their tireless efforts in safely serving our guests and keeping our operations running smoothly during this difficult time. \n I'll begin with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter declined 7.8%, and total company comp declined 8.9%. Given the challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are very pleased with this performance as top line results for the quarter were better than our internal expectations. \n Average ticket increased 7.6%, primarily driven by an increase in units per transaction, while transactions declined 15.4%. We experienced nice conversion in both channels but continued to be impacted by softer traffic to stores. \n As expected, e-commerce growth slowed relative to the second quarter but continued to deliver very strong growth versus last year. Our e-commerce operations delivered a comp increase of 90% for the quarter as guests continue to take advantage of our omnichannel capabilities. Buy online, pickup in store was strong again this quarter, totaling about 16% of e-commerce sales, approximately double the penetration in the third quarter last year. \n From a mix perspective, makeup was 45% of sales, down 600 basis points from last year. Skincare, bath and fragrance collectively increased 500 basis points to 26% of sales. Haircare products and styling tools increased 300 basis points to 21% of sales, while the services category was down 200 basis points to about 4% of sales. \n As Mary indicated, our service business continued to be negatively impacted by COVID-related capacity constraints. \n Gross profit margin was 35.1%, a decline of about 200 basis points compared to 37.1% a year ago. Similar to what we have seen since the onset of the pandemic, the largest driver of gross margin deleverage was fixed cost due to lower sales. I would note that the trend improved from what we experienced in the second quarter due to the stronger sales trend. Channel shift was also a large contributor to gross margin deleverage again this quarter, albeit less than we experienced in the second quarter as stores were open for the entire quarter. These headwinds were partially offset by an increase in merchandise margin, which was primarily driven by our lower promotional activity as well as continuing benefits from our efficiencies for growth or EFG efforts. \n SG&A expenses decreased to $416.4 million compared to $449.2 million in the third quarter of last year. The largest driver of the decrease was lower store payroll and benefits as we reduced investments in labor to reflect lower demand. Store expenses were also lower as we adjusted and managed to softer traffic in stores. \n Marketing expense was also lower year-over-year, reflecting reduced spend on print, offset by higher investment in digital channels. These reductions more than offset a modest increase in corporate overhead and PPE and COVID-related expenses. The increase in corporate overhead primarily reflects higher compensation and benefit expense partially offset by investments to support strategic growth initiatives made last year. \n As a reminder, in the third quarter of last year, incentive compensation expense decreased versus the prior year, reflecting financial performance that was below targeted levels as well as a lower stock price. \n This quarter, we recorded a charge of $23.6 million for impairment, restructuring and other costs. As Mary mentioned earlier, we suspended our planned expansion to Canada, resulting in a $15.9 million charge related to long-lived asset impairments, lease termination costs and severance. Our teams continue to wind down this effort, and we now expect to incur between $30 million to $40 million of Canada exit expenses in fiscal 2020. \n In the third quarter, we also recorded $5.7 million in severance associated with the elimination of the salon manager and prestige manager roles and recorded $2 million of lease termination costs related to the previously announced permanent closure of 19 stores. \n Preopening expense was $4.2 million in the quarter, a decrease from $6.5 million a year ago. We resumed new store openings in early August and opened 17 stores in the third quarter compared to 31 new stores a year ago. Interest expense related to the drawdown of our revolver totaled $1.4 million compared to interest income of $900,000 a year ago. \n Diluted GAAP earnings per share was $1.32 compared with $2.25 reported for last year's third quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding charges related to impairment, restructuring and other costs, was $1.64 compared to $2.23 a year ago, which excludes stock compensation and other tax credits. \n Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. For the quarter, total inventory decreased 11% compared to the third quarter last year, and inventory per store decreased 12.5% year-over-year as we adjusted to recent demand trends and reduced holiday receipts. To maintain flexibility and manage inventory risk, we have reduced our exposure to limited edition holiday sets and are leaning more into core product. We ended the quarter with $560.9 million in cash and cash equivalents. \n At the beginning of the pandemic, we drew down $800 million on our $1 billion revolver and suspended our stock buyback program as precautionary measures to increase liquidity. Reflecting on our confidence that we have sufficient liquidity to support our operations and investment priorities, we repaid $800 million of borrowings that were outstanding under the facility on September 2. We remain confident in our ability to generate strong cash flow, and we may resume our stock buyback program this quarter, depending on market and operating conditions. We currently have $1.58 billion remaining under our current repurchase authorization. \n Turning now to the rest of 2020. The overall operating environment remains uncertain, and it continues to be difficult to forecast our business with precision. Therefore, we are not providing EPS guidance at this time. However, I want to provide some color on how we are thinking about the fourth quarter. \n We are encouraged by the sales results for November. However, the operating environment continues to be dynamic, and it is difficult to predict how the effects of the pandemic, including any lockdowns or restrictions, may impact consumer demand through the rest of the quarter. As such, we now expect our fourth quarter comps to be in the range of down 12% to 14%, slightly better than the expectation of mid-teen comp declines we shared on our last earnings call. \n Two callouts as you think about your models. As Mary shared, we have realigned our store management structure to create a more cost-efficient store model. As a result of these changes, we will see a reduction of salon payroll and cost of goods sold and an increase in store payroll and SG&A relative to last year. Second, we expect to incur $15 million to $20 million of PPE and COVID-related expenses in the fourth quarter. Overall, we expect SG&A dollars in the fourth quarter will be similar to last year's levels. \n We continue to adjust our capital spending plan. Our updated plan for 2020 is to invest between $150 million and $160 million in capital expenditures, including approximately $65 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $65 million for supply chain and IT, and about $25 million for store maintenance and other. We expect to open approximately 30 new stores and relocate 5 stores in 2020. We are still finalizing our plans for next year but continue to expect to open at least 30 new stores in 2021. We remain confident in the long-term opportunity to continue to expand our store fleet. \n One final comment. We recognize that our long-term profitability potential is top of mind with investors, and I want to take this opportunity to reiterate our confidence that Ulta Beauty is a double-digit margin business. However, given the uncertainty and lack of visibility as to when the operating environment will stabilize and recover from the pandemic, it is difficult to say with certainty when we will return to double-digit margins. \n To start, we have healthy product margins, and our merchant teams continue to work to improve merchandise margins as we expand and enhance our assortment through both negotiation efforts as well as EFG opportunities. As sales stabilize and return to growth, we'll be able to leverage fixed costs. In addition to our ongoing EFG efforts, our real estate team is capturing significant benefits from lease renegotiation efforts, reflecting the market impacts of COVID-19, and these efforts will help us reduce occupancy costs over the longer term. \n Although e-commerce will likely continue to be a headwind to overall EBIT margins, we are improving e-commerce profitability as we increase utilization of BOPIS, leverage size and scale with growth and get closer to our guests through the expansion of our supply chain network. And we see additional opportunities to mitigate rate impacts in the future. \n As we discussed on our last earnings call, we continue to make progress on our journey to strengthen the effectiveness and profitability of our promotions. And we are actively taking steps in the near term to rightsize our cost structure in the new operating environment. Longer term, we are also working to identify additional opportunities across the enterprise to optimize our cost structure while also supporting investment to support growth capabilities. \n And now I'll turn the call back over to the operator to moderate the Q&A session. All right. Thanks, Rupesh. So first, I think with fourth quarter, it's important to keep in mind what the sales guidance is. So again, we expect a softer top line in Q4 versus Q3. Again, that's compared to last year's trends, right? So that comes with inherent margin pressure, generally speaking. \n We anticipate gross margin to leverage in Q4 similar to Q3 levels, with many of the same drivers that we've seen through the last couple of quarters primarily deleverage of fixed cost in the stores and across the supply chain, on lower sales volumes. And then this -- we can have some nice offsets with improving merchandise margins similar to what we saw in Q3. \n I guess as long as I'm talking about margins, I'll just pivot over to SG&A as well. Just as a reminder, we've made some comments in the call about the shift in the payroll, right, from -- related to the services manager going from cost of goods sold down to SG&A. So that's something to keep in mind as you update your model and just a little bit more color there. So we expect -- in SG&A, we do expect more deleverage in Q4 versus Q3, with the pressure being from store payroll and benefits as we ramp up store labor again and make sure we deliver excellent guest experience during the holiday season and then some increasing store expenses primarily due to the COVID and PPE-related costs. \n Lastly there, I'd say on the advertising or marketing side, there was a shift. We talked about this earlier in the year. So marketing is going to be heavier in the fourth quarter as we go into holiday. We view that as opportunistic spend versus what we saw earlier in the year. And Rupesh, I just want to clarify, I did mean deleverage. So gross margin deleverage in Q4 versus Q3, same with SG&A. And then finally, on the Canada piece, we haven't really quantified any element of the Canadian expansion plans here over the last couple of years we've been talking about this. So suffice it to say, it's a start-up investment like a lot of other things, and there's typically some deleverage that comes along with that during their early phases. That wasn't -- so we will avoid that next year, obviously, by not moving ahead with that. But back to Mary's comments, that's not the reason why we stepped away from that. I mean it was just a question of what were the highest priorities and where should we be focusing our efforts in light of all the disruption we're dealing with these days. Yes. So I guess maybe I'll go to the last piece of that first. So no, it doesn't change our outlook really on that range that we've been talking about and reaffirming over the last few years. So 1,500 to 1,700 stores in the U.S. We still feel comfortable that that's very doable range even with the new Target announcement here recently. So as you can well imagine, real estate being one of our core competencies, this has been on the front burner, just thinking about the impact to store growth in the future and how -- what changes this might drive us to. So we don't see any big pendulum swing with respect to that, although that's something we'll keep our eyes on, right, as we move down the pathway with the Target team. \n And so as far as next year, the cadence, so yes, at least 30 stores, markets partly related to our ability to work with our landlord partners. I mean you know a lot of these leases we're working years in advance, right? So there are signed leases and commitments to move forward with certain projects. So again, we're relooking at all of those, all the signed agreements that we have and all the others that are in the queue, just to make sure we're making good decisions and going with the best of the best kind of locations that we feel very confident in. So it's a thoughtful process, but we feel like we've got really great capabilities there analytically, and our real estate team is best in class. So we feel confident in the future."

            "name": "Mary Dillon",
            "content": "Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. \n Today, we reported financial results that reflect the strength of the Ulta Beauty model and improving trends in consumer demand. I continue to be very proud of how well our teams are responding and navigating through this difficult period. And I want to thank all of our Ulta Beauty associates for their continued agility, creativity and commitment to serving our guests and taking care of each other during this unprecedented period. \n For the third quarter, net sales were $1.6 billion and GAAP diluted EPS was $1.32 per share. Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.64 per share. \n Building on the momentum we saw at the end of the second quarter, third quarter comp store sales declined 8.9%. The mid-single-digit comp declines we experienced in August continued through September, with October sales impacted by our decision not to repeat certain promotional activity from last year. \n As we discussed on our last earnings call, we're working to optimize promotional events to remain competitive while also improving profitability. In the third quarter, we executed several promotional events that drove strong guest engagement and profitable sales. \n We launched our first-ever We Love Our Members event to reengage and welcome Ultamate Rewards members back to Ulta Beauty, having completed our phased store reopening process. We rewarded guests with member-only points and services offers and amplified the offers across owned, earned and paid channels to reinforce the value of our rewards program. We successfully executed a more focused 21 Days of Beauty, one of our most strategic events intended to drive mass migration to prestige products. To excite and reengage guests, we accelerated our digital and streaming first approach to support expanded messaging for our compelling beauty steals, newness and exclusive products. \n We expanded the focus of our Fall Haul event beyond makeup to include key self-care categories while reducing the length of the event to drive greater productivity. And to further elevate our hair authority through our Gorgeous Hair event, we leverage engaging storytelling around healthy hair, color care and black-owned brands. \n Now turning to our performance by category. We continue to increase our market share across most major prestige beauty categories. Starting with one of our strategic growth categories, skincare delivered positive comp growth driven by newer brands like The Ordinary, TULA and Beekman 1802 as well as existing brands like CeraVe, First Aid Beauty and La Roche-Posay. From our proprietary consumer insights work, we know most beauty enthusiasts are maintaining or expanding their skincare routines as a form of self-care. Increased interest for home skincare treatments as well as newness and innovation in body treatments, face serums and eye creams are driving strong category growth. Leaning into these trends and the opportunity to increase our market share in this category, we continue to expand our assortment while also increasing space and marketing support for this key growth category. \n Fragrance and bath was our strongest category this quarter, delivering double-digit comp growth, driven by newness, exclusive and unique Ulta Beauty programs. Guests responded well to our fragrance gift with purchase programs as well as our Fragrance Crush program, which highlights a favorite fragrance each month. Sales of fragrance also benefited from our exclusive launch of R.E.M. from Ariana Grande and innovation from established brands like YSL and Marc Jacobs. The bath category continues to deliver strong growth. And this quarter, we introduced newness from brands like Truly, Hempz, Ulta Beauty Collection and Tree Hut.\n Reflecting ongoing DIY beauty and self-care trends, haircare and hairstyling tools also delivered positive comp sales growth this quarter. Within haircare, color continued to deliver strong growth driven by brands like Arctic Fox and Madison Reed. Textured hair brands, Curlsmith and Pattern by Tracee Ellis Ross, also delivered nice growth. Our leader business also continued to perform well, and newness from Dyson and the continued popularity of one-step tools drove strong growth in styling tools this quarter as guests leverage more options to achieve different looks. \n Makeup continued to be challenged given shifts in consumer behavior and delays in planned newness and innovation. Despite these headwinds, subcategories that focus above the mask continued to perform better, including lashes, brow and eye. Newness, while more limited than last year, continues to be important to guests, with nostalgic themes like Ulta Beauty Harry Potter collection, Makeup Revolution's Nightmare Before Christmas and ColourPop's Hocus Pocus collection, all resonating really well with guests. \n Although the pandemic has accelerated channel shift, our consumer insights and results continue to confirm that our members prefer to shop in physical stores for beauty even as they have increased their adoption of online shopping. As expected, with stores opened for the full quarter, store traffic trends improved and e-commerce growth moderated from trends we saw in the first half of the year. \n For the quarter, our e-commerce business delivered sales growth of about 90%. And buy online, pickup in store was strong again this quarter. \n Turning now to services. Our services business continues to be adversely impacted by COVID-related capacity constraints and local restrictions. At the end of the third quarter, salon and brow services were available in nearly all stores, but we've not resumed skin or makeup services based on ongoing safety concerns. Although trends improved from the second quarter, sales from our services business were down more than 30% in the third quarter primarily due to a decline in transactions. Average ticket was higher, reflecting pent-up demand for cut, color and style services. \n At the end of the quarter, we had 31.7 million active members in our Ultamate Rewards Program, essentially flat with the second quarter and about 6% lower than the third quarter last year. While we're pleased with our new member acquisition and reengagement trends this quarter, we will continue to focus on reactivation of members who haven't shopped with us since the pandemic began. \n Now importantly, retention rates among our platinum and diamond members who are most engaged with our brand remain very strong. We continue to see an increase in members shopping with us online. As we've discussed before, omnichannel members are our most engaged and most productive members, historically spending 3x more per year than store-only guests. In the third quarter, omnichannel members were about 22% of the total compared to about 12% in the third quarter last year. \n As our teams continue to manage the day-to-day operations in the current environment, we're also building the foundation for profitable growth in 2021 and beyond. Specifically, we're focused on 5 strategic priorities to expand our market share gains and extend our competitive advantages. And during the third quarter, we made progress on each of these priorities. \n Starting with our continued focus on building the capabilities to win in an omnichannel world. We are committed to meeting guests wherever they want to shop. In April, in response to COVID-related constraints, our digital and store teams moved quickly to launch a new curbside pickup option. To make it easier for our guests and our store teams, we have recently enhanced this option with the launch of a curbside customer alert notification. We've refreshed curbside signage and established dedicated Ulta Beauty parking spaces at select stores. We've also expanded our store locator functionality to include greater visibility to store-specific service offerings and separate store and curbside hours. And in the Ulta Beauty app, we now provide store-specific occupancy levels for greater transparency and guest safety. \n To support our growing e-commerce business, this quarter, we opened our Jacksonville fast fulfillment center, expanded e-commerce operations in our Chambersburg, Greenwood and Dallas distribution centers and expanded our ship-from-store program to 105 stores. These investments have increased our e-commerce shipping capacity and will improve delivery speed to guests. \n This quarter, we also completed the rollout of our new booking tool for services in the app and on ulta.com. This new digital application enables guests to easily book or reschedule salon, brow and other service appointments. Adoption of the tool continues to increase, and nearly 1/3 of our service appointments were booked through this new tool in the most recent quarter, resulting in more convenience for our guests and more efficiency for our associates. \n Our second priority is to reimagine how guest experience and discover beauty in the new normal. Product discovery is a hallmark of the beauty shopping experience, and we're welcoming more guests to experience the fun of GLAMlab, our virtual try-on tool. Our store associates have done a great job introducing GLAMlab to guests as a safe alternative to testers in stores, which are currently for display purposes only. To help facilitate even more in-store engagement, we've introduced new QR codes on select shelf strips that take guests directly into the GLAMlab experience, making it even easier for guests to virtually try on products while they're in stores. \n Building on our successful virtual try-on capabilities, last quarter, we introduced a skin analysis tool, which uses augmented reality technology and artificial intelligence to assess skincare needs and offer personalized product recommendations. This quarter, we enhanced this tool to include new routine recommendations and the ability for guests to save analyses to track changes. In addition to offering guest digital tools, we're also testing one-on-one video consultations across all beauty categories in collaboration with our brand partners and our own services team members. \n Our third priority is to engage and delight beauty enthusiasts with a curated beauty assortment focused on exclusivity and leading brands. Reflecting the growing importance of clean beauty, in October, we launched Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty at all stores and on ulta.com and on our app, and the enthusiasm and feedback from our guests and brand partners has been tremendous. This holistic initiative provides greater transparency to help guests choose brands and products that reflect their personal values and individual needs. \n Through this initiative, we're certifying brands across 4 key pillars: clean ingredients, cruelty-free, vegan and sustainable packaging, and highlighting participating brands for their positive impact on communities. And today, more than 200 brands are participating in the program, and more than half have been certified in more than 1 pillar. As part of the launch, we established the Conscious Beauty Advisory Council, a coalition of experts at the forefront of clean beauty, product development and packaging sustainability. With the help of our advisory council, we will ensure that Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty will continue to evolve and grow as expectations and standards for clean beauty continue to change. \n In tandem with the launch of Conscious Beauty, we collaborated with Credo Beauty, a pioneer in Clean to introduce the Credo Collection at Ulta Beauty, a curated collection of prestige and masstige brands. Available in select stores and in ulta.com, this collection features 9 clean brands handpicked by the Credo experts across multiple categories, including skincare, haircare and cosmetics. \n Our fourth priority is to leverage insights from our Ultamate Rewards Program to cultivate brand love and loyalty, deepen guest engagement and increase spend per member. We continue to build content that reflects our brand purpose and drives meaningful connection with our guests. After suspending most of our marketing efforts in the first half of the year while stores were closed, this quarter, we launched Where Dreams Begin, a campaign that reflects the next chapter of our brand journey. Launched across linear television and digital streaming platforms, the work reinforces our brand purpose and celebrates optimism, togetherness, self-care and self-expression in a world increasingly challenged by uncertainty and division. We continue to enhance our ability to create personalized offers and recommendations based on a holistic, data-led understanding of guest preferences and behaviors. This quarter, we increased our use of propensity modeling to help reactivate members, and we continue to strengthen our ability to optimize offers in e-mail and online, enabling us to maximize the return on select promotions. \n Our fifth and final strategic priority is to drive holistic cost optimization. We continue to work to create a more cost-efficient store labor model. As we discussed on the last earnings call, we made the difficult decision to eliminate 2 store leadership roles, the salon manager and the prestige manager, and created a new service manager role responsible for services, events and prestige retail. Effective November 1, this new structure creates a stronger linkage between services and products. \n This quarter, we also made another difficult decision to suspend our expansion to Canada. This was not an easy decision to make and in no way reflects a lack of confidence in the international growth opportunity for Ulta Beauty. Our teams work diligently to position us for a successful entry into Canada next year, and I'm proud of what they accomplished in such a short period of time. However, after much consideration, we determined that prioritizing our efforts to strengthen and grow our U.S. operations must be our top priority in the current operating environment. \n So these are just a few of the examples we've taken to adjust our model to reflect the challenges and opportunities we see today. We've also maintained significant limitations on corporate hiring and controllable expenses, and we continue to look across the enterprise for additional ways we can optimize our cost structure while also investing in new capabilities to support future growth. \n We've made a lot of progress in pursuit of our strategic priorities, which positions us to drive continued market share growth in the fourth quarter and beyond. \n Certainly, 2020 has been a year like no other, and it's difficult to predict exactly what the holiday season will bring this year. With Shop Safe Standards in all stores and enhanced digital shopping options, our teams are ready to meet our guests wherever and however they want to shop with us this holiday season. \n We're encouraged by the sales trends we've seen so far in the quarter, but uncertainty remains as we navigate ongoing disruption from a resurgence in the virus and continued economic uncertainty. As we execute through this holiday season, our top priorities are to reengage existing members and capture new guests with relevant content, compelling offers and unique products, and also to deliver engaging omnichannel experiences. \n Ulta Beauty is well positioned for this gift-giving season as consumers seek moments of joy, connection and self-care. Our holiday campaign is focused on helping guests see the joy this holiday season. Leveraging influencers from our Ulta Beauty Collective, we're sharing ways to practice self-care. We're celebrating community and relationships with gifting ideas, and we're highlighting the magic and generosity of the season. We kicked off the holiday season at the beginning of November with the distribution of our holiday print magazine, a reimagining of our holiday offers and multiple member appreciation events. \n Building on newness and exclusives introduced earlier this year, we've launched several new brands just in time for holiday season. In skincare, we're excited to launch Alicia Keys' new brand, Keys Soulcare, exclusively at Ulta Beauty, with a limited selection of products for the holiday season. The full assortment will be available in early 2021. In makeup, we're excited to welcome HOURGLASS, a cruelty-free luxury beauty brand to the Ulta Beauty family. And while we offer Chanel fragrances in stores, we're excited to announce we've recently launched Chanel fragrances on ulta.com for holiday gifting and beyond. \n To help our guests give the best gifts this year, we have introduced a new digital gift guide, including a 3-step quiz to inspire and help find the perfect gift. And for those who prefer to give gift cards, we've expanded our designs to include more inclusive options, and we've expanded our distribution in third-party outlets as well for added guest convenience. \n In anticipation that more guests will utilize digital channels this season, we've made curbside and BOPIS pickup easier than ever. These enhancements, combined with the investments we've made to increase our ship-to-home capacity, position us well to deliver a great omnichannel experience this holiday season. \n The operating environment continues to be dynamic and challenging. As COVID-19 prevalence increases, so are market-specific government restrictions, resulting in some reductions in operating hours, limitations on in-store capacity and, in some cases, mandated store closures. Our priority is to ensure the safety and well-being of our associates, guests and brand partners, and we'll continue to monitor the situation closely and adjust our operations as needed. \n Now before I turn the call over to Scott, I want to highlight the exciting new partnership I'm sure you've all read about. In 2021, Ulta Beauty will partner with another powerhouse retailer, Target Corporation, to disrupt the retail industry and redefine how guests experience beauty. Next fall, we'll introduce Ulta Beauty at Target, a shop-in-shop experience online and in select Target locations. With 1,000 square feet of space, Ulta Beauty at Target will offer a curated assortment of established, emerging and prestige brands across multiple categories. Our vision is to create an extension of our welcoming Ulta Beauty experience with dedicated Target team members trained to provide elevated service and offer deep product expertise with a dedicated space that inspires trial and discovery. Leaning into the power of our respective loyalty programs, we intend to reward guests with benefits across both programs for all purchases made within the shop. \n Leveraging a royalty structure, this unique collaboration brings together Ulta Beauty's category authority and brand relationships with Target's traffic-driving business model and industry-leading fulfillment services. Together, we will deliver industry-leading guest experiences across multiple touch points, provide the prestige beauty category and participating brands with an unparalleled platform for growth, drive market disruption and capture more market share. For Ulta Beauty, this partnership will build on our strength as the nation's largest beauty retailer, bring our beauty authority to life in a new way and create additional touch points for millions of loyal and new guests to discover and engage with Ulta Beauty, ultimately leading to more members as well as greater spend per member. \n Expanding our omnichannel capabilities to more deeply connect with guests is a strategic priority for us. We believe this new channel will create more opportunity to drive demand for the full beauty experience for discovery, services and play available in all Ulta Beauty stores. Importantly, we'll be able to leverage our robust CRM capabilities to engage guests who shop Ulta Beauty at Target with targeted personalized communications to highlight and enhance their total Ulta Beauty experience. \n In closing, we know guests are changing how they shop for beauty, but their engagement with the category remains strong. In fact, the role of beauty is more important now than ever. In this new normal, beauty has become more than makeup, more than product. Today, beauty is a critical link to acts of self-care and wellness. And as a well-loved brand with a diverse assortment and a wide range of price points, outstanding service offerings and knowledgeable and passionate associates, Ulta Beauty is well positioned to lead and shape how guests experience beauty in this new normal. \n And now I'll turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? Great. Thank you. Well, let me just start about the fact by reiterating we're very, very excited about the partnership. We've got a strong business model and track record to start with and feel very confident about our long-term growth prospects. And of course, we're really thrilled to unlock even more excitement for guests and growth with our Target partnership. \n Just to recap, we're thrilled. It's an amazing retailer. Brian Cornell is a fantastic CEO, and they've got a fantastic team. These are 2 very strong retail brands that are loved by consumers. And the concept of Ulta Beauty inside Target, 9 out of 10 people loved it, complementary brand DNA and team DNA. And of course, I think we both bring very different strengths to the equation from Ulta. It's our beauty authority, our best-in-class understanding of the beauty category, and for Target, certainly, the scale of Target and the millions of guests that will discover Ulta Beauty at Target is a huge benefit for us as well, as well as their omnichannel capabilities. \n As we think about bringing this forward, I think our brand -- we're early in the process with our brand negotiations and discussions. It's a lot of positive, a lot of enthusiasm. I think as a category and for brands, it's a great new platform for growth and for new customers, millions of new customers who discover brands. And so we feel very optimistic about that. Target will own the inventory. And that -- I think we've talked about that publicly. So that's what we really own the brand relationships, and that's part of the partnership that we developed from the start. \n Early on in terms of integration of technology, but certainly a very important part of this is that our -- is that the customers that participate in the Ulta Beauty at Target will be able to earn -- will be able to sign up if they're not currently members in Ultamate Rewards. If they're Ultamate Rewards members, earn loyalty points as well as Target loyalty points. And then for Ultamate Rewards, redeem those at Ulta Beauty. So we think that's a critical part as we think about the way to really create a flywheel here that works -- creates a win, win, win, I'd say, for guests and for Ulta Beauty and for Target. Yes. I would say it's not -- wasn't a surprise. I mean we made a very specific decision to pull back some level of promotion. And adjusted without the promotion, of course, the comps are even stronger. So we think it's an important step, and just continuing to refine our promotion strategies to make them be as ultimately profitable as possible, but it's not a pullback on our ability to be very competitive. So the holiday season, we started early because we needed to get people to start early in November, right, given the capacity constraints. And we've got a very robust program throughout the holiday season that we think is very competitive. And so far, as I said in the script, we feel good about the results that we're seeing. So I think it played out exactly as we had expected. Yes. Well, stepping back, again, we're pleased with the momentum that we're seeing, and the demand signals are strong. And we did feel good about how we started in November. It's a pretty simple answer to your question. We're in the middle of this unprecedented pandemic. And as you know, we just reached peak levels of hospitalizations yesterday in the U.S. So it's uncertain. \n Certainly, we know we're set up well. Our e-commerce business is performing extremely well. Our stores are doing a great job. But there's uncertainty about what will happen, I guess, I'd say as we get closer to the holiday in terms of store traffic, and that would be true for everybody. So we're just trying to meet the guests where they are, be pragmatic about this. Certainly, the news about the vaccine is positive, but there's many difficult weeks ahead. So we feel good, but we're also being cautious about the uncertainty that's going to, we think, play out in the next several weeks and few months. Sure. Well, Oliver, that's a 3-pronged question. That's impressive. And I'll -- maybe Dave and I will tag team a little bit. E-commerce traffic and comp, we -- we're very pleased with how that's going, and in fact, expected it to moderate somewhat as we open up stores. And that -- we like that. It's -- obviously, as people are coming back to stores, historically, what we've seen is omnichannel guests are our best guests because they add the e-commerce purchase on top and really spend 3x as much as somebody who is store-only. So as we open up stores, expected to see some moderation of e-commerce demand, but it's still up 90% last quarter. So we feel very good about that. \n In terms of -- I think the second part of your question was about category performance on e-com, which Dave will be happy to take, and then we can just get into Ultamate Rewards at the end of the 3-pronged question. Okay. Thank you. It's another 3-pronged question. Starting with the broader environment, I would say, we are always in a strategic planning mode, right? Looking around the corners, thinking about the future, looking at what's happening with consumer behavior, channel behavior, competitive behavior. There's no question about that. The pandemic has accelerated many things that were on the horizon anyways and certainly increased e-commerce shopping, no surprise, disruption in some physical shopping, which is coming back. And we think there's a bit of a shakeout -- maybe accelerated shakeout in terms of who the winners and losers will be long term in terms of retail format. \n So part of what we -- a big part of what we do is think about how can we meet guests in new ways and new channels, new formats to meet them where they're going to be. And that has been a strategy for us already, which is increasing our omnichannel capabilities. So whether it's BOPIS, curbside, e-commerce, shipping capacity, digital tools, but we certainly -- that's another great opportunity for us with the Target partnership is to really disrupt at a time that there is disruption happening and accelerate the opportunities for us to drive growth through accessing new customers in new omnichannel ways. \n So D2C brand, certainly, there's strength in that segment as well. We think overall, e-commerce will be bigger than it would have been, it's been pulled forward. I think we all know that. But we see that our customer in this category also still really wants the in-store shopping experience. And so that's kind of exciting for us as we are always thinking about what that store of the future and experience of the future would look like. \n And frankly, I'm very happy that we had digital tools available like GLAMlab to immediately pivot to virtual try-on for makeup and now skincare in a way that is very helpful right now. So I think we're well positioned given the shifts. I don't think the shifts are done. I think we just have to assume that we have to continue to look around corners for new shifts and opportunities. Share of wallet, do you want to take that? I'm just going to add one thing to Scott's answer, which is on top of it, the way that we thought about the Target partnership, I'd say, is really an amplifier to our business model. As Scott said, we believe we can still build out the number of stores that we've mapped out. And this yet gives us yet another point of distribution, a way to reach millions of new guests with a trial and discovery version of Ulta Beauty, right, that we amplify back to the Ulta Beauty full business model as well. And so as we map out the future of those locations, plus our store locations, working in partnership with Target to make this a win for everybody. Thank you for joining us today. I'd like to close by thanking all of the Ulta Beauty associates across our stores, distribution centers and offices for their truly relentless effort to navigate through this challenging environment while also working hard to get our stores, website and DCs ready for the holiday season. We know this holiday season will be like no other, but our team is ready and excited to help our guests see the joy of the season. And we hope that you, your colleagues and your loved ones stay safe and healthy. We look forward to speaking to all of you again in March when we report our fourth quarter and full year results. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. \n It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed. \nKiley Rawlins: Thank you, Diego. \n Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for our discussion of Ulta Beauty's results for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Hosting today's call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Dave Kimbell, President, will join us for the Q&A session. \n Before we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company's safe harbor language. The statements contained in this conference call, which are not historical facts, may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today, August 27, 2020. We have no obligation to update or revise our forward-looking statements, except as required by law, and you should not expect us to do so. \n In today's comments, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted diluted EPS, which has been presented to reflect our view of our ongoing operations by adjusting for store impairment charges and costs associated with the permanent closure of 19 stores. A reconciliation of these measures to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release, which is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ulta.com. \n We'll begin this afternoon with prepared remarks from Mary and Scott. Following our prepared comments, we'll open the call up for questions. [Operator Instructions] \n As always, the IR team will be available for any follow-up questions after the call. \n Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mary. Mary? \nMary Dillon: Thank you, Kylie, and good after afternoon, everyone. \n Let's start with an overview of where we are today. First, I will say that since the beginning of the pandemic, we've navigated through the crisis with our associate and guests at the center of every decision made. I'm really proud of how our teams have responded through this challenging period and I want to thank my leadership team and all of our Ulta Beauty associates, especially our store and distribution center associates for their agility, creativity and commitment to serving our guests and taking care of each other during this unprecedented period. \n On our last earnings call, we were in the early stages of our reopening process. During the second order, we reopened stores for retail, expanded curbside capabilities to nearly all stores and began relaunching select services, all with a thoughtful consideration for the safety of our associates and guests, balanced with our desire to reopen quickly. By the end of June, more than 90% of our stores were open for retail. And by mid-July, our reopening process was complete. \n Reflecting local regulations and guidance, the resumption of our service offerings has been on a more and more measured pace. Today, salon services are available in about 88% of stores and brow services are offered in about 85% of the fleet. We've not resumed skin or makeup services, but we're working closely with medical experts to ensure we have strong safety protocols in place when it's appropriate to resume these services. \n In this new normal, we're operating Ulta Beauty stores with new shop safe standards, limited physical capacity to accommodate social distancing and reduced operating hours. To date, we have reactivated approximately 17,000 of our furloughed associates who are able to return to work. We're committed to maintaining a safe experience for our associates and our guests. As different markets manage fluctuating COVID-19 cases, we will continue to monitor guidance from government and health authorities, as well as local transmission levels to determine if we need to modify our shopping options or revert to closures in the near term. \n Now turning to our second quarter results. For the second quarter, total net sales were $1.2 billion, comp sales declined 26.7% and GAAP diluted EPS was $0.14 per share. Excluding the impact of impairment charges and costs associated with the previously announced store closures, adjusted diluted EPS was $0.73 per share. \n Comp sales improved significantly throughout the quarter from down 37% in early May, as we began reopening stores, to down only 10% in July after most of the stores have reopened. Sales trends have continued to improve, with comps down in the mid single-digit range for the first 3 weeks of August. We're excited about the positive signals we're seeing from guests. However, we believe it will take some time to fully return to pre-COVID levels and expect demand will continue to be suppressed for the rest of the year given the likely ongoing disruptions, we'll see as we continue to live with the realities of COVID-19, whether the continuation of working from home, managing the complexities of educating our children, the ongoing need for social distancing, mask wearing and need to avoid large gatherings, or coping with near-term employment and economic uncertainties. \n Longer term, we're confident beauty will recover and thrive given the strong emotional connection consumers have with the category. We know beauty enthusiasts remain passionate in and about Beauty and Ulta Beauty. We see it through the engagement in our social channels. And while the connection with Beauty has not diminished, how consumers engage with the category is changing. Health and safety concerns have led to fewer physical shopping trips but higher average ticket. And while we've seen greater adoption of online shopping, we're really encouraged to see guests coming back to stores as well. \n From a channel perspective, e-commerce achieved record growth in the quarter, delivering sales growth in excess of 200%. Curbside pickup and buy online pickup in some store were very strong during the quarter, totaling about 20% of total e-commerce orders as guests embrace this limited touch beauty-to-go option. Despite reducing advertising and promotional activity during the quarter, we maintained our unaided awareness in the mid-50% range and increased our aided awareness to 94%, and  are focused on driving meaningful connection with our guests through relevant content and inspirational brand messaging through our digital and social channels is having an impact. Our brand health is very strong with improvements in consideration, connection, integrity and advocacy, reflecting our response to the safety and social concerns of our guests. Building our brand affinity during this tumultuous time will continue to pay dividends over the long-term. \n Now turning to our performance by category. During the second quarter, we increased our market share across most major prestige beauty categories, and we saw an improving trend in our share of mass beauty as we reopened stores. Reflecting our pace reopening process, comp sales declined across all major categories for the full quarter. As stores reopened, sales trends improved with skincare, fragrance, bath and PCA, delivering double-digit comp growth in July. \n The makeup category continues to be challenged due to shifts in consumer behavior and limited newness and innovation in the category. Even with these headwinds, some subcategories of makeup performed better than others including lashes, brow and eye. Sales and services decreased for the quarter, reflecting our measured reactivation of hair and brow services and limited capacity due to social distancing. As sales -- as salons reopened, we saw significant increases in average ticket driven by pent-up demand, particularly for color and texture services. Importantly, we're seeing some strong double-digit growth in rebooking rates as our stylists deliver a safe and enjoyable experience and proactively focused on scheduling future visits. \n The number of active members in our ultimate rewards loyalty program decreased by 4% compared to the second quarter of last year to 31.9 million members. As a reminder, active members are members who have shopped with us at least once in the last 12 months. During the quarter, we saw modest growth in our diamond and platinum membership levels, however, new member growth and retention rates were pressured due to store closures and lower levels of marketing and promotional activity. New member acquisitions through our digital channels continue to expand at healthy rates, and we continue to see previously in-store only members engage with us online with greater frequency. \n Omnichannel members are our most engaged and most productive members, historically spending 3x more per year than store-only guests. So we're pleased to see that omnichannel guests grew to 21% of our members in the second quarter, nearly double the penetration in the same quarter last year. And online-only members represented 7.5% of our members, 2.5x the penetration last year. \n With our fleet open and trends improving, we're shifting our attention to strengthening the business in this new normal and expanding our market share in the second half of the year while also setting the foundation for profitable growth in 2021 and beyond. On the last earnings call, we introduced 5 strategic priorities where we're accelerating efforts to expand our market share gains and extend our competitive advantages. I'd like to give you an update on our progress in each of these areas. \n But first, I'd like to share our perspective on racial equality, inclusion and diversity. As a priority and a value, this is not new for us. But certainly our focus has been sharpened and elevated by the recent awakening in our country to the forces of systemic racism and the important dialogue and actions that have resulted. At Ulta Beauty, diversity and inclusion have always been core values, an important part of who we are. \n In the 7 years I've been CEO, we have worked hard to represent the wonderful diversity of our country and how we show up as a brand and as a retailer in everything we do, from our marketing communications to our brand partnerships and our team. I'm proud that our Board is 18% black and more than half are women. Our executive team is 13% black and 50% women. And our Ulta Beauty team overall includes 47% people of color and 92% of our associates are women. That said, there is still much more to do. \n Today, more than ever, we're working to accelerate our leadership ship in this space. We're using our social channels to amplify black voices and beauty, and we're working to grow our roster of black-owned brands. We recognize this as a journey, but we're firmly committed to creating an inclusive experience for our guests, building a diverse representative workforce and serving as an authentic leader of diversity and inclusion in corporate America. \n Let me now recap the progress we're making on our 5 strategic priorities. Our first priority is to expand our omnichannel business to more deeply connect with guests across channels and unlock the potential of our combined physical and digital footprint. This is not a new priority for us. We've been on this journey for several years, and we've made progress. However, the pandemic has accelerated consumer engagement and desire for online and contactless shopping, and we believe our e-commerce penetration will remain meaningfully higher than pre-COVID-19 levels. \n Our customer insights and member data show many of our members prefer to transact in store where they can discover and interact with products and other beauty enthusiasts. But we also know our members engage online to research, learn and discover new products. As the pandemic has accelerated the adoption of these digital channels, we're expanding our investment in digital innovation with enhancements to the Ulta Beauty app and ulta.com to create more personalized and seamless shopping experiences. We've also continued to enhance and expand our ability to provide members with personalized recommendations based on insights from our loyalty data. \n Today through the Ulta Beauty app and on ulta.com, we provide members with unique recommendation across a variety of experiences including new products, products based on category preferences, reminders for replenishment or handpicked items, all powered by our internal AI platform. We also recently launched app-only offers and exclusive ships to drive member app engagement, and we've introduced sponsored ads to allow our brand partners to influence specific product placements. \n We continue to drive innovation to make it easier for guests to shop with Ulta Beauty. In July, we began rolling out our new service booking tool in the app and on ulta.com, which enables guests to easily book or reschedule salon, brow and other service appointments. More than 1,000 stores are actively using this new tool, and the feedback from guests and stylists has been great. We're also testing new notification processes to expedite the curbside pickup experience with the goal of having a more seamless digital experience in place for holiday. \n As we work to enhance the digital experience for guests, we've launched a guest service chatbot on ulta.com for ease, convenience and speed in resolving a basic guest questions. And we launched a new guest service customer engagement platform that allows our call center team to seamlessly respond to guest needs across a variety of contact channels and across internal platforms. We continue to invest in our fulfillment capacity to support a larger e-commerce business. \n As discussed in the last earnings call, we pulled forward the opening of our Jacksonville fast fulfillment center, and we're on track to be operational to support higher levels of e-commerce demand this holiday season. In addition, we're expanding our ship-from-store program to 100 stores to increase shipping capacity and improve speed to guests, while also leveraging store labor and inventory. \n Longer term, we'll continue to evaluate our infrastructure to determine how we can leverage our supply chain network and store footprint to support our growing omnichannel business. We're actively reviewing our network to identify opportunities to improve product flow from brand to guest while enhancing inventory productivity and guest service levels. Similarly, we're looking at our store footprint through an omnichannel lens to ensure we're strategically positioned to optimize share and profitability opportunities in every market. \n Moving on to our second strategic priority: We are reimagining guest experience and discovery. We know guests still want the opportunity to test and play, but we also recognize the increased importance of safety. As we think about supporting and discovering the new channel, we're leveraging digital tools like GLAMlab, our virtual try-on tool. Since the COVID-19 crisis began, guest engagement with the tool has increased meaningfully, with product views in the second quarter increasing more than 150% from the first quarter. In addition in the second quarter, we expanded our virtual try-on capabilities to include hair color, false lashes and the benefit brow bar. While these are newer capabilities, our guests are actively playing and engaging with these innovative tools. \n Longer term, we intend to support discovery trial in play by offering a combination of limited safe product testing with an expanded selection of single-use samples and seamless digital innovation like GLAMlab and 3-D printing. In addition, we're retooling our approach to in-store education, events and services and reimagining our fixtures and visual merchandising with a focus on safety, flexibility and cost effectiveness. \n We know human connection in the physical shopping experience are important to beauty enthusiasts, so we're rethinking the whole store experience from BOPIS and curbside to the flow and feel of the store and the role of the associate as a trusted guide. Our vision is to continue to be the most loved destination and beauty by reimagining the end-to-end guest experience at Ulta Beauty, and we'll share more about these efforts on future calls. \n Turning now to our third area of strategic focus, to drive winning category strategies and engage and delight beauty enthusiasts with a curated, relevant and unique beauty assortment. Newness and price innovation drive beauty category growth. And while we've successfully launched newness online this year, many of our planned brand launches and expansions in stores have been necessarily delayed because of store closures. With the reopening process complete, our store teams are working hard to deliver more exciting newness across all categories. \n Clean Beauty continues to be a growing area of interest among our guests. Last month, we announced the launch of Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty, an initiative intended to help guests find brands and products that reflect their personal values. Through this initiative, we will certify brands across 5 key pillars: Clean ingredients; cruelty-free; vegan; sustainable packaging; and positive impact. Our goal is to give guests access to more choices, guide them along their journey and celebrate the brands and products that are aligned with this mission. \n Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty will launch this fall in all stores online@ulta.com and on our app. In conjunction with this launch, we established sustainable packaging goals with a pledge to ensure 50% of all packaging sold will be made from recycled or bio-sourced materials or will be recyclable or refillable by 2025. As part of this effort, we'll pilot a circular shopping experience with Loop, a reusable packaging pioneer in early '21. \n COVID-19 has amplified many of the category trends we've experienced over the last year, most notably the emergence of self-care has fueled consumer interest in skin care and hair. We're accelerating our focus in these areas to drive market share growth. \n In skincare, our merchant teams have made terrific progress at expanding our assortment and improving the profitability of this important growth category. We continue to expand our brand portfolio across all price points including brands like Beekman 1802, L'Occitane and GLAMGLOW; and expanding brands like the ordinary Urban Skin Rx and e.l.f. skin care. In addition, we're highlighting a number of new skin care brands from our Sparked platform, including kinship, UpCircle and [ Gift on Routes. ] \n To support these launches, we're dedicating more space for skincare in prominent areas of the sales floor and on ulta.com. And next year, we plan to implement more holistic changes to the layout in select new stores, which allocates more prominence and easy to navigate space for skin, more intuitive adjacencies and spaces in the front of the stores for curated events. \n In addition to product newness, we're investing in digital innovation to help our guests identify and address skin care concerns with the launch of a new skin analysis tool in the Ulta Beauty app. This new skin analysis tool uses augmented reality technology and AI to assess skin care needs and offer personalized recommendations and skin care tip. \n In hair, we're expanding our focus on texture and color with the introduction of brands like Arctic Fox,  Kreyol Essence, and the expansion of brands like Pattern and Curlsmith. To support these launches, we've increased our storytelling through our marketing vehicles, elevated the visibility of our stylists via social media and relaunched our salon takeovers to increase this visibility to key brands. \n Makeup remains our largest category and we remain confident in the long-term opportunity. But changes in consumer behavior, a reduction in wearing occasions and events and the delay of new product innovation coming to market will likely continue to challenge growth in the category in the near term. Makeup is still an important, profitable category for us, and we're prioritizing newness in high-growth areas including Laura Mercier, Pixi and the launch -- the newly launched KVD Vegan Beauty, while also working to improve the space productivity of prestige color and prestige skin categories through recent planogram realignment. \n Moving on to our fourth strategic priority. We'll continue to drive innovation in the ultimate rewards program in meaningful ways, personalizing experience across by touch points and creating stronger connections with our members. We have a large differentiated loyalty program with strong member engagement. Recent store closures and disruptions will constrain member growth this year, but we believe in the long-term opportunity to expand our loyalty program. To increase membership, we're focused on converting new members, both online and in-store and reengaging with members we haven't seen in a while. \n As consumers shift increasingly to online shopping, we're seeing more nonmembers engaging with us online. Since the pandemic began, we've seen more than 2 million online transactions from nonmembers, more than 4x the number over the same period a year ago. To increase our conversion of these online guests, we're enhancing our communications on ulta.com because we can reach them through e-mail, and we're proactively communicating and promoting the value of ultimate rewards with these guests. \n To reenergize our in-store efforts, we provided additional associate training during store closures. And in stores that have reopened, we've seen in-store member acquisition rates rebound at higher levels than pre-COVID. \n With the reopening process complete, we're actively implementing reengagement strategy starting with member appreciation months in August, where we celebrated our members, welcome them back to Ulta Beauty with new bonus points offers, incentives for app downloads and exclusive app offers. In addition to communicating directly with our members, we've highlighted these offers across all of our digital channels, including ulta.com, to raise visibility and awareness of our ultimate rewards program. In addition, we're using our customer insights and predictive tools to create relevant, real-time anticipatory interactions across channels to reactivate and engage targeted membership segments and to drive greater loyalty. \n And finally, our fifth area of focus is to drive strategic, holistic cost structure optimization. As we've discussed previously, we've made progress through our efficiency for growth, or EFG efforts, to improve our merchandising effectiveness and enhance core processes across our real estate and supply chain operations. While we recognize the rapid growth of e-commerce and increasing external cost pressures combined with the need to build critical capabilities to support our growth strategies, all require us to evolve our thinking about how we operate. So in addition to the near-term actions we're taking to stabilize and recover the business at the same time, we're also looking at opportunities to optimize our cost structure. \n A few examples include store optimization. We have a strong profitable store fleet. And as with any portfolio, there's always top and bottom performers. Last month, we announced our decision to permanently close 19 stores this year to strengthen our overall portfolio. In addition, we slowed new store growth to manage operational risk this year. The role of physical retail and beauty remains crucial to the shopping experience. So while we know the role of e-commerce will continue to grow, we also continue to believe we can ultimately operate between 1,500 to 1,700 stores in the U.S. As we plan growth beyond this year, we will seek to balance the opportunity for lower rents with the opportunity to upgrade existing locations. \n Second example, promotional efficiency. We continue to refine and strengthen our promotional strategies. While we will continue to lead into strategic events to drive market share, we're moderating or eliminating less profitable or less strategic promotions. For example this summer, we eliminated our Jumbo Love leader event, replacing it with a more focused promotional event for haircare. We limited the number of participating brands, reduced the average discount rate and eliminated additional marketing coupons. These changes delivered significantly more profit despite negatively impacting the comp in the hair category, and our core business was stronger during and after the event. \n Another example of store labor model, we're implementing changes to our store management structure. This fall, we will eliminate the store manager and prestige manager roles and create a new single service manager role responsible for services, events and prestige retail. This change will create a stronger linkage between services and products and provide our guests with better customer service and expertise. It will also result in a more cost-efficient labor store model -- store-labor model. \n Now one additional comment about our labor model. In April, we furloughed 33,000 associates, and to date, we brought back about 17,000 associates. Given our reduced operating hours, we know not all of our part-time associates will be able to work the shifts available given personal needs and availability. We also want to be realistic about capacity constraints, service limitations and the likelihood that demand will take time to recover. As such, not all of our furloughed associates will likely return to Ulta Beauty this year. \n These are a few examples of steps we're taking to adjust our cost structure for the new environment. We are also looking at additional opportunities across the enterprise to optimize our cost structure while also building new capabilities to support our competitive advantage and our future growth. \n So in closing, we believe the near-term environment will continue to be dynamic, but I'm confident our team can successfully navigate the challenges. And longer term, I remain optimistic about the growth opportunity for the beauty category and for Ulta Beauty. We have a strong and differentiated business model with diversity across categories and price points and outstanding service offerings. We're actively evolving and investing to extend our brand leadership, and I remain confident that Ulta Beauty will continue to innovate and lead, capture market share and drive profitable growth as we continue to be the most admired beauty retailer. \n And now I'll turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? \nScott Settersten: Thanks, Mary, and good afternoon, everyone. \n Starting with the income statement. Sales for the second quarter declined 26.3% and total company comp declined 26.7%. Overall, sales for the quarter were in line with our internal expectations, with sales from e-commerce a little stronger and stores a little softer than expected. Average ticket increased 14.9%, while transactions declined 36.2%. \n As Mary mentioned, the beginning of the quarter was significantly pressured due to store closures, but we experienced improvement in the business as the quarter progressed. We are very pleased with the performance of our e-commerce operations, which exceeded our internal expectations and delivered a comp increase of more than 200% for the quarter, as guests continue to take advantage of our omnichannel capabilities, including curbside pickup and buy online pickup in stores. As expected, e-commerce growth slowed as stores reopened, but continued to deliver strong triple-digit growth versus last year. \n From a mix perspective, makeup was 43% of sales, down 400 basis points from last year. Skincare, Bath & Fragrance collectively increased 600 basis points to 28% of sales as the penetration of all 3 categories increased year-over-year. As a percent of sales, haircare products and styling tools was flat at 21% of sales. \n The services category was down 300 basis points to about 3% of sales as all services were suspended for much of the quarter. Gross profit margin was 26.8%, a decline of 9.6 percentage points compared to 36.4% a year ago. Many of the trends we saw in the first quarter continued in the second quarter as we transitioned through the store reopening process. \n Similar to what we saw in the first quarter, the largest driver of margin deleverage were fixed cost due to significantly lower sales. Although not readily apparent in the gross margin results this quarter, we continue to reduce overall store occupancy costs. In addition to our ongoing EFG efforts, our real estate team is capturing significant benefits from lease negotiation efforts, reflecting the market impacts of COVID-19. These ongoing efforts will help us continue to reduce our occupancy costs over the long term. \n Channel shift was also a large contributor to gross margin deleverage this quarter, albeit less pressure than we experienced in the first quarter due to increased utilization of curbside pickup and buy online pick up in-store and higher shipping volumes. As we shared last quarter, we would not anticipate this magnitude of deleverage on gross margin from channel shift to continue once we return to a more normalized operating environment. \n We also experienced deleverage in salon expenses. While we furloughed many of our stylists as stores were closed, we continue to pay salon managers and our elite stylists. In addition, as Mary mentioned, as salons have reopened, our guest capacity has been constrained by safety protocols and social distancing, resulting in lower sales. \n In addition to these factors, we increased inventory reserves by $16.5 million during the quarter, primarily to adjust for slow turning and discontinued makeup SKUs and permanently closed stores. The sales pressure we have seen in makeup over the last several quarters has been exacerbated by COVID-19, which has resulted in changes in consumer behavior as well as delays in newness and innovation within the category. As we believe these factors will persist in the short term, we decided to move aggressively through slower-turning makeup SKUs to ensure that we maintain healthy inventory levels. \n In addition, we wrote off $1.4 million of inventory related to the previously announced 19 stores that will close in the third quarter. These headwinds were partially off offset by the impact of lower promotional activity as we chose to pull back on many promotional levers during the quarter as well as benefits from our credit card program. \n SG&A expenses decreased to $271.6 million compared to $392.8 million in the second quarter of 2019. A large portion of the decrease compared to last year was due to employee retention credits of $48.2 million made available under the CARES Act. It's important to keep in mind that the employee retention credits were recorded in the second quarter, but reflect credits for payroll taxes paid in both the first and second quarters. \n The decrease in SG&A is also attributable to lower store payroll and benefits, as many store associates were furloughed for much of the quarter. We also pulled back on marketing by significantly reducing spend on print material while investing into our digital channels. Store expenses were also lower, reflecting that many stores were closed for much of the quarter. These reductions more than offset an increase in corporate overhead, reflecting the impact of investments to support growth initiatives we made in 2019 that have not yet been anniversaried, and the impact of $37.5 million of PPE and other COVID-19-related expenses incurred in the quarter. \n We recorded a charge of $40.8 million for impairment, store closure and other costs. As discussed on our first quarter earnings call, we performed reviews on long-lived asset on a quarterly basis, or when events or circumstances indicate that asset values may not be recoverable based on current expectations for future cash flows through the remaining lease term. \n This quarter, there were 26 stores where the projected cash flows are lower than the current asset balance, which based on market value of the rent relative to our contractual obligation of the property resulted in impairment charges of $20.9 million. We have a strong on and productive fleet of stores, but the dynamic operating environment may result in additional impairments as we complete our quarterly testing process. \n We also recorded an impairment charge of $19.9 million related to the previously announced permanent closure of 19 stores. Pre-opening expense was $3.9 million in the quarter, a decrease from $5 million a year ago. As a reminder, preopening expense represents primarily rent expense associated with stores we control but are not yet open. Given the disruption related to COVID-19 pandemic, we chose to not open any new stores during the quarter. We resumed new store openings in early August and are on track to open 19 stores in the second half of fiscal 2020. \n Interest expense related to the drawdown of our revolver totaled $2.6 million compared to interest income of $1.7 million a year ago. Diluted GAAP earnings per share was $0.14 compared to earnings per share of $2.76 reported for last year's second quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding charges related to impairment, store closures and other costs, was $0.73 compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.72 a year ago. \n Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.16 billion in cash and cash equivalents and remain confident that we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations now and in the future. For the quarter, total inventory grew 4% compared to the second quarter last year, primarily reflecting inventory needed to support 51 net new stores. Inventory per store decreased slightly as we have closely monitored demand as stores reopened and adjusted inventory levels accordingly. \n Turning now to the rest of 2020. We're not providing an earnings outlook at this time. However, I want to share with you how we are thinking about the rest of the year. As Mary mentioned, we're pleased with the sales performance we have seen since we reopened stores, but we believe it is prudent to take a cautious approach to the second half. Given the ongoing uncertainty, we are currently planning comps to be down in the low double digit to mid-teens range in the second half, reflecting a number of factors. \n First, we believe the near-term environment relative to containing the pandemic and related economic impacts will continue to be dynamic and challenging, and like others, we have seen volatility in our business as local markets experienced higher transmission levels of COVID-19. Two, we are pulling back on our promotional activity to drive profitability, of course we're watching the competitive environment closely and will adjust if needed. And finally, we expect store traffic this holiday season will be impacted by ongoing consumer health concerns and limited physical capacity in our stores as well as our decision to close stores for Thanksgiving. \n We anticipate our gross profit margin will deleverage in the second half but not as much as we experienced in the first half. Compared to the first half trends, we expect less deleverage from fixed-cost and in-channel mix as sales improve and e-commerce penetration normalizes to a level higher than last year but lower than what we saw in the first half when stores were closed. \n We expect to incur between $35 million and $40 million in PPE and COVID-19-related cost in the second half. As Mary discussed, we are actively taking steps across the organization to rightsize our cost structure in the new operating environment. We have limited the number of new hires and look to repurpose open positions. We delayed and reduced merit increases for our corporate, store and salon associates. We reduced marketing, travel and other controllable expenses, and moderated our pace of investments to build international capabilities. \n Looking forward, we continue to identify additional opportunities across the enterprise to optimize our cost structure, while also building new capabilities to support competitive advantage and future growth. \n In addition to cost management efforts, we continue to refine our capital spending plans. Our updated plan for the year is to invest between $180 million and $200 million, including approximately $65 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures; $90 million for supply chain and IT; and about $30 million for store maintenance and other. \n We expect to open approximately 30 new stores in 2020 and relocate 5. We are still finalizing our real estate plans for next year, but plan to open at least as many new stores in 2021 as we do in 2020. While we have slowed our new store growth opening pace in the near-term in response to COVID-19 and evolving market conditions, we remain confident in the longer-term opportunity to continue to expand our fleet. \n And now, I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Nice to see the progress. Mary, I wanted to go back to the comment you made, newness is sort of coming through nontraditional brands. So I want to go back to -- given that prestige brands are contending with the contracting mall-based distribution channel, are you seeing either broader SKU assortment from existing prestige brands? And is there an opportunity to expand beyond fragrance into some brands like Chanel or Dior? \n And then my follow-up for Scott, just a clarification, the negative low double-digit to negative mid-teens. If you're running negative single-digit now at the beginning of the third quarter, should we expect the third quarter to be stronger than the fourth quarter with all the uncertainty, or maybe the 2 of them similar in nature from a year-on-year standpoint? \nMary Dillon: So Adrienne, thank you for your questions. And maybe I'll start with the second one first because, yes, so I think right directionally, we'd say we're expecting Q3 to be somewhat better than Q4. There's a lot of uncertainty, as everybody knows, but we've got resets and launches coming in Q3. I think holiday is just something we're all a little more cautious about, given new ways that people are going to think about shopping and hours available, et cetera. So we're thinking directionally that way. \nScott Settersten: Yes. And as far as the comp sequence is concerned, I would just point maybe to looking at the promotional calendar. I know a lot of you guys track this stuff very closely. So you can schedule out what types of things we did last year over the course of the third and fourth quarters. And with the background color being we're trying to pull back on some of those things, right, we talked about in our comments. \n So overall, directionally, I would say the fourth quarter, probably slightly weaker on balance just because of the volume of sales there and some of the promotional activity that historically have taken place in the fourth quarter overall. \nMary Dillon: And Dave, would you take the first part of the question? Thank you. \nDavid Kimbell: Yes, absolutely. As it relates to your question on assortment and evolution of that, for sure, we're continuing to see disruption in the prestige marketplace. And that's something we've seen for a while, and a dynamic that we feel like we've been taking advantage of and continuing to grow share across all categories in the prestige side of the business. \n And that comes from all different types of brands. Certainly, exclusive and new brands like Kylie, some of our established and dependent brands, brands like Tart and Urban Decay and Two-faced, where we launched exclusive innovation across those brands. And on the more prestige luxury side, we have made specific advancements on that. You asked specifically about Chanel. And yes, we have a strong fragrance business but we have rolled out in the Chanel Beaute line, a small number of stores with an expanded portfolio in the makeup side. \n So we see continued opportunity across all aspects of that business to capture more share, expand our assortment and meet our guests' needs in multiple ways. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. \nLauren Frasch: This is Lauren Frasch on for Ike. Given the massive acceleration in e-commerce that we've seen in 2020, could you talk a bit about the current margin profile of e-com initiatives and any initiatives you might be taking on to improve that? \n And then as a follow-up, how does that new acceleration in online penetration play into your vision of longer-term margins for the overall business? \nScott Settersten: Yes. That's a broad question. But let me first start out by saying, just, I guess, reiterating how proud we are of our teams, the e-com digital teams, the distribution centers, our store associates and all the support people that work with them. I mean it was a spectacular outcome to deliver a complex, that 200% year-over-year expansion, just really a great outcome overall, with the thought being, that's the average for the quarter. At some point during the quarter, it was higher than that, right, higher than 200%. So very proud of the outcomes there. \n When we think about, over time, the e-commerce business, we haven't been shy about sharing the challenges we have with rate. I mean, everybody is very aware of that overall. So when we think about what we're trying to balance is rate versus dollars and speed versus cost. And we've talked to investors in recent years about the heavy investment cycle we've been in to support that part of our business. And it's really worked to our advantage now, right, in this time of crisis and change pivot point with consumers. So very happy what we've been doing in recent years to support that business, and obviously, that's going to be the trend for the future as well. So we'll continue to be focused there. \n When we think about the margin profile overall in the future, again, our historical guide was that it was going to be a 20 to 40 basis point headwind. Obviously, that's not what it is in this time and space. We're happy with the sequential improvement we saw from the first quarter, right? And we expect that to continue to moderate sequentially as we go deeper into 2020. \n And we're thinking and working collectively on other levers we can pull to try to mitigate some of that rate headwind, specifically in the e-commerce space. So things like BOPIS, we've been talking about and curbside now that we have that available to us. And again, those are higher-ticket transactions typically and better margin profile file overall. Our DCs are operating more efficiently now, so that helps offset some of that headwind. \n And then we're thinking about other parts of the business, right? Mary pointed to cost optimization. So it's not just an e-commerce question. It's more of what else are we looking at overall for the enterprise to help optimize the overall margin profile of the business, not just the e-com piece of it. \n So the entire team is focused on that, and we're doing a lot of work now framing up 2021 in how we deliver the best overall financial result there and then start marching back to healthier operating margins. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. \nSteven Forbes: Mary, maybe a question for you. You mentioned in the prepared remarks about the doubling of the omnichannel penetration rate, right, among the members. Curious if you could just discuss how the behaviors of these new omnichannel members has compared, right, to the legacy group. Are they repeating faster, shopping more categories or sort of think like potentially consolidating their spend, right, with Ulta, just given the trip consolidation pieces? We'd love to hear how you sort of think about that doubling in this quarter. \nMary Dillon: Yes. Well, it's too early to really kind of parse out the exact dynamics of their behavior, but we like where it's heading. I mean, omnichannel guests, I said this earlier, I think you probably know this, but they're most engaged guests, and they spend 3x historically as much as somebody who's shopping in-store only. So this is sort of a forced migration to more folks to get it into this. \n And so while you can debate sort of the margin impacts of e-com, we know the total value of this customer is quite significantly strong. Because most of our guests historically have started a store-only, and then started to shop online with us as we saw their spend triple, they basically were keeping pretty similar what they were buying in-store and just adding incrementally online, and the categories tended to be similar. \n So we would expect a similar behavior, except we've got a lot of folks now who started first online, right? And so -- and as we open up our stores and saw people coming back, I mean, certainly, traffic isn't where it was, but we're pleased with the pace of people coming back to the stores. I think it just kind of continues to support that premise that beauty enthusiasts like the idea of shopping, both physically and digitally. They get good things on the side both of those things. \n So I mentioned this also that as we saw a lot of new people shopping us who weren't rewards members, we also have the opportunity, now that we have their e-mail, to convert them into the loyalty program. \n So I think this is all good. I mean, the thing -- that swift increase that happened showed that: a, we were in the right place, from an e commerce perspective. I mean that e-commerce business doesn't just happen on its own. Our team was doing a great job of connecting with guests and social and digital channels to drive -- make sure we're driving awareness and staying top of mind at a time that there was a lot of things on people's minds, right? So we pivoted out of what we would have done traditionally and really focused on understanding where people were in terms of self-care and things like that. \n So it was strategically, I think, a great pivot. And we'll continue to watch it closely, but we think it's a good thing for our business. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Binetti with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nMichael Binetti: Nice job on the quarter. I guess, Mary, I found it a little, on the plan of pullback on promotions in the back half, somewhat counterintuitive. I think there's obviously an unprecedented numbers of department stores that have been closing around you, and it seems to me that, that's a really good opportunity for you guys to grab market share. You seem like the heir apparent for that share. \n I mean, are you -- would you be willing to walk away from a new customer opportunity if you do see a path to that customer as those doors start to close in the back half? And then I guess as a... \nMary Dillon: Oh, you're going to ask a 2-part question, okay. I'll call you on that. \n Let me just start with that one. Maybe, Dave, maybe you can add to it. But I'd say high level, of course, we're focused on driving market share gains, and there's opportunities out there. Having said that, all we're doing is saying, let's be as targeted and strategic as we can about how to do that. We are -- I mean, through this entire pandemic, we've been gaining share in Prestige Beauty, and while -- and so we know that we're competing well even with a somewhat less promotional kind of cadence than we would have had at that time. \n So the idea is to still compete at the peak times of things like holiday, do strategic promotions that we work really well for us, and just be more efficient with how we do this. And certainly, if we see opportunities to get more aggressive or need to, we will. I mean we're not -- we understand that there's an opportunity to convert, especially as we convert people into our loyalty program, and that becomes very sticky. \n So I think it's a good, good balanced way to think about this, but we're obviously keeping a close eye on it. Is there anything you'd add to that, Dave, that I didn't hit on there? \nDavid Kimbell: Just to reinforce, yes, this idea of just being much more strategic in our approach towards promotional optimization, but we are not pulling, eliminating all promotions. In fact, starting this Sunday will be 21 Days of Beauty, one of our biggest and most important, most strategic events of the year. And it's a good example of an event that is promotional but it has a strategic role in driving what we call mass migration, introducing our guests many times for the first time to a new prestige brand. \n So focusing on activities like that, optimizing programs like our loyalty program, personalization efforts that more pinpoint and direct target -- direct promotional activity, specifically to people that we know respond to it will -- just allow us to be more efficient with that spend, and ultimately, be more effective in the marketplace. \nMichael Binetti: Got you. If I could ask a follow-up. I mean, how best to connect that to the progression of margins as you think multiyear? I think what I heard here today that was incremental. I heard more efficient promotions, more efficient labor model. You have Jacksonville coming back online -- or coming online again, so e-com should be more efficient. I think you talked about negotiations, other EFG initiatives. \n What are the headwinds we should think about that would offset some margins as you try and orient yourselves? I guess we're looking at 2019 since we're trying to forget about 2020 for several reasons here. \nScott Settersten: Yes. So when we work -- I mean, we're in the throes of it right now, Michael, looking at 2021 operating plan and looking at new embedded cost headwinds to the business overall. So some of the things we've talked about historically around channel mix headwinds and store payroll headwinds, and some new, like PP&E cost implications and how long that might be with us. So there's a lot of ores in the water, so to speak, right now. The team is focused on it. \n Again, we're focused on overall operating margins, trying to squeeze out the best overall financial results, and we're focused on double-digit operating margins over the longer term. We still think that, that's kind of the minimum threshold for this business. We got healthy product margins. It's part of the base of our operating model, and there's still lots of levers for us to pull on, and we're just making decisions now on which ones we're going to push and pull for next year. So we'll have more to say on that as we get further along this year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. \nPaul Trussell: Good job in the quarter. Wanted to ask about stores. You mentioned that as stores reopen, online still remained very strong, up triple digits. How should we think about the productivity and the profitability of your store fleet? And while your long-term target remains intact, do you view the cadence of store openings, on an annual basis, potentially any different going forward, both in the U.S. and your approach to opening in Canada? \nScott Settersten: Well, I guess I'll start. So just the basic runway on the store buildout program, so we pulled back, we moderated this year for obvious reasons, right? So you're in that 30 new store opening range for 2020. And as we stated in our remarks, next year, the way we're looking at it now because, again, you're working on leases as years in advance, right? Working with landlord partners, lining up the right kind of space and making sure you got the right co-tenancy mix there. So these are far down the road kind of decision. \n So we feel good about at least 30 new stores for next year, and hopefully, maybe more depending on how some of the pandemic impacts other retailers in our centers across the U.S. right now. \n So we still feel good. Again, I think we mentioned in the remarks that we're looking at the optimal footprint, right? So the fleet we have now versus the fleet we would want if we had a white sheet of paper to work with, and then layering on top of that, the omnichannel sales opportunity for us for the long-term and just making sure we got the right number of stores with the right incremental -- digital sales offering as well. \n So again, looking at it today, we still feel like 1,500 to 1,700 is a good range. I mean, that's definitely something we feel comfortable with. And that we just want to make sure that it's optimal, right? So we're in the midst of that work now, and we'll have more to share on that later in the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: My question and follow-up in one is financial related. First, can you talk about the fixed cost per store? They sound like they're going lower. Are you able to quantify so we can understand leverage or even deleverage going forward? \n And then related to something that was asked earlier, Scott, the 20 to 40 basis points you mentioned in e-commerce or as penetration went up, margins got hit. Was that number inclusive of what was happening to the store-only business, and that was the overall result to the business? Or was that a channel-exclusive comment that as that mix to that channel increased, that was the pure impact to the overall business? Hopefully, that makes sense. \nScott Settersten: Yes. So we're thinking about the second part of your question, Simeon. But as far as the first question there, so fixed cost overall is something that we have been focused on for a couple of years already. So when we talk about efficiencies for growth, or EFG, real estate is a core pillar in the work that we do there. So again, thinking about the whole portfolio when we're dealing with landlords, not just individual stores and looking further out into the future on renewals and opportunities to reposition stores or renegotiate overall economics on those stores, so that's been underway now for a period of time. And so we're -- we've got an embedded process in the business, and we're feeling really good about what we're doing. \n So COVID-19 just kind of put that on steroids here in the near term. So again, you've seen other retailers talking about challenges they've had, so we're doing a lot of the same things behind the scenes. We feel like we've got a better process. We've got strong relationships. We're a retailer of choice for many landlords, the beauty category being a healthy one to add to the mix, and we drive a lot of traffic to centers. So we feel like we're in a good position to make sure we get the best overall economic deals. \n That's something that will be part of our long-term plan. We're getting benefits now, and we will continue to scale that up over the long term. \n As far as the 20 to 40 basis point headwind in our historical guidance, I mean, that's -- again, that's -- the page has been turned on that here over the last, call it, 3 to 5 months. And we've been reacting and leveraging and trying to optimize the overall impact there. I think I mentioned earlier, DC, throughput, efficiencies are getting better as the business scales up to 2 and 3x times. We are getting efficiencies out of the network overall. \n I mean, there are headwinds. You've seen the news reports here on some of the surcharges that are coming from some of the shipping operations here in the U.S. So that's another bit of a wildcard that we're balancing against. But it's a little too early to really be able to quantify what the impact on that is. I would say, in the big scheme of things, that's a smaller item compared to some of the other headwinds that we're dealing with now here in 2020. But again, we've got a great team in supply chain in that's smart and thinking about all the long-term impacts of this over the long term. \n And again, when we put it into the mosaic that we're dealing with, whether it's specific, digital, gross margin headwinds or other things in the business, PP&E costs, we're kind of putting all the PPE -- all the puzzle pieces together here to kind of try to come up with the best overall operating margin answer that we can. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Steph Wissink with Jefferies. \nStephanie Schiller Wissink: First part of the question is for Scott. You gave us some great detail for the back half on gross margin. I'm wondering if you're willing to give us some direction on SG&A. In the quarter, you had a few transitory elements. So I'm just curious if you can help us unpack -- or I think retention credits, you mentioned around $48 million. Some of your store staff are still furloughed. Maybe just help us think about the puts and takes as you think about first semester versus second. \n And then Mary and Dave, so related to that is on marketing. I think, Mary, you mentioned that your unaided awareness was stable despite pulling back pretty significantly on marketing. So I'm wondering if that's reshaping how you're thinking about marketing the Ulta brand, if you're seeing that you're better known and better selected today than you've been in the past, if that changes how much you think you need to spend on brand marketing going forward? \nMary Dillon: I'll start with that one, because I'm sure our Head of Marketing probably wasn't thrilled when I make that comment. I thought that's a logical question. \n No, I would say that I think -- well, Dave is closer to it than I am. But the notion of being able to retain and maintain great aided awareness, unaided awareness and strong brand equity means there's consistent kind of investments you have to make over time, I guess, I'd say, through the lens of things that, like media, like advertising. So we have pulled back maybe some pieces here and there because we really didn't have the ability to -- need to create that kind of demand. \n But our marketing team does an amazing job of just constantly looking at return on investment and improving what we do every day to maximize the levers that we use. So I think our marketing investment has gotten, tell me if I'm wrong, more efficient over time, and it will continue to do so. So okay, Scott? \nScott Settersten: So SG&A in the back half of the year. So you're right, the CARES Act, $48 million was a onetime kind of thing for the second quarter and won't recur in the back half of the year, but then we'll have the PP&E cost. PPE costs, the $35 million to $40 million in the back half, that's primarily SG&A costs. So a lot of it is store labor. When you think about metering people in and out of the stores and making sure we're guiding them to safe shopping practices. And then you got cleaning of the stores and related supplies to all that. \n Store payroll and benefits is the largest bucket in the SG&A line item. Directionally, you've heard us talk about some of the changes we're making here. Mary mentioned a few of those. And so lower in the second half versus last year by some of those actions that were taken. \n Marketing, lower in the second half versus last year, but not as low as it was in the first half. Some -- we pulled some expenses out of the first half and we're putting in the second half to -- we've got some great new advertising, right? Television advertising coming here, so we're really excited about. \n Overhead, then would be the last bucket, and there's going to be some growth versus last year because some of those investments we made, growth investments, are still yet to be anniversaried and will be when we get through the full year. \nMary Dillon: So thank you. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today. We're out of time. \n I just want to express my sincere appreciation to all of our Ulta Beauty associates for their efforts as we continue to navigate well through this unprecedented environment. \n I just hope that you and your colleagues and your loved ones are safe and healthy, and we look forward to speaking with all of you again in December when we report our third quarter results. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Yes, absolutely. As it relates to your question on assortment and evolution of that, for sure, we're continuing to see disruption in the prestige marketplace. And that's something we've seen for a while, and a dynamic that we feel like we've been taking advantage of and continuing to grow share across all categories in the prestige side of the business. \n And that comes from all different types of brands. Certainly, exclusive and new brands like Kylie, some of our established and dependent brands, brands like Tart and Urban Decay and Two-faced, where we launched exclusive innovation across those brands. And on the more prestige luxury side, we have made specific advancements on that. You asked specifically about Chanel. And yes, we have a strong fragrance business but we have rolled out in the Chanel Beaute line, a small number of stores with an expanded portfolio in the makeup side. \n So we see continued opportunity across all aspects of that business to capture more share, expand our assortment and meet our guests' needs in multiple ways. Just to reinforce, yes, this idea of just being much more strategic in our approach towards promotional optimization, but we are not pulling, eliminating all promotions. In fact, starting this Sunday will be 21 Days of Beauty, one of our biggest and most important, most strategic events of the year. And it's a good example of an event that is promotional but it has a strategic role in driving what we call mass migration, introducing our guests many times for the first time to a new prestige brand. \n So focusing on activities like that, optimizing programs like our loyalty program, personalization efforts that more pinpoint and direct target -- direct promotional activity, specifically to people that we know respond to it will -- just allow us to be more efficient with that spend, and ultimately, be more effective in the marketplace."

            "name": "Scott Settersten",
            "content": "Thanks, Mary, and good afternoon, everyone. \n Starting with the income statement. Sales for the second quarter declined 26.3% and total company comp declined 26.7%. Overall, sales for the quarter were in line with our internal expectations, with sales from e-commerce a little stronger and stores a little softer than expected. Average ticket increased 14.9%, while transactions declined 36.2%. \n As Mary mentioned, the beginning of the quarter was significantly pressured due to store closures, but we experienced improvement in the business as the quarter progressed. We are very pleased with the performance of our e-commerce operations, which exceeded our internal expectations and delivered a comp increase of more than 200% for the quarter, as guests continue to take advantage of our omnichannel capabilities, including curbside pickup and buy online pickup in stores. As expected, e-commerce growth slowed as stores reopened, but continued to deliver strong triple-digit growth versus last year. \n From a mix perspective, makeup was 43% of sales, down 400 basis points from last year. Skincare, Bath & Fragrance collectively increased 600 basis points to 28% of sales as the penetration of all 3 categories increased year-over-year. As a percent of sales, haircare products and styling tools was flat at 21% of sales. \n The services category was down 300 basis points to about 3% of sales as all services were suspended for much of the quarter. Gross profit margin was 26.8%, a decline of 9.6 percentage points compared to 36.4% a year ago. Many of the trends we saw in the first quarter continued in the second quarter as we transitioned through the store reopening process. \n Similar to what we saw in the first quarter, the largest driver of margin deleverage were fixed cost due to significantly lower sales. Although not readily apparent in the gross margin results this quarter, we continue to reduce overall store occupancy costs. In addition to our ongoing EFG efforts, our real estate team is capturing significant benefits from lease negotiation efforts, reflecting the market impacts of COVID-19. These ongoing efforts will help us continue to reduce our occupancy costs over the long term. \n Channel shift was also a large contributor to gross margin deleverage this quarter, albeit less pressure than we experienced in the first quarter due to increased utilization of curbside pickup and buy online pick up in-store and higher shipping volumes. As we shared last quarter, we would not anticipate this magnitude of deleverage on gross margin from channel shift to continue once we return to a more normalized operating environment. \n We also experienced deleverage in salon expenses. While we furloughed many of our stylists as stores were closed, we continue to pay salon managers and our elite stylists. In addition, as Mary mentioned, as salons have reopened, our guest capacity has been constrained by safety protocols and social distancing, resulting in lower sales. \n In addition to these factors, we increased inventory reserves by $16.5 million during the quarter, primarily to adjust for slow turning and discontinued makeup SKUs and permanently closed stores. The sales pressure we have seen in makeup over the last several quarters has been exacerbated by COVID-19, which has resulted in changes in consumer behavior as well as delays in newness and innovation within the category. As we believe these factors will persist in the short term, we decided to move aggressively through slower-turning makeup SKUs to ensure that we maintain healthy inventory levels. \n In addition, we wrote off $1.4 million of inventory related to the previously announced 19 stores that will close in the third quarter. These headwinds were partially off offset by the impact of lower promotional activity as we chose to pull back on many promotional levers during the quarter as well as benefits from our credit card program. \n SG&A expenses decreased to $271.6 million compared to $392.8 million in the second quarter of 2019. A large portion of the decrease compared to last year was due to employee retention credits of $48.2 million made available under the CARES Act. It's important to keep in mind that the employee retention credits were recorded in the second quarter, but reflect credits for payroll taxes paid in both the first and second quarters. \n The decrease in SG&A is also attributable to lower store payroll and benefits, as many store associates were furloughed for much of the quarter. We also pulled back on marketing by significantly reducing spend on print material while investing into our digital channels. Store expenses were also lower, reflecting that many stores were closed for much of the quarter. These reductions more than offset an increase in corporate overhead, reflecting the impact of investments to support growth initiatives we made in 2019 that have not yet been anniversaried, and the impact of $37.5 million of PPE and other COVID-19-related expenses incurred in the quarter. \n We recorded a charge of $40.8 million for impairment, store closure and other costs. As discussed on our first quarter earnings call, we performed reviews on long-lived asset on a quarterly basis, or when events or circumstances indicate that asset values may not be recoverable based on current expectations for future cash flows through the remaining lease term. \n This quarter, there were 26 stores where the projected cash flows are lower than the current asset balance, which based on market value of the rent relative to our contractual obligation of the property resulted in impairment charges of $20.9 million. We have a strong on and productive fleet of stores, but the dynamic operating environment may result in additional impairments as we complete our quarterly testing process. \n We also recorded an impairment charge of $19.9 million related to the previously announced permanent closure of 19 stores. Pre-opening expense was $3.9 million in the quarter, a decrease from $5 million a year ago. As a reminder, preopening expense represents primarily rent expense associated with stores we control but are not yet open. Given the disruption related to COVID-19 pandemic, we chose to not open any new stores during the quarter. We resumed new store openings in early August and are on track to open 19 stores in the second half of fiscal 2020. \n Interest expense related to the drawdown of our revolver totaled $2.6 million compared to interest income of $1.7 million a year ago. Diluted GAAP earnings per share was $0.14 compared to earnings per share of $2.76 reported for last year's second quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding charges related to impairment, store closures and other costs, was $0.73 compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.72 a year ago. \n Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.16 billion in cash and cash equivalents and remain confident that we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations now and in the future. For the quarter, total inventory grew 4% compared to the second quarter last year, primarily reflecting inventory needed to support 51 net new stores. Inventory per store decreased slightly as we have closely monitored demand as stores reopened and adjusted inventory levels accordingly. \n Turning now to the rest of 2020. We're not providing an earnings outlook at this time. However, I want to share with you how we are thinking about the rest of the year. As Mary mentioned, we're pleased with the sales performance we have seen since we reopened stores, but we believe it is prudent to take a cautious approach to the second half. Given the ongoing uncertainty, we are currently planning comps to be down in the low double digit to mid-teens range in the second half, reflecting a number of factors. \n First, we believe the near-term environment relative to containing the pandemic and related economic impacts will continue to be dynamic and challenging, and like others, we have seen volatility in our business as local markets experienced higher transmission levels of COVID-19. Two, we are pulling back on our promotional activity to drive profitability, of course we're watching the competitive environment closely and will adjust if needed. And finally, we expect store traffic this holiday season will be impacted by ongoing consumer health concerns and limited physical capacity in our stores as well as our decision to close stores for Thanksgiving. \n We anticipate our gross profit margin will deleverage in the second half but not as much as we experienced in the first half. Compared to the first half trends, we expect less deleverage from fixed-cost and in-channel mix as sales improve and e-commerce penetration normalizes to a level higher than last year but lower than what we saw in the first half when stores were closed. \n We expect to incur between $35 million and $40 million in PPE and COVID-19-related cost in the second half. As Mary discussed, we are actively taking steps across the organization to rightsize our cost structure in the new operating environment. We have limited the number of new hires and look to repurpose open positions. We delayed and reduced merit increases for our corporate, store and salon associates. We reduced marketing, travel and other controllable expenses, and moderated our pace of investments to build international capabilities. \n Looking forward, we continue to identify additional opportunities across the enterprise to optimize our cost structure, while also building new capabilities to support competitive advantage and future growth. \n In addition to cost management efforts, we continue to refine our capital spending plans. Our updated plan for the year is to invest between $180 million and $200 million, including approximately $65 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures; $90 million for supply chain and IT; and about $30 million for store maintenance and other. \n We expect to open approximately 30 new stores in 2020 and relocate 5. We are still finalizing our real estate plans for next year, but plan to open at least as many new stores in 2021 as we do in 2020. While we have slowed our new store growth opening pace in the near-term in response to COVID-19 and evolving market conditions, we remain confident in the longer-term opportunity to continue to expand our fleet. \n And now, I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. Yes. And as far as the comp sequence is concerned, I would just point maybe to looking at the promotional calendar. I know a lot of you guys track this stuff very closely. So you can schedule out what types of things we did last year over the course of the third and fourth quarters. And with the background color being we're trying to pull back on some of those things, right, we talked about in our comments. \n So overall, directionally, I would say the fourth quarter, probably slightly weaker on balance just because of the volume of sales there and some of the promotional activity that historically have taken place in the fourth quarter overall. Yes. That's a broad question. But let me first start out by saying, just, I guess, reiterating how proud we are of our teams, the e-com digital teams, the distribution centers, our store associates and all the support people that work with them. I mean it was a spectacular outcome to deliver a complex, that 200% year-over-year expansion, just really a great outcome overall, with the thought being, that's the average for the quarter. At some point during the quarter, it was higher than that, right, higher than 200%. So very proud of the outcomes there. \n When we think about, over time, the e-commerce business, we haven't been shy about sharing the challenges we have with rate. I mean, everybody is very aware of that overall. So when we think about what we're trying to balance is rate versus dollars and speed versus cost. And we've talked to investors in recent years about the heavy investment cycle we've been in to support that part of our business. And it's really worked to our advantage now, right, in this time of crisis and change pivot point with consumers. So very happy what we've been doing in recent years to support that business, and obviously, that's going to be the trend for the future as well. So we'll continue to be focused there. \n When we think about the margin profile overall in the future, again, our historical guide was that it was going to be a 20 to 40 basis point headwind. Obviously, that's not what it is in this time and space. We're happy with the sequential improvement we saw from the first quarter, right? And we expect that to continue to moderate sequentially as we go deeper into 2020. \n And we're thinking and working collectively on other levers we can pull to try to mitigate some of that rate headwind, specifically in the e-commerce space. So things like BOPIS, we've been talking about and curbside now that we have that available to us. And again, those are higher-ticket transactions typically and better margin profile file overall. Our DCs are operating more efficiently now, so that helps offset some of that headwind. \n And then we're thinking about other parts of the business, right? Mary pointed to cost optimization. So it's not just an e-commerce question. It's more of what else are we looking at overall for the enterprise to help optimize the overall margin profile of the business, not just the e-com piece of it. \n So the entire team is focused on that, and we're doing a lot of work now framing up 2021 in how we deliver the best overall financial result there and then start marching back to healthier operating margins. Yes. So when we work -- I mean, we're in the throes of it right now, Michael, looking at 2021 operating plan and looking at new embedded cost headwinds to the business overall. So some of the things we've talked about historically around channel mix headwinds and store payroll headwinds, and some new, like PP&E cost implications and how long that might be with us. So there's a lot of ores in the water, so to speak, right now. The team is focused on it. \n Again, we're focused on overall operating margins, trying to squeeze out the best overall financial results, and we're focused on double-digit operating margins over the longer term. We still think that, that's kind of the minimum threshold for this business. We got healthy product margins. It's part of the base of our operating model, and there's still lots of levers for us to pull on, and we're just making decisions now on which ones we're going to push and pull for next year. So we'll have more to say on that as we get further along this year. Well, I guess I'll start. So just the basic runway on the store buildout program, so we pulled back, we moderated this year for obvious reasons, right? So you're in that 30 new store opening range for 2020. And as we stated in our remarks, next year, the way we're looking at it now because, again, you're working on leases as years in advance, right? Working with landlord partners, lining up the right kind of space and making sure you got the right co-tenancy mix there. So these are far down the road kind of decision. \n So we feel good about at least 30 new stores for next year, and hopefully, maybe more depending on how some of the pandemic impacts other retailers in our centers across the U.S. right now. \n So we still feel good. Again, I think we mentioned in the remarks that we're looking at the optimal footprint, right? So the fleet we have now versus the fleet we would want if we had a white sheet of paper to work with, and then layering on top of that, the omnichannel sales opportunity for us for the long-term and just making sure we got the right number of stores with the right incremental -- digital sales offering as well. \n So again, looking at it today, we still feel like 1,500 to 1,700 is a good range. I mean, that's definitely something we feel comfortable with. And that we just want to make sure that it's optimal, right? So we're in the midst of that work now, and we'll have more to share on that later in the year. Yes. So we're thinking about the second part of your question, Simeon. But as far as the first question there, so fixed cost overall is something that we have been focused on for a couple of years already. So when we talk about efficiencies for growth, or EFG, real estate is a core pillar in the work that we do there. So again, thinking about the whole portfolio when we're dealing with landlords, not just individual stores and looking further out into the future on renewals and opportunities to reposition stores or renegotiate overall economics on those stores, so that's been underway now for a period of time. And so we're -- we've got an embedded process in the business, and we're feeling really good about what we're doing. \n So COVID-19 just kind of put that on steroids here in the near term. So again, you've seen other retailers talking about challenges they've had, so we're doing a lot of the same things behind the scenes. We feel like we've got a better process. We've got strong relationships. We're a retailer of choice for many landlords, the beauty category being a healthy one to add to the mix, and we drive a lot of traffic to centers. So we feel like we're in a good position to make sure we get the best overall economic deals. \n That's something that will be part of our long-term plan. We're getting benefits now, and we will continue to scale that up over the long term. \n As far as the 20 to 40 basis point headwind in our historical guidance, I mean, that's -- again, that's -- the page has been turned on that here over the last, call it, 3 to 5 months. And we've been reacting and leveraging and trying to optimize the overall impact there. I think I mentioned earlier, DC, throughput, efficiencies are getting better as the business scales up to 2 and 3x times. We are getting efficiencies out of the network overall. \n I mean, there are headwinds. You've seen the news reports here on some of the surcharges that are coming from some of the shipping operations here in the U.S. So that's another bit of a wildcard that we're balancing against. But it's a little too early to really be able to quantify what the impact on that is. I would say, in the big scheme of things, that's a smaller item compared to some of the other headwinds that we're dealing with now here in 2020. But again, we've got a great team in supply chain in that's smart and thinking about all the long-term impacts of this over the long term. \n And again, when we put it into the mosaic that we're dealing with, whether it's specific, digital, gross margin headwinds or other things in the business, PP&E costs, we're kind of putting all the PPE -- all the puzzle pieces together here to kind of try to come up with the best overall operating margin answer that we can. So SG&A in the back half of the year. So you're right, the CARES Act, $48 million was a onetime kind of thing for the second quarter and won't recur in the back half of the year, but then we'll have the PP&E cost. PPE costs, the $35 million to $40 million in the back half, that's primarily SG&A costs. So a lot of it is store labor. When you think about metering people in and out of the stores and making sure we're guiding them to safe shopping practices. And then you got cleaning of the stores and related supplies to all that. \n Store payroll and benefits is the largest bucket in the SG&A line item. Directionally, you've heard us talk about some of the changes we're making here. Mary mentioned a few of those. And so lower in the second half versus last year by some of those actions that were taken. \n Marketing, lower in the second half versus last year, but not as low as it was in the first half. Some -- we pulled some expenses out of the first half and we're putting in the second half to -- we've got some great new advertising, right? Television advertising coming here, so we're really excited about. \n Overhead, then would be the last bucket, and there's going to be some growth versus last year because some of those investments we made, growth investments, are still yet to be anniversaried and will be when we get through the full year."

            "name": "Mary Dillon",
            "content": "Thank you, Kylie, and good after afternoon, everyone. \n Let's start with an overview of where we are today. First, I will say that since the beginning of the pandemic, we've navigated through the crisis with our associate and guests at the center of every decision made. I'm really proud of how our teams have responded through this challenging period and I want to thank my leadership team and all of our Ulta Beauty associates, especially our store and distribution center associates for their agility, creativity and commitment to serving our guests and taking care of each other during this unprecedented period. \n On our last earnings call, we were in the early stages of our reopening process. During the second order, we reopened stores for retail, expanded curbside capabilities to nearly all stores and began relaunching select services, all with a thoughtful consideration for the safety of our associates and guests, balanced with our desire to reopen quickly. By the end of June, more than 90% of our stores were open for retail. And by mid-July, our reopening process was complete. \n Reflecting local regulations and guidance, the resumption of our service offerings has been on a more and more measured pace. Today, salon services are available in about 88% of stores and brow services are offered in about 85% of the fleet. We've not resumed skin or makeup services, but we're working closely with medical experts to ensure we have strong safety protocols in place when it's appropriate to resume these services. \n In this new normal, we're operating Ulta Beauty stores with new shop safe standards, limited physical capacity to accommodate social distancing and reduced operating hours. To date, we have reactivated approximately 17,000 of our furloughed associates who are able to return to work. We're committed to maintaining a safe experience for our associates and our guests. As different markets manage fluctuating COVID-19 cases, we will continue to monitor guidance from government and health authorities, as well as local transmission levels to determine if we need to modify our shopping options or revert to closures in the near term. \n Now turning to our second quarter results. For the second quarter, total net sales were $1.2 billion, comp sales declined 26.7% and GAAP diluted EPS was $0.14 per share. Excluding the impact of impairment charges and costs associated with the previously announced store closures, adjusted diluted EPS was $0.73 per share. \n Comp sales improved significantly throughout the quarter from down 37% in early May, as we began reopening stores, to down only 10% in July after most of the stores have reopened. Sales trends have continued to improve, with comps down in the mid single-digit range for the first 3 weeks of August. We're excited about the positive signals we're seeing from guests. However, we believe it will take some time to fully return to pre-COVID levels and expect demand will continue to be suppressed for the rest of the year given the likely ongoing disruptions, we'll see as we continue to live with the realities of COVID-19, whether the continuation of working from home, managing the complexities of educating our children, the ongoing need for social distancing, mask wearing and need to avoid large gatherings, or coping with near-term employment and economic uncertainties. \n Longer term, we're confident beauty will recover and thrive given the strong emotional connection consumers have with the category. We know beauty enthusiasts remain passionate in and about Beauty and Ulta Beauty. We see it through the engagement in our social channels. And while the connection with Beauty has not diminished, how consumers engage with the category is changing. Health and safety concerns have led to fewer physical shopping trips but higher average ticket. And while we've seen greater adoption of online shopping, we're really encouraged to see guests coming back to stores as well. \n From a channel perspective, e-commerce achieved record growth in the quarter, delivering sales growth in excess of 200%. Curbside pickup and buy online pickup in some store were very strong during the quarter, totaling about 20% of total e-commerce orders as guests embrace this limited touch beauty-to-go option. Despite reducing advertising and promotional activity during the quarter, we maintained our unaided awareness in the mid-50% range and increased our aided awareness to 94%, and  are focused on driving meaningful connection with our guests through relevant content and inspirational brand messaging through our digital and social channels is having an impact. Our brand health is very strong with improvements in consideration, connection, integrity and advocacy, reflecting our response to the safety and social concerns of our guests. Building our brand affinity during this tumultuous time will continue to pay dividends over the long-term. \n Now turning to our performance by category. During the second quarter, we increased our market share across most major prestige beauty categories, and we saw an improving trend in our share of mass beauty as we reopened stores. Reflecting our pace reopening process, comp sales declined across all major categories for the full quarter. As stores reopened, sales trends improved with skincare, fragrance, bath and PCA, delivering double-digit comp growth in July. \n The makeup category continues to be challenged due to shifts in consumer behavior and limited newness and innovation in the category. Even with these headwinds, some subcategories of makeup performed better than others including lashes, brow and eye. Sales and services decreased for the quarter, reflecting our measured reactivation of hair and brow services and limited capacity due to social distancing. As sales -- as salons reopened, we saw significant increases in average ticket driven by pent-up demand, particularly for color and texture services. Importantly, we're seeing some strong double-digit growth in rebooking rates as our stylists deliver a safe and enjoyable experience and proactively focused on scheduling future visits. \n The number of active members in our ultimate rewards loyalty program decreased by 4% compared to the second quarter of last year to 31.9 million members. As a reminder, active members are members who have shopped with us at least once in the last 12 months. During the quarter, we saw modest growth in our diamond and platinum membership levels, however, new member growth and retention rates were pressured due to store closures and lower levels of marketing and promotional activity. New member acquisitions through our digital channels continue to expand at healthy rates, and we continue to see previously in-store only members engage with us online with greater frequency. \n Omnichannel members are our most engaged and most productive members, historically spending 3x more per year than store-only guests. So we're pleased to see that omnichannel guests grew to 21% of our members in the second quarter, nearly double the penetration in the same quarter last year. And online-only members represented 7.5% of our members, 2.5x the penetration last year. \n With our fleet open and trends improving, we're shifting our attention to strengthening the business in this new normal and expanding our market share in the second half of the year while also setting the foundation for profitable growth in 2021 and beyond. On the last earnings call, we introduced 5 strategic priorities where we're accelerating efforts to expand our market share gains and extend our competitive advantages. I'd like to give you an update on our progress in each of these areas. \n But first, I'd like to share our perspective on racial equality, inclusion and diversity. As a priority and a value, this is not new for us. But certainly our focus has been sharpened and elevated by the recent awakening in our country to the forces of systemic racism and the important dialogue and actions that have resulted. At Ulta Beauty, diversity and inclusion have always been core values, an important part of who we are. \n In the 7 years I've been CEO, we have worked hard to represent the wonderful diversity of our country and how we show up as a brand and as a retailer in everything we do, from our marketing communications to our brand partnerships and our team. I'm proud that our Board is 18% black and more than half are women. Our executive team is 13% black and 50% women. And our Ulta Beauty team overall includes 47% people of color and 92% of our associates are women. That said, there is still much more to do. \n Today, more than ever, we're working to accelerate our leadership ship in this space. We're using our social channels to amplify black voices and beauty, and we're working to grow our roster of black-owned brands. We recognize this as a journey, but we're firmly committed to creating an inclusive experience for our guests, building a diverse representative workforce and serving as an authentic leader of diversity and inclusion in corporate America. \n Let me now recap the progress we're making on our 5 strategic priorities. Our first priority is to expand our omnichannel business to more deeply connect with guests across channels and unlock the potential of our combined physical and digital footprint. This is not a new priority for us. We've been on this journey for several years, and we've made progress. However, the pandemic has accelerated consumer engagement and desire for online and contactless shopping, and we believe our e-commerce penetration will remain meaningfully higher than pre-COVID-19 levels. \n Our customer insights and member data show many of our members prefer to transact in store where they can discover and interact with products and other beauty enthusiasts. But we also know our members engage online to research, learn and discover new products. As the pandemic has accelerated the adoption of these digital channels, we're expanding our investment in digital innovation with enhancements to the Ulta Beauty app and ulta.com to create more personalized and seamless shopping experiences. We've also continued to enhance and expand our ability to provide members with personalized recommendations based on insights from our loyalty data. \n Today through the Ulta Beauty app and on ulta.com, we provide members with unique recommendation across a variety of experiences including new products, products based on category preferences, reminders for replenishment or handpicked items, all powered by our internal AI platform. We also recently launched app-only offers and exclusive ships to drive member app engagement, and we've introduced sponsored ads to allow our brand partners to influence specific product placements. \n We continue to drive innovation to make it easier for guests to shop with Ulta Beauty. In July, we began rolling out our new service booking tool in the app and on ulta.com, which enables guests to easily book or reschedule salon, brow and other service appointments. More than 1,000 stores are actively using this new tool, and the feedback from guests and stylists has been great. We're also testing new notification processes to expedite the curbside pickup experience with the goal of having a more seamless digital experience in place for holiday. \n As we work to enhance the digital experience for guests, we've launched a guest service chatbot on ulta.com for ease, convenience and speed in resolving a basic guest questions. And we launched a new guest service customer engagement platform that allows our call center team to seamlessly respond to guest needs across a variety of contact channels and across internal platforms. We continue to invest in our fulfillment capacity to support a larger e-commerce business. \n As discussed in the last earnings call, we pulled forward the opening of our Jacksonville fast fulfillment center, and we're on track to be operational to support higher levels of e-commerce demand this holiday season. In addition, we're expanding our ship-from-store program to 100 stores to increase shipping capacity and improve speed to guests, while also leveraging store labor and inventory. \n Longer term, we'll continue to evaluate our infrastructure to determine how we can leverage our supply chain network and store footprint to support our growing omnichannel business. We're actively reviewing our network to identify opportunities to improve product flow from brand to guest while enhancing inventory productivity and guest service levels. Similarly, we're looking at our store footprint through an omnichannel lens to ensure we're strategically positioned to optimize share and profitability opportunities in every market. \n Moving on to our second strategic priority: We are reimagining guest experience and discovery. We know guests still want the opportunity to test and play, but we also recognize the increased importance of safety. As we think about supporting and discovering the new channel, we're leveraging digital tools like GLAMlab, our virtual try-on tool. Since the COVID-19 crisis began, guest engagement with the tool has increased meaningfully, with product views in the second quarter increasing more than 150% from the first quarter. In addition in the second quarter, we expanded our virtual try-on capabilities to include hair color, false lashes and the benefit brow bar. While these are newer capabilities, our guests are actively playing and engaging with these innovative tools. \n Longer term, we intend to support discovery trial in play by offering a combination of limited safe product testing with an expanded selection of single-use samples and seamless digital innovation like GLAMlab and 3-D printing. In addition, we're retooling our approach to in-store education, events and services and reimagining our fixtures and visual merchandising with a focus on safety, flexibility and cost effectiveness. \n We know human connection in the physical shopping experience are important to beauty enthusiasts, so we're rethinking the whole store experience from BOPIS and curbside to the flow and feel of the store and the role of the associate as a trusted guide. Our vision is to continue to be the most loved destination and beauty by reimagining the end-to-end guest experience at Ulta Beauty, and we'll share more about these efforts on future calls. \n Turning now to our third area of strategic focus, to drive winning category strategies and engage and delight beauty enthusiasts with a curated, relevant and unique beauty assortment. Newness and price innovation drive beauty category growth. And while we've successfully launched newness online this year, many of our planned brand launches and expansions in stores have been necessarily delayed because of store closures. With the reopening process complete, our store teams are working hard to deliver more exciting newness across all categories. \n Clean Beauty continues to be a growing area of interest among our guests. Last month, we announced the launch of Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty, an initiative intended to help guests find brands and products that reflect their personal values. Through this initiative, we will certify brands across 5 key pillars: Clean ingredients; cruelty-free; vegan; sustainable packaging; and positive impact. Our goal is to give guests access to more choices, guide them along their journey and celebrate the brands and products that are aligned with this mission. \n Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty will launch this fall in all stores online@ulta.com and on our app. In conjunction with this launch, we established sustainable packaging goals with a pledge to ensure 50% of all packaging sold will be made from recycled or bio-sourced materials or will be recyclable or refillable by 2025. As part of this effort, we'll pilot a circular shopping experience with Loop, a reusable packaging pioneer in early '21. \n COVID-19 has amplified many of the category trends we've experienced over the last year, most notably the emergence of self-care has fueled consumer interest in skin care and hair. We're accelerating our focus in these areas to drive market share growth. \n In skincare, our merchant teams have made terrific progress at expanding our assortment and improving the profitability of this important growth category. We continue to expand our brand portfolio across all price points including brands like Beekman 1802, L'Occitane and GLAMGLOW; and expanding brands like the ordinary Urban Skin Rx and e.l.f. skin care. In addition, we're highlighting a number of new skin care brands from our Sparked platform, including kinship, UpCircle and [ Gift on Routes. ] \n To support these launches, we're dedicating more space for skincare in prominent areas of the sales floor and on ulta.com. And next year, we plan to implement more holistic changes to the layout in select new stores, which allocates more prominence and easy to navigate space for skin, more intuitive adjacencies and spaces in the front of the stores for curated events. \n In addition to product newness, we're investing in digital innovation to help our guests identify and address skin care concerns with the launch of a new skin analysis tool in the Ulta Beauty app. This new skin analysis tool uses augmented reality technology and AI to assess skin care needs and offer personalized recommendations and skin care tip. \n In hair, we're expanding our focus on texture and color with the introduction of brands like Arctic Fox,  Kreyol Essence, and the expansion of brands like Pattern and Curlsmith. To support these launches, we've increased our storytelling through our marketing vehicles, elevated the visibility of our stylists via social media and relaunched our salon takeovers to increase this visibility to key brands. \n Makeup remains our largest category and we remain confident in the long-term opportunity. But changes in consumer behavior, a reduction in wearing occasions and events and the delay of new product innovation coming to market will likely continue to challenge growth in the category in the near term. Makeup is still an important, profitable category for us, and we're prioritizing newness in high-growth areas including Laura Mercier, Pixi and the launch -- the newly launched KVD Vegan Beauty, while also working to improve the space productivity of prestige color and prestige skin categories through recent planogram realignment. \n Moving on to our fourth strategic priority. We'll continue to drive innovation in the ultimate rewards program in meaningful ways, personalizing experience across by touch points and creating stronger connections with our members. We have a large differentiated loyalty program with strong member engagement. Recent store closures and disruptions will constrain member growth this year, but we believe in the long-term opportunity to expand our loyalty program. To increase membership, we're focused on converting new members, both online and in-store and reengaging with members we haven't seen in a while. \n As consumers shift increasingly to online shopping, we're seeing more nonmembers engaging with us online. Since the pandemic began, we've seen more than 2 million online transactions from nonmembers, more than 4x the number over the same period a year ago. To increase our conversion of these online guests, we're enhancing our communications on ulta.com because we can reach them through e-mail, and we're proactively communicating and promoting the value of ultimate rewards with these guests. \n To reenergize our in-store efforts, we provided additional associate training during store closures. And in stores that have reopened, we've seen in-store member acquisition rates rebound at higher levels than pre-COVID. \n With the reopening process complete, we're actively implementing reengagement strategy starting with member appreciation months in August, where we celebrated our members, welcome them back to Ulta Beauty with new bonus points offers, incentives for app downloads and exclusive app offers. In addition to communicating directly with our members, we've highlighted these offers across all of our digital channels, including ulta.com, to raise visibility and awareness of our ultimate rewards program. In addition, we're using our customer insights and predictive tools to create relevant, real-time anticipatory interactions across channels to reactivate and engage targeted membership segments and to drive greater loyalty. \n And finally, our fifth area of focus is to drive strategic, holistic cost structure optimization. As we've discussed previously, we've made progress through our efficiency for growth, or EFG efforts, to improve our merchandising effectiveness and enhance core processes across our real estate and supply chain operations. While we recognize the rapid growth of e-commerce and increasing external cost pressures combined with the need to build critical capabilities to support our growth strategies, all require us to evolve our thinking about how we operate. So in addition to the near-term actions we're taking to stabilize and recover the business at the same time, we're also looking at opportunities to optimize our cost structure. \n A few examples include store optimization. We have a strong profitable store fleet. And as with any portfolio, there's always top and bottom performers. Last month, we announced our decision to permanently close 19 stores this year to strengthen our overall portfolio. In addition, we slowed new store growth to manage operational risk this year. The role of physical retail and beauty remains crucial to the shopping experience. So while we know the role of e-commerce will continue to grow, we also continue to believe we can ultimately operate between 1,500 to 1,700 stores in the U.S. As we plan growth beyond this year, we will seek to balance the opportunity for lower rents with the opportunity to upgrade existing locations. \n Second example, promotional efficiency. We continue to refine and strengthen our promotional strategies. While we will continue to lead into strategic events to drive market share, we're moderating or eliminating less profitable or less strategic promotions. For example this summer, we eliminated our Jumbo Love leader event, replacing it with a more focused promotional event for haircare. We limited the number of participating brands, reduced the average discount rate and eliminated additional marketing coupons. These changes delivered significantly more profit despite negatively impacting the comp in the hair category, and our core business was stronger during and after the event. \n Another example of store labor model, we're implementing changes to our store management structure. This fall, we will eliminate the store manager and prestige manager roles and create a new single service manager role responsible for services, events and prestige retail. This change will create a stronger linkage between services and products and provide our guests with better customer service and expertise. It will also result in a more cost-efficient labor store model -- store-labor model. \n Now one additional comment about our labor model. In April, we furloughed 33,000 associates, and to date, we brought back about 17,000 associates. Given our reduced operating hours, we know not all of our part-time associates will be able to work the shifts available given personal needs and availability. We also want to be realistic about capacity constraints, service limitations and the likelihood that demand will take time to recover. As such, not all of our furloughed associates will likely return to Ulta Beauty this year. \n These are a few examples of steps we're taking to adjust our cost structure for the new environment. We are also looking at additional opportunities across the enterprise to optimize our cost structure while also building new capabilities to support our competitive advantage and our future growth. \n So in closing, we believe the near-term environment will continue to be dynamic, but I'm confident our team can successfully navigate the challenges. And longer term, I remain optimistic about the growth opportunity for the beauty category and for Ulta Beauty. We have a strong and differentiated business model with diversity across categories and price points and outstanding service offerings. We're actively evolving and investing to extend our brand leadership, and I remain confident that Ulta Beauty will continue to innovate and lead, capture market share and drive profitable growth as we continue to be the most admired beauty retailer. \n And now I'll turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? So Adrienne, thank you for your questions. And maybe I'll start with the second one first because, yes, so I think right directionally, we'd say we're expecting Q3 to be somewhat better than Q4. There's a lot of uncertainty, as everybody knows, but we've got resets and launches coming in Q3. I think holiday is just something we're all a little more cautious about, given new ways that people are going to think about shopping and hours available, et cetera. So we're thinking directionally that way. And Dave, would you take the first part of the question? Thank you. Yes. Well, it's too early to really kind of parse out the exact dynamics of their behavior, but we like where it's heading. I mean, omnichannel guests, I said this earlier, I think you probably know this, but they're most engaged guests, and they spend 3x historically as much as somebody who's shopping in-store only. So this is sort of a forced migration to more folks to get it into this. \n And so while you can debate sort of the margin impacts of e-com, we know the total value of this customer is quite significantly strong. Because most of our guests historically have started a store-only, and then started to shop online with us as we saw their spend triple, they basically were keeping pretty similar what they were buying in-store and just adding incrementally online, and the categories tended to be similar. \n So we would expect a similar behavior, except we've got a lot of folks now who started first online, right? And so -- and as we open up our stores and saw people coming back, I mean, certainly, traffic isn't where it was, but we're pleased with the pace of people coming back to the stores. I think it just kind of continues to support that premise that beauty enthusiasts like the idea of shopping, both physically and digitally. They get good things on the side both of those things. \n So I mentioned this also that as we saw a lot of new people shopping us who weren't rewards members, we also have the opportunity, now that we have their e-mail, to convert them into the loyalty program. \n So I think this is all good. I mean, the thing -- that swift increase that happened showed that: a, we were in the right place, from an e commerce perspective. I mean that e-commerce business doesn't just happen on its own. Our team was doing a great job of connecting with guests and social and digital channels to drive -- make sure we're driving awareness and staying top of mind at a time that there was a lot of things on people's minds, right? So we pivoted out of what we would have done traditionally and really focused on understanding where people were in terms of self-care and things like that. \n So it was strategically, I think, a great pivot. And we'll continue to watch it closely, but we think it's a good thing for our business. Oh, you're going to ask a 2-part question, okay. I'll call you on that. \n Let me just start with that one. Maybe, Dave, maybe you can add to it. But I'd say high level, of course, we're focused on driving market share gains, and there's opportunities out there. Having said that, all we're doing is saying, let's be as targeted and strategic as we can about how to do that. We are -- I mean, through this entire pandemic, we've been gaining share in Prestige Beauty, and while -- and so we know that we're competing well even with a somewhat less promotional kind of cadence than we would have had at that time. \n So the idea is to still compete at the peak times of things like holiday, do strategic promotions that we work really well for us, and just be more efficient with how we do this. And certainly, if we see opportunities to get more aggressive or need to, we will. I mean we're not -- we understand that there's an opportunity to convert, especially as we convert people into our loyalty program, and that becomes very sticky. \n So I think it's a good, good balanced way to think about this, but we're obviously keeping a close eye on it. Is there anything you'd add to that, Dave, that I didn't hit on there? I'll start with that one, because I'm sure our Head of Marketing probably wasn't thrilled when I make that comment. I thought that's a logical question. \n No, I would say that I think -- well, Dave is closer to it than I am. But the notion of being able to retain and maintain great aided awareness, unaided awareness and strong brand equity means there's consistent kind of investments you have to make over time, I guess, I'd say, through the lens of things that, like media, like advertising. So we have pulled back maybe some pieces here and there because we really didn't have the ability to -- need to create that kind of demand. \n But our marketing team does an amazing job of just constantly looking at return on investment and improving what we do every day to maximize the levers that we use. So I think our marketing investment has gotten, tell me if I'm wrong, more efficient over time, and it will continue to do so. So okay, Scott? So thank you. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today. We're out of time. \n I just want to express my sincere appreciation to all of our Ulta Beauty associates for their efforts as we continue to navigate well through this unprecedented environment. \n I just hope that you and your colleagues and your loved ones are safe and healthy, and we look forward to speaking with all of you again in December when we report our third quarter results. Thank you."

Mary? \nMary Dillon: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we talk about our first quarter results and how we're responding to the challenges created by COVID-19, I want to first take a moment to thank all who have been on the frontlines selflessly fighting the outbreak and caring for the country since this pandemic began. We're truly grateful for your dedication. I also want to thank my leadership team and all Ulta Beauty associates for their unwavering commitment, tireless efforts and continued agility as we adjust to a very dynamic and uncertain operating environment.\n As we've navigated through this crisis, our lens for every decision has been the safety and the well-being of our associates and guests. In early March, as the virus began to spread in the U.S., we quickly took steps to keep our associates and guests safe and healthy. We increased sanitation measures and cleaning frequency in stores, limited the use of testers and suspended all beauty services. As the situation escalated, we made the difficult decision to temporarily close all of our stores on March 19 and quickly shifted our focus to operating our e-commerce channel only.\n When we began 2020, we certainly did not plan to operate the digital-only business, but I'm very proud of how quickly our teams pivoted to support our e-commerce operations. Our marketing team shifted rapidly to create highly relevant digital content sensitive to the mindset of our guests at that time, a focus on connection, self-care and positivity while also acknowledging new consumer behavior such as social distancing and wearing masks.\n Anticipating an increase in demand, our digital teams quickly leveraged the existing capabilities to support higher e-commerce order volumes and manage order flow. Our supply chain teams quickly increased capacity while implementing enhanced cleaning protocols in alignment with CDC guidelines and new processes that support social distancing within the distribution centers to keep our associates safe. Our DC associates were incredible in their ability to quickly meet the increased demand in our e-commerce business, and I'm deeply grateful for their efforts.\n With more than 80% of our revenues previously generated in stores, we knew that the expected acceleration in e-commerce would not recoup all of the lost brick-and-mortar sale. So early in the COVID-19 crisis, we took several precautionary steps to protect liquidity and enhance our financial flexibility, which Scott will discuss shortly. And as we actively took steps to manage the business through the short-term uncertainty, we simultaneously began to plan the reopening of our stores and to adjust our operational plans for the rest of 2020.\n In April, it became clear our stores would remain closed longer than initially expected. After evaluating multiple options and considering the changes in unemployment insurance details incorporated into the CARES Act, we made the decision to furlough many of our store and salon associates. Our intention is to retain as much of our workforce as possible, and we look forward to when we can safely welcome associates back into all of our stores.\n To help support our associates through this crisis, we expanded the criteria for our Associate Relief Program to include those who need assistance due to a personal hardship as a result of COVID-19. This program is one way we can care for our associates. And I, along with Ulta Beauty executive team and Board of Directors, have made personal donations to the program.\n We're also providing support for those who are working hard on the frontlines to take care of all of us. Since the crisis began, Ulta Beauty has donated 450,000 gloves and 110,000 essential beauty items to several national organizations serving local communities and health care workers. And throughout this crisis, we've worked closely with our brand partners, both big and small, to ensure that we successfully navigate this crisis together. We're appreciative of their ongoing partnership and are confident our relationship remains strong and in a good position to drive growth.\n Now let's turn to our first quarter results. Reflecting the impact of store closures, total net sales for the quarter were $1.2 billion. Comp store sales declined 35.3%, and we had a net loss of $1.39 per share. While these are certainly not the results we planned, I'm proud of how our team has worked together to respond to the unexpected challenges.\n The first quarter began well with good growth in comp store sales, market share and our Ultamate Rewards loyalty program. However, the escalation of COVID-19 in mid-March, the need to temporarily close all of our physical stores and immediate changes in consumer behavior disrupted these positive trends. Within beauty, consumers focused on immediate safety and protection necessities like hand soap and antibacterial gels early in the crisis.\n As salons and other beauty service outlets closed, guests shifted to do-it-yourself beauty solutions, including hair color, nail care and hair removal products. And as quarantines became more pervasive, guests looked to self-care and wellness products like skincare treatments, hair masks and bath products, home fragrance and others to relieve stress. Although comp sales after mid-March declined in all categories as a result of our store closures, the skincare, haircare, bath and nail categories all increased as a percentage of sales.\n Early in the quarter, we saw nice market share gains across the majority of categories. The temporary closure of our stores in mid-March impacted our overall market share. But in our digital business, which operated for the full quarter, we are pleased to see strong market share gains across all of our prestige categories.\n From a channel perspective, our e-commerce channel was strong early in the quarter, with sales trends accelerating from levels we saw in the fourth quarter. As we close stores and transition to a digital-only business, sales accelerated further. Despite proactively managing demand in light of capacity constraints resulting from increased social distancing protocols in our DCs, we more than doubled our e-commerce sales this quarter.\n The number of active members in our Ultamate Rewards loyalty program increased 2% compared to the first quarter last year to 33.1 million members. While this growth was lower than planned, we are pleased to see it in spite of the store closures. Historically, stores have been the largest source of new member acquisition. And while we saw significant growth in new member acquisition through our digital channels, it was not enough to offset the impact of store closures.\n We're also very pleased to see that a large number of previously in-store-only members engage with us online for the first time. Our omnichannel guests historically have had very strong engagement with Ulta Beauty with nearly 3x the annual spend of an in-store-only guest. So we're excited about the opportunity to maintain strong engagement with these new guests that are shopping in our omnichannel format as our operations fully reopen.\n Reflecting heightened guest focus on safety and social distancing, our digital and store teams moved quickly to create and launch a new touchless curbside pickup option for our guests. And on April 23, we launched buy online, pickup curbside in 70 stores across 9 states. Guests have enthusiastically embraced this beauty-to-go option, and our store associates are doing an amazing job bringing this to life for them from flawless execution to wearing welcome back signs as they deliver purchases to guests. Since launching this option 6 weeks ago, we've seen a nice acceleration in the average number of orders per store, strong average order values and high satisfaction ratings as more guests are using this option as a fun and convenient way to come back to Ulta Beauty.\n Over the last month, various states and local authorities have begun to lift restrictions in an effort to restart their economies, allowing us to make key decisions on how and when to reopen stores. Of course, we want to open our stores as quickly and as safely as possible and have been doing so. To help us make reopening decisions, we've developed a rigorous process to evaluate the safety risk for each store.\n In addition to reviewing the legal guidance to determine we're allowed to reopen, we also assess local COVID-19 transmission trends and evaluate certain operational criteria and local guest sentiment. Once we determine that it's safe to open, we will flex based on local conditions. Some stores will reopen curbside pickup, some stores will reopen curbside and retail only, and some stores will reopen with curbside retail and a limited service offering. All doors will initially reopen with limited store hours.\n We know that health and safety will remain top concerns for all. And as we reopen stores, we're implementing new Shop Safe Standards to ensure the safety of our associates and guests. Reflecting guidance from government and health officials as well as recommendations from RILA and NRF, these standards include associate wellness checks, increased cleaning frequency and additional hand sanitizer station. All associates are wearing face coverings in store, and we're asking all guests to do the same while shopping. To promote social distancing, we've reduced the number of [ added chairs ] on the sales floor, created one-way aisles and added plexiglass shields at checkout. And we're limiting occupancy and the number of open registers.\n The opportunity to test and play is an important part of the beauty shopping experience. And while we've kept most testers on the sales floor to help guests visualize color, texture and packaging, we've made them unavailable for guest use. As an alternative, we're directing guests to our GLAMlab tool, which is our live interactive virtual experience that lives within the Ulta Beauty app. GLAMlab allows users to virtually discover and try thousands of beauty products. Since the crisis began, guest engagement with the tool has increased nearly 5x, and more than 30 million shades have been tested virtually.\n We're also making changes in our salons to promote and protect safety, including offering services by appointment only, performing associate and guests wellness checks, using protective wear, increasing cleaning between appointments and implementing social distancing between stations. Last month, we began the reopening process with the launch of curbside pickup. And on May 11, we reopened 180 stores to guests, including many with salon services. As of today, 840 Ulta Beauty stores or about 2/3 of the fleet offer curbside pickup. 333 stores or about 1/4 of the fleet are open to guests for retail, and 283 of those stores are open with salon services. While it's early in the reopening process, we've seen stronger-than-expected sales in reopened stores. And we're seeing great guest engagement with our salon services with many appointments booked several weeks out.\n To get a sense of how reopened stores are performing, when we look at the first wave of 180 stores that have reopened, omnichannel comp sales in these stores are collectively flat a year ago with some states even comping higher than last year. And sales in these initial stores continue to reflect strong penetration of e-commerce in BOPIS and curbside pickup as well as ship to home. Of course, these are early results but encouraging.\n Over the next several weeks, we'll continue to assess opportunities to reopen additional stores and expand services offerings. As we learn, we will adjust, communicate and continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of our associates and guests. Based on current available information, we expect to have a vast majority of stores reopened in some capacity by the end of June.\n I'll just add that earlier this week, I was able to hold a virtual store team visit with Kecia Steelman, our Chief Stores Officer, in markets across the country: Epping, New Hampshire; Hendersonville, Tennessee; Delray Beach, Florida; Austin, Texas, Indian Land, South Carolina; Norridge, Illinois; and Orland Park, Illinois. Some of these stores are doing curbside. Some are fully reopened for retail. But one thing was true for all, our teams are excited to be back to work and appreciate how Ulta Beauty has treated them through this difficult time.\n Now as we look beyond the reopening process, we're adjusting our plans for the rest of 2020. Consumer safety concerns, macroeconomic pressures and the risk of a resurgence in the infection rate are dynamics that might constrain demand for the rest of the year. As a result, we are reimagining holiday, rethinking our tentpole events and continuously looking for opportunities to reduce costs. We believe that demand will improve as guests regain confidence, and our goal is to maintain operational flexibility so we can adjust quickly to changes in demand while also managing inventory risk and cost as we navigate continued uncertainty.\n Longer term, I remain excited about the opportunity for Ulta Beauty. The beauty category, while not recession-proof, has fared better than many other discretionary categories in economic downturns, reflecting the relatively low price point and the emotional connection with the product. While our business is larger and more diverse than it was in the last downturn, our annual comp performance in 2008 and 2009 was positive. And we know from our proprietary research and engagement that the beauty category remains strong despite the uncertainty many guests are experiencing today.\n Within the beauty category, our diverse assortment, combined with convenient locations, strong brand awareness and our differentiated loyalty program all position us to gain market share in a challenging economic environment. Most importantly, I believe our values-based, guest and associate-centric culture and commitment to high performance will enable us to continue to expand our leadership position.\n Over the last 90 days, I have been inspired by the power of the culture we've built as our teams have worked quickly and collaboratively to care for our associates, to support our e-commerce business and to reopen our stores. Whether it's volunteering to help guest services respond to e-commerce inquiries, stepping in to help our HR service center support furloughed associates or virtually collaborating to swatch samples for GLAMlab, our associates have stepped out of their regular duties to support each other, our guests and Ulta Beauty through this truly unprecedented period.\n Despite our universal desire to return to normal, COVID-19 will likely have sustained effects on consumers, the competitive environment and how we all operate and work. We're thinking through all of these changes and what they may mean to our business model going forward, but we know we'll emerge strong. Health and safety concerns are elevated. And while we're all rethinking the risk of close contact in physical touch, consumers have adopted new shopping behaviors quickly. Many consumers have more comfort with online purchases and in-store pickup, and we expect they may continue to participate in these convenient ways of shopping.\n Businesses have been financially challenged due to closures, category shifts and liquidity pressures, and some will likely not reopen. And we will likely see additional cost pressures due to channel shifts, PPE costs and increased promotional intensity as businesses look to drive demand in a difficult economic environment. At Ulta Beauty, we are not sitting still. We intend to leverage the strengths of our operating model and investments to reimagine the future of Ulta Beauty and the new normal. Specifically, we're accelerating efforts in 5 key areas to expand our market share gains and extend our competitive advantages.\n First, over the last few years, we've invested to expand our digital and omnichannel capabilities. As a result, we've delivered double-digit growth in e-commerce sales. COVID-19 has hastened channel shift across retail, and we believe much of this new consumer behavior will be sticky. So we're focused on how we can move even faster to win in an omnichannel world. We're accelerating investments to expand our shipping capacity this year, which includes the pull forward of our Jacksonville fast fulfillment center into 2020, investments in existing buildings and the expansion of our ship-from-store capabilities.\n During this crisis, we've seen strong conversion of an in-store-only guest to omnichannel guest, with trends accelerating since the launch of curbside pickup. We know there's a strong connection in beauty between the digital and the physical, and we're looking at our brick-and-mortar footprint and how we can accelerate our efforts to build a comprehensive multichannel view of how we serve our guests.\n Second, we know that beauty enthusiasts love to shop for discovery and trial no matter the channel. And we do not expect this desire to change. We also know that concerns about personal safety and close contact caused by COVID-19 will require the beauty experience to change in the short term but will also likely spark longer-term innovation. We're reimagining the guest experience and product discovery and looking at ways technology, services and the role of our associates can evolve to create a new wow experience for our guests.\n Our Ulta Beauty app and GLAMlab tool will continue to play a big role in guest discovery and trial. Today, guests can use GLAMlab to match foundation, try on makeup and play with hair color and lashes. And in the future, guests will have even more opportunities as we accelerate the implementation of new categories and experiences.\n Third, we plan to build on the successful work we've done to expand our market share and accelerate gains even further in key categories like skincare, hair and wellness. Social distancing has resulted in many consumer behavior changes, and the crisis has exacerbated many of the category trends that we saw playing out during the crisis. While we remain confident in the long-term potential of makeup, headwinds facing the makeup category will likely persist in the short term given the impact of social distancing and masks as well as the delayed introduction of newness and innovation this year. On the flip side, many people seem to be on video calls now most of the day, so we'll watch the impact on makeup usage closely.\n Conversely, skincare has become more important as guests look to take care of their skin and relieve stress. And wellness has taken on new dimensions, extending to both physical and mental aspects as consumers increase efforts to stay healthy and look to feel better in this new environment. We intend to lean into these trends to drive further market share expansion.\n Fourth, we've built a tremendous asset in our Ultamate Rewards program. With more than 33 million active members, we build a differentiated loyalty program that provides us with valuable customer insights, and we're applying advanced analytics and artificial intelligence to leverage this data to deliver personalized targeted communications. As we focus on deepening guest engagement, we're looking at ways to drive next level loyalty and accelerate personalization to increase spend per member. This will be particularly relevant in an increasingly omnichannel marketplace as more consumers move seamlessly between channels.\n Finally, through our efficiency for growth or EFG efforts, we've made progress in improving our merchandising effectiveness and enhancing core processes across our real estate and supply chain operations. As we think about cost pressures increasing as we move forward, we're looking at how we can go beyond process optimization and develop a cost structure that will enable us to weather economic challenges while also supporting investment in capabilities and opportunities that will set us up for future success.\n So in closing, this crisis certainly has been fluid, swift and inescapable. Businesses and consumers alike are adjusting to the effects of COVID-19, and longer term, the pandemic will have a sustained impact on how we all live and work. While the economic environment will be challenged, beauty enthusiasts have a deep emotional connection with beauty that in the past has not diminished in softer economic environment. Routines will continue to shift and evolve, but beauty is a platform for self-expression, togetherness, joy and self-care, all of which are even more important for beauty enthusiasts during this time of uncertainty and change.\n At Ulta Beauty, we have a strong differentiated operating model, a brand that's known and loved and dedicated associates who are passionate about our guests and our company. And I'm confident we will emerge in this crisis well positioned to accelerate our market share gains and extend our competitive advantages.\n And now I'll turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? \nScott Settersten: Thanks, Mary, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our financial results, I'd like to reiterate Mary's comments, and on behalf of Ulta Beauty, express our immense gratitude for the first responders who are on the frontlines every day, protecting us from the spread of the coronavirus. I would also like to acknowledge all our associates, from those in the field and in our distribution centers, to our team members from our home office, who have worked tirelessly to adapt to the rapidly changing environment. I could not be more proud of the work they are doing.\n Now the situation with COVID-19 is dynamic and fluid, so our first priority has been to protect liquidity. We have taken steps to enhance our financial flexibility, including drawing down $800 million on our $1 billion revolver, suspending our stock buyback program and actively managing and prioritizing our expense structure, working capital and capital investments. We have also taken a conservative approach to inventory management, adjusting receipts to reflect current and expected sales levels.\n As a result of these efforts, we had $1.15 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We are proud of the quick actions we've taken to further enhance our financial strength and are confident that we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations now and in the future.\n Turning now to our results for the first quarter, beginning with the income statement. Q1 sales declined 32.7% as we temporarily closed all of our stores in response to the spread of COVID-19. Total company comp declined 35.3% and was composed of 3.3% average ticket growth and a 38.6% decline in transactions. As Mary mentioned, we were pleased with our performance in the beginning of the quarter, with total company comp sales trending above our plan through March 10. However, we began to experience softer traffic as consumers became concerned about the spread of the virus. And we subsequently closed all of our stores on March 19, resulting in a 62% comp decline from March 11 to the end of the quarter. Fortunately, we continue to operate our e-commerce business, which delivered a comp increase of just over 100% for the quarter.\n From a mix perspective, makeup was 49% of sales, down 400 basis points from last year. The skincare, bath and fragrance category increased 300 basis points to 24% of sales. Haircare products and styling tools increased 100 basis points to 18% of sales. The services category was down 100 basis points to about 4% of sales, reflecting the temporary suspension of all services in mid-March.\n Gross profit margin was 25.9%, a decline of 11 percentage points compared to 37% a year ago. The deleverage in the quarter was primarily due to 3 items: deleverage of fixed costs, channel mix and the deleverage of salon services. Fixed store and supply chain cost deleveraged roughly 500 basis points due to significantly lower sales related to temporary store closures.\n Channel shift contributed approximately 400 basis points of deleverage as our stores were closed for much of the quarter, and e-commerce was a much larger mix of our overall business. As we have shared previously, our e-commerce channel sales, or more aptly described, our direct-to-consumer sales channel, are less profitable than a typical retail store sale with the variance between the 2 channels being most pronounced on the gross margin line, where all of the fixed and variable costs as well as the higher promotional intensity cost of that channel sales are captured, while for retail store sales, a large portion of the variable cost, i.e., store labor, is included in our SG&A line.\n It's also important to keep in mind the unique circumstances we experienced this quarter, having all of our stores closed, which exacerbated the impact of channel shift. We would not anticipate this kind of deleverage on gross margin from channel shift once we return to a more normalized operating environment and our stores are open.\n We also experienced deleverage in salon services as we chose to continue to compensate our stylists for most of the quarter despite all stores being closed. These headwinds were partially offset by the impact of lower promotional activity within the e-commerce channel as we chose to pull back on many promotional levers to manage e-commerce demand and volumes at our distribution centers as well as benefits from our credit card program.\n SG&A expenses decreased 5.5% to $380.9 million compared to $403.1 million in the first quarter of 2019 as we pulled back on store expenses in light of temporary store closures as well as advertising by reducing our spend on print material and reallocating resources into our digital vehicles. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 32.5% compared to 23.1% last year. We experienced the most deleverage from store labor which is the largest expense within SG&A. Store labor is normally a more variable expense as we often adjust payroll hours to support sales volumes. However, payroll was more fixed during the quarter as we chose to continue to pay our store associates for most of the quarter despite temporarily closing all stores. We also experienced deleverage on corporate overhead, reflecting the impact of investments we made in 2019 that have not yet been anniversaried.\n This quarter, we recorded an impairment charge of $19.5 million related to the expected future performance of a small number of stores. To provide some context, we perform reviews on long-lived assets on a quarterly basis or when events or circumstances indicate that asset values may not be recoverable. The basis of our evaluation is whether future cash flows through the lease term are greater than or equal to the asset balance on the balance sheet.\n There are a small number of stores that were underperforming before we made the decision to temporarily close stores. These stores were further impacted due to COVID 19. The projected cash flows for these stores are lower than the current asset balance, and based on the market value of the rent relative to our contractual obligation of the property, resulted in impairment charges. We have a strong and productive fleet of stores. But going forward, we will continue to test for impairments and adjust accordingly.\n Preopening expense was $4.6 million in the quarter, an increase from $4.2 million a year ago as we assumed control of the property at Herald Square in New York City. The rent for this property is higher than our other stores and will be recognized in the preopening line until the store opens.\n Interest expense related to the drawdown of our revolver totaled $1.3 million compared to interest income of $2 million a year ago. Diluted GAAP loss per share was $1.39 compared to earnings per share of $3.26 reported for last year's first quarter.\n Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. For the quarter, total inventory grew 7.2%, primarily reflecting inventory needed to support 68 net new stores. Inventory per store increased 1.5%, reflecting the impact of store closures for most of the quarter. We will continue to closely monitor demand as we begin to reopen stores, and we'll adjust our inventory levels accordingly. Fortunately, we have not experienced any significant issues accessing inventory.\n Reflecting our proactive efforts to manage liquidity, capital expenditures for the quarter were $45.1 million compared to $71.8 million last year.\n Turning now to the rest of 2020. We continue to operate in an uncertain environment and have been working under a variety of assumptions to help us make the best financial decisions we can for our people and our business. However, the situation is dynamic, and it remains difficult to model sales and expenses with certainty. Therefore, we are not providing earnings guidance at this time.\n We are able to provide an update for a few other key model inputs. We have reduced our CapEx plan by about $100 million in response to the current operating environment. Our updated plan for the year is to invest between $200 million and $210 million, including approximately $92 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $80 million for supply chain and IT and about $33 million for store maintenance and other.\n We now expect to open approximately 30 to 40 new stores in 2020 and relocate 3 stores. We have chosen to defer some store openings into 2021 and are currently evaluating what the right pace of new store openings should be next year. We have a strong and profitable fleet of stores. And given the new operating environment, we plan to accelerate efforts to strengthen our fleet through relocations, negotiations with our landlord partners and potential store closures. And while we believe there's opportunity to open more stores and reach new guests, we are also evaluating our long-term store target in the U.S. given the acceleration we are experiencing with our e-commerce business.\n In closing, although we lack some near-term visibility, we remain confident in our differentiated business model and our ability to adapt to our guests' changing preferences. We believe that we have the financial strength to manage through the crisis and are making decisions to ensure Ulta Beauty is even better positioned for the long term.\n And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan. \nMegan Alexander: This is actually Megan Alexander on for Chris. I was just hoping you could elaborate a bit on what you're seeing in the stores that you've reopened just in terms of pent-up demand and whether you're seeing any change in the category trends as you reopen them. And then can you just talk about any detail on what you're seeing in terms of guests using curbside versus actually coming into the stores? \nMary Dillon: Yes. Well, we're really, I guess, I'd say pretty pleased about what we're seeing so far in terms of consumer behavior, right? So, so far, our trends are stronger than we expected in terms of sales. It varies by market. We actually have some markets comping positively, others negative. The e-commerce trends have been very encouraging. And they're remaining resilient and really accelerating because of the adoption of curbside, which we can talk more about.\n But -- and I mentioned this in the script, but the first 180 stores, if you look at their performance so far, total sales are flat to a year ago. But of course, the mix is quite different, right, between stores, curbside, BOPIS, ship to home. So I'd say overall, guest reaction has been quite positive. But we're cautious. I mean it's early, early, and we're taking a conservative stance as we look forward.\n The opportunity for us that we see as well is that I've mentioned that we've got a lot of guests who've never shopped online with us before who are now converting to omnichannel guests, I guess, out of necessity. And that guest, the more that we can keep them shopping in multiple channels, they're very valuable to us. They spend almost 3x as much historically as somebody who shops in stores only.\n So the other thing I'd add is that -- and maybe David can comment on category mix. But on the curbside, so far, we invented that. I'm very proud of the team for really kind of putting that together pretty quickly. We hadn't been doing curbside. We even had launched BOPIS in the fourth quarter of last year, and that was going really well, but we hadn't needed to do curbside yet. So I really congratulate our team for getting that stood up. And we've been pleased to see the guest reaction.\n So I'd say what they like about it is the speed, the ease and the overall enthusiasm of our first staff. We're following all the kind of social distancing and safety guidelines that you can imagine. But we feel that so far, that could be -- again as people try that, they find it as another convenient way to shop at Ulta Beauty, and we expect that will continue to be part of the mix as we go forward.\n Is there anything else you want to add on categories, Dave? \nDavid Kimbell: Well, the only thing I'd add on categories, and you mentioned it in the script, Mary, is that categories that were strong with us when we were operating on an e-commerce only continue to be strong. And those are kind of self-care categories and wellness categories, skincare, haircare, bath, other categories that have been -- that have accelerated throughout this crisis. But interestingly, as curbside became available, we also saw a pickup on makeup as more guests were engaging in that category. And as we've made -- as we've evolved through the initial phases of this crisis, we've seen makeup make a bit of a strengthening move as curbside has given our guests more options to engage in the category. \nOperator: And our next question is from Mark Altschwager from Robert W. Baird. \nMark Altschwager: Maybe following up on the category trend. Wondering if you can just give us some broader perspective on the beauty cycle and how you're planning for mix shifts in the near term just with the economic backdrop. Are you seeing or expecting to see a shift to mass and masstige from prestige? Sounds like skincare has remained robust. However, as the industry starts to cycle the sharp decline in color cosmetics as we go through the mid- to late part of the year, just wondering if there's any reason to think there's a light at the end of the tunnel there from a product innovation and growth standpoint. \nMary Dillon: Thank you, Mark. I'd say in some ways going into this, what we've seen is at the beginning of the cycle, of course, the types of things that people bought were quite different than what we've seen in the past, right, things like hand sanitizers and soaps. And then we saw folks get more engaged in things that I would call like self-care, do-it-yourself at home. So haircare, nails, that kind of thing, and then kind of more into things that are a bit more self-indulgent or self-care, like whether it's mask, skincare, fragrances for the bath, that kind of stuff. So it's just kind of interesting to see that cycle of -- the psyche of consumer behavior.\n As an aside, one thing I'll say is I feel like our team did a great job from a social media and just marketing perspective to really meet our guests where they were and kind of talk to them about those things. Engagement was really high.\n The core category trends, I'd say, were similar -- roughly similar to what we saw coming into this year, which is acceleration in skin care. We've talked about that. We see that as a big future trend. The intersection of wellness and beauty together is going to be important. I think with makeup, as Dave said, I think it's an interesting early fact that on curbside, we saw some tick-up in makeup. You can debate the 2 sides of it. But I mean anecdotally, I'd say that folks who maybe were doing -- working from home before on phone calls are now all of a sudden all working from home on video calls, and everybody is on video call.\n So will that have -- will that help bring the light at the end of the tunnel as you said? Well, certainly, makeup is still large and it's very -- customers are very engaged in that category. But it has been in a lower cycle. You're right. So could this help it? I think we'll see. We don't know. Right now, I wouldn't say that's happening in the large scale. \nOperator: And our next question is from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: I wondered if we could drill down a little bit more around your commentary about the promotional environment, maybe what you saw during the quarter and what you expect for the rest of the year. And just one housekeeping question about the impairment charge. Just how many underperforming stores account for that? And do you plan to reopen them? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. So I'll start with the promotion and maybe Scott will take the impairment piece here. Yes, promotion activity, of course, like everything else, was disrupted through the quarter. Our strategy pre-COVID has been on really a multiyear journey to try to reduce broad-based promotions and be more strategic and focused on driving consumer engagement demand across all of our activities, the brands that we're bringing in, our loyalty program and other aspects of ways to engage with our guests.\n We are -- we do -- as we enter into -- as the category shifts into a reopening of stores and a recovery phase coming out of the March and April elements of this crisis, we are anticipating, as a category, potentially higher promotional activity. But our focus will continue to be on driving the more strategic aspects of our business. We have a very strong loyalty program. We've built, we think, very strong personalization capabilities, and in fact, in some ways, have strengthened aspects of that over the first part of this year. And we intend to leverage that to be more personalized and direct with our communications and aspects.\n We will lean into the most strategic aspects of our promotional -- annual promotional programs, 21 Days of Beauty, holiday, skin and hair events through the year. But of course, we're going to be nimble in the category. And while we know we're not anticipating leading a massive increase in promotional activity, we won't cede share either. So we have tools to respond appropriately in the category, and we'll do so and make sure that we're remaining competitive in the marketplace. \nScott Settersten: To the impairment question, so the short answer is it was around 20 stores in total that were impacted by this. And really, it was 10 stores that drove the majority of the impairment charge during the quarter. The slightly longer answer is, Kate, this is going to be a multi-chapter story here. So again, the fact that we took impairment charges on these stores doesn't mean we're closing these stores necessarily. These might still be productive stores, but they just might be in higher rent kind of geographies in the United States, for example.\n And as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we are taking a clean sheet look at the whole store fleet. So there are instances that we're looking at where maybe we're not in the best center or we're not in the best position in the center. And now with the disruption we're seeing in the retail environment, there are centers that we've been blocked from historically that we might get more aggressive on and might have opportunities now in the future. So there could be other potential store closures come somewhere down the road here. Hopefully, we can get all that house kept in fiscal 2020, but it's not all a one -- a first quarter kind of story. \nOperator: Our next question is from Kelly Crago from Citi Research. \nKelly Crago: I was just wondering what your exposure is to some of the department stores that have announced store closings. Have you done any work there? And should we expect any sort of promotional cadence geared towards gaining that customer? And then my second question is just around vendor support given you're expecting a more promotional environment. How are those conversations going with your vendors? \nMary Dillon: Yes. I would say we'll step back and start with department stores. I mean just in general, we have a very sort of broad competitive environment, and we think about that because we do -- we bring all things together in beauty. And as a result, we compete with everybody from department stores to mass retailers to other specialty retailers, e-commerce only. So it actually is a pretty broad competitive environment that we're in. And we pay close attention to everything that's happening and see opportunities and risks throughout.\n So I mean that's how we've always been as a business, is to play our offense and to make sure that we get the share gains that we believe we can get in certain categories. I mentioned already in the digital channel, we gained share in every category in prestige, and we were only digital in this past quarter. So we feel good about that. So that's something we pay close attention to.\n And the second part of the question was... \nDavid Kimbell: And vendor support. \nMary Dillon: Vendor support. Yes. I mean listen, there was -- it's a very important time for us to be very close with our vendor partners, big and small. And so I feel very good about -- we have worked -- Dave leads the merchandising team. And you can add more to those if you like. But I mean we -- I'm proud about the fact that I feel that we've been very transparent with our vendors, share the dilemmas with them, share the opportunities with them as we move forward. And our relationships are very strong. So I certainly -- I feel very confident about our ability to come out of this stronger than ever and continue to win in the marketplace, and I think our vendor relationships will be a key part of that. \nOperator: And our next question is from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI. \nOmar Saad: Really impressive digital e-commerce growth in the quarter. Obviously, you guys have one of the best-in-class loyalty programs out there. I'm curious what you're seeing in that part of the business as stores reopen or what your expectations are for that kind of run rate you've been at. Do you expect that to moderate? Are you seeing that moderate? Is that demand shifting to more buy online pickup or curbside? What are your expectations for that strong digital growth in the intermediate term as we go from a fully locked down state to one that's more open than the store network thing? \nDavid Kimbell: Well, yes. We've been really, of course, pleased with the e-commerce performance. It's a part of our business that we've been building and investing in and bringing innovation into for many years, and it certainly has been paying off for us through this crisis. Obviously, as stores opened, it will decrease in its total penetration of our business from being 100% e-commerce only. But what we do believe going forward is that we've moved quite a few of our guests that have previously only shopped us in-store, has shopped us online. And that's a really positive thing.\n We know -- and Mary mentioned some of these statistics, but we know that guests shop -- that shop us in an omnichannel way are among our very best guests. They shop us more frequently, both in store and online. They spend more with us. So we anticipate, from a member standpoint, this could have some really positive lasting impacts of introducing more guests to the total Ulta Beauty experience.\n Penetration going forward, we think there will be a step change in penetration because of this introduction of omnichannel capabilities to more guests. We think it will be a higher run rate going forward, but time will tell exactly where that settles, but certainly higher than it was and a faster acceleration and adoption of our e-commerce capabilities.\n And curbside has been a big win for us. Mary said how quickly we adopted that. We were happy to have BOPIS in the fourth quarter as we rolled that out last year. To be able to shift and pivot that to curbside capability was really meaningful. And as stores have reopened, guests -- some guests are still opting for curbside capability. And so we'll sustain that going forward, and we think it adds actually a nice -- essentially a third option for our guests. If they don't want to actually come into a store at this time, they can still get their products that same day and have a great experience from Ulta. So that will be a big role going forward. \nOperator: And our next question is from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. \nDana Telsey: I hope everyone's and healthy. As you think about the store reopening platform and the service model in there, how do you think of employee staffing and the percentage of payroll that you'll need going forward versus what you would need in the past? And then secondly, on products and just color cosmetics, is the state of innovation or the pace of innovation that you've seen with your vendors, does that accelerate or decrease going forward? And does the closures of department stores give you more runway to gain market share even as we go through this year? \nMary Dillon: Dana, it's Mary. Thank you. On the services staffing, I can't tell you the precise ratio there in terms of where we're going to land. But I will tell you that I actually feel that -- first of all, we're taking a conservative and cautious approach to thinking about services. But I also believe we've got a great opportunity because there's -- we have a national platform, a national brand. And there's still pretty, I'd say, low usage of our services relative to the total retail percent of business that we have. So we feel like there's a great opportunity. We also know, as you know, like our omnichannel guests, that people who use our services are spending almost 3x as much as somebody who's not.\n So it's a great opportunity. We are starting slowly, and we're starting with hair only and I would say with even stricter protocols of health and safety than just the reopening of the store, which is very strict. So there's additional steps in place to make sure that that's done safely and well. But frankly, as we started to open up, we have about 280 stores that have salons open right now. And there's a lot of pent-up demand for cut and color, as you can imagine.\n So we have many, many stores that are well booked right now. We are stylists. We kept them on the payroll largely so that we knew we could come back strong. We wanted them to stay with Ulta Beauty and help us capitalize on this opportunity over time. So over time, we'll go from hair to brows again and things like that, but we're just going to take it a step at a time.\n Your question about cosmetic innovation, maybe, Dave, if you want to add to that? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. I'd say on innovation in total, certainly, this has disrupted the brand's view on innovation and timing. And in some cases, new launches have been shifted back or readjusted. But what I'd say is 2 parts to that. We felt really good about newness across categories, makeup included, skincare, haircare, fragrance coming in pre-COVID and this crisis, several new brands across the portfolio like Laura Mercier, Thrive, Pixi on the makeup side; Kiehl's, Ordinary, Indie Lee, Urban Skin Rx in skincare; Pattern, Arctic Fox, [ Wella ] in hair. Several new brands that had launched recently, in either very late Q4 or early in Q1, actually performed well throughout this crisis and will be well positioned coming out. So we still have that pipeline of newness.\n And then as we look forward over the rest of the year across categories, again, including makeup, as I said, brands, in some cases, have adjusted their plans. But as we start to get more confidence in consumer reaction and store opening timing, we will rebuild our innovation introduction time line in the second half of the year and are optimistic. We know our guests continue to be attracted to newness, both new brands and new products from existing brands. So we see a strong pipeline coming through as we work our way through this, through the 2020 and then certainly into 2021. \nOperator: Our next question is from Simeon Siegel from BMO Capital. \nSimeon Siegel: I hope you're all doing okay. Mary or Dave, how are you thinking about marketing? I know -- it's obviously the easiest lever to pull back on, but just given the balance sheet strength, is there an opportunity to actually go on the offensive there and take some share? And then just, Scott, how are you thinking about inventory savings for the rest of the year? And maybe any color you might be able to give on gross margin. \nMary Dillon: It sounds like a party at your house, Simeon. I love it. \nSimeon Siegel: Everyone is so excited for this call. \nMary Dillon: I'm so happy they're excited. That's awesome. \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. So I'm glad you asked about marketing. Yes, we have -- we really see a great opportunity to continue to build the Ulta Beauty brand and really in a lot of ways, accelerate out of this crisis behind the strength of our brand and everything that our brand represents: the assortment, the loyalty program, the guest experience, the strength of our associates and what they bring to our guests every day.\n Coming into this crisis, the work that we've done to establish our brand and to create a brand platform that is rooted in this idea of possibilities, of joy, of connection to others and the power of beauty, I think, actually that served us really well. And I'm really proud of the work that the marketing team did to shift the strategy to be really responsive and reflective of the new mindset and to more focus more on these connections and self-care and just bringing joy and happiness, which is ultimately what beauty is about through all channels.\n To your point, we believe that we have an opportunity to continue to invest in marketing because we're so, we believe, well positioned to, again, have a leadership voice in that. So while we pull back on certain elements, most notably print tactics because they have long lead time, we can't be as responsive to store dynamics or shifting consumer dynamics. We've pulled back on those elements. We've invested more in digital and social aspects.\n And as we look out over the rest of the year, it is not our plan to make a significant reduction in total marketing spend as much as shift our focus to both a messaging that's relevant and compelling as well as the tools that will be -- both give us some flexibility to adjust whatever comes ahead of us through the rest of the year. But it was also very relevant in the time frame. \nScott Settersten: And it sounds like you had 3 questions, Simeon, right, 3 questions there. But they're important. So we'll answer the 2 -- the final 2 here. So on inventory, I would just say we're being careful. I think the team did a great job, again, high sense of urgency to monitor receipts and order flow during the depths of the crisis. And now we're back. Again, it's back to vendor relationships. Dave and Mary both alluded to being transparent and clear and having good connections with vendors because we're making orders. We're making orders, and we have been now for a number of weeks.\n So the sales throughput there on our e-commerce business, we need to stay in stock. And when the store is opening back up, we want to make sure that the newness, that the back half is flowing out there to make sure we're ready for guests to come back and visit with us.\n On the gross margin, I think we laid out the first quarter pretty thoroughly in the prepared comments. As we think about the rest of the year, I mean, that's part of the primary reason why we don't feel comfortable providing guidance for the rest of 2020 at this point. But again, you can go back through the script comments. I mean we've given you a laundry list of things that we're thinking about, right, and with the key being opportunistic as we go through the rest of 2020, whether it be pulling forward the Jacksonville fast fulfillment center here in the back half of the year, provide more capacity.\n We talked about rethinking the cadence of some of our major events and the promotional elements that go with some of those things, reassessing our assortment strategies, maybe being opportunistic about moving out of some of the slow movers, so to speak, as we go through the back half of the year. We talked about store footprint optimization. So there could be some impairment charges or closure charges that come along with those kinds of things. But again, it's not going to be a first quarter only story. This will evolve as we go through the rest of the year, and we'll be as transparent with you as we can along the way. \nMary Dillon: So let me just close this. I really want to thank everybody for joining us today. I know at the end of every quarter, I thank my team. But honestly, in my 7 years as CEO of this company, in fact, in my career, I don't think I've ever seen a group of people leading with more resilience and heart and collaboration and more drive to win. So I want to thank the Ulta Beauty team, and we hope that you stay healthy and safe, and we look forward to speaking with all of you again in August when we report our second quarter results. Thank you. \nOperator: And this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Kimbell",
            "content": "Well, the only thing I'd add on categories, and you mentioned it in the script, Mary, is that categories that were strong with us when we were operating on an e-commerce only continue to be strong. And those are kind of self-care categories and wellness categories, skincare, haircare, bath, other categories that have been -- that have accelerated throughout this crisis. But interestingly, as curbside became available, we also saw a pickup on makeup as more guests were engaging in that category. And as we've made -- as we've evolved through the initial phases of this crisis, we've seen makeup make a bit of a strengthening move as curbside has given our guests more options to engage in the category. Yes. So I'll start with the promotion and maybe Scott will take the impairment piece here. Yes, promotion activity, of course, like everything else, was disrupted through the quarter. Our strategy pre-COVID has been on really a multiyear journey to try to reduce broad-based promotions and be more strategic and focused on driving consumer engagement demand across all of our activities, the brands that we're bringing in, our loyalty program and other aspects of ways to engage with our guests.\n We are -- we do -- as we enter into -- as the category shifts into a reopening of stores and a recovery phase coming out of the March and April elements of this crisis, we are anticipating, as a category, potentially higher promotional activity. But our focus will continue to be on driving the more strategic aspects of our business. We have a very strong loyalty program. We've built, we think, very strong personalization capabilities, and in fact, in some ways, have strengthened aspects of that over the first part of this year. And we intend to leverage that to be more personalized and direct with our communications and aspects.\n We will lean into the most strategic aspects of our promotional -- annual promotional programs, 21 Days of Beauty, holiday, skin and hair events through the year. But of course, we're going to be nimble in the category. And while we know we're not anticipating leading a massive increase in promotional activity, we won't cede share either. So we have tools to respond appropriately in the category, and we'll do so and make sure that we're remaining competitive in the marketplace. And vendor support. Well, yes. We've been really, of course, pleased with the e-commerce performance. It's a part of our business that we've been building and investing in and bringing innovation into for many years, and it certainly has been paying off for us through this crisis. Obviously, as stores opened, it will decrease in its total penetration of our business from being 100% e-commerce only. But what we do believe going forward is that we've moved quite a few of our guests that have previously only shopped us in-store, has shopped us online. And that's a really positive thing.\n We know -- and Mary mentioned some of these statistics, but we know that guests shop -- that shop us in an omnichannel way are among our very best guests. They shop us more frequently, both in store and online. They spend more with us. So we anticipate, from a member standpoint, this could have some really positive lasting impacts of introducing more guests to the total Ulta Beauty experience.\n Penetration going forward, we think there will be a step change in penetration because of this introduction of omnichannel capabilities to more guests. We think it will be a higher run rate going forward, but time will tell exactly where that settles, but certainly higher than it was and a faster acceleration and adoption of our e-commerce capabilities.\n And curbside has been a big win for us. Mary said how quickly we adopted that. We were happy to have BOPIS in the fourth quarter as we rolled that out last year. To be able to shift and pivot that to curbside capability was really meaningful. And as stores have reopened, guests -- some guests are still opting for curbside capability. And so we'll sustain that going forward, and we think it adds actually a nice -- essentially a third option for our guests. If they don't want to actually come into a store at this time, they can still get their products that same day and have a great experience from Ulta. So that will be a big role going forward. Yes. I'd say on innovation in total, certainly, this has disrupted the brand's view on innovation and timing. And in some cases, new launches have been shifted back or readjusted. But what I'd say is 2 parts to that. We felt really good about newness across categories, makeup included, skincare, haircare, fragrance coming in pre-COVID and this crisis, several new brands across the portfolio like Laura Mercier, Thrive, Pixi on the makeup side; Kiehl's, Ordinary, Indie Lee, Urban Skin Rx in skincare; Pattern, Arctic Fox, [ Wella ] in hair. Several new brands that had launched recently, in either very late Q4 or early in Q1, actually performed well throughout this crisis and will be well positioned coming out. So we still have that pipeline of newness.\n And then as we look forward over the rest of the year across categories, again, including makeup, as I said, brands, in some cases, have adjusted their plans. But as we start to get more confidence in consumer reaction and store opening timing, we will rebuild our innovation introduction time line in the second half of the year and are optimistic. We know our guests continue to be attracted to newness, both new brands and new products from existing brands. So we see a strong pipeline coming through as we work our way through this, through the 2020 and then certainly into 2021. Yes. So I'm glad you asked about marketing. Yes, we have -- we really see a great opportunity to continue to build the Ulta Beauty brand and really in a lot of ways, accelerate out of this crisis behind the strength of our brand and everything that our brand represents: the assortment, the loyalty program, the guest experience, the strength of our associates and what they bring to our guests every day.\n Coming into this crisis, the work that we've done to establish our brand and to create a brand platform that is rooted in this idea of possibilities, of joy, of connection to others and the power of beauty, I think, actually that served us really well. And I'm really proud of the work that the marketing team did to shift the strategy to be really responsive and reflective of the new mindset and to more focus more on these connections and self-care and just bringing joy and happiness, which is ultimately what beauty is about through all channels.\n To your point, we believe that we have an opportunity to continue to invest in marketing because we're so, we believe, well positioned to, again, have a leadership voice in that. So while we pull back on certain elements, most notably print tactics because they have long lead time, we can't be as responsive to store dynamics or shifting consumer dynamics. We've pulled back on those elements. We've invested more in digital and social aspects.\n And as we look out over the rest of the year, it is not our plan to make a significant reduction in total marketing spend as much as shift our focus to both a messaging that's relevant and compelling as well as the tools that will be -- both give us some flexibility to adjust whatever comes ahead of us through the rest of the year. But it was also very relevant in the time frame."

            "name": "Scott Settersten",
            "content": "Thanks, Mary, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our financial results, I'd like to reiterate Mary's comments, and on behalf of Ulta Beauty, express our immense gratitude for the first responders who are on the frontlines every day, protecting us from the spread of the coronavirus. I would also like to acknowledge all our associates, from those in the field and in our distribution centers, to our team members from our home office, who have worked tirelessly to adapt to the rapidly changing environment. I could not be more proud of the work they are doing.\n Now the situation with COVID-19 is dynamic and fluid, so our first priority has been to protect liquidity. We have taken steps to enhance our financial flexibility, including drawing down $800 million on our $1 billion revolver, suspending our stock buyback program and actively managing and prioritizing our expense structure, working capital and capital investments. We have also taken a conservative approach to inventory management, adjusting receipts to reflect current and expected sales levels.\n As a result of these efforts, we had $1.15 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We are proud of the quick actions we've taken to further enhance our financial strength and are confident that we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations now and in the future.\n Turning now to our results for the first quarter, beginning with the income statement. Q1 sales declined 32.7% as we temporarily closed all of our stores in response to the spread of COVID-19. Total company comp declined 35.3% and was composed of 3.3% average ticket growth and a 38.6% decline in transactions. As Mary mentioned, we were pleased with our performance in the beginning of the quarter, with total company comp sales trending above our plan through March 10. However, we began to experience softer traffic as consumers became concerned about the spread of the virus. And we subsequently closed all of our stores on March 19, resulting in a 62% comp decline from March 11 to the end of the quarter. Fortunately, we continue to operate our e-commerce business, which delivered a comp increase of just over 100% for the quarter.\n From a mix perspective, makeup was 49% of sales, down 400 basis points from last year. The skincare, bath and fragrance category increased 300 basis points to 24% of sales. Haircare products and styling tools increased 100 basis points to 18% of sales. The services category was down 100 basis points to about 4% of sales, reflecting the temporary suspension of all services in mid-March.\n Gross profit margin was 25.9%, a decline of 11 percentage points compared to 37% a year ago. The deleverage in the quarter was primarily due to 3 items: deleverage of fixed costs, channel mix and the deleverage of salon services. Fixed store and supply chain cost deleveraged roughly 500 basis points due to significantly lower sales related to temporary store closures.\n Channel shift contributed approximately 400 basis points of deleverage as our stores were closed for much of the quarter, and e-commerce was a much larger mix of our overall business. As we have shared previously, our e-commerce channel sales, or more aptly described, our direct-to-consumer sales channel, are less profitable than a typical retail store sale with the variance between the 2 channels being most pronounced on the gross margin line, where all of the fixed and variable costs as well as the higher promotional intensity cost of that channel sales are captured, while for retail store sales, a large portion of the variable cost, i.e., store labor, is included in our SG&A line.\n It's also important to keep in mind the unique circumstances we experienced this quarter, having all of our stores closed, which exacerbated the impact of channel shift. We would not anticipate this kind of deleverage on gross margin from channel shift once we return to a more normalized operating environment and our stores are open.\n We also experienced deleverage in salon services as we chose to continue to compensate our stylists for most of the quarter despite all stores being closed. These headwinds were partially offset by the impact of lower promotional activity within the e-commerce channel as we chose to pull back on many promotional levers to manage e-commerce demand and volumes at our distribution centers as well as benefits from our credit card program.\n SG&A expenses decreased 5.5% to $380.9 million compared to $403.1 million in the first quarter of 2019 as we pulled back on store expenses in light of temporary store closures as well as advertising by reducing our spend on print material and reallocating resources into our digital vehicles. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 32.5% compared to 23.1% last year. We experienced the most deleverage from store labor which is the largest expense within SG&A. Store labor is normally a more variable expense as we often adjust payroll hours to support sales volumes. However, payroll was more fixed during the quarter as we chose to continue to pay our store associates for most of the quarter despite temporarily closing all stores. We also experienced deleverage on corporate overhead, reflecting the impact of investments we made in 2019 that have not yet been anniversaried.\n This quarter, we recorded an impairment charge of $19.5 million related to the expected future performance of a small number of stores. To provide some context, we perform reviews on long-lived assets on a quarterly basis or when events or circumstances indicate that asset values may not be recoverable. The basis of our evaluation is whether future cash flows through the lease term are greater than or equal to the asset balance on the balance sheet.\n There are a small number of stores that were underperforming before we made the decision to temporarily close stores. These stores were further impacted due to COVID 19. The projected cash flows for these stores are lower than the current asset balance, and based on the market value of the rent relative to our contractual obligation of the property, resulted in impairment charges. We have a strong and productive fleet of stores. But going forward, we will continue to test for impairments and adjust accordingly.\n Preopening expense was $4.6 million in the quarter, an increase from $4.2 million a year ago as we assumed control of the property at Herald Square in New York City. The rent for this property is higher than our other stores and will be recognized in the preopening line until the store opens.\n Interest expense related to the drawdown of our revolver totaled $1.3 million compared to interest income of $2 million a year ago. Diluted GAAP loss per share was $1.39 compared to earnings per share of $3.26 reported for last year's first quarter.\n Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. For the quarter, total inventory grew 7.2%, primarily reflecting inventory needed to support 68 net new stores. Inventory per store increased 1.5%, reflecting the impact of store closures for most of the quarter. We will continue to closely monitor demand as we begin to reopen stores, and we'll adjust our inventory levels accordingly. Fortunately, we have not experienced any significant issues accessing inventory.\n Reflecting our proactive efforts to manage liquidity, capital expenditures for the quarter were $45.1 million compared to $71.8 million last year.\n Turning now to the rest of 2020. We continue to operate in an uncertain environment and have been working under a variety of assumptions to help us make the best financial decisions we can for our people and our business. However, the situation is dynamic, and it remains difficult to model sales and expenses with certainty. Therefore, we are not providing earnings guidance at this time.\n We are able to provide an update for a few other key model inputs. We have reduced our CapEx plan by about $100 million in response to the current operating environment. Our updated plan for the year is to invest between $200 million and $210 million, including approximately $92 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $80 million for supply chain and IT and about $33 million for store maintenance and other.\n We now expect to open approximately 30 to 40 new stores in 2020 and relocate 3 stores. We have chosen to defer some store openings into 2021 and are currently evaluating what the right pace of new store openings should be next year. We have a strong and profitable fleet of stores. And given the new operating environment, we plan to accelerate efforts to strengthen our fleet through relocations, negotiations with our landlord partners and potential store closures. And while we believe there's opportunity to open more stores and reach new guests, we are also evaluating our long-term store target in the U.S. given the acceleration we are experiencing with our e-commerce business.\n In closing, although we lack some near-term visibility, we remain confident in our differentiated business model and our ability to adapt to our guests' changing preferences. We believe that we have the financial strength to manage through the crisis and are making decisions to ensure Ulta Beauty is even better positioned for the long term.\n And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. To the impairment question, so the short answer is it was around 20 stores in total that were impacted by this. And really, it was 10 stores that drove the majority of the impairment charge during the quarter. The slightly longer answer is, Kate, this is going to be a multi-chapter story here. So again, the fact that we took impairment charges on these stores doesn't mean we're closing these stores necessarily. These might still be productive stores, but they just might be in higher rent kind of geographies in the United States, for example.\n And as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we are taking a clean sheet look at the whole store fleet. So there are instances that we're looking at where maybe we're not in the best center or we're not in the best position in the center. And now with the disruption we're seeing in the retail environment, there are centers that we've been blocked from historically that we might get more aggressive on and might have opportunities now in the future. So there could be other potential store closures come somewhere down the road here. Hopefully, we can get all that house kept in fiscal 2020, but it's not all a one -- a first quarter kind of story. And it sounds like you had 3 questions, Simeon, right, 3 questions there. But they're important. So we'll answer the 2 -- the final 2 here. So on inventory, I would just say we're being careful. I think the team did a great job, again, high sense of urgency to monitor receipts and order flow during the depths of the crisis. And now we're back. Again, it's back to vendor relationships. Dave and Mary both alluded to being transparent and clear and having good connections with vendors because we're making orders. We're making orders, and we have been now for a number of weeks.\n So the sales throughput there on our e-commerce business, we need to stay in stock. And when the store is opening back up, we want to make sure that the newness, that the back half is flowing out there to make sure we're ready for guests to come back and visit with us.\n On the gross margin, I think we laid out the first quarter pretty thoroughly in the prepared comments. As we think about the rest of the year, I mean, that's part of the primary reason why we don't feel comfortable providing guidance for the rest of 2020 at this point. But again, you can go back through the script comments. I mean we've given you a laundry list of things that we're thinking about, right, and with the key being opportunistic as we go through the rest of 2020, whether it be pulling forward the Jacksonville fast fulfillment center here in the back half of the year, provide more capacity.\n We talked about rethinking the cadence of some of our major events and the promotional elements that go with some of those things, reassessing our assortment strategies, maybe being opportunistic about moving out of some of the slow movers, so to speak, as we go through the back half of the year. We talked about store footprint optimization. So there could be some impairment charges or closure charges that come along with those kinds of things. But again, it's not going to be a first quarter only story. This will evolve as we go through the rest of the year, and we'll be as transparent with you as we can along the way."

            "name": "Mary Dillon",
            "content": "Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we talk about our first quarter results and how we're responding to the challenges created by COVID-19, I want to first take a moment to thank all who have been on the frontlines selflessly fighting the outbreak and caring for the country since this pandemic began. We're truly grateful for your dedication. I also want to thank my leadership team and all Ulta Beauty associates for their unwavering commitment, tireless efforts and continued agility as we adjust to a very dynamic and uncertain operating environment.\n As we've navigated through this crisis, our lens for every decision has been the safety and the well-being of our associates and guests. In early March, as the virus began to spread in the U.S., we quickly took steps to keep our associates and guests safe and healthy. We increased sanitation measures and cleaning frequency in stores, limited the use of testers and suspended all beauty services. As the situation escalated, we made the difficult decision to temporarily close all of our stores on March 19 and quickly shifted our focus to operating our e-commerce channel only.\n When we began 2020, we certainly did not plan to operate the digital-only business, but I'm very proud of how quickly our teams pivoted to support our e-commerce operations. Our marketing team shifted rapidly to create highly relevant digital content sensitive to the mindset of our guests at that time, a focus on connection, self-care and positivity while also acknowledging new consumer behavior such as social distancing and wearing masks.\n Anticipating an increase in demand, our digital teams quickly leveraged the existing capabilities to support higher e-commerce order volumes and manage order flow. Our supply chain teams quickly increased capacity while implementing enhanced cleaning protocols in alignment with CDC guidelines and new processes that support social distancing within the distribution centers to keep our associates safe. Our DC associates were incredible in their ability to quickly meet the increased demand in our e-commerce business, and I'm deeply grateful for their efforts.\n With more than 80% of our revenues previously generated in stores, we knew that the expected acceleration in e-commerce would not recoup all of the lost brick-and-mortar sale. So early in the COVID-19 crisis, we took several precautionary steps to protect liquidity and enhance our financial flexibility, which Scott will discuss shortly. And as we actively took steps to manage the business through the short-term uncertainty, we simultaneously began to plan the reopening of our stores and to adjust our operational plans for the rest of 2020.\n In April, it became clear our stores would remain closed longer than initially expected. After evaluating multiple options and considering the changes in unemployment insurance details incorporated into the CARES Act, we made the decision to furlough many of our store and salon associates. Our intention is to retain as much of our workforce as possible, and we look forward to when we can safely welcome associates back into all of our stores.\n To help support our associates through this crisis, we expanded the criteria for our Associate Relief Program to include those who need assistance due to a personal hardship as a result of COVID-19. This program is one way we can care for our associates. And I, along with Ulta Beauty executive team and Board of Directors, have made personal donations to the program.\n We're also providing support for those who are working hard on the frontlines to take care of all of us. Since the crisis began, Ulta Beauty has donated 450,000 gloves and 110,000 essential beauty items to several national organizations serving local communities and health care workers. And throughout this crisis, we've worked closely with our brand partners, both big and small, to ensure that we successfully navigate this crisis together. We're appreciative of their ongoing partnership and are confident our relationship remains strong and in a good position to drive growth.\n Now let's turn to our first quarter results. Reflecting the impact of store closures, total net sales for the quarter were $1.2 billion. Comp store sales declined 35.3%, and we had a net loss of $1.39 per share. While these are certainly not the results we planned, I'm proud of how our team has worked together to respond to the unexpected challenges.\n The first quarter began well with good growth in comp store sales, market share and our Ultamate Rewards loyalty program. However, the escalation of COVID-19 in mid-March, the need to temporarily close all of our physical stores and immediate changes in consumer behavior disrupted these positive trends. Within beauty, consumers focused on immediate safety and protection necessities like hand soap and antibacterial gels early in the crisis.\n As salons and other beauty service outlets closed, guests shifted to do-it-yourself beauty solutions, including hair color, nail care and hair removal products. And as quarantines became more pervasive, guests looked to self-care and wellness products like skincare treatments, hair masks and bath products, home fragrance and others to relieve stress. Although comp sales after mid-March declined in all categories as a result of our store closures, the skincare, haircare, bath and nail categories all increased as a percentage of sales.\n Early in the quarter, we saw nice market share gains across the majority of categories. The temporary closure of our stores in mid-March impacted our overall market share. But in our digital business, which operated for the full quarter, we are pleased to see strong market share gains across all of our prestige categories.\n From a channel perspective, our e-commerce channel was strong early in the quarter, with sales trends accelerating from levels we saw in the fourth quarter. As we close stores and transition to a digital-only business, sales accelerated further. Despite proactively managing demand in light of capacity constraints resulting from increased social distancing protocols in our DCs, we more than doubled our e-commerce sales this quarter.\n The number of active members in our Ultamate Rewards loyalty program increased 2% compared to the first quarter last year to 33.1 million members. While this growth was lower than planned, we are pleased to see it in spite of the store closures. Historically, stores have been the largest source of new member acquisition. And while we saw significant growth in new member acquisition through our digital channels, it was not enough to offset the impact of store closures.\n We're also very pleased to see that a large number of previously in-store-only members engage with us online for the first time. Our omnichannel guests historically have had very strong engagement with Ulta Beauty with nearly 3x the annual spend of an in-store-only guest. So we're excited about the opportunity to maintain strong engagement with these new guests that are shopping in our omnichannel format as our operations fully reopen.\n Reflecting heightened guest focus on safety and social distancing, our digital and store teams moved quickly to create and launch a new touchless curbside pickup option for our guests. And on April 23, we launched buy online, pickup curbside in 70 stores across 9 states. Guests have enthusiastically embraced this beauty-to-go option, and our store associates are doing an amazing job bringing this to life for them from flawless execution to wearing welcome back signs as they deliver purchases to guests. Since launching this option 6 weeks ago, we've seen a nice acceleration in the average number of orders per store, strong average order values and high satisfaction ratings as more guests are using this option as a fun and convenient way to come back to Ulta Beauty.\n Over the last month, various states and local authorities have begun to lift restrictions in an effort to restart their economies, allowing us to make key decisions on how and when to reopen stores. Of course, we want to open our stores as quickly and as safely as possible and have been doing so. To help us make reopening decisions, we've developed a rigorous process to evaluate the safety risk for each store.\n In addition to reviewing the legal guidance to determine we're allowed to reopen, we also assess local COVID-19 transmission trends and evaluate certain operational criteria and local guest sentiment. Once we determine that it's safe to open, we will flex based on local conditions. Some stores will reopen curbside pickup, some stores will reopen curbside and retail only, and some stores will reopen with curbside retail and a limited service offering. All doors will initially reopen with limited store hours.\n We know that health and safety will remain top concerns for all. And as we reopen stores, we're implementing new Shop Safe Standards to ensure the safety of our associates and guests. Reflecting guidance from government and health officials as well as recommendations from RILA and NRF, these standards include associate wellness checks, increased cleaning frequency and additional hand sanitizer station. All associates are wearing face coverings in store, and we're asking all guests to do the same while shopping. To promote social distancing, we've reduced the number of [ added chairs ] on the sales floor, created one-way aisles and added plexiglass shields at checkout. And we're limiting occupancy and the number of open registers.\n The opportunity to test and play is an important part of the beauty shopping experience. And while we've kept most testers on the sales floor to help guests visualize color, texture and packaging, we've made them unavailable for guest use. As an alternative, we're directing guests to our GLAMlab tool, which is our live interactive virtual experience that lives within the Ulta Beauty app. GLAMlab allows users to virtually discover and try thousands of beauty products. Since the crisis began, guest engagement with the tool has increased nearly 5x, and more than 30 million shades have been tested virtually.\n We're also making changes in our salons to promote and protect safety, including offering services by appointment only, performing associate and guests wellness checks, using protective wear, increasing cleaning between appointments and implementing social distancing between stations. Last month, we began the reopening process with the launch of curbside pickup. And on May 11, we reopened 180 stores to guests, including many with salon services. As of today, 840 Ulta Beauty stores or about 2/3 of the fleet offer curbside pickup. 333 stores or about 1/4 of the fleet are open to guests for retail, and 283 of those stores are open with salon services. While it's early in the reopening process, we've seen stronger-than-expected sales in reopened stores. And we're seeing great guest engagement with our salon services with many appointments booked several weeks out.\n To get a sense of how reopened stores are performing, when we look at the first wave of 180 stores that have reopened, omnichannel comp sales in these stores are collectively flat a year ago with some states even comping higher than last year. And sales in these initial stores continue to reflect strong penetration of e-commerce in BOPIS and curbside pickup as well as ship to home. Of course, these are early results but encouraging.\n Over the next several weeks, we'll continue to assess opportunities to reopen additional stores and expand services offerings. As we learn, we will adjust, communicate and continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of our associates and guests. Based on current available information, we expect to have a vast majority of stores reopened in some capacity by the end of June.\n I'll just add that earlier this week, I was able to hold a virtual store team visit with Kecia Steelman, our Chief Stores Officer, in markets across the country: Epping, New Hampshire; Hendersonville, Tennessee; Delray Beach, Florida; Austin, Texas, Indian Land, South Carolina; Norridge, Illinois; and Orland Park, Illinois. Some of these stores are doing curbside. Some are fully reopened for retail. But one thing was true for all, our teams are excited to be back to work and appreciate how Ulta Beauty has treated them through this difficult time.\n Now as we look beyond the reopening process, we're adjusting our plans for the rest of 2020. Consumer safety concerns, macroeconomic pressures and the risk of a resurgence in the infection rate are dynamics that might constrain demand for the rest of the year. As a result, we are reimagining holiday, rethinking our tentpole events and continuously looking for opportunities to reduce costs. We believe that demand will improve as guests regain confidence, and our goal is to maintain operational flexibility so we can adjust quickly to changes in demand while also managing inventory risk and cost as we navigate continued uncertainty.\n Longer term, I remain excited about the opportunity for Ulta Beauty. The beauty category, while not recession-proof, has fared better than many other discretionary categories in economic downturns, reflecting the relatively low price point and the emotional connection with the product. While our business is larger and more diverse than it was in the last downturn, our annual comp performance in 2008 and 2009 was positive. And we know from our proprietary research and engagement that the beauty category remains strong despite the uncertainty many guests are experiencing today.\n Within the beauty category, our diverse assortment, combined with convenient locations, strong brand awareness and our differentiated loyalty program all position us to gain market share in a challenging economic environment. Most importantly, I believe our values-based, guest and associate-centric culture and commitment to high performance will enable us to continue to expand our leadership position.\n Over the last 90 days, I have been inspired by the power of the culture we've built as our teams have worked quickly and collaboratively to care for our associates, to support our e-commerce business and to reopen our stores. Whether it's volunteering to help guest services respond to e-commerce inquiries, stepping in to help our HR service center support furloughed associates or virtually collaborating to swatch samples for GLAMlab, our associates have stepped out of their regular duties to support each other, our guests and Ulta Beauty through this truly unprecedented period.\n Despite our universal desire to return to normal, COVID-19 will likely have sustained effects on consumers, the competitive environment and how we all operate and work. We're thinking through all of these changes and what they may mean to our business model going forward, but we know we'll emerge strong. Health and safety concerns are elevated. And while we're all rethinking the risk of close contact in physical touch, consumers have adopted new shopping behaviors quickly. Many consumers have more comfort with online purchases and in-store pickup, and we expect they may continue to participate in these convenient ways of shopping.\n Businesses have been financially challenged due to closures, category shifts and liquidity pressures, and some will likely not reopen. And we will likely see additional cost pressures due to channel shifts, PPE costs and increased promotional intensity as businesses look to drive demand in a difficult economic environment. At Ulta Beauty, we are not sitting still. We intend to leverage the strengths of our operating model and investments to reimagine the future of Ulta Beauty and the new normal. Specifically, we're accelerating efforts in 5 key areas to expand our market share gains and extend our competitive advantages.\n First, over the last few years, we've invested to expand our digital and omnichannel capabilities. As a result, we've delivered double-digit growth in e-commerce sales. COVID-19 has hastened channel shift across retail, and we believe much of this new consumer behavior will be sticky. So we're focused on how we can move even faster to win in an omnichannel world. We're accelerating investments to expand our shipping capacity this year, which includes the pull forward of our Jacksonville fast fulfillment center into 2020, investments in existing buildings and the expansion of our ship-from-store capabilities.\n During this crisis, we've seen strong conversion of an in-store-only guest to omnichannel guest, with trends accelerating since the launch of curbside pickup. We know there's a strong connection in beauty between the digital and the physical, and we're looking at our brick-and-mortar footprint and how we can accelerate our efforts to build a comprehensive multichannel view of how we serve our guests.\n Second, we know that beauty enthusiasts love to shop for discovery and trial no matter the channel. And we do not expect this desire to change. We also know that concerns about personal safety and close contact caused by COVID-19 will require the beauty experience to change in the short term but will also likely spark longer-term innovation. We're reimagining the guest experience and product discovery and looking at ways technology, services and the role of our associates can evolve to create a new wow experience for our guests.\n Our Ulta Beauty app and GLAMlab tool will continue to play a big role in guest discovery and trial. Today, guests can use GLAMlab to match foundation, try on makeup and play with hair color and lashes. And in the future, guests will have even more opportunities as we accelerate the implementation of new categories and experiences.\n Third, we plan to build on the successful work we've done to expand our market share and accelerate gains even further in key categories like skincare, hair and wellness. Social distancing has resulted in many consumer behavior changes, and the crisis has exacerbated many of the category trends that we saw playing out during the crisis. While we remain confident in the long-term potential of makeup, headwinds facing the makeup category will likely persist in the short term given the impact of social distancing and masks as well as the delayed introduction of newness and innovation this year. On the flip side, many people seem to be on video calls now most of the day, so we'll watch the impact on makeup usage closely.\n Conversely, skincare has become more important as guests look to take care of their skin and relieve stress. And wellness has taken on new dimensions, extending to both physical and mental aspects as consumers increase efforts to stay healthy and look to feel better in this new environment. We intend to lean into these trends to drive further market share expansion.\n Fourth, we've built a tremendous asset in our Ultamate Rewards program. With more than 33 million active members, we build a differentiated loyalty program that provides us with valuable customer insights, and we're applying advanced analytics and artificial intelligence to leverage this data to deliver personalized targeted communications. As we focus on deepening guest engagement, we're looking at ways to drive next level loyalty and accelerate personalization to increase spend per member. This will be particularly relevant in an increasingly omnichannel marketplace as more consumers move seamlessly between channels.\n Finally, through our efficiency for growth or EFG efforts, we've made progress in improving our merchandising effectiveness and enhancing core processes across our real estate and supply chain operations. As we think about cost pressures increasing as we move forward, we're looking at how we can go beyond process optimization and develop a cost structure that will enable us to weather economic challenges while also supporting investment in capabilities and opportunities that will set us up for future success.\n So in closing, this crisis certainly has been fluid, swift and inescapable. Businesses and consumers alike are adjusting to the effects of COVID-19, and longer term, the pandemic will have a sustained impact on how we all live and work. While the economic environment will be challenged, beauty enthusiasts have a deep emotional connection with beauty that in the past has not diminished in softer economic environment. Routines will continue to shift and evolve, but beauty is a platform for self-expression, togetherness, joy and self-care, all of which are even more important for beauty enthusiasts during this time of uncertainty and change.\n At Ulta Beauty, we have a strong differentiated operating model, a brand that's known and loved and dedicated associates who are passionate about our guests and our company. And I'm confident we will emerge in this crisis well positioned to accelerate our market share gains and extend our competitive advantages.\n And now I'll turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? Yes. Well, we're really, I guess, I'd say pretty pleased about what we're seeing so far in terms of consumer behavior, right? So, so far, our trends are stronger than we expected in terms of sales. It varies by market. We actually have some markets comping positively, others negative. The e-commerce trends have been very encouraging. And they're remaining resilient and really accelerating because of the adoption of curbside, which we can talk more about.\n But -- and I mentioned this in the script, but the first 180 stores, if you look at their performance so far, total sales are flat to a year ago. But of course, the mix is quite different, right, between stores, curbside, BOPIS, ship to home. So I'd say overall, guest reaction has been quite positive. But we're cautious. I mean it's early, early, and we're taking a conservative stance as we look forward.\n The opportunity for us that we see as well is that I've mentioned that we've got a lot of guests who've never shopped online with us before who are now converting to omnichannel guests, I guess, out of necessity. And that guest, the more that we can keep them shopping in multiple channels, they're very valuable to us. They spend almost 3x as much historically as somebody who shops in stores only.\n So the other thing I'd add is that -- and maybe David can comment on category mix. But on the curbside, so far, we invented that. I'm very proud of the team for really kind of putting that together pretty quickly. We hadn't been doing curbside. We even had launched BOPIS in the fourth quarter of last year, and that was going really well, but we hadn't needed to do curbside yet. So I really congratulate our team for getting that stood up. And we've been pleased to see the guest reaction.\n So I'd say what they like about it is the speed, the ease and the overall enthusiasm of our first staff. We're following all the kind of social distancing and safety guidelines that you can imagine. But we feel that so far, that could be -- again as people try that, they find it as another convenient way to shop at Ulta Beauty, and we expect that will continue to be part of the mix as we go forward.\n Is there anything else you want to add on categories, Dave? Thank you, Mark. I'd say in some ways going into this, what we've seen is at the beginning of the cycle, of course, the types of things that people bought were quite different than what we've seen in the past, right, things like hand sanitizers and soaps. And then we saw folks get more engaged in things that I would call like self-care, do-it-yourself at home. So haircare, nails, that kind of thing, and then kind of more into things that are a bit more self-indulgent or self-care, like whether it's mask, skincare, fragrances for the bath, that kind of stuff. So it's just kind of interesting to see that cycle of -- the psyche of consumer behavior.\n As an aside, one thing I'll say is I feel like our team did a great job from a social media and just marketing perspective to really meet our guests where they were and kind of talk to them about those things. Engagement was really high.\n The core category trends, I'd say, were similar -- roughly similar to what we saw coming into this year, which is acceleration in skin care. We've talked about that. We see that as a big future trend. The intersection of wellness and beauty together is going to be important. I think with makeup, as Dave said, I think it's an interesting early fact that on curbside, we saw some tick-up in makeup. You can debate the 2 sides of it. But I mean anecdotally, I'd say that folks who maybe were doing -- working from home before on phone calls are now all of a sudden all working from home on video calls, and everybody is on video call.\n So will that have -- will that help bring the light at the end of the tunnel as you said? Well, certainly, makeup is still large and it's very -- customers are very engaged in that category. But it has been in a lower cycle. You're right. So could this help it? I think we'll see. We don't know. Right now, I wouldn't say that's happening in the large scale. Yes. I would say we'll step back and start with department stores. I mean just in general, we have a very sort of broad competitive environment, and we think about that because we do -- we bring all things together in beauty. And as a result, we compete with everybody from department stores to mass retailers to other specialty retailers, e-commerce only. So it actually is a pretty broad competitive environment that we're in. And we pay close attention to everything that's happening and see opportunities and risks throughout.\n So I mean that's how we've always been as a business, is to play our offense and to make sure that we get the share gains that we believe we can get in certain categories. I mentioned already in the digital channel, we gained share in every category in prestige, and we were only digital in this past quarter. So we feel good about that. So that's something we pay close attention to.\n And the second part of the question was... Vendor support. Yes. I mean listen, there was -- it's a very important time for us to be very close with our vendor partners, big and small. And so I feel very good about -- we have worked -- Dave leads the merchandising team. And you can add more to those if you like. But I mean we -- I'm proud about the fact that I feel that we've been very transparent with our vendors, share the dilemmas with them, share the opportunities with them as we move forward. And our relationships are very strong. So I certainly -- I feel very confident about our ability to come out of this stronger than ever and continue to win in the marketplace, and I think our vendor relationships will be a key part of that. Dana, it's Mary. Thank you. On the services staffing, I can't tell you the precise ratio there in terms of where we're going to land. But I will tell you that I actually feel that -- first of all, we're taking a conservative and cautious approach to thinking about services. But I also believe we've got a great opportunity because there's -- we have a national platform, a national brand. And there's still pretty, I'd say, low usage of our services relative to the total retail percent of business that we have. So we feel like there's a great opportunity. We also know, as you know, like our omnichannel guests, that people who use our services are spending almost 3x as much as somebody who's not.\n So it's a great opportunity. We are starting slowly, and we're starting with hair only and I would say with even stricter protocols of health and safety than just the reopening of the store, which is very strict. So there's additional steps in place to make sure that that's done safely and well. But frankly, as we started to open up, we have about 280 stores that have salons open right now. And there's a lot of pent-up demand for cut and color, as you can imagine.\n So we have many, many stores that are well booked right now. We are stylists. We kept them on the payroll largely so that we knew we could come back strong. We wanted them to stay with Ulta Beauty and help us capitalize on this opportunity over time. So over time, we'll go from hair to brows again and things like that, but we're just going to take it a step at a time.\n Your question about cosmetic innovation, maybe, Dave, if you want to add to that? It sounds like a party at your house, Simeon. I love it. I'm so happy they're excited. That's awesome. So let me just close this. I really want to thank everybody for joining us today. I know at the end of every quarter, I thank my team. But honestly, in my 7 years as CEO of this company, in fact, in my career, I don't think I've ever seen a group of people leading with more resilience and heart and collaboration and more drive to win. So I want to thank the Ulta Beauty team, and we hope that you stay healthy and safe, and we look forward to speaking with all of you again in August when we report our second quarter results. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\n It is now my pleasure to introduce Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President of Investor Relations.

Hosting our call today are Dave Kimbell, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Kecia Steelman, Chief Operating Officer, will join us for the Q&A session.\n This afternoon, we announced our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2021.

[Operator Instructions] And as always, the IR team will be available for any follow-up questions after the call.\n Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dave. Dave? \nDavid Kimbell: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. Before discussing our results, I want to share how proud I am of our associates' performance throughout 2021. While consistently providing care and service to our guests and to each other, they successfully navigated pandemic-related challenges and delivered exceptional results for all of our stakeholders.\n In fiscal 2021, the beauty category recovered earlier and faster than we expected. And our teams adjusted quickly in many ways, including working with our brand partners to accelerate receipts and manage in-stocks, creating highly relevant content that reflected the rapidly evolving mindset of our guests, adjusting staffing levels across the organization to meet growing demand and protecting and strengthening our culture, leading with their hearts and working together to create new ways to delight and excite guests, all while continuing to execute against our strategic priorities and drive our business forward.\n Now moving to our results for the quarter. The Ulta Beauty team delivered record fourth quarter financial results despite COVID and winter weather disruptions. Net sales increased 24.1% to $2.7 million -- $2.7 billion. Operating profit increased to 13.8% of sales and diluted EPS increased to $5.41 per share for the quarter.\n The decisions our teams made and plans they executed with excellence around assortment strategies, inventory flow, marketing and staffing levels positioned us to take advantage of a positive consumer environment this holiday season and deliver strong results.\n I want to express my sincere appreciation to all Ulta Beauty associates, particularly in our stores and distribution centers, who show up every day, positive and optimistic, ready to serve our guests while facing personal challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic. Their dedication enabled us to deliver these outstanding results, and I am grateful for their flexibility as circumstances shifted.\n We kicked off the holiday season in early November with our multichannel celebrate more campaign. Our audience-tailored creative and contextually relevant storytelling connected with consumers in fresh and bold ways across platforms. And we continued to expand live streaming and social selling experiences. We enhanced our Member Love events, rewarding members with new loyalty offers to drive engagement, reactivation and retention.\n And we leveraged our CRM capabilities to further enhance the productivity of our promotions. We also enhanced our gift card program, including more innovative and inclusive designs and new multipack options, which helped deliver strong double-digit growth in gift card sales across stores and third-party channels.\n Our decision to proactively manage inventory flow resulted in strong sell-through of holiday merchandise and core product, and our teams transitioned quickly after Christmas to support our strategic Jumbo Love and Love your Skin events as well as significant brand launches. In January, we executed 4 exciting new brand launches at Ulta Beauty, OLAPLEX, N\u00b01 DE CHANEL, Supergoop! and Billie Eilish.\n As the #1 prestige hair care brand in the market, OLAPLEX offers patented bond building products and is changing how consumers engage with the hair care category. While our initial assortment included only 7 SKUs, it was one of the strongest brand launches in Ulta Beauty history. With the unique ability to offer guests the professional service in our salons and the retail products to take home, we are delighted to expand our partnership with OLAPLEX.\n In makeup, we are excited to partner with Chanel Beaut\u00e9 as the exclusive U.S. retailer for the historic launch of N\u00b01 DE CHANEL. Offering luxury to younger generations, this new line is sustainably sourced with clean ingredients and sustainable packaging. With an assortment spanning skin care, makeup and fragrance, N\u00b01 DE CHANEL is currently available in 250 Ulta Beauty stores and on ulta.com. This launch is a key element of our luxury beauty strategy, and we're very pleased with the initial results.\n In skin care, we launched Supergoop!, known for its sunscreen expertise. Supergoop! is made with clean v-friendly ingredients, is cruelty-free and leverages sustainable packaging. And in fragrance, we launched a new offering exclusive to Ulta Beauty from acclaimed recording artist, Billie Eilish.\n Taking a closer look at sales trends in the quarter, guests were excited to return to in-store holiday shopping. Even as stores delivered robust double-digit comp growth, e-commerce sales exceeded our expectations, increasing slightly on top of last year's 70% growth. This reinforces us that e-commerce is complementary and incremental to the physical shopping experience.\n Guests continue to increase their utilization of \"buy online, pick up in store\" while also engaging with our new same-day delivery option. During the quarter, BOPIS sales increased 20% to account for 17% of e-commerce sales compared to 15% in the fourth quarter last year. While only available in about 200 stores, we are pleased with the performance of our new same-day delivery options.\n From a category perspective, all major categories delivered double-digit comp growth compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, driven by cycling last year's disruption from COVID, strong execution of our holiday plans and product newness. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, fragrance, bath, hair care and skin care, all continued to deliver strong double-digit growth. Makeup was more challenged this quarter with trends decelerating from the third quarter across both prestige and mass makeup, although sales of mass makeup continued to be positive compared to 2019.\n Over the last year, as the beauty category has recovered, the performance of makeup has been more volatile and lagged other categories, in part reflecting higher sensitivity to COVID fluctuations. We remain confident that makeup will return to growth as consumer optimism and comfort with out-of-home activities increases. But we recognize the timing and rate of recovery will continue to be impacted by changes in the COVID environment.\n Looking specifically at the fourth quarter trends in makeup, face, lip and eye continued to deliver strong growth, driven by blush, tinted moisture, lip balm and lashes. Newness from L, Kiss and Ardell continued to excite and engage guests, while prestige brands like MAC, Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me also delivered positive growth. In addition, this quarter, we expanded Chanel Beaut\u00e9 into 50 additional stores and launched the full assortment on ulta.com.\n Hair care delivered double-digit growth, increasing to 28% of net sales. Consumer focus on hair health drove strong growth in treatments, shampoo and conditioner and tools like the Dyson Airwrap were hot holiday gifts this year. New brands like OLAPLEX, KRISTIN ESS and Briogeo, as well as guest favorites like Redken and Living Proof delivered nice growth during the quarter.\n The fragrance and bath category was again the best performing major category during the quarter, delivering robust double-digit comp growth and increasing to 18% of net sales. Compelling newness from luxury brands like Gucci, Dior and Carolina Herrera as well as exclusive newness from Ariana Grande and Billie Eilish contributed to the strong growth. In addition, our holiday fragrance programs and our monthly Fragrance Crush program performed very well.\n Finally, skin care delivered another quarter of double-digit sales growth. Beauty enthusiasts are maintaining their skin care regimens as they continue to focus on self-care. Category growth in the quarter was primarily driven by moisturizers, cleansers and Sun care. Newness continued to peel the guests as new brands, including Drunk Elephant, Good Molecules, Fresh and Black Girl Sunscreen as well as new products from Tula drove strong growth during the quarter. In addition, dermatology-based brands like CeraVe and La Roche-Posay continued to resonate with guests.\n The performance of our services business accelerated in the quarter, increasing more than 30% over last year, driven primarily by growth in transactions. During the quarter, we expanded salon capacity to 100% in all Ulta Beauty salons and Benefit Brow Bars, except where limited by state or local mandates. And we relaunched skin services in 130 stores.\n In addition, our recently launched salon services, Express Color and OLAPLEX Repair & Protect, continue to bring in new members to our salons, an encouraging trend as we know members who use our services are some of our most valuable and engaged guests. Reflecting this momentum, during the quarter, we hired approximately 1,000 new associates to support our expanding services business.\n Now turning to our results for the full year. The Ulta Beauty team delivered record sales of $8.6 billion, recorded operating margin of 15% of sales and record diluted EPS of $17.98 per share. Comparable sales increased 37.9% compared to fiscal 2020 and 12.6% compared to fiscal 2019. We expanded our market share in Prestige Beauty based on dollar sales for the 52 weeks ended January 29, 2022, compared to the same period last year based on point-of-sale data from the NPD Group.\n We continue to fuel guest desires for newness with relevant brand launches such as Drunk Elephant, BOBBI BROWN, OLAPLEX, KRISTIN ESS and Verb. We expanded our Conscious Beauty platform to 270 certified brands, launched SKU level certification for the clean ingredients and vegan peelers and expanded our Made Without List. We doubled the number of black-owned brands in our assortment, welcoming Black Girls Sunscreen, Camille Rose, Homebody and BLK/OPL, among others, to the Ulta Beauty family and introduced dedicated space for BIPOC-founded brands in 260 stores.\n We launched The Wellness Shop, a cross-category platform that offers guests self-care for the mind, body and spirit on ulta.com and in more than 450 stores. We opened 44 net new stores, relocated 7 stores, remodeled 9 stores and negotiated more than 150 lease renewals.\n We continue to drive higher BOPIS utilization with new guest incentives, increased marketing to drive awareness and operational improvements to the guest and associate experience. As a result, BOPIS sales increased to 18% of e-commerce sales compared to 14% in fiscal 2020. Between BOPIS and our ship-from-store capabilities, about 28% of our digital orders this year were fulfilled by stores.\n We launched our exciting new partnership with Target Corporation and opened 100 Ulta Beauty at Target locations. I'll share more on this later. We drove member growth through new acquisition, member reengagement and targeted retention efforts, increasing the number of Ultimate Rewards members to a record 37 million members. We grew aided awareness to 94% and maintained unaided awareness at 48%.\n Importantly, we significantly increased Ulta Beauty consideration with Gen Z, Hispanic and black beauty enthusiast and created deeper, more emotional connections with consumers.\n We successfully navigate macro headwinds, including supply chain challenges and tight labor markets. We proactively invested in our teams with appreciation bonus for our store and DC associates. We doubled our renewable energy credit, invested in energy management system retrofits, diverted nearly 15 tons of waste from landfills through our recycling efforts and joined other leading retailers in the consortium to reinvent the retail bag.\n And we made meaningful progress against our DE&I commitments, including launching the MUSE platform, signing the 15% pledge, investing in, in-store guest experience training, reimagining our diverse leaders development program and integrating DE&I and across our internal talent life cycle.\n Now as we turn to fiscal 2022, consumers in the operating environment are changing faster than ever. Consumers are becoming increasingly resilient to COVID surges, but macro headwinds, global uncertainty and potential pandemic setbacks will likely continue to impact consumers. The beauty category is healthy and growing, and our proprietary consumer insights give us confidence that the recovery, which began last year, will continue in 2022 as consumers maintain their self-care routines and engage in more social activities.\n And as consumers increase their consumption of services and experiences, our assortment and service offerings position us to benefit from these shifts. We know there will be challenges, but I am more excited than ever about the opportunity for Ulta Beauty to grow and continue to lead the beauty category. Last fall, we introduced a new strategic framework which will shape our future and enable us to deliver against our long-term financial targets.  \n Let me share our fiscal 2022 priorities through the lens of each of our strategic pillars. Starting with our first pillar. We will drive breakthrough and disruptive growth through an expanded definition of all things beauty. Our differentiated assortment is core to our success. And in fiscal 2022, we intend to enhance and expand our Conscious Beauty platform, further increase our assortment of black-owned, black-founded and black-led brands in support of our 15% pledge and build the infrastructure to support these brands, expand The Wellness Shop to an additional 300 stores and continue to evolve and expand our offering across core categories to engage and excite the beauty enthusiasts.\n To drive growth and capture market share, we will continue to add relevant brands to our assortment. In recent weeks, we've executed one of our most anticipated brand launches ever, Fenty Beauty. Partnering with Rihanna and Fenty Beauty, we announced the news on February 17 through social channels, achieving higher mentioned volume and reach than any other Ulta Beauty brand launch announcement. The initial guest response was incredibly positive, trending as the #1 topic on Twitter the day of the announcement.\n Turning now to our second pillar, to evolve the guest experience through our personalized and connected omnichannel ecosystem, all in your world. Beauty enthusiasts are increasingly leveraging both physical and digital channels, and we have the power to connect and engage with them across the beauty journey and meet them wherever they are.\n In fiscal 2022, we intend to leverage our real estate pipeline to pilot a new in-store experience with a layout and flow that reflects our key merchandising strategies and consolidates guest services in a central location, test a small store format with an optimized assortment and service offering in a handful of small markets, enhance our buy anywhere fill anywhere efforts by expanding our same-day delivery option, continue to create leading digital experiences through the ongoing refresh of our digital store to provide guests with an experience that seamlessly merges content with commerce, the expansion of our virtual try-on capabilities and new capabilities resulting from our digital fund investments.\n We'll provide guests with more convenience through the launch of Afterpay as a payment option in stores and will expand the Ulta Beauty at Target shop in more than 250 new Target locations.\n As part of our efforts to expand our omnichannel ecosystem, last year, we joined forces with the Target Corporation to create a new way for guests to discover Prestige Beauty. In just 9 short months, the Ulta Beauty and Target teams worked together to design a space that feels authentic to both brands. We connected 2 independent loyalty programs. We made it easy for guests to link their accounts. And we onboarded more than 50 prestige and emerging brands.\n I am pleased to share that in our Ulta Beauty at Target location, customer awareness remains very strong. Guests are shopping across categories, and more than 1 million members have linked their Ultimate Rewards and Target Circle accounts. Building on this foundation, this year, our focus is on accelerating new member acquisition, optimizing the guest experience and continuing to amplify marketing as we scale.\n Moving now to our third pillar, expand and deepen our presence across the guest beauty journey, firmly placing Ulta Beauty at the heart of the beauty community. In fiscal 2022, we intend to further build upon our brand purpose and elevate our marketing efforts to include more action-based programming that address the needs of key audiences; expand live streaming and social selling; drive member growth and leverage data and analytics to increase the personalization of our communication, deepen engagement and shift share of wallet; and launch our retail media network, UB Media.\n Our fourth pillar is to drive operational excellence and optimization. We are investing in multiple significant cross-functional projects that require capital and resources, but position us to capture additional market share, fund enhancements to the guest experience and deliver future profitable growth.\n In fiscal 2022, we plan to execute the first phase of Project SOAR, our multiyear effort to upgrade our enterprise resource planning platform, migrate to Google Cloud as our data and analytics platform to facilitate data accessibility, enhanced reporting and faster decision-making, begin a 2-year effort to refresh our store POS systems and leverage our continuous improvement capability to identify, prioritize, activate and measure meaningful cross-functional process optimization opportunities.\n In support of our supply chain optimization efforts, this year, we plan to begin an upgrade and retrofit of our Greenwood distribution center, begin construction of our first market fulfillment center and implement new transportation tools to provide better visibility to loads in transit.\n Our winning culture is a key driver of Ulta Beauty's success. And our fifth strategic pillar is to protect and cultivate our world-class culture and talent. We strive to make Ulta Beauty a great place to work by leading with our hearts, caring for each other in everything we do and demonstrating integrity, authenticity and inclusivity daily.\n To reinforce our position as an employer of choice and enable us to continue to successfully navigate anticipated tight labor markets, this year, we intend to increase investments in training and development programs to enhance the guest experience, improve personnel performance and help associates manage their career, continue leveraging our diverse slate recruitment efforts, further enhance and optimize our talent acquisition processes, increase investment in development programs to help associates plan and develop their careers and continue to navigate the pandemic with safety at the forefront for all of our associates.\n Finally, our sixth strategic pillar is to expand our environmental and social impact. As the largest U.S. beauty retailer, we have the power to shape how the world sees beauty and responsibility to inspire positive change.\n Building on the progress we made in 2021, this year, we plan to continue to amplify underrepresented voices through media investments with multicultural platforms; the expansion of our MUSE platform and increased brand marketing support for black-owned, black-founded and black-led brands within our assortment; build an ecosystem to support the pipeline of BIPOC brands, including the creation of an accelerator program focused on early-stage BIPOC beauty brands to educate, inspire and support brand participants to prepare for retail readiness; and an investment in new voices, a venture capital firm that partners with and invests in entrepreneurs of color to drive scalable, sustainable businesses; continue to invest in training and internal programming to ensure our guests, associates and communities feel connected to and reflected at Ulta Beauty.\n And as we look to reduce our carbon footprint, we plan to expand our LED lighting retrofit program, double our investment in renewable energy credits and explore opportunities to collaborate with our brand partners to identify opportunities to reduce Scope 3 emissions together.\n We recently published our 2021 ESG report, which includes information about our strong corporate governance practices and commitment to operating an ethical business. In addition, it includes disclosures aligned with the SASB Index and TCFD as well as updated EEO-1 information.\n In closing, I am incredibly proud of what the Ulta Beauty team has accomplished and excited about the opportunities ahead. We operate in a healthy, culturally relevant and growing category. We have a strong proven business model, and we have a winning culture and simply outstanding associates. We have ambitious plans, and I am confident we have the right team to execute our strategies and deliver for our guests, associates and shareholders.\n And now, I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? \nScott Settersten: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our financial results, I want to echo Dave's comments and express my sincere appreciation to all our Ulta Beauty associates for their focus on providing great guest experiences and managing the business, especially in such a dynamic operating environment. Their dedication to our guests and each other enabled us to deliver another strong quarter and an outstanding year for our shareholders.\n Now to our fourth quarter results, beginning with the income statement. Overall, results for the quarter were better than anticipated, primarily driven by stronger-than-expected holiday sales and a rational promotional environment. Sales growth across both physical and digital channels were stronger than expected, resulting in gross margin and less SG&A deleverage than planned. As a result, operating margin increased to 13.8% of sales for the quarter.\n Net sales for the quarter increased 24.1%, driven by 21.4% growth in comp sales and strong new store performance. Transactions for the quarter increased 10.4%, driven by double-digit growth in store traffic. And average ticket increased 9.9%, resulting from both a higher average selling price and an increase in units per transaction.\n Looking at the cadence of sales for the quarter. November was the strongest month, supported by our successful marketing efforts and guests' early holiday shopping. Post-holiday, overall growth moderated, driven primarily by a deceleration of store traffic, likely reflecting disruption from weather and the Omicron variant.\n During the quarter, we opened 6 new stores, relocated 3 stores and remodeled 1 store. Compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, total sales increased 18.4% and comp sales increased 15.4%. For the quarter, gross margin increased about 250 basis points to 37.6% of sales compared to 35.1% last year. The increase was primarily due to the leverage of fixed costs, favorable channel mix shifts and higher merchandise margin.\n Consistent with trends we experienced in the first 3 quarters of the year, in the fourth quarter, strong top line growth and benefits from our occupancy cost optimization efforts resulted in significant leverage of fixed costs. Channel mix was favorable as the penetration of e-commerce sales was about 600 basis points lower than last year. And merchandise margin improved, primarily due to lower promotional activity and ongoing benefits from our category management efforts.\n Comparing this year's performance to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, gross margin improved by 260 basis points. Higher merchandise margin and fixed cost leverage were partially offset by adverse channel mix.\n As planned, SG&A increased 26% to $650 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 40 basis points to 23.8% compared to 23.4% last year, primarily due to higher incentive compensation and store payroll and benefits, partially offset by leverage of marketing expense due to higher sales.\n Reflecting strong operational performance versus our internal targets, incentive compensation associated with our annual bonus program increased compared to last year. In addition, we elected to grant discretionary appreciation bonuses to our store associates in recognition of their efforts to deliver this outstanding performance. In total, higher incentive compensation drove about 60 basis points of deleverage in the quarter.\n Store payroll and benefits expense in the quarter was higher than last year, reflecting an increase in the number of store associates and higher average wage rates. Compared to fiscal 2019, SG&A as a percentage of sales was about 140 basis points unfavorable, primarily due to higher incentive compensation and marketing expense.\n Operating margin was 13.8% of sales compared to 10.2% of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 on a GAAP basis and 11.6% of sales on an adjusted basis. Strong top line growth, driven primarily by stores, combined with the impact of our ongoing cost optimization efforts, resulted in record level operating margin performance.\n The company's tax rate decreased to 22.9% compared to 23.4% in the fourth quarter last year. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to a benefit from the income tax accounting for share-based compensation and state tax credits. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased to $5.41 compared to $3.03 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in Q4 of last year was $3.41.\n To recap the full year, our teams delivered sales and profits that far exceeded pre-pandemic levels. Compared to fiscal 2019, sales increased 16.7% to $8.6 billion. Operating profit increased 44% to $1.3 billion or 15% of sales. And diluted EPS increased 48% to $17.98 per share.\n Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 28% to $1.5 billion compared to $1.2 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 44 net new stores, the increase reflects inventory purchases to support new brand launches, including OLAPLEX, Fenty and Chanel as well as proactive efforts to maintain strong in-stocks of key items to support expected demand and mitigate anticipated global supply chain disruptions.\n In fiscal 2021, we invested $172 million in capital expenditures, including approximately $89 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $60 million for supply chain and IT and about $23 million for store maintenance and other.\n Depreciation for the year was $268 million compared to $298 million last year, primarily reflecting the impact of last year's store impairments and store closures. Ulta Beauty continues to generate significant cash from operations. As we shared at our October Analyst Day, our priority for use of cash is to reinvest in the business to drive profitable growth. After investing to support growth, we will continue to look to return excess capital to shareholders.\n During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million shares at a cost of $760 million. We elected to accelerate repurchases in the fourth quarter to take advantage of better-than-expected cash flow.\n Since launching our stock buyback program in 2014, we've purchased 14 million shares at an average price of $275, effectively returning $3.9 billion to shareholders, while continuing to invest in strategic growth drivers. Having essentially completed the authorization announced in March of 2020, today, we announced a new share repurchase authorization for $2 billion.\n Turning now to our outlook. We are emerging from the pandemic as a stronger, healthier business. Over the last 2 years, we've strengthened category margins and improved our ability to optimize promotions. Our real estate portfolio is healthy and improving economics. Our e-commerce business is larger and more profitable. And we've strengthened our analytical capabilities and adjusted our cost structure.\n At our Analyst Day in October, we shared an updated growth algorithm with investors. Over the next 3 years, we expect to deliver net sales growth between 5% and 7% on a compound annual growth basis using fiscal 2019 as the base year; operating profit between 13% and 14% of sales; low double-digit diluted earnings per share growth on a CAGR basis, again using fiscal 2019 as the base year; and maintaining capital expenditures between 4% and 5% of sales.\n As we look to fiscal 2022, we continue to expect that sales growth and operating margin will be in line with these longer-term targets. Our EPS guidance of low to mid-single-digit growth reflects lapping extraordinary performance in fiscal 2021. Our guidance for fiscal 2022 also includes macro considerations, including continued wage pressures and higher supply chain costs as well as the impact of a more normalized investment agenda.\n Specifically, in fiscal 2022, we plan to open approximately 50 net new stores and remodel or relocate approximately 35 stores. We expect net sales will be between $9.05 billion and $9.15 billion, with comp sales growth between 3% and 4%. Our sales outlook reflects a more normalized growth trend for the beauty category, including a modest recovery in makeup, while also considering various uncertainties including inflationary risks to consumer spending and the impact of increasing points of distribution for Prestige Beauty.\n For your modeling purposes, we anticipate comp growth in the first half will be in the mid-single-digit range, driven by stronger growth in the first quarter and then moderate to low single-digit growth as we lap last year's recovery. We expect operating margin for the year will be between 13.7% and 14% of sales compared to 15% in fiscal 2021, with deleverage from both gross margin and SG&A. We anticipate operating margin deleverage will be greater in the first half as we lap last year's strong performance.\n We expect gross margin will be lower than fiscal 2021, driven primarily by lower merchandise margin resulting from the impact of new brand launches, lapping onetime benefits from favorable inventory reserve adjustments and a more normalized promotional environment. We also expect supply chain costs will increase more than sales, resulting in additional pressure on gross margin.\n We expect SG&A expense will deleverage, driven primarily by $70 million to $75 million of expenses related to our strategic priorities, including investments to support UB Media, Ulta Beauty at Target, Project SOAR and other IT capabilities as well as higher wage rate growth across the enterprise, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. These assumptions result in guidance for diluted earnings per share in the range of $18.20 to $18.70 per share, including the impact of approximately $900 million in share repurchases.\n We are not providing specific quarterly guidance. But as you update your financial models, consider that the second quarter will likely be our most challenging quarter of the year as we lap extraordinary performance in fiscal 2021. As a result, we are currently planning for EPS in the second quarter to decrease about 10%.\n Finally, we plan to spend between $375 million and $425 million in CapEx, including approximately $195 million for supply chain and IT; $150 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures; and about $55 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be between $250 million and $255 million. I would note that our guidance assumes no changes in federal tax rate environment and no material increases in the federal minimum wage.\n In closing, a rapidly recovering environment, combined with the outstanding efforts of our teams and the work we have done to strengthen the business, enabled us to deliver record performance in fiscal 2021. While lapping this performance will be difficult, we remain confident in our longer-term growth targets.\n Ulta Beauty has established significant long-term competitive advantages. And we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities within the $140 billion U.S. beauty products and salon services industry and continue to deliver long-term shareholder value.\n And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. \nOperator: Our first question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Group. \nDana Telsey: Congratulations on the nice progress. As you think about the current macro landscape out there and the inflationary pressures, how are you thinking about pricing in 2022? And how does that feed into the margin? And do you see any difference by category? \nDavid Kimbell: Great. Dana, thanks for the question. And yes, certainly, we are tracking and monitoring closely the inflationary environment, and we understand the unique dynamics that we're facing. We recognize consumers are going to be facing headwinds from rising prices and other dynamics.\n I will say that as we look at the beauty category, even with these headwinds, we remain positive. The category is healthy. It is growing. It's emotionally important and connected to our consumers. We are in the midst, even as we face some of these inflationary pressures, that we're in the midst of opening of the economy, of the world around us, which is beneficial. We know consumers are working to maintain their self-care routine.\n And so despite the headwinds, we think the category is well positioned. And then uniquely, Ulta is well positioned because of our model. The fact that we are across all price points, all categories, mass, prestige, we are able to adjust and reflect evolving consumer needs as the world around us changes. Pricing has -- every year, there's pricing. Certainly, over the last few months, we've seen some pricing action in -- from some of our brands.\n A reminder, in our prestige side of the business, it tends to be MSRP. And so we're -- we would be reflective of where the broader market is going. But it hasn't been an extraordinary amount of price increase yet. And any benefit of that is certainly reflected in our guidance going forward. But as cost pressures increase, both on our business and our brand partners' business, we'll be clearly tracking this closely and making sure we're adjusting appropriately as we manage through the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Altschwager with Baird. \nMark Altschwager: I wanted to ask about the rewards program and spend per member. It looks like kind of your average spend per Ultimate Rewards member must have been up pretty nicely 2021 versus 2019. Just any color there would be great. And how much of that is category recovery versus share of wallet gains? And then looking ahead, you did allow some of the increased distribution points for Prestige Beauty as a consideration in your guidance. So curious how you're thinking about ability to continue to capture share of wallet and the opportunities in 2022? \nDavid Kimbell: Great. Well, we are incredibly proud of our loyalty program. We have been for a long time. And I'm really, really pleased with the results that the team delivered in 2021 to reach a record level of 37 million active members, which is not only 13% ahead of 2020, but 6% ahead of 2019. So our guests are highly engaged. Reactivation rates and retention rates are very strong.\n We did see an increase in spend per member, which we're encouraged by. And that's driven by a number of factors as we continue to optimize the way we're engaging, leveraging our personalization efforts, providing more relevant, appropriate messages to our guests brought through our CRM capability. We've seen a category mix change.\n We've talked consistently through the year about the growth of fragrance. Some other like tools in our hair tools, some higher ticket items that have been driving very strong growth ahead of the total store. And so that's contributing to it. And I'd just say an overall connection to Ulta Beauty. I mentioned just the high level of unaided awareness, the strong emotional connection that we're building is driving greater share of wallet. And our efforts going forward will continue to drive that.\n As I look at the broader marketplace and share of wallet, and yes, there is expanded points of distribution on the prestige side of business, part of which is Ulta Beauty, both in our own stores and our partnership with Target. And I'm really pleased that in the fourth quarter, we gained share when we look across all of our points of distribution, including Target, despite hundreds of more new locations, competitive locations.\n So we're confident. We think we've got the right model, strong competitive position, most importantly, deep connection to our guests that's demonstrating stronger loyalty to Ulta Beauty. And we're going to leverage that to continue to drive growth and share growth into 2022. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Oliver Chen with Cowen. \nOliver Chen: On the guidance, what gives you confidence that makeup will return to growth? And how does that intersect with inventory, category planning and also your comments on prestige and the competition there? As a follow-up, as you make strides in BIPOC brands, black indigenous and people of color brands, how should investors measure your success here? How are you measuring success? Do you have a lot of innovative programs there? \nDavid Kimbell: Great. Thanks, Oliver. Yes, there are some important topics in your questions. First, makeup, we are confident in the path ahead of makeup. And yes, and I'd say as we reflect back on the year, there were certainly some ups and downs. And what we continue to see is makeup, more than any other category, is sensitive to COVID fluctuations. And we saw that in the fourth quarter with Omicron and Delta and continued challenges there.\n But as I look forward on makeup, there are so many things that continue to encourage us. And we've seen some of these trends for a little while, but we've also -- as soon as we get momentum, we see some setbacks related to COVID. But broad macro trends of opening up and more opportunity for consumers to get back in the world, you know you're seeing it in back to work. We're seeing just a rapid acceleration in that. Events, activities, those things people getting out of their house are all exceptionally positive for the total category.\n We know all along that consumers have been passionate about makeup. Just there are opportunities -- their usage of opportunities have been more limited, but we see the passion in social media. The engagement continues to be high in all -- in TikTok and in Instagram and all other forms. So we know the connection is there. We know the opportunities are coming. We know there's important trends like the duality of natural looks and bolder looks, increased focus around eye and brow that even a resurgence of contouring, all these things are positive.\n And then you layer in for us our -- the outstanding work our merchandising team has done to continue to evolve our assortment. You -- I mentioned the launch of Fenty Beauty, which is just a really important step in our continued connection with our guests, and that is off to a very strong start. Launch of Chanel on the luxury side to tap into a new opportunity there. We have expansion in MAC, which is going quite well. And then a number of great brands. We're seeing innovation. I'll give you a couple of examples on MAC, a M\u00b7A\u00b7CStack Mascara that has 1 formula in 2 wands for both volume and precision.\n We've got a NYX Line Loud lip liner that's exclusive to Ulta Beauty that's performing well. We've got Morphe X Lucky Charms that's getting exclusive and driving engagement. And we've got Tresl\u00face by Becky G, which is a Mexican-American Singer celebrating her Latin root. So we have exclusivity, newness. We've big brands, emerging brands.\n And it ties to your last point, your question about BIPOC. We see success by these brands thriving. We're not here just to get these brands on the shelf. It's one thing to arrive on our shelves, it's another thing to thrive. And that's how we're measuring success. We want these brands to be -- perform well, to grow, to have great opportunities [indiscernible]. And that's how we're measuring it. And that's how I'd suggest you look at it. We're doing this to drive engagement with our, we're seeing it for our brands. So we're optimistic about beauty, about makeup. And BIPOC will be one of the elements that will help us drive growth going forward. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: You talked about gross margin down in 2022. That seems a bit different from your prior commentary. Is that simply lapping through this big gross margin beat in the fourth quarter? Or is there something changing in your outlook or something that you're seeing in the market? And then on the gross margin side, can you help us a little bit on the cadence front? \nScott Settersten: Yes. Thanks, Chris. So I don't really think that there's any inconsistency in our messaging here. I think the variables at play are pretty consistent over the course of the year as you think about 2022, I would say. So again, it's back to merchandise margins, right, being under pressure in 2022 compared to what we've just been through the last year or so.\n With the promotional environment, we think it's going to get back to more normal kind of business environment and then incremental supply chain costs, including transportation costs and wages and our distribution centers being greater than our growth outlook is for next year. So a combination of those things driving deleverage.\n And then as we think about the year, I guess, as we said, second quarter is going to be the toughest. So again,first half of the year stronger, generally speaking, on operating margin than the second half. Partly that's being driven in the first quarter by stronger sales as we lap over. Last year at this time, we were just starting to come out of the depths of the pandemic.\n So sales, especially in the store fleet, stronger this year in the first quarter than they were a year ago. That drives a lot of leverage for us and helps gross margin and operating margin overall and then sequencing again, and I think we said in our prepared remarks, those impacts overall kind of moderate as we get deeper into the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kelly Crago with Citi. \nKelly Crago: Just curious if you could elaborate a bit on your partnership with Target. Now that you're at your 9 months in, are Target stops helping drive new customer sales? What does the spend look like for our customers who shop both channels? Any other color you could provide around customer behavior, at least at Target, would be helpful? \nKecia Steelman: Yes. Thanks, Kelly, for the question. As a retail leader, we're really aiming to deliver a seamless, omnichannel experience that meets our guests wherever they are. The newest element of this omnichannel strategy of the Ulta Beauty at Target is really providing us another way to engage and discover Ulta Beauty for a new guest set that's shopping at Target. The strategy is working.\n What I would share is that our existing Ultimate Rewards members, they're taking advantage of shopping at Ulta Beauty at Target, and we're also introducing this to some new guests. The guest response has been really positive. The awareness remains strong. As Dave mentioned in his comments, more than 1 million members have linked their Ultimate Rewards in Target Circle accounts, and we're signing up new members every week.\n Target shared at their recent financial community meeting that the productivity in their space is very high. So that's always a good indicator, too. And I would say that while it's still really early, we're really encouraged that we see new members bouncing back into Ulta Beauty, and their shopping behaviors are very similar to our existing loyalty members. So just to kind of wrap up, overall, we're very pleased. While this is still new, we're pleased with how this is playing out as part of our omni strategy going forward. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson. \nMichael Baker: Maybe a 2-parter. Just on makeup, were you seeing it up on a 2-year basis earlier in the quarter and then Omicron slowed that down? Is that what you're saying? And can you talk about what you might be seeing in some areas of the country that seem to reopen earlier and not be as impacted by Omicron or at least didn't seem to slow down some of the people going out, Texas, Florida, maybe places like that? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. What I will say, we won't get into like every period throughout the quarter. But for sure, what we see on makeup is a -- as anxiety around COVID has increased, has fluctuated through the last 2 years, we do see more pressure on makeup. And -- but now across the country, as more and more people both -- yes, some parts of the country have been more open than others, but there still has been a consumer concern, even as elements are open, that is easing right now across all parts of the country. And so that's encouraging to us.\n And that's what we think we need is more ongoing, consistent confidence to be back into work, be back at various activities and events. And as we see that, we know that's an element. It's not the only thing, but it's an important element to make up success going forward. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets. \nAnthony Chukumba: To be respectful for everyone on the call, I'll actually limit it to one question, one actual question. So I just was wondering if you could just give us a little bit more color on the rollout of Fenty Beauty. Just any color in terms of number of stores, linear feet, end caps. Any additional color would be very helpful. \nDavid Kimbell: Thank you for modeling the one question rule, Anthony. I appreciate that. And yes, we are thrilled with Fenty. It is in all stores. It is online. It is -- if you have a chance to go into any Ulta Beauty store, you'll see it right at the front of the store. In most of our stores right at the front, it has an entire the 18-foot run and an end cap broad assortment featuring Fenty among other things is known for the breadth of assortment in [ beige ] in particular. So you'll see that being able to test and try items.\n So -- and then strong, strong presence online. In fact, we really found some unique ways in our online footprint to bring that brand to life and communicate to our guests. And so off to a great start, really pleased with it. Really glad that Kendo organization has partnered with us in many ways and see this as a key part of our success going forward. I'm thrilled to have Rihanna and Fenty as part of the Ulta Beauty family for a long time to come. \nKiley Rawlins: Hector, I think we have time for one more question, please. \nOperator: Our final question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Congratulations to the team and all the store employees, what a wonderful year. Dave, my question is for you, and it's getting back to the Ulta at TARGET a couple of weeks ago before announced the potential to expand to 850 stores by 2023 through Kohl's. You mentioned over 200 for this year. So I'm just wondering, can you share with us any data from that partnership, new customer acquisition? Any details there? And what would you need to see to accelerate that a little bit more aggressively beyond the 200? \nDavid Kimbell: Well, let me give a little bit of color, and I'll ask Kecia to kind of follow -- give some more detail to build off her previous answer on this. But -- and we are just thrilled to be partnering with Target. We know there's been -- we're in the midst of a real transformation in the Prestige Beauty landscape.\n And the fact that in the fourth quarter, with hundreds of new locations across Prestige Beauty, across the location, the fact that Ulta Beauty continues to gain share we think is a reflection of the strength of our strategy, the execution that we brought both in stores, online and in our Target Ulta Beauty at Target relationship.\n We are delighting guests. We're gaining share even as there's other competitive activity. And we're confident we're going to be able to continue to do. But Kecia, do you want to give some specifics about number of stores and what the outlook looks like there? \nKecia Steelman: Yes. What we've said, Adrienne, is a little over 250 this next year. We are in close partnership and we are following Target's remodel schedule. So that really kind of plays into timing, sequencing, et cetera, of how we're going about opening new stores. But the partnership is really strong.\n We're really pleased with our results. And the space -- the productivity in this space is high. It's a highly curated assortment with 50 key brand partners. And we're continuing to learn and evolve and grow as we continue to roll out more locations, but over 250 in the next year. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Dave Kimbell for closing remarks. \nDavid Kimbell: All right. Awesome. Thank you all for joining us today. Really appreciate it. In closing, I want to thank, again, our 40,000 associates for delivering a simply outstanding 2021 and with a relentless commitment to our guests, to each other and to moving our business forward.\n We all look forward to speaking to all of you again in May when we report our first quarter results. I hope you have a great evening. Thanks again for joining. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Kimbell",
            "content": "Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. Before discussing our results, I want to share how proud I am of our associates' performance throughout 2021. While consistently providing care and service to our guests and to each other, they successfully navigated pandemic-related challenges and delivered exceptional results for all of our stakeholders.\n In fiscal 2021, the beauty category recovered earlier and faster than we expected. And our teams adjusted quickly in many ways, including working with our brand partners to accelerate receipts and manage in-stocks, creating highly relevant content that reflected the rapidly evolving mindset of our guests, adjusting staffing levels across the organization to meet growing demand and protecting and strengthening our culture, leading with their hearts and working together to create new ways to delight and excite guests, all while continuing to execute against our strategic priorities and drive our business forward.\n Now moving to our results for the quarter. The Ulta Beauty team delivered record fourth quarter financial results despite COVID and winter weather disruptions. Net sales increased 24.1% to $2.7 million -- $2.7 billion. Operating profit increased to 13.8% of sales and diluted EPS increased to $5.41 per share for the quarter.\n The decisions our teams made and plans they executed with excellence around assortment strategies, inventory flow, marketing and staffing levels positioned us to take advantage of a positive consumer environment this holiday season and deliver strong results.\n I want to express my sincere appreciation to all Ulta Beauty associates, particularly in our stores and distribution centers, who show up every day, positive and optimistic, ready to serve our guests while facing personal challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic. Their dedication enabled us to deliver these outstanding results, and I am grateful for their flexibility as circumstances shifted.\n We kicked off the holiday season in early November with our multichannel celebrate more campaign. Our audience-tailored creative and contextually relevant storytelling connected with consumers in fresh and bold ways across platforms. And we continued to expand live streaming and social selling experiences. We enhanced our Member Love events, rewarding members with new loyalty offers to drive engagement, reactivation and retention.\n And we leveraged our CRM capabilities to further enhance the productivity of our promotions. We also enhanced our gift card program, including more innovative and inclusive designs and new multipack options, which helped deliver strong double-digit growth in gift card sales across stores and third-party channels.\n Our decision to proactively manage inventory flow resulted in strong sell-through of holiday merchandise and core product, and our teams transitioned quickly after Christmas to support our strategic Jumbo Love and Love your Skin events as well as significant brand launches. In January, we executed 4 exciting new brand launches at Ulta Beauty, OLAPLEX, N\u00b01 DE CHANEL, Supergoop! and Billie Eilish.\n As the #1 prestige hair care brand in the market, OLAPLEX offers patented bond building products and is changing how consumers engage with the hair care category. While our initial assortment included only 7 SKUs, it was one of the strongest brand launches in Ulta Beauty history. With the unique ability to offer guests the professional service in our salons and the retail products to take home, we are delighted to expand our partnership with OLAPLEX.\n In makeup, we are excited to partner with Chanel Beaute\u0301 as the exclusive U.S. retailer for the historic launch of N\u00b01 DE CHANEL. Offering luxury to younger generations, this new line is sustainably sourced with clean ingredients and sustainable packaging. With an assortment spanning skin care, makeup and fragrance, N\u00b01 DE CHANEL is currently available in 250 Ulta Beauty stores and on ulta.com. This launch is a key element of our luxury beauty strategy, and we're very pleased with the initial results.\n In skin care, we launched Supergoop!, known for its sunscreen expertise. Supergoop! is made with clean v-friendly ingredients, is cruelty-free and leverages sustainable packaging. And in fragrance, we launched a new offering exclusive to Ulta Beauty from acclaimed recording artist, Billie Eilish.\n Taking a closer look at sales trends in the quarter, guests were excited to return to in-store holiday shopping. Even as stores delivered robust double-digit comp growth, e-commerce sales exceeded our expectations, increasing slightly on top of last year's 70% growth. This reinforces us that e-commerce is complementary and incremental to the physical shopping experience.\n Guests continue to increase their utilization of \"buy online, pick up in store\" while also engaging with our new same-day delivery option. During the quarter, BOPIS sales increased 20% to account for 17% of e-commerce sales compared to 15% in the fourth quarter last year. While only available in about 200 stores, we are pleased with the performance of our new same-day delivery options.\n From a category perspective, all major categories delivered double-digit comp growth compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, driven by cycling last year's disruption from COVID, strong execution of our holiday plans and product newness. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, fragrance, bath, hair care and skin care, all continued to deliver strong double-digit growth. Makeup was more challenged this quarter with trends decelerating from the third quarter across both prestige and mass makeup, although sales of mass makeup continued to be positive compared to 2019.\n Over the last year, as the beauty category has recovered, the performance of makeup has been more volatile and lagged other categories, in part reflecting higher sensitivity to COVID fluctuations. We remain confident that makeup will return to growth as consumer optimism and comfort with out-of-home activities increases. But we recognize the timing and rate of recovery will continue to be impacted by changes in the COVID environment.\n Looking specifically at the fourth quarter trends in makeup, face, lip and eye continued to deliver strong growth, driven by blush, tinted moisture, lip balm and lashes. Newness from L, Kiss and Ardell continued to excite and engage guests, while prestige brands like MAC, Clinique and Lanco\u0302me also delivered positive growth. In addition, this quarter, we expanded Chanel Beaute\u0301 into 50 additional stores and launched the full assortment on ulta.com.\n Hair care delivered double-digit growth, increasing to 28% of net sales. Consumer focus on hair health drove strong growth in treatments, shampoo and conditioner and tools like the Dyson Airwrap were hot holiday gifts this year. New brands like OLAPLEX, KRISTIN ESS and Briogeo, as well as guest favorites like Redken and Living Proof delivered nice growth during the quarter.\n The fragrance and bath category was again the best performing major category during the quarter, delivering robust double-digit comp growth and increasing to 18% of net sales. Compelling newness from luxury brands like Gucci, Dior and Carolina Herrera as well as exclusive newness from Ariana Grande and Billie Eilish contributed to the strong growth. In addition, our holiday fragrance programs and our monthly Fragrance Crush program performed very well.\n Finally, skin care delivered another quarter of double-digit sales growth. Beauty enthusiasts are maintaining their skin care regimens as they continue to focus on self-care. Category growth in the quarter was primarily driven by moisturizers, cleansers and Sun care. Newness continued to peel the guests as new brands, including Drunk Elephant, Good Molecules, Fresh and Black Girl Sunscreen as well as new products from Tula drove strong growth during the quarter. In addition, dermatology-based brands like CeraVe and La Roche-Posay continued to resonate with guests.\n The performance of our services business accelerated in the quarter, increasing more than 30% over last year, driven primarily by growth in transactions. During the quarter, we expanded salon capacity to 100% in all Ulta Beauty salons and Benefit Brow Bars, except where limited by state or local mandates. And we relaunched skin services in 130 stores.\n In addition, our recently launched salon services, Express Color and OLAPLEX Repair & Protect, continue to bring in new members to our salons, an encouraging trend as we know members who use our services are some of our most valuable and engaged guests. Reflecting this momentum, during the quarter, we hired approximately 1,000 new associates to support our expanding services business.\n Now turning to our results for the full year. The Ulta Beauty team delivered record sales of $8.6 billion, recorded operating margin of 15% of sales and record diluted EPS of $17.98 per share. Comparable sales increased 37.9% compared to fiscal 2020 and 12.6% compared to fiscal 2019. We expanded our market share in Prestige Beauty based on dollar sales for the 52 weeks ended January 29, 2022, compared to the same period last year based on point-of-sale data from the NPD Group.\n We continue to fuel guest desires for newness with relevant brand launches such as Drunk Elephant, BOBBI BROWN, OLAPLEX, KRISTIN ESS and Verb. We expanded our Conscious Beauty platform to 270 certified brands, launched SKU level certification for the clean ingredients and vegan peelers and expanded our Made Without List. We doubled the number of black-owned brands in our assortment, welcoming Black Girls Sunscreen, Camille Rose, Homebody and BLK/OPL, among others, to the Ulta Beauty family and introduced dedicated space for BIPOC-founded brands in 260 stores.\n We launched The Wellness Shop, a cross-category platform that offers guests self-care for the mind, body and spirit on ulta.com and in more than 450 stores. We opened 44 net new stores, relocated 7 stores, remodeled 9 stores and negotiated more than 150 lease renewals.\n We continue to drive higher BOPIS utilization with new guest incentives, increased marketing to drive awareness and operational improvements to the guest and associate experience. As a result, BOPIS sales increased to 18% of e-commerce sales compared to 14% in fiscal 2020. Between BOPIS and our ship-from-store capabilities, about 28% of our digital orders this year were fulfilled by stores.\n We launched our exciting new partnership with Target Corporation and opened 100 Ulta Beauty at Target locations. I'll share more on this later. We drove member growth through new acquisition, member reengagement and targeted retention efforts, increasing the number of Ultimate Rewards members to a record 37 million members. We grew aided awareness to 94% and maintained unaided awareness at 48%.\n Importantly, we significantly increased Ulta Beauty consideration with Gen Z, Hispanic and black beauty enthusiast and created deeper, more emotional connections with consumers.\n We successfully navigate macro headwinds, including supply chain challenges and tight labor markets. We proactively invested in our teams with appreciation bonus for our store and DC associates. We doubled our renewable energy credit, invested in energy management system retrofits, diverted nearly 15 tons of waste from landfills through our recycling efforts and joined other leading retailers in the consortium to reinvent the retail bag.\n And we made meaningful progress against our DE&I commitments, including launching the MUSE platform, signing the 15% pledge, investing in, in-store guest experience training, reimagining our diverse leaders development program and integrating DE&I and across our internal talent life cycle.\n Now as we turn to fiscal 2022, consumers in the operating environment are changing faster than ever. Consumers are becoming increasingly resilient to COVID surges, but macro headwinds, global uncertainty and potential pandemic setbacks will likely continue to impact consumers. The beauty category is healthy and growing, and our proprietary consumer insights give us confidence that the recovery, which began last year, will continue in 2022 as consumers maintain their self-care routines and engage in more social activities.\n And as consumers increase their consumption of services and experiences, our assortment and service offerings position us to benefit from these shifts. We know there will be challenges, but I am more excited than ever about the opportunity for Ulta Beauty to grow and continue to lead the beauty category. Last fall, we introduced a new strategic framework which will shape our future and enable us to deliver against our long-term financial targets.  \n Let me share our fiscal 2022 priorities through the lens of each of our strategic pillars. Starting with our first pillar. We will drive breakthrough and disruptive growth through an expanded definition of all things beauty. Our differentiated assortment is core to our success. And in fiscal 2022, we intend to enhance and expand our Conscious Beauty platform, further increase our assortment of black-owned, black-founded and black-led brands in support of our 15% pledge and build the infrastructure to support these brands, expand The Wellness Shop to an additional 300 stores and continue to evolve and expand our offering across core categories to engage and excite the beauty enthusiasts.\n To drive growth and capture market share, we will continue to add relevant brands to our assortment. In recent weeks, we've executed one of our most anticipated brand launches ever, Fenty Beauty. Partnering with Rihanna and Fenty Beauty, we announced the news on February 17 through social channels, achieving higher mentioned volume and reach than any other Ulta Beauty brand launch announcement. The initial guest response was incredibly positive, trending as the #1 topic on Twitter the day of the announcement.\n Turning now to our second pillar, to evolve the guest experience through our personalized and connected omnichannel ecosystem, all in your world. Beauty enthusiasts are increasingly leveraging both physical and digital channels, and we have the power to connect and engage with them across the beauty journey and meet them wherever they are.\n In fiscal 2022, we intend to leverage our real estate pipeline to pilot a new in-store experience with a layout and flow that reflects our key merchandising strategies and consolidates guest services in a central location, test a small store format with an optimized assortment and service offering in a handful of small markets, enhance our buy anywhere fill anywhere efforts by expanding our same-day delivery option, continue to create leading digital experiences through the ongoing refresh of our digital store to provide guests with an experience that seamlessly merges content with commerce, the expansion of our virtual try-on capabilities and new capabilities resulting from our digital fund investments.\n We'll provide guests with more convenience through the launch of Afterpay as a payment option in stores and will expand the Ulta Beauty at Target shop in more than 250 new Target locations.\n As part of our efforts to expand our omnichannel ecosystem, last year, we joined forces with the Target Corporation to create a new way for guests to discover Prestige Beauty. In just 9 short months, the Ulta Beauty and Target teams worked together to design a space that feels authentic to both brands. We connected 2 independent loyalty programs. We made it easy for guests to link their accounts. And we onboarded more than 50 prestige and emerging brands.\n I am pleased to share that in our Ulta Beauty at Target location, customer awareness remains very strong. Guests are shopping across categories, and more than 1 million members have linked their Ultimate Rewards and Target Circle accounts. Building on this foundation, this year, our focus is on accelerating new member acquisition, optimizing the guest experience and continuing to amplify marketing as we scale.\n Moving now to our third pillar, expand and deepen our presence across the guest beauty journey, firmly placing Ulta Beauty at the heart of the beauty community. In fiscal 2022, we intend to further build upon our brand purpose and elevate our marketing efforts to include more action-based programming that address the needs of key audiences; expand live streaming and social selling; drive member growth and leverage data and analytics to increase the personalization of our communication, deepen engagement and shift share of wallet; and launch our retail media network, UB Media.\n Our fourth pillar is to drive operational excellence and optimization. We are investing in multiple significant cross-functional projects that require capital and resources, but position us to capture additional market share, fund enhancements to the guest experience and deliver future profitable growth.\n In fiscal 2022, we plan to execute the first phase of Project SOAR, our multiyear effort to upgrade our enterprise resource planning platform, migrate to Google Cloud as our data and analytics platform to facilitate data accessibility, enhanced reporting and faster decision-making, begin a 2-year effort to refresh our store POS systems and leverage our continuous improvement capability to identify, prioritize, activate and measure meaningful cross-functional process optimization opportunities.\n In support of our supply chain optimization efforts, this year, we plan to begin an upgrade and retrofit of our Greenwood distribution center, begin construction of our first market fulfillment center and implement new transportation tools to provide better visibility to loads in transit.\n Our winning culture is a key driver of Ulta Beauty's success. And our fifth strategic pillar is to protect and cultivate our world-class culture and talent. We strive to make Ulta Beauty a great place to work by leading with our hearts, caring for each other in everything we do and demonstrating integrity, authenticity and inclusivity daily.\n To reinforce our position as an employer of choice and enable us to continue to successfully navigate anticipated tight labor markets, this year, we intend to increase investments in training and development programs to enhance the guest experience, improve personnel performance and help associates manage their career, continue leveraging our diverse slate recruitment efforts, further enhance and optimize our talent acquisition processes, increase investment in development programs to help associates plan and develop their careers and continue to navigate the pandemic with safety at the forefront for all of our associates.\n Finally, our sixth strategic pillar is to expand our environmental and social impact. As the largest U.S. beauty retailer, we have the power to shape how the world sees beauty and responsibility to inspire positive change.\n Building on the progress we made in 2021, this year, we plan to continue to amplify underrepresented voices through media investments with multicultural platforms; the expansion of our MUSE platform and increased brand marketing support for black-owned, black-founded and black-led brands within our assortment; build an ecosystem to support the pipeline of BIPOC brands, including the creation of an accelerator program focused on early-stage BIPOC beauty brands to educate, inspire and support brand participants to prepare for retail readiness; and an investment in new voices, a venture capital firm that partners with and invests in entrepreneurs of color to drive scalable, sustainable businesses; continue to invest in training and internal programming to ensure our guests, associates and communities feel connected to and reflected at Ulta Beauty.\n And as we look to reduce our carbon footprint, we plan to expand our LED lighting retrofit program, double our investment in renewable energy credits and explore opportunities to collaborate with our brand partners to identify opportunities to reduce Scope 3 emissions together.\n We recently published our 2021 ESG report, which includes information about our strong corporate governance practices and commitment to operating an ethical business. In addition, it includes disclosures aligned with the SASB Index and TCFD as well as updated EEO-1 information.\n In closing, I am incredibly proud of what the Ulta Beauty team has accomplished and excited about the opportunities ahead. We operate in a healthy, culturally relevant and growing category. We have a strong proven business model, and we have a winning culture and simply outstanding associates. We have ambitious plans, and I am confident we have the right team to execute our strategies and deliver for our guests, associates and shareholders.\n And now, I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? Great. Dana, thanks for the question. And yes, certainly, we are tracking and monitoring closely the inflationary environment, and we understand the unique dynamics that we're facing. We recognize consumers are going to be facing headwinds from rising prices and other dynamics.\n I will say that as we look at the beauty category, even with these headwinds, we remain positive. The category is healthy. It is growing. It's emotionally important and connected to our consumers. We are in the midst, even as we face some of these inflationary pressures, that we're in the midst of opening of the economy, of the world around us, which is beneficial. We know consumers are working to maintain their self-care routine.\n And so despite the headwinds, we think the category is well positioned. And then uniquely, Ulta is well positioned because of our model. The fact that we are across all price points, all categories, mass, prestige, we are able to adjust and reflect evolving consumer needs as the world around us changes. Pricing has -- every year, there's pricing. Certainly, over the last few months, we've seen some pricing action in -- from some of our brands.\n A reminder, in our prestige side of the business, it tends to be MSRP. And so we're -- we would be reflective of where the broader market is going. But it hasn't been an extraordinary amount of price increase yet. And any benefit of that is certainly reflected in our guidance going forward. But as cost pressures increase, both on our business and our brand partners' business, we'll be clearly tracking this closely and making sure we're adjusting appropriately as we manage through the year. Great. Well, we are incredibly proud of our loyalty program. We have been for a long time. And I'm really, really pleased with the results that the team delivered in 2021 to reach a record level of 37 million active members, which is not only 13% ahead of 2020, but 6% ahead of 2019. So our guests are highly engaged. Reactivation rates and retention rates are very strong.\n We did see an increase in spend per member, which we're encouraged by. And that's driven by a number of factors as we continue to optimize the way we're engaging, leveraging our personalization efforts, providing more relevant, appropriate messages to our guests brought through our CRM capability. We've seen a category mix change.\n We've talked consistently through the year about the growth of fragrance. Some other like tools in our hair tools, some higher ticket items that have been driving very strong growth ahead of the total store. And so that's contributing to it. And I'd just say an overall connection to Ulta Beauty. I mentioned just the high level of unaided awareness, the strong emotional connection that we're building is driving greater share of wallet. And our efforts going forward will continue to drive that.\n As I look at the broader marketplace and share of wallet, and yes, there is expanded points of distribution on the prestige side of business, part of which is Ulta Beauty, both in our own stores and our partnership with Target. And I'm really pleased that in the fourth quarter, we gained share when we look across all of our points of distribution, including Target, despite hundreds of more new locations, competitive locations.\n So we're confident. We think we've got the right model, strong competitive position, most importantly, deep connection to our guests that's demonstrating stronger loyalty to Ulta Beauty. And we're going to leverage that to continue to drive growth and share growth into 2022. Great. Thanks, Oliver. Yes, there are some important topics in your questions. First, makeup, we are confident in the path ahead of makeup. And yes, and I'd say as we reflect back on the year, there were certainly some ups and downs. And what we continue to see is makeup, more than any other category, is sensitive to COVID fluctuations. And we saw that in the fourth quarter with Omicron and Delta and continued challenges there.\n But as I look forward on makeup, there are so many things that continue to encourage us. And we've seen some of these trends for a little while, but we've also -- as soon as we get momentum, we see some setbacks related to COVID. But broad macro trends of opening up and more opportunity for consumers to get back in the world, you know you're seeing it in back to work. We're seeing just a rapid acceleration in that. Events, activities, those things people getting out of their house are all exceptionally positive for the total category.\n We know all along that consumers have been passionate about makeup. Just there are opportunities -- their usage of opportunities have been more limited, but we see the passion in social media. The engagement continues to be high in all -- in TikTok and in Instagram and all other forms. So we know the connection is there. We know the opportunities are coming. We know there's important trends like the duality of natural looks and bolder looks, increased focus around eye and brow that even a resurgence of contouring, all these things are positive.\n And then you layer in for us our -- the outstanding work our merchandising team has done to continue to evolve our assortment. You -- I mentioned the launch of Fenty Beauty, which is just a really important step in our continued connection with our guests, and that is off to a very strong start. Launch of Chanel on the luxury side to tap into a new opportunity there. We have expansion in MAC, which is going quite well. And then a number of great brands. We're seeing innovation. I'll give you a couple of examples on MAC, a M\u00b7A\u00b7CStack Mascara that has 1 formula in 2 wands for both volume and precision.\n We've got a NYX Line Loud lip liner that's exclusive to Ulta Beauty that's performing well. We've got Morphe X Lucky Charms that's getting exclusive and driving engagement. And we've got Treslu\u0301ce by Becky G, which is a Mexican-American Singer celebrating her Latin root. So we have exclusivity, newness. We've big brands, emerging brands.\n And it ties to your last point, your question about BIPOC. We see success by these brands thriving. We're not here just to get these brands on the shelf. It's one thing to arrive on our shelves, it's another thing to thrive. And that's how we're measuring success. We want these brands to be -- perform well, to grow, to have great opportunities [indiscernible]. And that's how we're measuring it. And that's how I'd suggest you look at it. We're doing this to drive engagement with our, we're seeing it for our brands. So we're optimistic about beauty, about makeup. And BIPOC will be one of the elements that will help us drive growth going forward. Yes. What I will say, we won't get into like every period throughout the quarter. But for sure, what we see on makeup is a -- as anxiety around COVID has increased, has fluctuated through the last 2 years, we do see more pressure on makeup. And -- but now across the country, as more and more people both -- yes, some parts of the country have been more open than others, but there still has been a consumer concern, even as elements are open, that is easing right now across all parts of the country. And so that's encouraging to us.\n And that's what we think we need is more ongoing, consistent confidence to be back into work, be back at various activities and events. And as we see that, we know that's an element. It's not the only thing, but it's an important element to make up success going forward. Thank you for modeling the one question rule, Anthony. I appreciate that. And yes, we are thrilled with Fenty. It is in all stores. It is online. It is -- if you have a chance to go into any Ulta Beauty store, you'll see it right at the front of the store. In most of our stores right at the front, it has an entire the 18-foot run and an end cap broad assortment featuring Fenty among other things is known for the breadth of assortment in [ beige ] in particular. So you'll see that being able to test and try items.\n So -- and then strong, strong presence online. In fact, we really found some unique ways in our online footprint to bring that brand to life and communicate to our guests. And so off to a great start, really pleased with it. Really glad that Kendo organization has partnered with us in many ways and see this as a key part of our success going forward. I'm thrilled to have Rihanna and Fenty as part of the Ulta Beauty family for a long time to come. Well, let me give a little bit of color, and I'll ask Kecia to kind of follow -- give some more detail to build off her previous answer on this. But -- and we are just thrilled to be partnering with Target. We know there's been -- we're in the midst of a real transformation in the Prestige Beauty landscape.\n And the fact that in the fourth quarter, with hundreds of new locations across Prestige Beauty, across the location, the fact that Ulta Beauty continues to gain share we think is a reflection of the strength of our strategy, the execution that we brought both in stores, online and in our Target Ulta Beauty at Target relationship.\n We are delighting guests. We're gaining share even as there's other competitive activity. And we're confident we're going to be able to continue to do. But Kecia, do you want to give some specifics about number of stores and what the outlook looks like there? All right. Awesome. Thank you all for joining us today. Really appreciate it. In closing, I want to thank, again, our 40,000 associates for delivering a simply outstanding 2021 and with a relentless commitment to our guests, to each other and to moving our business forward.\n We all look forward to speaking to all of you again in May when we report our first quarter results. I hope you have a great evening. Thanks again for joining."

            "name": "Scott Settersten",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our financial results, I want to echo Dave's comments and express my sincere appreciation to all our Ulta Beauty associates for their focus on providing great guest experiences and managing the business, especially in such a dynamic operating environment. Their dedication to our guests and each other enabled us to deliver another strong quarter and an outstanding year for our shareholders.\n Now to our fourth quarter results, beginning with the income statement. Overall, results for the quarter were better than anticipated, primarily driven by stronger-than-expected holiday sales and a rational promotional environment. Sales growth across both physical and digital channels were stronger than expected, resulting in gross margin and less SG&A deleverage than planned. As a result, operating margin increased to 13.8% of sales for the quarter.\n Net sales for the quarter increased 24.1%, driven by 21.4% growth in comp sales and strong new store performance. Transactions for the quarter increased 10.4%, driven by double-digit growth in store traffic. And average ticket increased 9.9%, resulting from both a higher average selling price and an increase in units per transaction.\n Looking at the cadence of sales for the quarter. November was the strongest month, supported by our successful marketing efforts and guests' early holiday shopping. Post-holiday, overall growth moderated, driven primarily by a deceleration of store traffic, likely reflecting disruption from weather and the Omicron variant.\n During the quarter, we opened 6 new stores, relocated 3 stores and remodeled 1 store. Compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, total sales increased 18.4% and comp sales increased 15.4%. For the quarter, gross margin increased about 250 basis points to 37.6% of sales compared to 35.1% last year. The increase was primarily due to the leverage of fixed costs, favorable channel mix shifts and higher merchandise margin.\n Consistent with trends we experienced in the first 3 quarters of the year, in the fourth quarter, strong top line growth and benefits from our occupancy cost optimization efforts resulted in significant leverage of fixed costs. Channel mix was favorable as the penetration of e-commerce sales was about 600 basis points lower than last year. And merchandise margin improved, primarily due to lower promotional activity and ongoing benefits from our category management efforts.\n Comparing this year's performance to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, gross margin improved by 260 basis points. Higher merchandise margin and fixed cost leverage were partially offset by adverse channel mix.\n As planned, SG&A increased 26% to $650 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 40 basis points to 23.8% compared to 23.4% last year, primarily due to higher incentive compensation and store payroll and benefits, partially offset by leverage of marketing expense due to higher sales.\n Reflecting strong operational performance versus our internal targets, incentive compensation associated with our annual bonus program increased compared to last year. In addition, we elected to grant discretionary appreciation bonuses to our store associates in recognition of their efforts to deliver this outstanding performance. In total, higher incentive compensation drove about 60 basis points of deleverage in the quarter.\n Store payroll and benefits expense in the quarter was higher than last year, reflecting an increase in the number of store associates and higher average wage rates. Compared to fiscal 2019, SG&A as a percentage of sales was about 140 basis points unfavorable, primarily due to higher incentive compensation and marketing expense.\n Operating margin was 13.8% of sales compared to 10.2% of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 on a GAAP basis and 11.6% of sales on an adjusted basis. Strong top line growth, driven primarily by stores, combined with the impact of our ongoing cost optimization efforts, resulted in record level operating margin performance.\n The company's tax rate decreased to 22.9% compared to 23.4% in the fourth quarter last year. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to a benefit from the income tax accounting for share-based compensation and state tax credits. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased to $5.41 compared to $3.03 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in Q4 of last year was $3.41.\n To recap the full year, our teams delivered sales and profits that far exceeded pre-pandemic levels. Compared to fiscal 2019, sales increased 16.7% to $8.6 billion. Operating profit increased 44% to $1.3 billion or 15% of sales. And diluted EPS increased 48% to $17.98 per share.\n Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 28% to $1.5 billion compared to $1.2 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 44 net new stores, the increase reflects inventory purchases to support new brand launches, including OLAPLEX, Fenty and Chanel as well as proactive efforts to maintain strong in-stocks of key items to support expected demand and mitigate anticipated global supply chain disruptions.\n In fiscal 2021, we invested $172 million in capital expenditures, including approximately $89 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $60 million for supply chain and IT and about $23 million for store maintenance and other.\n Depreciation for the year was $268 million compared to $298 million last year, primarily reflecting the impact of last year's store impairments and store closures. Ulta Beauty continues to generate significant cash from operations. As we shared at our October Analyst Day, our priority for use of cash is to reinvest in the business to drive profitable growth. After investing to support growth, we will continue to look to return excess capital to shareholders.\n During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million shares at a cost of $760 million. We elected to accelerate repurchases in the fourth quarter to take advantage of better-than-expected cash flow.\n Since launching our stock buyback program in 2014, we've purchased 14 million shares at an average price of $275, effectively returning $3.9 billion to shareholders, while continuing to invest in strategic growth drivers. Having essentially completed the authorization announced in March of 2020, today, we announced a new share repurchase authorization for $2 billion.\n Turning now to our outlook. We are emerging from the pandemic as a stronger, healthier business. Over the last 2 years, we've strengthened category margins and improved our ability to optimize promotions. Our real estate portfolio is healthy and improving economics. Our e-commerce business is larger and more profitable. And we've strengthened our analytical capabilities and adjusted our cost structure.\n At our Analyst Day in October, we shared an updated growth algorithm with investors. Over the next 3 years, we expect to deliver net sales growth between 5% and 7% on a compound annual growth basis using fiscal 2019 as the base year; operating profit between 13% and 14% of sales; low double-digit diluted earnings per share growth on a CAGR basis, again using fiscal 2019 as the base year; and maintaining capital expenditures between 4% and 5% of sales.\n As we look to fiscal 2022, we continue to expect that sales growth and operating margin will be in line with these longer-term targets. Our EPS guidance of low to mid-single-digit growth reflects lapping extraordinary performance in fiscal 2021. Our guidance for fiscal 2022 also includes macro considerations, including continued wage pressures and higher supply chain costs as well as the impact of a more normalized investment agenda.\n Specifically, in fiscal 2022, we plan to open approximately 50 net new stores and remodel or relocate approximately 35 stores. We expect net sales will be between $9.05 billion and $9.15 billion, with comp sales growth between 3% and 4%. Our sales outlook reflects a more normalized growth trend for the beauty category, including a modest recovery in makeup, while also considering various uncertainties including inflationary risks to consumer spending and the impact of increasing points of distribution for Prestige Beauty.\n For your modeling purposes, we anticipate comp growth in the first half will be in the mid-single-digit range, driven by stronger growth in the first quarter and then moderate to low single-digit growth as we lap last year's recovery. We expect operating margin for the year will be between 13.7% and 14% of sales compared to 15% in fiscal 2021, with deleverage from both gross margin and SG&A. We anticipate operating margin deleverage will be greater in the first half as we lap last year's strong performance.\n We expect gross margin will be lower than fiscal 2021, driven primarily by lower merchandise margin resulting from the impact of new brand launches, lapping onetime benefits from favorable inventory reserve adjustments and a more normalized promotional environment. We also expect supply chain costs will increase more than sales, resulting in additional pressure on gross margin.\n We expect SG&A expense will deleverage, driven primarily by $70 million to $75 million of expenses related to our strategic priorities, including investments to support UB Media, Ulta Beauty at Target, Project SOAR and other IT capabilities as well as higher wage rate growth across the enterprise, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. These assumptions result in guidance for diluted earnings per share in the range of $18.20 to $18.70 per share, including the impact of approximately $900 million in share repurchases.\n We are not providing specific quarterly guidance. But as you update your financial models, consider that the second quarter will likely be our most challenging quarter of the year as we lap extraordinary performance in fiscal 2021. As a result, we are currently planning for EPS in the second quarter to decrease about 10%.\n Finally, we plan to spend between $375 million and $425 million in CapEx, including approximately $195 million for supply chain and IT; $150 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures; and about $55 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be between $250 million and $255 million. I would note that our guidance assumes no changes in federal tax rate environment and no material increases in the federal minimum wage.\n In closing, a rapidly recovering environment, combined with the outstanding efforts of our teams and the work we have done to strengthen the business, enabled us to deliver record performance in fiscal 2021. While lapping this performance will be difficult, we remain confident in our longer-term growth targets.\n Ulta Beauty has established significant long-term competitive advantages. And we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities within the $140 billion U.S. beauty products and salon services industry and continue to deliver long-term shareholder value.\n And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. Yes. Thanks, Chris. So I don't really think that there's any inconsistency in our messaging here. I think the variables at play are pretty consistent over the course of the year as you think about 2022, I would say. So again, it's back to merchandise margins, right, being under pressure in 2022 compared to what we've just been through the last year or so.\n With the promotional environment, we think it's going to get back to more normal kind of business environment and then incremental supply chain costs, including transportation costs and wages and our distribution centers being greater than our growth outlook is for next year. So a combination of those things driving deleverage.\n And then as we think about the year, I guess, as we said, second quarter is going to be the toughest. So again,first half of the year stronger, generally speaking, on operating margin than the second half. Partly that's being driven in the first quarter by stronger sales as we lap over. Last year at this time, we were just starting to come out of the depths of the pandemic.\n So sales, especially in the store fleet, stronger this year in the first quarter than they were a year ago. That drives a lot of leverage for us and helps gross margin and operating margin overall and then sequencing again, and I think we said in our prepared remarks, those impacts overall kind of moderate as we get deeper into the year."

            "name": "Kecia Steelman",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Kelly, for the question. As a retail leader, we're really aiming to deliver a seamless, omnichannel experience that meets our guests wherever they are. The newest element of this omnichannel strategy of the Ulta Beauty at Target is really providing us another way to engage and discover Ulta Beauty for a new guest set that's shopping at Target. The strategy is working.\n What I would share is that our existing Ultimate Rewards members, they're taking advantage of shopping at Ulta Beauty at Target, and we're also introducing this to some new guests. The guest response has been really positive. The awareness remains strong. As Dave mentioned in his comments, more than 1 million members have linked their Ultimate Rewards in Target Circle accounts, and we're signing up new members every week.\n Target shared at their recent financial community meeting that the productivity in their space is very high. So that's always a good indicator, too. And I would say that while it's still really early, we're really encouraged that we see new members bouncing back into Ulta Beauty, and their shopping behaviors are very similar to our existing loyalty members. So just to kind of wrap up, overall, we're very pleased. While this is still new, we're pleased with how this is playing out as part of our omni strategy going forward. Yes. What we've said, Adrienne, is a little over 250 this next year. We are in close partnership and we are following Target's remodel schedule. So that really kind of plays into timing, sequencing, et cetera, of how we're going about opening new stores. But the partnership is really strong.\n We're really pleased with our results. And the space -- the productivity in this space is high. It's a highly curated assortment with 50 key brand partners. And we're continuing to learn and evolve and grow as we continue to roll out more locations, but over 250 in the next year."

Dave? \nDavid Kimbell: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. The Ulta Beauty team delivered outstanding results again this quarter. For the third quarter, net sales increased 28.6% to a record $2 billion. Operating profit increased to 14.2% of sales, and diluted EPS increased to $3.94 per share. \n In addition to producing these excellent financial results, we also delivered strong operational results. We continue to increase our market share in Prestige Beauty based on dollar sales for the 13 weeks ended October 30, 2021, compared to the same period last year. We increased the number of members in our Ultimate Rewards loyalty program by 13% to a record 35.9 million members and returned to pre-pandemic member penetration levels. And we navigated global supply chain challenges and tight labor markets and remained well positioned to meet guest needs and deliver a successful holiday season. \n This performance reflects the strength and resiliency of the beauty category, the power of Ulta Beauty's differentiated model and the impact of our winning culture and outstanding team. I want to express my sincere appreciation to all of our Ulta Beauty associates for their incredible efforts to serve our guests and deliver these excellent results. I'm inspired every day by our associates' passion for beauty and passion for our guests, and I am honored to lead such a great company of talented associates who continue to care for each other while driving our business forward. \n At our Analyst Day in October, we introduced a new strategic framework, which will shape our future and enable Ulta Beauty to deliver against longer-term financial targets. Today, I'll reiterate some of the information we discussed about our strategic imperatives and share an update on progress made in the third quarter, then I'll share how we are positioning Ulta Beauty for holiday before I turn it over to Scott to discuss the financials. \n Starting with our focus on driving breakthrough and disruptive growth through an expanded definition of All Things Beauty. Our differentiated assortment is core to our success. And we continue to innovate, evolve and expand our offering to excite the beauty enthusiast. \n In the third quarter, all major categories delivered robust double-digit comp growth compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020, driven by cycling last year's disruption from COVID, product newness and strong performance from our strategic promotional events, including 21 Days of Beauty, [ Ahava ] and our Gorgeous Hair event. \n Compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, fragrance, bath, haircare and skincare all delivered strong double-digit comp growth. While makeup was slightly below 2019 levels, we are encouraged that the trend in Prestige Makeup improved from the second quarter, and growth in mass cosmetics remained strong. Engagement with the category remains high with consumers looking to refresh their beauty stash with new products, and recent trends give us confidence the makeup category will return to growth compared to pre-pandemic levels. \n Compared to last year, eyes, face and lip continued to deliver strong growth within the makeup category. Engagement with false lashes and lash growth serums, combined with innovation like creamy eye shadow sticks, are driving continued growth within eye. Increased interest in tinted moisturizers and blush are driving growth within face. And lip color, lip gloss and lip balm continue to drive growth within lip. \n Newness continues to excite and engage guests. New brands like Bobby Brown and Elaluz, combined with new product launches from a wide range of brands, including ColourPop, Urban Decay, Tarte and NYX drove nice growth in the quarter. In addition, this quarter, we expanded MAC into 200 additional stores. \n Haircare delivered another quarter of double-digit growth driven by strong guest engagement with our strategic events, newness and our Back Bar Takeover events. In early October, we kicked off our fall Gorgeous Hair event, a semiannual event strategically focused on acquiring members who do not shop the haircare category or engage with our salon services. Building on the success of our spring event, we continue to streamline offers, focus our marketing events and create relevant storytelling around hair goals, service enhancements and holiday kits. \n We saw good growth from our core assortment and engagement with new brands like KRISTIN ESS, Briogeo, and Verb. And product newness from brands like Dyson, Living Proof, Redken and Curlsmith continued to resonate with guests. We continue to expand our assortment of prestige haircare brands, and I'm excited to share we will launch OLAPLEX, the #1 prestige hair brand in the market, in all Ulta Beauty stores and on ulta.com in January. \n Our Back Bar Takeovers give our stylists the unique opportunity to introduce new brands and products to guests. And this quarter, salon takeovers by Bondi Boost, IGK, Verb and KRISTIN ESS all drove nice sales growth during their respective takeovers. \n Skincare delivered another quarter of strong double-digit sales growth as guests continue to invest in self-care and maintain their skincare regimens. Similar to last quarter, skincare routines, including moisturizers, serums and cleansers, drove category growth. New brands, including Drunk Elephant; Fresh; Good Molecules, which is exclusive to Ulta Beauty and peach slices; as well as new products from Tula, Clinique and The Ordinary drove solid guest engagement. \n Finally, our fragrance and bath category continued to deliver exceptional growth. Ariana Grande's latest fragrance, God is a Woman, which is exclusive to Ulta Beauty; as well as newness from Carolina Herrera; Coach; YSL and Dior, drove strong growth during the quarter. Events included in our back-to-school gift with purchase and our monthly Fragrance Crush program also drove strong engagement. Beyond fragrance, the bath and body category continues to drive robust growth as moisturizers and scrubs remain on trend. \n In addition to delivering growth from our core categories, we are focused on driving growth from key cross-functional platforms. Starting with Conscious Beauty, our cross-category initiative intended to help guests discover and engage with brands and products which reflect their personal values. Through this program, we identify brands across 5 key pillars: clean ingredients, cruelty free, vegan, sustainable packaging and positive impact. \n During the quarter, we certified 19 new brands, including LAMIK Beauty, WLDKAT and Better Not Younger, bringing the total number of certified conscious beauty brands to 275 at the end of Q3. During the third quarter, we expanded our certification to the SKU level for clean ingredients and vegan and added in-store badging at the shelf for certified brands as well as new search filters online to help guests easily identify products, which reflect what is most important to them. \n Moving now to our efforts to expand our assortment of black-owned and BIPOC brands. During the third quarter, we added 2 new black-owned brands, Sunday || Sunday and Nude Sugar, and we are on track to double the number of black-owned brands in our assortment this year. In addition, I am excited to share that we have welcomed our first South Asian owned makeup brand to the Ulta Beauty family, Live Tinted. Founded by Asian influencer Deepica Mutyala, Live Tinted is a cosmetic brand that celebrates multicultural beauty. The brand is also... \nOperator: [Technical Difficulty] \nDavid Kimbell: Hello, everyone. I think we're having -- we had a -- we were disconnected. I think we're having some phone network issues. But hopefully, you can hear me, and I'm going to pick up, I think, where we got cut off. So if I repeat a little bit, I apologize, but we'll dive right back in. \n So moving now to our efforts to expand our assortment of black-owned and BIPOC brands. During the third quarter, we added 2 new black-owned brands, Sunday || Sunday and Nude Sugar, and we are on track to double the number of black-owned brands in our assortment this year. In addition, I'm excited to share we have welcomed our first South Asian-owned makeup brand to the Ulta Beauty family, Live Tinted. Founded by Asian influencer, Deepica Mutyala, Live Tinted is a cosmetic brand that celebrates multicultural beauty. The brand is also a part of our conscious beauty platform certified as clean, vegan and cruelty-free. \n Based on our proprietary research, we know 65% of beauty enthusiasts believe beauty is significantly connected to wellness. Reflecting this consumer insight, in the second quarter, we launched the wellness shop online and in 450 stores. This cross-category platform offers self-care products for the mind, body and spirit in an accessible, easy-to-navigate way. In the third quarter, we refreshed the wellness shop assortment shifting from summer solutions to total body care and hydration, which is especially relevant during colder months and introduced new items from HAIRtamin, [ Alum ], OSEA and Josie Maran. \n Turning now to our efforts to evolve the guest experience through our personalized and connected omnichannel ecosystem, All in Your World. We know the guest journey is increasingly blurring across physical and digital channels, and we aim to deliver a cohesive omnichannel strategy to serve our guests. During Q3, we enhanced our omnichannel strategy in 4 ways. \n First, we launched Beauty to Go, our promise that buy online, pick up in store orders will be picked up and ready to go within 2 hours or less, giving our guests fast, convenient access to the beauty they want most. We also continue to test incentive strategies to encourage guest utilization. During the third quarter, BOPIS orders increased 28% compared to last year, totaling 20% of e-commerce sales in the quarter compared to 16% last year. \n Second, partnering with DoorDash, we launched same-day delivery in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston and Boise, and we're excited about the value and convenience that will provide guests this holiday season. \n Third, in October, we launched 2 exclusive salon services in all stores and relaunched skin services in select stores. Starting with salons. We have partnered with OLAPLEX to offer guests a professional bond repair service, which reverses damage caused by hair color, chemical treatment, heat and styling and the environment. And we have partnered with Redken to introduce a new express root touch-up service that offers guests 100% gray coverage color in only 10 minutes. These new exclusive services are bringing new guests into our salon. \n We also relaunched skin services in 100 locations featuring a revamped menu with new services to address specific guest concerns, such as hydration, anti-aging and acne. While it's still early, we are pleased with how guests are engaging with these new offerings. \n Finally, we launched Ulta Beauty at Target in 92 stores and online during the third quarter, and I am pleased to share we have reached our fiscal year goal of opening more than 100 shops. We are excited about this innovative partnership and how, together with Target, we will change the way guests experience beauty. While it will take time for us to understand what role this new distribution point will play for our guests, we are incredibly pleased with the ongoing customer excitement and encouraged to see Ultimate Reward members linking their accounts with Target Circle as well as new members signing up through the shop. \n Moving on to our efforts to expand and deepen our presence across the guest beauty journey as the heart of the beauty community. We are focused on how to best elevate consumer connection, supercharge, member acquisition and drive guest loyalty, love and share of wallet. \n In the third quarter, we continue to elevate our storytelling with relevant content across channels to launch Ulta Beauty at Target and to support our strategic events. In addition, as students return to classrooms after more than a year of virtual learning, we saw an opportunity to deepen our engagement with Gen Z audiences across channels with insight-driven campaigns during key back-to-school moments. \n We ended the third quarter with 35.9 million active members, 13% above last year and 6% above 2019. While we continue to add new members, member growth this quarter was largely driven by a reactivation of lapsed members and active member retention. \n After experiencing headwinds last year due to the disruption from the pandemic, we have accelerated personalization to create stronger life cycle strategies, build baskets and maximize business returns, and we are very pleased with the results. We are driving strong conversion of new members in stores and online. We are successfully reengaging members who lapsed during the pandemic, and we are driving stronger engagement from our existing members. Importantly, our member retention rates have recovered to pre-pandemic levels, and spend per member is at an all-time high. \n Shifting now to our plans and expectations for holiday. Based on our consumer insights, we expected many guests would start their holiday shopping earlier this year, and we proactively took steps to ensure we were ready with holiday sets, stocking stuffers and unique collaborations to help guests get a head start on their gifting needs. \n If holiday 2020 was about less, holiday 2021 is about more, more fun, more in real life gatherings, more gifting and more glamming. All of our teams at Ulta Beauty are ready and excited to help our guests celebrate more this year. Like last year, we kicked off the holiday season in early November with our Hello Holidays campaign, early Black Friday deals and new loyalty offers. With authentic stories of connection and joy across video, digital, social and print platforms to encourage and motivate beauty enthusiasts to shop Ulta Beauty, we'll be everywhere our guests are this holiday season. \n Our merchant teams have built an outstanding holiday assortment with giftable fun items across categories and price points. With new brands like Bobby Brown, Drunk Elephant and Briogeo, expanded assortments from brands like Laura Mercier, Florence and Pattern and exciting holiday offerings from brands like Dyson, Tarte, Ariana Grande, Truly and our very own Ulta Beauty Collection, we have great gifts for everyone. \n To help guests explore our best holiday gifts, we developed a unique digital experience to allow for easy discovery of holiday gifts online and in-store. When guests visit ulta.com or scan the QR codes on a banner at the front of our store, an app click will launch giving the guest an opportunity to easily explore top gifts by category. Our stores are always the center of holiday at Ulta Beauty. \n As we combine our great in-store experience with our innovative omnichannel capabilities, we'll meet every guest wherever and however they want to shop Ulta Beauty. To help guests get ready for in real-life celebrations, we've expanded salon capacity to 100% in all Ulta Beauty salons and benefit brow bars except where limited by state or local mandates, and we've relaunched skin services in select stores. \n Finally, our BOPIS, curbside and same-day delivery options, will provide guests with great shopping convenience this holiday season. Our teams are excited, engaged and ready to support our guests from proactively managing inventory flow and anticipating supply chain challenges to stress testing our IT systems and digital platforms to successfully accelerating our holiday hiring. The holiday season is off to a strong start, and I am confident we are well positioned to deliver another successful holiday season at Ulta Beauty. \n In closing, we are excited about the strength we are seeing in our business. Our third quarter performance exceeded our initial expectations, and we are encouraged by the early holiday trends. The beauty category is recovering, and our teams are executing well. We are investing and innovating to ensure Ulta Beauty will lead the new beauty landscape, and we are confident our well-defined strategy will enable us to capture more market share and drive profitable growth. \n And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? \nScott Settersten: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported stronger-than-expected third quarter results, and I would like to echo Dave's comments and express my appreciation to all our Ulta Beauty associates for delivering another outstanding quarter. \n Starting with the income statement. Q3 sales increased 28.6% driven by double-digit growth in comp sales and strong new store performance. Total company comp increased 25.8% primarily driven by strong transaction growth in stores. In addition to robust sales growth from stores, e-commerce exceeded our expectations delivering modest growth on top of last year's 90% growth. Total company transactions for the quarter increased 16.8%. Average ticket increased 7.7%, primarily due to an increase in average selling price, reflecting favorable category mix shifts and lower promotional levels. \n During the quarter, we opened 7 new stores and closed 1 store. We also remodeled 3 stores and relocated 2 stores. Compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, total sales increased 19%, and comp sales increased 14.3%. From a mix perspective, makeup was 45% of sales compared to 47% last year. Haircare products and styling tools were 21% of sales compared to 20% last year. Skincare was 16% of sales, flat with last year. And the fragrance and bath category increased 200 basis points to 12% of sales. \n Q3 gross profit margin increased 450 basis points to 39.6% of sales compared to 35.1% last year. The increase was primarily due to leverage of fixed costs, channel mix shifts, leverage of salon expenses and higher margin merchandise margin. \n Consistent with what we experienced in the first half of this year, strong top line growth and benefits from our occupancy cost optimization efforts resulted in significant leverage of fixed costs. E-commerce sales penetration in Q3 was about 500 basis points lower than last year as we cycled last year's strong e-commerce growth. As a percentage of sales, salon expenses also leveraged, reflecting strong top line sales and lower costs from the elimination of the salon manager role. As a reminder, we will anniversary this change in Q4. \n The improvement in merchandise margin was primarily the result of higher sales, lower promotional activity and ongoing benefits from our category management efforts. Comparing this year's performance to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, gross margin improved by 250 basis points. Higher merchandise margin, fixed cost leverage and leverage of salon expenses were partially offset by adverse channel mix. \n As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased to 25.2% and compared to 26.8% last year. Strong top line growth drove leverage of corporate overhead, store expenses and store payroll and benefits. This leverage was partially offset by deleverage from marketing expense, primarily reflecting increased spend on print advertising compared to the third quarter last year. \n Last year, we significantly reduced our spend on print material in Q3 due to the pandemic. This year, our cadence of print was more normalized. And as Dave mentioned earlier, we are leveraging our CRM capabilities to optimize circulation and increase the profitability of our print vehicles. Compared to Q3 of fiscal 2019, SG&A as a percentage of sales was about 150 basis points favorable. As a percentage of sales, lower store expenses, store payroll and benefits and corporate overhead were partially offset by higher marketing expense. \n Operating margin was 14.2% of sales compared to 6.5% of sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 on a GAAP basis and 8% of sales on an adjusted basis. Strong top line growth driven primarily by stores, combined with the impact of our ongoing cost optimization efforts, including promotional optimization, delivered strong operating margin results. \n The company's tax rate decreased to 24.1% compared to 25.1% in the third quarter last year. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to favorable provision to tax return adjustments driven by federal employment tax credits compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020. \n Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased to $3.94 compared to $1.32 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in Q3 of last year was $1.64. \n Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion of inventory compared to $1.4 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 40 additional stores, the increase in inventory reflects our proactive efforts to mitigate holiday sales risk due to anticipated supply chain disruptions. Where appropriate, our teams work closely with our brand partners to prioritize receipts to ensure we have adequate inventory of core and seasonal product to support expected demand for the holiday season. \n Capital expenditures were $51.1 million for the quarter, driven by investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, supply chain and IT systems. Depreciation was $65.2 million compared to $72.4 million last year, primarily reflecting the impact of last year's store impairments and store closures. \n We ended the quarter with $605.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. In the third quarter, we repurchased 341,000 shares at a cost of $126.4 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $759.8 million remaining under our current $1.6 billion repurchase authorization. We continue to expect to repurchase approximately 850 million of shares in fiscal 2021, but as always, have the flexibility to modify the cadence of repurchases in response to market conditions. \n Turning now to our updated outlook for 2021. We are very pleased with our year-to-date results through Q3 and are encouraged by the strong trends we've experienced so far in the fourth quarter. However, we recognize we still have several significant sales weeks left in the holiday season, and the operating environment continues to be dynamic. Despite these uncertainties, we have increased our financial expectations for the year. We now expect net sales for the year will be between $8.5 billion and $8.6 billion with comp sales growth forecasted in the 36% to 37% range. This guidance reflects our expectation that fourth quarter comp growth will be between 15% and 20%. For the year, we plan to open approximately 44 net new stores and remodel or relocate 17 stores. \n We now expect operating margin rate for fiscal 2021 will be between 14.3% and 14.5% of sales. We continue to believe the largest driver of our operating margin expansion will come from gross margin, driven by leverage of fixed costs, less headwind from channel shift, improving merchandise margin and leverage of salon costs. \n Based on higher top line growth, we now expect to leverage SG&A more than previously expected as compared to fiscal 2020. Based on these assumptions, we now expect diluted earnings per share will be between $16.70 and $17.10 per share, including the impact of approximately $850 million in share repurchases. \n We now expect to spend between $200 million and $225 million in CapEx in fiscal 2021, including approximately $100 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $80 million for supply chain and IT and about $34 million for store maintenance and other. As a reminder, our guidance for fiscal 2021 assumes a consistent federal tax rate and no material increases in the federal minimum wage. \n Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to address a few follow-up questions we received from our October Analyst Day event. First, our longer-term financial targets. In October, we shared targets for revenue and earnings growth, which we are confident we can deliver through fiscal 2024 based on the limited visibility we have in the dynamic operating environment. As a reminder, we are targeting net sales growth between 5% and 7% and diluted earnings per share growth in the low double-digit range on a compound annual growth basis using fiscal 2019 as base through fiscal 2024. \n In addition, we are targeting operating profit margins in the 13% to 14% range over the next 3 years. Our operating margin expectations reflect a balanced and disciplined approach to strategic investments that will support our long-term growth aspirations and deliver strong shareholder returns. \n Regarding the timing of investments related to Project SOAR, our multiyear effort to upgrade our enterprise resource planning or ERP platform. We expect to invest $160 million to $180 million in capital over the next 3 years, with most of the investment planned for fiscal 2022 and 2023. As a reminder, in addition to providing us with more flexible and scalable operating environment, this new platform will support future growth and innovation. We expect to begin to see operational benefits from this investment in fiscal 2023. \n Lastly, we are still finalizing our budget for fiscal 2022 and plan to provide financial guidance in line with our regular cadence on our March earnings call. However, we wanted to share some initial thoughts to consider as you update your financial models. \n Comp sales growth in fiscal 2021 is expected to be significantly stronger than we initially planned, but we remain confident we can deliver comp sales growth in fiscal 2022 within our longer-term targeted range of 3% to 5%. While we expect fiscal 2021 operating margin will be modestly above our longer-term target, we expect operating margin in fiscal 2022 will be within our longer-term targeted range of 13% to 14%, reflecting a more normalized pace of top line growth and capital and operational investment. We continue to target EPS growth in fiscal 2022 despite the challenge of cycling this year's stimulus payments and reopening of the economy, but acknowledge the earnings growth rate next year will likely be lower than our longer-term target. \n And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: At the time that you provided your longer-term guidance, you were expecting to have a 13% operating margin this year. You're now on pace to have the mid-14% operating margin, and yet you still expect your operating margin to be within your guidance for next year. So will you be investing more than you had originally planned for 2022? And as part of that, if you do better than the 3% to 5% sales -- comp sales increase that you're anticipating for next year, would you let that flow to the bottom line and have better-than-expected margins? \nScott Settersten: Yes. So to the first part of your question, Michael, what we're talking about today is consistent with how we framed it up at our Analyst Day in the later part of October. So again, over the longer term, we're very confident we can deliver operating margin in the 13 to 14 percentage range. We, again, reiterated today, that's a function of what we expect to be a more moderate top line sales growth environment next year, coupled with a more normalized investment cycle for the company, and that's with people cost and all the capital costs that go along with all those new great strategic initiatives that we have well underway now. \n So as we think about potential sales overperformance next year, which, again, we would hope to see that, we would continue to take what we always have as a very disciplined, pragmatic approach to long-term investment to drive healthy growth in the business balanced against short-term operating results. So again, just making sure we take a very balanced approach to that as we have in the past, and you can expect that to continue into the future. \nDavid Kimbell: And Michael, I'd just add to what Scott said, just to reiterate what we talked about at Analyst Day that we are very optimistic about the path ahead. That's reflected in that long-term guidance. We believe we'll be growing faster than the market. The initiatives, both in our core business today as well as new programs and initiatives that we'll be adding over next year and the years ahead, give us a lot of confidence that we'll be leading the category and delivering profitable growth over that time frame. And as we shared at Analyst Day, we see a lot of confidence in that path ahead. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. \nLorraine Maikis: I wanted to follow up on the comments you made around cosmetics. Are you seeing any newness that you're excited about? And what do you think will be the catalyst to move the comp into positive territory versus 2019? \nDavid Kimbell: Great. Thanks, Lorraine. Yes, makeup, obviously, is an important topic for us and one that we're very focused on, and I'd reiterate our confidence in the category. It is -- as I said in the remarks, it is not performing at the level that our other categories, skincare, haircare, bath, fragrance, which are all delivering double-digit comp versus 2020. It has not caught up to that level of growth. But even with that, we feel encouraged by what we're seeing. \n Our mass side of the business remains double-digit growth versus 2019 and is performing well. And our prestige business improved in the quarter, and we saw some real pockets of growth and success. And I think it's a combination of things, both currently driving the business and as we look forward. We continue to see strong innovation and growth from a number of brands, brands across the spectrum from Clinique and NARS and Lanc\u00f4me to NYX and Maybelline. We're expanding MAC into 200 additional stores to have it in over 500 of our stores. We've launched new brands like Bobby Brown, and we're seeing newness from Laura Mercier, ColourPop, Urban Decay, Tarte. And so it is -- there's a robust pipeline, and it's hitting across all price points. \n When I look at some of the trends that we see in the market and we believe will drive the business into next year. There's a number of things that, again, encourage us. We see really a duality of looks that's going on right now, a combination -- many consumers looking to a combination of both natural looks and bolder looks. Looks, the bolder looks that reflect kind of this idea of individual expression, bold colors with innovation, innovative formulas, color boost that bright impactful, particularly around the eye. And that's -- that combination of people looking to do both, natural and bolder colors, is really positive. \n We've talked about skinification for a while, bringing moisturizing benefits or lightweight concealers or other elements that combine those categories. There's evolved application techniques, including what we kind of see as kind of next generation of contouring that's been driven by TikTok and other social media, which we think is encouraging. New product forms, including long wear lip. We've been looking at inclusive beauty for a while, and that's continuing to drive across all different types of skin tones, again, driven by influence and TikTok. And mascara and lashes is another space I've mentioned that we're seeing innovation and growth. A combination of both using more -- with more than one product or having different mascaras for different events and different times a day. \n So a number of things that are coming together that are helping improve the category and give us confidence as we look forward. So as we look at the -- both the trend impact in the total category and the pipeline that we have, both of existing brands and new brands on the horizon in 2022, we feel confident in the path ahead and are working every day to drive that business forward. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: Dave, I want to ask about OLAPLEX. Would you be willing to share with us how it could stack up relative to some of the prior big launches? Maybe Kylie. I wrote down Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me. You also considered getting into pro hair color. And then this is Part 3, but I assume you're not going to give this product to Target right away, but curious how that works. \nDavid Kimbell: Well, yes, I'm not going to give you real, like, exact specifics of how any one launch would match up with others, other than to say we're thrilled about our partnership with OLAPLEX. We're already in partnership. We have been for several weeks now with our salon service, and that's performing exceptionally well, exceeding our expectations. Our guests are thrilled by it. And importantly, our stylist are thrilled by it. And so it's -- that's gotten out of the gates really strong. And as we move into January to be able to launch the product line in all stores, in online, a complete assortment of OLAPLEX. \n As I mentioned in the remarks, and you know it's the #1 prestige haircare brand, and so we anticipate that it will have a big impact on our hair business and continue to support and drive our salon business. So we're excited about it, and we're putting the unique capabilities of Ulta Beauty behind the launch, a real 360 marketing program, leveraging our almost 36 million members and all the marketing tools and capabilities and partnership with just a fantastic OLAPLEX team. So excited about that launch and looking forward to taking the next step of that in January. \n And then as far as other -- extending into Target, we look at every brand and every opportunity, and nothing here to specifically talk about as it relates to OLAPLEX. But Target is -- we're excited about, and we'll continue to evolve that assortment over time. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. \nMatthew Norton: Matt Norton on for Steve Forbes here. I wanted to ask about the Target partnership. We know it's early but wanted to ask if you guys have seen any categorical differences, any customer demographic differences, spend for member frequency? Anything of that nature would be helpful. \nKecia Steelman: I'll take that with one, Matt. This is Kecia. It's really too early to comment on the results as we really want to see a few purchase cycles to confirm the role of this new addition, how it plays for our guests. \n We think about purchase cycle similar to what we see with our members who really typically shop Ulta Beauty 3 to 4x a year. So it's going to take a little bit more time because we just opened these stores at the beginning of August. Longer term, we do believe this partnership is going to really enable us to expand our loyalty members, increase our engagement, ultimately increase our spend per member. But bottom line, our partnership brings together these 2 powerhouse retailers to really reimagine prestige. We're really off to a strong start. We're excited to see what the holiday season brings, but we'll be able to update you after a few more shopping cycles here. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nMichael Binetti: Scott, can we talk a little bit more about the gross margin? You helped us a lot with some of the drivers there in merch margin, the fixed cost leverage, salon leverage and I think you said a little bit of an offset from the channel mix headwinds. But you gave some comments on the merch margin as well. But as we think of where you are today, are there elements there that you're seeing in the gross margin this year that are -- that help you form a new baseline to grow off of going forward? Or would you point us to some of those elements that you think you need to give back? And I know you've done a lot of work on things like promotional levels and merch margin. You just told us the revenues will grow, so maybe there should be some fixed cost leverage still next year. I'm just wondering, as we take your comments and try to put them out to '22, if there's things we should think about as offsets there as well? \nScott Settersten: Yes, I don't think there's anything incrementally new, I guess, I could share. It's really a combination of all the variables that we've been talking about with investors and with the analyst for quite some time. So it all kind of gets back to our EFG efforts, right? So a lot of great work has been done by our teams over the last couple of years across a wide variety of cost targets across our business. We talked about occupancy costs. We've been talking about promotional effectiveness. We've been talking about core end-to-end process opportunities. We've been talking about supply chain investments for the future. So there's a lot of variables at play here. \n We're, I think, producing very good results this year under very difficult circumstances. So all this good work now is starting to bear fruit for us. So again, I would say those are the building blocks that we start with as we started thinking about our longer-term plan. And then as you heard us describe at Analyst Day, now we're into 2.0, I guess, I would call it, with our continuous improvement initiatives, right? And so building highly skilled resources internally here that can help us get after some of those harder to capture benefits. And of course, some of the new infrastructure investments that we talked about as well at Analyst Day, especially in Project SOAR, which is really a multigenerational opportunity for us to reimagine business flows across the business and improve our processes and take a lot of inefficiencies out of the business here. But again, some of that takes time. \n So as we're thinking about the next 3 years or so, EFG core benefits will continue to deliver good cost optimization for us in the near term, and then CI with SOAR will drive longer-term benefits for us. So we still think there's plenty of opportunity to keep operating margins in a very healthy 13% to 14% range here over the longer term. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. \nMark Astrachan: I guess maybe I could try to just squeeze in a follow-up on Target and then another question. Maybe if you could just talk about any sort of thoughts on what consumers are buying there relative to kind of expectations, that would be helpful. And then just a bigger question, the brand owners seem to be reporting, what I guess I would call, kind of stickier D2C sales on their own website relative certainly to pre-pandemic levels. It would obviously seem like given your growth, these are incremental consumers to the category. So I'm curious how you're thinking about dealing with the partners as a supplier but also the customers -- or I mean the suppliers -- your suppliers, I should say, and then how they're dealing with their own customers and how kind of those 2 things interplay in your business over time? Do you think that's incremental? Do you think that's potentially something that you've got to watch for going forward? Because, obviously, as I said, it hasn't seemed to have an impact so far. \nDavid Kimbell: Great. Thanks, Mark. I'll start with your second question and then Kecia can give any more color on the Target part of that. But on DTC, it's -- that's not new, not new this year. That's been DTC. That's been building for a while, and so we really look at that as something that we're obviously monitoring and watching but also see as a development in the competitive landscape that we can manage through. And in fact, DTC, most of -- many of the DTC brands have found the importance of physical retail, and many of them have chosen to partner with Ulta Beauty. So start DTC and come into Ulta Beauty. Ulta Beauty brands, some larger brands kind of building a DTC brand presence, which we know is happening. \n But we see -- our model has been very different. The guest experience, the combination of in-store and online, our loyalty program, the breadth of products across price points, the depth within brands and segments and categories, the salon services, everything that we offer. The competitive differentiation that we have really separates us from our other retailers and from DTC. And as I said, many DTC are partnering with us, whether they're long-time established brands or newer brands, and so we're watching that landscape. But for us, it's like we think with any competitive evolution in the category, we play offense. We do what we do best. We adjust and adapt, but we look to drive our business forward in a really differentiated way, and I think that's what's been driving our business so far this year. Kecia, any more color you want to add on the Target? \nKecia Steelman: Yes, absolutely. What we're seeing is that they're shopping the entire assortment. You have to remember, this was a highly curated assortment of pure SKUs, best-selling items, must-have minis. So we are really pleased that they are shopping the entire shop-in-shop, which is what the intention was. Was it not just to help them shop one category to get a taste of what Ulta Beauty has to offer as a whole in the shop. So I'd say bottom line, they're really shopping the entire assortment. We like what we're seeing so far. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad with Evercore. \nOmar Saad: Great quarter. Appreciate all the color and especially the kind of initial look at what you think comps and sales could look like in 2022. I really want to kind of get a better understanding of what underlies that confidence behind what you think is a plus 3% to 5% kind of long-term algorithm on top of what's obviously going to be a very big number this year. I think investors expect some of these franchise. They've done so well this year to give back some of those gains next year. But obviously, you guys don't see it that way. Would love to know if it's -- whether it's reactivating existing customers or new customers coming in or the trends around product innovation. Would love to get a better sense of why you expect to grow on top of this great growth next year. \nDavid Kimbell: Great. Omar, thanks for the question. Yes, I'd really -- I guess I'd answer that by looking back at what we shared at Analyst Day and the comprehensive nature of our strategic approach. There isn't any one thing that gives us confidence. And yes, we are having a very strong year, recovering out of the challenges of 2020 and increasing versus 2019. But by no means do we think this is kind of the end of the road. We actually see this is us strengthening and leading the category recovery. We think the category itself is going to be healthy beauty category in 2022 and beyond. And we think our differentiated model will continue to lead that category, gain share and drive growth for us. So it is the combination of an exceptional differentiated assortment. Nobody has the collection of products that we have, and we've brought a lot of newness in this year, some of that hitting even late in the year like OLAPLEX hitting in January that we'll be driving. And we've got a pipeline that I'm excited about going into 2022, and we'll be sharing that as time is appropriate. So assortment always drives our business. \n Our loyalty program recovered from 2020, frankly, faster than we thought. And we think that's a great sign that what we believe what's going on in 2020 when we took a step back was not because they didn't like Ulta, just the disruption in their lives, and they've shown us that retention is high. We're acquiring new members. We're bringing lapsed members back in, and we see many more beauty enthusiasts to capture -- we see that growth happening across age groups. You know -- you've heard us talk about our strength with Gen Z as one example, and we see a lot of opportunity to continue to gain with our loyalty program. \n And then frankly, the unique combination of digital and physical. We believe guests are showing us demonstrating with their loyalty and their spend that they really do prefer what all the data says, and they're showing us with their dollars they prefer to shop a combination of physical and digital. That's why our e-com actually grew in Q3 after such strong growth in 2020, even as our stores show exceptional growth versus 2020. So that experience and our continued innovation and evolution across both digital and physical, we believe is where the consumer is going, and we're leading in that as well. And then all the other initiatives, our program with Target, of course, is massive, new programs like Ulta Beauty UB Media. So we think we've got a pipeline. Growth won't be what it is this year, and that's reflected. But we're going to lead this category, and it's going to take -- it will be a unique combination of what makes us differentiated that gives us confidence. \nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: So Scott, I guess I just wanted for Q4, just dig into more how you're thinking about operating margins. So maybe if you can just talk more about the puts and takes on the gross margin and SG&A line. \nScott Settersten: Sure. Thanks for the question. So big picture, operating margin versus 2020, it's going to be flattish in the fourth quarter. And versus 2019, we'd see some deleverage in operating margin. Again, both of those will have a mix of gross margin expansion and SG&A deleverage. So gross margin goodness coming from all the things we've talked about this year, fixed store cost leverage, merchandise margin improvements versus 2020. Channel mix is a benefit for us versus last year. Channel mix, more of a headwind versus 2019. So gross margin leverage for both years. \n On the SG&A line, again, deleverage for both years. 2020 not as significant as it is versus 2019. Again, 2020, consistent with all the things we've been talking about all year with the addition of incentive compensation, I guess I would say, is more significant in the fourth quarter than earlier in the year. And then when we compare it back to 2019, store labor and wages, not only hours, but wage rates are up significantly versus 2019. Incentive comp, again, is a bigger impact versus 2019. If you remember, 2019, we were short of our targets in 2021. It's a bit of a different story, and then marketing expense as well. Again, more investment versus 2019 when we were kind of battening down the hatches, I guess I would say, in a tougher environment. And this year, we're taking advantage of tailwinds and investing in market awareness activities to, again, capture more market share over the long term. So that's what I would say a short story. Again, super excited and happy with the results so far this year through Q3 and very encouraged and excited about the kickoff to the fourth quarter. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn this call back over to Mr. Dave Kimbell for closing remarks. \nDavid Kimbell: Great. Well, thank you for joining us today, and I want to thank all of our Ulta Beauty associates across our stores, distribution centers and corporate offices who are working hard to ensure we deliver an outstanding guest experience this holiday season and who are committed to taking good care of our guests and each other every single day. As I said in the past, we have the absolute best team in retail, and I am so proud to lead this great team. \n We hope you all have a safe and joyous holiday season, and we look forward to speaking to all of you again in March when we report our fourth quarter and full year results. Have a great evening. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Kimbell",
            "content": "Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. The Ulta Beauty team delivered outstanding results again this quarter. For the third quarter, net sales increased 28.6% to a record $2 billion. Operating profit increased to 14.2% of sales, and diluted EPS increased to $3.94 per share. \n In addition to producing these excellent financial results, we also delivered strong operational results. We continue to increase our market share in Prestige Beauty based on dollar sales for the 13 weeks ended October 30, 2021, compared to the same period last year. We increased the number of members in our Ultimate Rewards loyalty program by 13% to a record 35.9 million members and returned to pre-pandemic member penetration levels. And we navigated global supply chain challenges and tight labor markets and remained well positioned to meet guest needs and deliver a successful holiday season. \n This performance reflects the strength and resiliency of the beauty category, the power of Ulta Beauty's differentiated model and the impact of our winning culture and outstanding team. I want to express my sincere appreciation to all of our Ulta Beauty associates for their incredible efforts to serve our guests and deliver these excellent results. I'm inspired every day by our associates' passion for beauty and passion for our guests, and I am honored to lead such a great company of talented associates who continue to care for each other while driving our business forward. \n At our Analyst Day in October, we introduced a new strategic framework, which will shape our future and enable Ulta Beauty to deliver against longer-term financial targets. Today, I'll reiterate some of the information we discussed about our strategic imperatives and share an update on progress made in the third quarter, then I'll share how we are positioning Ulta Beauty for holiday before I turn it over to Scott to discuss the financials. \n Starting with our focus on driving breakthrough and disruptive growth through an expanded definition of All Things Beauty. Our differentiated assortment is core to our success. And we continue to innovate, evolve and expand our offering to excite the beauty enthusiast. \n In the third quarter, all major categories delivered robust double-digit comp growth compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020, driven by cycling last year's disruption from COVID, product newness and strong performance from our strategic promotional events, including 21 Days of Beauty, [ Ahava ] and our Gorgeous Hair event. \n Compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, fragrance, bath, haircare and skincare all delivered strong double-digit comp growth. While makeup was slightly below 2019 levels, we are encouraged that the trend in Prestige Makeup improved from the second quarter, and growth in mass cosmetics remained strong. Engagement with the category remains high with consumers looking to refresh their beauty stash with new products, and recent trends give us confidence the makeup category will return to growth compared to pre-pandemic levels. \n Compared to last year, eyes, face and lip continued to deliver strong growth within the makeup category. Engagement with false lashes and lash growth serums, combined with innovation like creamy eye shadow sticks, are driving continued growth within eye. Increased interest in tinted moisturizers and blush are driving growth within face. And lip color, lip gloss and lip balm continue to drive growth within lip. \n Newness continues to excite and engage guests. New brands like Bobby Brown and Elaluz, combined with new product launches from a wide range of brands, including ColourPop, Urban Decay, Tarte and NYX drove nice growth in the quarter. In addition, this quarter, we expanded MAC into 200 additional stores. \n Haircare delivered another quarter of double-digit growth driven by strong guest engagement with our strategic events, newness and our Back Bar Takeover events. In early October, we kicked off our fall Gorgeous Hair event, a semiannual event strategically focused on acquiring members who do not shop the haircare category or engage with our salon services. Building on the success of our spring event, we continue to streamline offers, focus our marketing events and create relevant storytelling around hair goals, service enhancements and holiday kits. \n We saw good growth from our core assortment and engagement with new brands like KRISTIN ESS, Briogeo, and Verb. And product newness from brands like Dyson, Living Proof, Redken and Curlsmith continued to resonate with guests. We continue to expand our assortment of prestige haircare brands, and I'm excited to share we will launch OLAPLEX, the #1 prestige hair brand in the market, in all Ulta Beauty stores and on ulta.com in January. \n Our Back Bar Takeovers give our stylists the unique opportunity to introduce new brands and products to guests. And this quarter, salon takeovers by Bondi Boost, IGK, Verb and KRISTIN ESS all drove nice sales growth during their respective takeovers. \n Skincare delivered another quarter of strong double-digit sales growth as guests continue to invest in self-care and maintain their skincare regimens. Similar to last quarter, skincare routines, including moisturizers, serums and cleansers, drove category growth. New brands, including Drunk Elephant; Fresh; Good Molecules, which is exclusive to Ulta Beauty and peach slices; as well as new products from Tula, Clinique and The Ordinary drove solid guest engagement. \n Finally, our fragrance and bath category continued to deliver exceptional growth. Ariana Grande's latest fragrance, God is a Woman, which is exclusive to Ulta Beauty; as well as newness from Carolina Herrera; Coach; YSL and Dior, drove strong growth during the quarter. Events included in our back-to-school gift with purchase and our monthly Fragrance Crush program also drove strong engagement. Beyond fragrance, the bath and body category continues to drive robust growth as moisturizers and scrubs remain on trend. \n In addition to delivering growth from our core categories, we are focused on driving growth from key cross-functional platforms. Starting with Conscious Beauty, our cross-category initiative intended to help guests discover and engage with brands and products which reflect their personal values. Through this program, we identify brands across 5 key pillars: clean ingredients, cruelty free, vegan, sustainable packaging and positive impact. \n During the quarter, we certified 19 new brands, including LAMIK Beauty, WLDKAT and Better Not Younger, bringing the total number of certified conscious beauty brands to 275 at the end of Q3. During the third quarter, we expanded our certification to the SKU level for clean ingredients and vegan and added in-store badging at the shelf for certified brands as well as new search filters online to help guests easily identify products, which reflect what is most important to them. \n Moving now to our efforts to expand our assortment of black-owned and BIPOC brands. During the third quarter, we added 2 new black-owned brands, Sunday || Sunday and Nude Sugar, and we are on track to double the number of black-owned brands in our assortment this year. In addition, I am excited to share that we have welcomed our first South Asian owned makeup brand to the Ulta Beauty family, Live Tinted. Founded by Asian influencer Deepica Mutyala, Live Tinted is a cosmetic brand that celebrates multicultural beauty. The brand is also... Hello, everyone. I think we're having -- we had a -- we were disconnected. I think we're having some phone network issues. But hopefully, you can hear me, and I'm going to pick up, I think, where we got cut off. So if I repeat a little bit, I apologize, but we'll dive right back in. \n So moving now to our efforts to expand our assortment of black-owned and BIPOC brands. During the third quarter, we added 2 new black-owned brands, Sunday || Sunday and Nude Sugar, and we are on track to double the number of black-owned brands in our assortment this year. In addition, I'm excited to share we have welcomed our first South Asian-owned makeup brand to the Ulta Beauty family, Live Tinted. Founded by Asian influencer, Deepica Mutyala, Live Tinted is a cosmetic brand that celebrates multicultural beauty. The brand is also a part of our conscious beauty platform certified as clean, vegan and cruelty-free. \n Based on our proprietary research, we know 65% of beauty enthusiasts believe beauty is significantly connected to wellness. Reflecting this consumer insight, in the second quarter, we launched the wellness shop online and in 450 stores. This cross-category platform offers self-care products for the mind, body and spirit in an accessible, easy-to-navigate way. In the third quarter, we refreshed the wellness shop assortment shifting from summer solutions to total body care and hydration, which is especially relevant during colder months and introduced new items from HAIRtamin, [ Alum ], OSEA and Josie Maran. \n Turning now to our efforts to evolve the guest experience through our personalized and connected omnichannel ecosystem, All in Your World. We know the guest journey is increasingly blurring across physical and digital channels, and we aim to deliver a cohesive omnichannel strategy to serve our guests. During Q3, we enhanced our omnichannel strategy in 4 ways. \n First, we launched Beauty to Go, our promise that buy online, pick up in store orders will be picked up and ready to go within 2 hours or less, giving our guests fast, convenient access to the beauty they want most. We also continue to test incentive strategies to encourage guest utilization. During the third quarter, BOPIS orders increased 28% compared to last year, totaling 20% of e-commerce sales in the quarter compared to 16% last year. \n Second, partnering with DoorDash, we launched same-day delivery in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston and Boise, and we're excited about the value and convenience that will provide guests this holiday season. \n Third, in October, we launched 2 exclusive salon services in all stores and relaunched skin services in select stores. Starting with salons. We have partnered with OLAPLEX to offer guests a professional bond repair service, which reverses damage caused by hair color, chemical treatment, heat and styling and the environment. And we have partnered with Redken to introduce a new express root touch-up service that offers guests 100% gray coverage color in only 10 minutes. These new exclusive services are bringing new guests into our salon. \n We also relaunched skin services in 100 locations featuring a revamped menu with new services to address specific guest concerns, such as hydration, anti-aging and acne. While it's still early, we are pleased with how guests are engaging with these new offerings. \n Finally, we launched Ulta Beauty at Target in 92 stores and online during the third quarter, and I am pleased to share we have reached our fiscal year goal of opening more than 100 shops. We are excited about this innovative partnership and how, together with Target, we will change the way guests experience beauty. While it will take time for us to understand what role this new distribution point will play for our guests, we are incredibly pleased with the ongoing customer excitement and encouraged to see Ultimate Reward members linking their accounts with Target Circle as well as new members signing up through the shop. \n Moving on to our efforts to expand and deepen our presence across the guest beauty journey as the heart of the beauty community. We are focused on how to best elevate consumer connection, supercharge, member acquisition and drive guest loyalty, love and share of wallet. \n In the third quarter, we continue to elevate our storytelling with relevant content across channels to launch Ulta Beauty at Target and to support our strategic events. In addition, as students return to classrooms after more than a year of virtual learning, we saw an opportunity to deepen our engagement with Gen Z audiences across channels with insight-driven campaigns during key back-to-school moments. \n We ended the third quarter with 35.9 million active members, 13% above last year and 6% above 2019. While we continue to add new members, member growth this quarter was largely driven by a reactivation of lapsed members and active member retention. \n After experiencing headwinds last year due to the disruption from the pandemic, we have accelerated personalization to create stronger life cycle strategies, build baskets and maximize business returns, and we are very pleased with the results. We are driving strong conversion of new members in stores and online. We are successfully reengaging members who lapsed during the pandemic, and we are driving stronger engagement from our existing members. Importantly, our member retention rates have recovered to pre-pandemic levels, and spend per member is at an all-time high. \n Shifting now to our plans and expectations for holiday. Based on our consumer insights, we expected many guests would start their holiday shopping earlier this year, and we proactively took steps to ensure we were ready with holiday sets, stocking stuffers and unique collaborations to help guests get a head start on their gifting needs. \n If holiday 2020 was about less, holiday 2021 is about more, more fun, more in real life gatherings, more gifting and more glamming. All of our teams at Ulta Beauty are ready and excited to help our guests celebrate more this year. Like last year, we kicked off the holiday season in early November with our Hello Holidays campaign, early Black Friday deals and new loyalty offers. With authentic stories of connection and joy across video, digital, social and print platforms to encourage and motivate beauty enthusiasts to shop Ulta Beauty, we'll be everywhere our guests are this holiday season. \n Our merchant teams have built an outstanding holiday assortment with giftable fun items across categories and price points. With new brands like Bobby Brown, Drunk Elephant and Briogeo, expanded assortments from brands like Laura Mercier, Florence and Pattern and exciting holiday offerings from brands like Dyson, Tarte, Ariana Grande, Truly and our very own Ulta Beauty Collection, we have great gifts for everyone. \n To help guests explore our best holiday gifts, we developed a unique digital experience to allow for easy discovery of holiday gifts online and in-store. When guests visit ulta.com or scan the QR codes on a banner at the front of our store, an app click will launch giving the guest an opportunity to easily explore top gifts by category. Our stores are always the center of holiday at Ulta Beauty. \n As we combine our great in-store experience with our innovative omnichannel capabilities, we'll meet every guest wherever and however they want to shop Ulta Beauty. To help guests get ready for in real-life celebrations, we've expanded salon capacity to 100% in all Ulta Beauty salons and benefit brow bars except where limited by state or local mandates, and we've relaunched skin services in select stores. \n Finally, our BOPIS, curbside and same-day delivery options, will provide guests with great shopping convenience this holiday season. Our teams are excited, engaged and ready to support our guests from proactively managing inventory flow and anticipating supply chain challenges to stress testing our IT systems and digital platforms to successfully accelerating our holiday hiring. The holiday season is off to a strong start, and I am confident we are well positioned to deliver another successful holiday season at Ulta Beauty. \n In closing, we are excited about the strength we are seeing in our business. Our third quarter performance exceeded our initial expectations, and we are encouraged by the early holiday trends. The beauty category is recovering, and our teams are executing well. We are investing and innovating to ensure Ulta Beauty will lead the new beauty landscape, and we are confident our well-defined strategy will enable us to capture more market share and drive profitable growth. \n And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? And Michael, I'd just add to what Scott said, just to reiterate what we talked about at Analyst Day that we are very optimistic about the path ahead. That's reflected in that long-term guidance. We believe we'll be growing faster than the market. The initiatives, both in our core business today as well as new programs and initiatives that we'll be adding over next year and the years ahead, give us a lot of confidence that we'll be leading the category and delivering profitable growth over that time frame. And as we shared at Analyst Day, we see a lot of confidence in that path ahead. Great. Thanks, Lorraine. Yes, makeup, obviously, is an important topic for us and one that we're very focused on, and I'd reiterate our confidence in the category. It is -- as I said in the remarks, it is not performing at the level that our other categories, skincare, haircare, bath, fragrance, which are all delivering double-digit comp versus 2020. It has not caught up to that level of growth. But even with that, we feel encouraged by what we're seeing. \n Our mass side of the business remains double-digit growth versus 2019 and is performing well. And our prestige business improved in the quarter, and we saw some real pockets of growth and success. And I think it's a combination of things, both currently driving the business and as we look forward. We continue to see strong innovation and growth from a number of brands, brands across the spectrum from Clinique and NARS and Lanco\u0302me to NYX and Maybelline. We're expanding MAC into 200 additional stores to have it in over 500 of our stores. We've launched new brands like Bobby Brown, and we're seeing newness from Laura Mercier, ColourPop, Urban Decay, Tarte. And so it is -- there's a robust pipeline, and it's hitting across all price points. \n When I look at some of the trends that we see in the market and we believe will drive the business into next year. There's a number of things that, again, encourage us. We see really a duality of looks that's going on right now, a combination -- many consumers looking to a combination of both natural looks and bolder looks. Looks, the bolder looks that reflect kind of this idea of individual expression, bold colors with innovation, innovative formulas, color boost that bright impactful, particularly around the eye. And that's -- that combination of people looking to do both, natural and bolder colors, is really positive. \n We've talked about skinification for a while, bringing moisturizing benefits or lightweight concealers or other elements that combine those categories. There's evolved application techniques, including what we kind of see as kind of next generation of contouring that's been driven by TikTok and other social media, which we think is encouraging. New product forms, including long wear lip. We've been looking at inclusive beauty for a while, and that's continuing to drive across all different types of skin tones, again, driven by influence and TikTok. And mascara and lashes is another space I've mentioned that we're seeing innovation and growth. A combination of both using more -- with more than one product or having different mascaras for different events and different times a day. \n So a number of things that are coming together that are helping improve the category and give us confidence as we look forward. So as we look at the -- both the trend impact in the total category and the pipeline that we have, both of existing brands and new brands on the horizon in 2022, we feel confident in the path ahead and are working every day to drive that business forward. Well, yes, I'm not going to give you real, like, exact specifics of how any one launch would match up with others, other than to say we're thrilled about our partnership with OLAPLEX. We're already in partnership. We have been for several weeks now with our salon service, and that's performing exceptionally well, exceeding our expectations. Our guests are thrilled by it. And importantly, our stylist are thrilled by it. And so it's -- that's gotten out of the gates really strong. And as we move into January to be able to launch the product line in all stores, in online, a complete assortment of OLAPLEX. \n As I mentioned in the remarks, and you know it's the #1 prestige haircare brand, and so we anticipate that it will have a big impact on our hair business and continue to support and drive our salon business. So we're excited about it, and we're putting the unique capabilities of Ulta Beauty behind the launch, a real 360 marketing program, leveraging our almost 36 million members and all the marketing tools and capabilities and partnership with just a fantastic OLAPLEX team. So excited about that launch and looking forward to taking the next step of that in January. \n And then as far as other -- extending into Target, we look at every brand and every opportunity, and nothing here to specifically talk about as it relates to OLAPLEX. But Target is -- we're excited about, and we'll continue to evolve that assortment over time. Great. Thanks, Mark. I'll start with your second question and then Kecia can give any more color on the Target part of that. But on DTC, it's -- that's not new, not new this year. That's been DTC. That's been building for a while, and so we really look at that as something that we're obviously monitoring and watching but also see as a development in the competitive landscape that we can manage through. And in fact, DTC, most of -- many of the DTC brands have found the importance of physical retail, and many of them have chosen to partner with Ulta Beauty. So start DTC and come into Ulta Beauty. Ulta Beauty brands, some larger brands kind of building a DTC brand presence, which we know is happening. \n But we see -- our model has been very different. The guest experience, the combination of in-store and online, our loyalty program, the breadth of products across price points, the depth within brands and segments and categories, the salon services, everything that we offer. The competitive differentiation that we have really separates us from our other retailers and from DTC. And as I said, many DTC are partnering with us, whether they're long-time established brands or newer brands, and so we're watching that landscape. But for us, it's like we think with any competitive evolution in the category, we play offense. We do what we do best. We adjust and adapt, but we look to drive our business forward in a really differentiated way, and I think that's what's been driving our business so far this year. Kecia, any more color you want to add on the Target? Great. Omar, thanks for the question. Yes, I'd really -- I guess I'd answer that by looking back at what we shared at Analyst Day and the comprehensive nature of our strategic approach. There isn't any one thing that gives us confidence. And yes, we are having a very strong year, recovering out of the challenges of 2020 and increasing versus 2019. But by no means do we think this is kind of the end of the road. We actually see this is us strengthening and leading the category recovery. We think the category itself is going to be healthy beauty category in 2022 and beyond. And we think our differentiated model will continue to lead that category, gain share and drive growth for us. So it is the combination of an exceptional differentiated assortment. Nobody has the collection of products that we have, and we've brought a lot of newness in this year, some of that hitting even late in the year like OLAPLEX hitting in January that we'll be driving. And we've got a pipeline that I'm excited about going into 2022, and we'll be sharing that as time is appropriate. So assortment always drives our business. \n Our loyalty program recovered from 2020, frankly, faster than we thought. And we think that's a great sign that what we believe what's going on in 2020 when we took a step back was not because they didn't like Ulta, just the disruption in their lives, and they've shown us that retention is high. We're acquiring new members. We're bringing lapsed members back in, and we see many more beauty enthusiasts to capture -- we see that growth happening across age groups. You know -- you've heard us talk about our strength with Gen Z as one example, and we see a lot of opportunity to continue to gain with our loyalty program. \n And then frankly, the unique combination of digital and physical. We believe guests are showing us demonstrating with their loyalty and their spend that they really do prefer what all the data says, and they're showing us with their dollars they prefer to shop a combination of physical and digital. That's why our e-com actually grew in Q3 after such strong growth in 2020, even as our stores show exceptional growth versus 2020. So that experience and our continued innovation and evolution across both digital and physical, we believe is where the consumer is going, and we're leading in that as well. And then all the other initiatives, our program with Target, of course, is massive, new programs like Ulta Beauty UB Media. So we think we've got a pipeline. Growth won't be what it is this year, and that's reflected. But we're going to lead this category, and it's going to take -- it will be a unique combination of what makes us differentiated that gives us confidence. Great. Well, thank you for joining us today, and I want to thank all of our Ulta Beauty associates across our stores, distribution centers and corporate offices who are working hard to ensure we deliver an outstanding guest experience this holiday season and who are committed to taking good care of our guests and each other every single day. As I said in the past, we have the absolute best team in retail, and I am so proud to lead this great team. \n We hope you all have a safe and joyous holiday season, and we look forward to speaking to all of you again in March when we report our fourth quarter and full year results. Have a great evening."

            "name": "Scott Settersten",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported stronger-than-expected third quarter results, and I would like to echo Dave's comments and express my appreciation to all our Ulta Beauty associates for delivering another outstanding quarter. \n Starting with the income statement. Q3 sales increased 28.6% driven by double-digit growth in comp sales and strong new store performance. Total company comp increased 25.8% primarily driven by strong transaction growth in stores. In addition to robust sales growth from stores, e-commerce exceeded our expectations delivering modest growth on top of last year's 90% growth. Total company transactions for the quarter increased 16.8%. Average ticket increased 7.7%, primarily due to an increase in average selling price, reflecting favorable category mix shifts and lower promotional levels. \n During the quarter, we opened 7 new stores and closed 1 store. We also remodeled 3 stores and relocated 2 stores. Compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, total sales increased 19%, and comp sales increased 14.3%. From a mix perspective, makeup was 45% of sales compared to 47% last year. Haircare products and styling tools were 21% of sales compared to 20% last year. Skincare was 16% of sales, flat with last year. And the fragrance and bath category increased 200 basis points to 12% of sales. \n Q3 gross profit margin increased 450 basis points to 39.6% of sales compared to 35.1% last year. The increase was primarily due to leverage of fixed costs, channel mix shifts, leverage of salon expenses and higher margin merchandise margin. \n Consistent with what we experienced in the first half of this year, strong top line growth and benefits from our occupancy cost optimization efforts resulted in significant leverage of fixed costs. E-commerce sales penetration in Q3 was about 500 basis points lower than last year as we cycled last year's strong e-commerce growth. As a percentage of sales, salon expenses also leveraged, reflecting strong top line sales and lower costs from the elimination of the salon manager role. As a reminder, we will anniversary this change in Q4. \n The improvement in merchandise margin was primarily the result of higher sales, lower promotional activity and ongoing benefits from our category management efforts. Comparing this year's performance to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, gross margin improved by 250 basis points. Higher merchandise margin, fixed cost leverage and leverage of salon expenses were partially offset by adverse channel mix. \n As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased to 25.2% and compared to 26.8% last year. Strong top line growth drove leverage of corporate overhead, store expenses and store payroll and benefits. This leverage was partially offset by deleverage from marketing expense, primarily reflecting increased spend on print advertising compared to the third quarter last year. \n Last year, we significantly reduced our spend on print material in Q3 due to the pandemic. This year, our cadence of print was more normalized. And as Dave mentioned earlier, we are leveraging our CRM capabilities to optimize circulation and increase the profitability of our print vehicles. Compared to Q3 of fiscal 2019, SG&A as a percentage of sales was about 150 basis points favorable. As a percentage of sales, lower store expenses, store payroll and benefits and corporate overhead were partially offset by higher marketing expense. \n Operating margin was 14.2% of sales compared to 6.5% of sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 on a GAAP basis and 8% of sales on an adjusted basis. Strong top line growth driven primarily by stores, combined with the impact of our ongoing cost optimization efforts, including promotional optimization, delivered strong operating margin results. \n The company's tax rate decreased to 24.1% compared to 25.1% in the third quarter last year. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to favorable provision to tax return adjustments driven by federal employment tax credits compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020. \n Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased to $3.94 compared to $1.32 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in Q3 of last year was $1.64. \n Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion of inventory compared to $1.4 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 40 additional stores, the increase in inventory reflects our proactive efforts to mitigate holiday sales risk due to anticipated supply chain disruptions. Where appropriate, our teams work closely with our brand partners to prioritize receipts to ensure we have adequate inventory of core and seasonal product to support expected demand for the holiday season. \n Capital expenditures were $51.1 million for the quarter, driven by investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, supply chain and IT systems. Depreciation was $65.2 million compared to $72.4 million last year, primarily reflecting the impact of last year's store impairments and store closures. \n We ended the quarter with $605.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. In the third quarter, we repurchased 341,000 shares at a cost of $126.4 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $759.8 million remaining under our current $1.6 billion repurchase authorization. We continue to expect to repurchase approximately 850 million of shares in fiscal 2021, but as always, have the flexibility to modify the cadence of repurchases in response to market conditions. \n Turning now to our updated outlook for 2021. We are very pleased with our year-to-date results through Q3 and are encouraged by the strong trends we've experienced so far in the fourth quarter. However, we recognize we still have several significant sales weeks left in the holiday season, and the operating environment continues to be dynamic. Despite these uncertainties, we have increased our financial expectations for the year. We now expect net sales for the year will be between $8.5 billion and $8.6 billion with comp sales growth forecasted in the 36% to 37% range. This guidance reflects our expectation that fourth quarter comp growth will be between 15% and 20%. For the year, we plan to open approximately 44 net new stores and remodel or relocate 17 stores. \n We now expect operating margin rate for fiscal 2021 will be between 14.3% and 14.5% of sales. We continue to believe the largest driver of our operating margin expansion will come from gross margin, driven by leverage of fixed costs, less headwind from channel shift, improving merchandise margin and leverage of salon costs. \n Based on higher top line growth, we now expect to leverage SG&A more than previously expected as compared to fiscal 2020. Based on these assumptions, we now expect diluted earnings per share will be between $16.70 and $17.10 per share, including the impact of approximately $850 million in share repurchases. \n We now expect to spend between $200 million and $225 million in CapEx in fiscal 2021, including approximately $100 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $80 million for supply chain and IT and about $34 million for store maintenance and other. As a reminder, our guidance for fiscal 2021 assumes a consistent federal tax rate and no material increases in the federal minimum wage. \n Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to address a few follow-up questions we received from our October Analyst Day event. First, our longer-term financial targets. In October, we shared targets for revenue and earnings growth, which we are confident we can deliver through fiscal 2024 based on the limited visibility we have in the dynamic operating environment. As a reminder, we are targeting net sales growth between 5% and 7% and diluted earnings per share growth in the low double-digit range on a compound annual growth basis using fiscal 2019 as base through fiscal 2024. \n In addition, we are targeting operating profit margins in the 13% to 14% range over the next 3 years. Our operating margin expectations reflect a balanced and disciplined approach to strategic investments that will support our long-term growth aspirations and deliver strong shareholder returns. \n Regarding the timing of investments related to Project SOAR, our multiyear effort to upgrade our enterprise resource planning or ERP platform. We expect to invest $160 million to $180 million in capital over the next 3 years, with most of the investment planned for fiscal 2022 and 2023. As a reminder, in addition to providing us with more flexible and scalable operating environment, this new platform will support future growth and innovation. We expect to begin to see operational benefits from this investment in fiscal 2023. \n Lastly, we are still finalizing our budget for fiscal 2022 and plan to provide financial guidance in line with our regular cadence on our March earnings call. However, we wanted to share some initial thoughts to consider as you update your financial models. \n Comp sales growth in fiscal 2021 is expected to be significantly stronger than we initially planned, but we remain confident we can deliver comp sales growth in fiscal 2022 within our longer-term targeted range of 3% to 5%. While we expect fiscal 2021 operating margin will be modestly above our longer-term target, we expect operating margin in fiscal 2022 will be within our longer-term targeted range of 13% to 14%, reflecting a more normalized pace of top line growth and capital and operational investment. We continue to target EPS growth in fiscal 2022 despite the challenge of cycling this year's stimulus payments and reopening of the economy, but acknowledge the earnings growth rate next year will likely be lower than our longer-term target. \n And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. Yes. So to the first part of your question, Michael, what we're talking about today is consistent with how we framed it up at our Analyst Day in the later part of October. So again, over the longer term, we're very confident we can deliver operating margin in the 13 to 14 percentage range. We, again, reiterated today, that's a function of what we expect to be a more moderate top line sales growth environment next year, coupled with a more normalized investment cycle for the company, and that's with people cost and all the capital costs that go along with all those new great strategic initiatives that we have well underway now. \n So as we think about potential sales overperformance next year, which, again, we would hope to see that, we would continue to take what we always have as a very disciplined, pragmatic approach to long-term investment to drive healthy growth in the business balanced against short-term operating results. So again, just making sure we take a very balanced approach to that as we have in the past, and you can expect that to continue into the future. Yes, I don't think there's anything incrementally new, I guess, I could share. It's really a combination of all the variables that we've been talking about with investors and with the analyst for quite some time. So it all kind of gets back to our EFG efforts, right? So a lot of great work has been done by our teams over the last couple of years across a wide variety of cost targets across our business. We talked about occupancy costs. We've been talking about promotional effectiveness. We've been talking about core end-to-end process opportunities. We've been talking about supply chain investments for the future. So there's a lot of variables at play here. \n We're, I think, producing very good results this year under very difficult circumstances. So all this good work now is starting to bear fruit for us. So again, I would say those are the building blocks that we start with as we started thinking about our longer-term plan. And then as you heard us describe at Analyst Day, now we're into 2.0, I guess, I would call it, with our continuous improvement initiatives, right? And so building highly skilled resources internally here that can help us get after some of those harder to capture benefits. And of course, some of the new infrastructure investments that we talked about as well at Analyst Day, especially in Project SOAR, which is really a multigenerational opportunity for us to reimagine business flows across the business and improve our processes and take a lot of inefficiencies out of the business here. But again, some of that takes time. \n So as we're thinking about the next 3 years or so, EFG core benefits will continue to deliver good cost optimization for us in the near term, and then CI with SOAR will drive longer-term benefits for us. So we still think there's plenty of opportunity to keep operating margins in a very healthy 13% to 14% range here over the longer term. Sure. Thanks for the question. So big picture, operating margin versus 2020, it's going to be flattish in the fourth quarter. And versus 2019, we'd see some deleverage in operating margin. Again, both of those will have a mix of gross margin expansion and SG&A deleverage. So gross margin goodness coming from all the things we've talked about this year, fixed store cost leverage, merchandise margin improvements versus 2020. Channel mix is a benefit for us versus last year. Channel mix, more of a headwind versus 2019. So gross margin leverage for both years. \n On the SG&A line, again, deleverage for both years. 2020 not as significant as it is versus 2019. Again, 2020, consistent with all the things we've been talking about all year with the addition of incentive compensation, I guess I would say, is more significant in the fourth quarter than earlier in the year. And then when we compare it back to 2019, store labor and wages, not only hours, but wage rates are up significantly versus 2019. Incentive comp, again, is a bigger impact versus 2019. If you remember, 2019, we were short of our targets in 2021. It's a bit of a different story, and then marketing expense as well. Again, more investment versus 2019 when we were kind of battening down the hatches, I guess I would say, in a tougher environment. And this year, we're taking advantage of tailwinds and investing in market awareness activities to, again, capture more market share over the long term. So that's what I would say a short story. Again, super excited and happy with the results so far this year through Q3 and very encouraged and excited about the kickoff to the fourth quarter."

It's really too early to comment on the results as we really want to see a few purchase cycles to confirm the role of this new addition, how it plays for our guests. \n We think about purchase cycle similar to what we see with our members who really typically shop Ulta Beauty 3 to 4x a year. So it's going to take a little bit more time because we just opened these stores at the beginning of August. Longer term, we do believe this partnership is going to really enable us to expand our loyalty members, increase our engagement, ultimately increase our spend per member. But bottom line, our partnership brings together these 2 powerhouse retailers to really reimagine prestige. We're really off to a strong start. We're excited to see what the holiday season brings, but we'll be able to update you after a few more shopping cycles here. Yes, absolutely. What we're seeing is that they're shopping the entire assortment. You have to remember, this was a highly curated assortment of pure SKUs, best-selling items, must-have minis. So we are really pleased that they are shopping the entire shop-in-shop, which is what the intention was. Was it not just to help them shop one category to get a taste of what Ulta Beauty has to offer as a whole in the shop. So I'd say bottom line, they're really shopping the entire assortment. We like what we're seeing so far."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to Ulta Beauty's conference call to discuss results for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\n It is now my pleasure to introduce Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rawlins, please proceed. \nKiley Rawlins: Thank you, Paul. Good afternoon, everyone. Hosting our call today are Dave Kimbell, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer; Kecia Steelman, Chief Operating Officer, will join us for the Q&A session.\n This afternoon, we released our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. A copy of the press release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company's safe harbor language. The statements contained in this conference call which are not historical facts may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\n Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today, August 25, 2021. We have no obligation to update or revise our forward-looking statements, except as required by law, and you should not expect us to do so.\n In today's comments, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted EPS, which have been presented to reflect our view of our ongoing operations by adjusting fiscal 2020 results for store impairment charges and costs associated with the permanent closure of 19 stores. A reconciliation of these measures to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release.\n We'll begin this afternoon with prepared remarks from Dave and Scott. Following our prepared comments, we'll open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] As always, I'll be available for any follow-up questions after the call.\n Now I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave? \nDavid Kimbell: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone.\n The Ulta Beauty team delivered excellent results again this quarter, and I want to start by expressing my sincere appreciation to all of our Ulta Beauty associates for their outstanding efforts to drive these results. As I have traveled around the country visiting with our teams across all parts of the company, I continue to feel inspired by their commitment and passion for our guests, our business and for each other.\n We are excited about the momentum we are seeing in our business and are optimistic about our future. The beauty category is recovering faster than we expected, and the investments we've made over the last year to adapt to the market disruption and strengthen our leadership position are delivering results. Our value proposition is strong, and we are evolving and innovating to lead in the new beauty landscape, capture more market share and drive profitable growth.\n For the second quarter, net sales increased 60.2% to $1.97 billion. Operating margin increased to 16.9% of sales and diluted EPS was $4.56 per share. These strong results exceeded our internal expectations and reflect our ongoing efforts to serve our guests, especially as we continue to adapt to the changing environment. In recognition of their dedication to our guests and their efforts to deliver these strong results, this quarter, we awarded a onetime discretionary appreciation bonus to eligible store and DC associates.\n For the quarter, comp sales increased 56.3% driven by strong growth in our brick-and-mortar channel. As consumer confidence, optimism and comfort to shop in physical stores continues to increase, we are seeing more of our members return to stores. Traffic trends in stores improved from the first quarter, but remained lower than 2019 levels. However, comp sales in stores increased this quarter compared to 2019 driven by strong average ticket growth.\n We continue to optimize operating hours, and I am pleased to share that our retail operating hours are nearly back to 2019 levels. As expected, e-commerce declined as compared to the second quarter last year but were more than double 2019 levels. The sales decline was driven by a decrease in the number of transactions. Average ticket remains strong. Recall that our e-commerce business increased more than 200% in the second quarter last year as we phased the reopening of stores.\n Guest utilization of buy online pickup in store remained high totaling 20% of e-commerce sales in the quarter. To enhance the experience, we made operational improvements to increase order accuracy and fulfillment speed. And in the second quarter, 97% of orders were ready for pickup within 2 hours. We have also increased the number of stores with dedicated parking spaces and we continue to look for opportunities to make curbside pickup available at nontraditional Ulta Beauty locations.\n Customer engagement in our digital platforms remain strong even as store traffic ramps up. Compared to the first quarter, our omnichannel guests, on average, maintained the same number of transactions in the online channel even as they increased their in-store transactions, reinforcing that e-commerce transactions are incremental and help drive greater overall member engagement and spend.\n From a category perspective, we increased market share across all major prestige beauty categories based on dollar sales for the 13 weeks ended July 31, 2021 compared to the same time period last year. We also saw sales strength across all of our major mass categories.\n Compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020, all major categories delivered robust double-digit comps as we anniversaried last year's phased reopening process and introduced more newness. Compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019, fragrance, bath, skin care and hair care, all delivered strong double-digit comp growth. Makeup was only slightly lower than 2019. While comp sales in the makeup category are not yet positive compared to 2019, momentum is building with both mass and prestige categories improving from the first quarter trend. Reductions in mask-wearing requirements, combined with an increase in makeup-wearing occasions, helped drive strong growth in face and lip, while engagement with eye continue to be healthy.\n During the quarter, we launched 3 new makeup brands, Bobbi Brown, Elaluz, a prestige brand founded by a well-known Brazilian influencer and makeup artist, and Undone Beauty. These new brands, combined with new product launches from a wide range of brands, including MAC, Clinique, NYX, e.l.f. and Maybelline, drove improved sales performance in the quarter.\n Skin care delivered another quarter of strong double-digit sales growth compared to 2019. Reflecting the strong connection between beauty and self-care, guests are maintaining their skin care regimens even as they increase makeup purchases. Moisturizers, serums and cleansers continue to drive category growth. We also saw robust growth in sun protection and self-tanning as consumers re-engaged with travel and vacation activities. New brands, including fresh, Good Molecules, which is exclusive to Ulta Beauty, and b.tan as well as new products from Tula, Shiseido, CeraVe, La Roche-Posay and The Cr\u00e8me Shop, drove solid guest engagement.\n Hair care continued to deliver double-digit growth driven by newness and strong guest engagement with our strategic tent-pole events. We began the quarter with our semiannual Gorgeous Hair event, an event strategically designed to convert members who do not currently shop the hair care category or engage with our salon services. This year, we streamlined offers and invested in dedicated social and digital marketing campaigns to expand our reach. As a result, the event attracted new members to the category and delivered stronger-than-expected sales and profitability.\n We ended the quarter with our Jumbo Love event, a basket-building event focused on larger product sizes. We continued to narrow brand participation and simplify our presentation to guests. These improvements resulted in stronger sales and profitability. In addition to strong strategic events, we also launched a number of new hair care brands throughout the quarter, including Rizos Curls, Verb and CURLS, a well-established Black-owned brand. These new brands, combined with recently launched Briogeo and Kristin Ess, contributed to the strong category growth this quarter as consumers focus on building and maintaining hair health.\n Finally, fragrance and bath delivered exceptionally strong growth driven by Mother's Day and Father's Day sales as well as our Fragrance Crush events. Newness in fragrance from Marc Jacobs and Carolina Herrera as well as engagement with the base business from favorites like Dolce & Gabbana and Chanel drove meaningful market share growth. Body scrubs and moisturizers from brands like Truly and Tree Hut continued to drive outstanding sales growth, reflecting guests' continued commitment to self-care.\n Our Conscious Beauty platform continues to expand and resonate with guests. At the end of the second quarter, more than 270 brands were certified in at least 1 of the 5 Conscious Beauty pillars and now include fresh, Kylie Cosmetics, Happy Dance and Good Molecules, among others.\n To promote guest discovery and trial this quarter, we will offer guests the new Conscious Beauty sampler kit, which includes hero brands like Beekman 1802, Kinship, Tarte and Tula. We will also refresh our endcap in stores, adding products from Dermalogica, Sunday Riley, Florence and Truly. As we work to scale Conscious Beauty further, we are enhancing our search capabilities on ulta.com and in the mobile app to make it easier for guests to find certified products that reflect their personal values.\n Through the pandemic, the lines between health and beauty have blurred. Based on our proprietary research, we know that 65% of beauty enthusiasts believe beauty is significantly connected to wellness. Reflecting these consumer insights, this quarter, we launched The Wellness Shop in select stores and on ulta.com to help our guests navigate their personal wellness journey. With a guest category focus on self-care for the mind, body and spirit, The Wellness Shop features a curated selection of products across 5 key segments, including supplements and ingestibles and spa at home. From daily rituals to relaxation and sleep regimens, the shop addresses a variety of wellness needs in an accessible, easy-to-navigate presentation. Our guests are responding well to the platform, and we'll continue to increase awareness of the offering and expand its presence over time.\n Our services business is also gaining momentum. Sales from hair and brow services increased more than 60% compared to 2020. Despite capacity limitations due to mandates from the CDC and state and local authorities, we are increasing member engagement and driving retail attachment, especially through our salon backbar takeovers. Services play an important role in driving guest engagement, loyalty, frequency and spend. I'm excited to share that we plan to relaunch skin services in select stores in the third quarter. We plan to offer new services that target specific concerns such as hydration, anti-aging as well as acne facials that cater to our Gen Z guest, and we will test microchanneling, dermaplaning and HydraFacials in select stores.\n Turning now to our loyalty program. We are seeing faster recovery in active member growth than initially expected. We ended the second quarter with a record 34.6 million active members, 8% above last year and 4% above 2019. Spend per member also increased, driven by higher average ticket, surpassing both 2020 and 2019 levels.\n The majority of new member acquisition happens in stores and our talented store associates continue to convert new members at higher rates than in 2019. We are also improving our conversion rates online, reflecting improvements we had made in the online customer journey. In addition to growth in new members, we are accelerating reactivation of lapsed members and increasing retention rates of existing members as we continue to advance and apply our data and analytics capabilities.\n From a channel perspective, in-store-only members totaled 73% this quarter, increasing from 67% in the first quarter. As expected, the mix of omnichannel members moderated from the first quarter to 18% of total members, but remained well above 2019 levels. Importantly, omnichannel members continued to increase their spend across both store and digital channels. As we progress through the rest of the year, we expect the penetration of omnichannel guests will continue to moderate as in-store shopping increases, but remain above 2019 levels.\n Discovery and trial are critical parts of the beauty experience, and we offer a variety of physical and digital ways to discover new products, new trends and new applications. This quarter, we launched new functionality in our mobile app that allows guests greater access to select product scanning for content and reviews, loyalty information and virtual try-on while shopping in stores.\n In addition, we reintroduced testers in stores with expanded stations of testing and sanitation supplies. We continue to deliver hyper-relevant content to drive discovery and build stronger connections with our guests. This quarter, we introduced Beauty School Live Virtual Masterclasses focused on brand launches, demonstrations and beauty tutorials. BeautyBio founder Jamie O'Banion hosted a Megawatt Glow masterclass, showcasing skin care tools and products. And in honor of National Lipstick Day, we partnered with a NYX Professional Makeup pro artist to walk viewers through a long wear lip look.\n In July, we launched a partnership with Supergreat, a hyper-relevant, app-based, Gen Z-centric live stream platform that is 100% focused on beauty. From shoppable live videos to editorial content and exclusive product drops, the Supergreat community is an ideal partnership for experiential immersive beauty. While we are early in our pilot, we've already seen encouraging results with engagement tracking ahead of other live platforms.\n As part of our holistic marketing efforts to reinforce Ulta Beauty's authority in the skin care category, we launched #UltaSkinTok, our first multi-branded TikTok hashtag challenge. To drive increased awareness of our category breadth and depth, we asked audiences to post their favorite skin care products from Ulta Beauty. The hashtag has amassed more than 8 billion views to date with 1.6 million videos created.\n We want Ulta Beauty to be the most loved beauty destination and the most inclusive. Building on our focus as a diversity-forward company, we announced a number of commitments at the beginning of this fiscal year to further our efforts to champion diversity and inclusion. This quarter, we joined the 15 Percent Pledge, committing to dedicate 15% of our total assortment to Black-owned, Black-founded and Black-led brands. To date this year, we have welcomed 8 new Black-owned brands to the Ulta Beauty family, including Homebody, CAMILLE ROSE and mented, and we are on track to double the number of Black-owned brands in our assortment this year.\n As part of our cross-functional approach to integrate diversity and inclusion into all that we do, our teams launched a textured hair training series for all stylists to better enable more inclusive experiences in our salons. We also launched mandatory inclusion in action training in stores to understand what diversity, equity and inclusion means to Ulta Beauty.\n We strive to make a positive difference in the communities where we live and work. The Ulta Beauty Charitable Foundation focuses on improving the lives of women and families. This quarter, with the generosity of our guests, our teams raised more than $2 million for Save the Children, to support mothers and children in need. We also partnered with LinkedIn with the #BackToWork campaign, highlighting the pandemic's impact on women and providing resources to aid economic recovery.\n And as part of our ongoing efforts to reduce waste and minimize our impact on the environment, we recently launched the Consortium to Reinvent the Retail Bag, a multiyear collaboration across retail sectors that aims to identify, test and implement innovative new design solutions that serve the functions of today's single-use plastic retail bag.\n Finally, I am very excited to share that Ulta Beauty at Target has launched in 58 stores and online with plans to open about 100 stores by the end of the quarter. Over the last 9 months, the Ulta Beauty and Target teams have collaborated closely to create a unique way for guests to experience beauty, and we are excited to see it come to life.\n As guests come to Ulta Beauty at Target, they will be welcomed into a 1,000 square foot co-design space with bold new fixtures and lighting that celebrate premium beauty with a modern look. Each aspect of the shop was thoughtfully designed to make the space feel authentic to Ulta Beauty, Target and the featured brands within the assortment. From the unmistakable Ulta Beauty orange pop canopies and vivid graphics that weave into the existing Target store, everything was designed to create an inspiring and unique beauty experience for guests.\n With compelling product displays and unique discovery zones, the shop offers a curated selection of more than 50 prestige and emerging brands, including MAC, Clinique, Morphe, Tula, The Ordinary, Pattern, Madison Reed, Urban Decay and the Ulta Beauty Collection. The assortment is a compelling mix of best-selling items as well as limited edition collaborations and minis to drive discovery and trial.\n We're making the experience as seamless as possible both in-store and online. Guests shopping Ulta Beauty at Target on Target.com and the Target app will enjoy free shipping for qualifying orders and all of Target's same-day fulfillment services. And guests will benefit from rewards across both Ultamate Rewards and Target Circle.\n While it's only been 10 days since the first shop was opened, guest response has been overwhelmingly positive with enthusiasm about 2 of their favorite retailers coming together and excitement about the ability to earn points in both loyalty programs. We're thrilled about this partnership and how together we can change the way the world experiences beauty.\n Before I turn the call over to Scott, I want to announce that we will host an Analyst Day here in Chicago on October 19 to share how our strategic priorities are evolving and how we plan to continue to position Ulta Beauty to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. Given the ongoing uncertainty around the Delta variant, we are planning the event to accommodate both in-person and virtual participation. Our teams will continue to assess guidance from the CDC, and we will adapt our plans as necessary to ensure the safety of our team and attendees.\n And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? \nScott Settersten: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone.\n Starting with the income statement. Q2 sales increased 60.2% as we anniversaried the disruption of stores last year due to COVID-19. We opened 7 new stores during the quarter and closed 1 store. We also remodeled 5 stores and relocated 1 store.\n Total company comp increased 56.3% driven by a 52.5% increase in transactions and a 2.5% growth in average ticket. As Dave mentioned, the resurgence of traffic in stores drove the strong comp performance. Compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019, total sales increased 18% and comp sales increased 13.1%.\n From a mix perspective, cosmetics was 43% of sales compared to 45% last year. Skin care was 17% of sales compared to 18% last year, the fragrance and bath category increased 300 basis points to 12% of sales, and hair care products and styling tools was flat with last year at 21% of sales. The services category increased to 4% of sales compared to 3% last year.\n Q2 gross profit margin increased to 40.6% of sales compared to 26.8% last year. The increase was primarily due to the leverage of fixed costs, higher merchandise margin, more favorable channel mix and leverage of salon expenses. Strong top line growth drove significant leverage of fixed costs.\n The improvement in merchandise margin was primarily the result of anniversary-ing higher inventory reserves in the second quarter last year as well as higher sales, lower promotional activity and ongoing benefits from our cost optimization efforts. Recall that we increased inventory reserves by $16.5 million in the second quarter last year primarily to adjust for slow turning and discontinued makeup SKUs and permanently closed stores. As a percentage of sales, salon expenses were lower compared to last year, reflecting strong top line sales and the elimination of the salon manager role. As a reminder, we will anniversary this change in Q4.\n Comparing this year's performance to the second quarter of fiscal 2019, gross margin improved by 420 basis points. Higher merchandise margin, fixed cost leverage and leverage of salon expenses were partially offset by adverse channel mix. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased to 23.6% compared to 22.1% last year. Higher store payroll and benefits and higher marketing expense was partially offset by leverage of corporate overhead and variable store expenses.\n Store payroll and benefits deleveraged in the quarter primarily due to the anniversary-ing of the $48.2 million in employee retention credits made available last year under the CARES Act. In addition, reflecting the strong operational performance, we elected to grant discretionary appreciation bonuses to our nonexempt store and DC teams in recognition of their efforts.\n Marketing expense also deleveraged during the quarter, primarily reflecting increased spend on print marketing. Recall that last year, we significantly reduced our spend on print material while our stores were closed due to the pandemic. We are also expanding our investment in digital marketing to support key events and re-engage lapsed members. In addition, we are leveraging our CRM capabilities and working more closely with our brand partners to create more targeted digital marketing campaigns across multiple touch points. Strong top line growth resulted in nice leverage of corporate overhead and store expenses.\n Compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019, SG&A as a percentage of sales was flat. As a percentage of sales, lower store expenses were offset by higher store payroll and corporate overhead. Compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019, advertising in the second quarter of 2021 was flat as a percentage of sales.\n Operating margin was 16.9% of sales compared to 1.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 on a GAAP basis and 4.5% on an adjusted basis. Strong top line growth driven by brick-and-mortar, combined with the impact of our cost optimization efforts including promotional optimization, delivered record operating margin results.\n The tax rate increased to 24.4% compared to 20.6% last year due to a decrease in state tax credits as a result of an increase in pretax income. Diluted GAAP earnings per share were $4.56, which included $0.04 per share of tax benefit related to share-based compensation compared to $0.14 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of last year was $0.73.\n Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total inventory increased 5.5% compared to last year, reflecting the impact of 32 additional stores, the opening of our Jacksonville fast fulfillment center in Q3 of fiscal 2020 and increased inventory purchases to support higher demand. Capital expenditures were $22.7 million for the quarter driven by our new store opening program, investments in IT systems and store remodels and relocations. Depreciation was $69 million compared with $77.4 million last year, primarily reflecting the impact of last year's store impairments and the 19 stores which were permanently closed.\n We ended the quarter with $770.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. In the second quarter, we repurchased 746,000 shares at a cost of $243.5 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $886.2 million remaining under our current $1.6 billion repurchase authorization. We continue to expect to repurchase approximately $850 million of shares in fiscal 2021 but as always have the flexibility to modify the cadence of repurchases in response to market conditions.\n Turning now to our updated outlook for 2021. We are encouraged by our first half results and the trends we've experienced so far in the third quarter. While the operating environment continues to be dynamic and our near-term visibility remains limited, especially as it relates to the spread of COVID variants, we have increased our financial expectations for the year. We now expect net sales for the year to be between $8.1 billion and $8.3 billion with comp sales growth planned to be in the 30% to 32% range.\n We continue to expect comp results will moderate to the low double-digit range as we move through the second half. We expect to open approximately 44 net new stores and remodel or relocate 18 stores. We now expect operating margin rate for the year will be approximately 13% of sales. We continue to believe the largest driver of operating margin expansion will come from gross margin, driven by leverage of fixed cost, less headwind from channel shift, improving merchandise margin and leverage of salon costs.\n Based on the higher top line growth, we now expect to leverage SG&A more than previously expected as compared to fiscal 2020. These assumptions result in an expectation for diluted earnings per share in the range of $14.50 to $14.70 per share, including the impact of approximately $850 million in share repurchases. Like others, we are managing global supply chain constraints, port congestion and other headwinds, including the resurgence of COVID-19.\n Our teams are working diligently to mitigate risk and where appropriate, we are proactively working with our brand partners to prioritize receipts to ensure we have adequate inventory for the holiday season. As a result, we expect that our inventory levels at the end of the third quarter will likely be elevated above expected sales growth.\n We plan to spend between $225 million and $250 million in CapEx in fiscal 2021, including approximately $100 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $105 million for supply chain and IT and about $33 million for store maintenance and other. As a reminder, our guidance for 2021 assumes a consistent federal tax rate and no material increases in the federal minimum wage and does not include assumptions for any impact related to a resurgence of COVID-19.\n And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Congratulations. I mean, really, it's a huge inflection starting last quarter and great to see the momentum continuing. Dave, my first question is for you about Ulta and Target. Obviously, it's early days with just 10 days under your belt. But I wanted to see, what have your early learnings been? If you can help us with any details on that. And then I know the initial target was somewhere around 100 stores. What would be the benchmarks for more aggressive rollout?\n And then my second follow-up question is for Scott. Just remind us, this is one of the first calls where we haven't spent an inordinate amount of time on freight and the supply chain, although it is an issue. You're not as exposed to the Far East. So can you talk about kind of where you are exposed? And if you can, any kind of basis point impact for the back half? \nDavid Kimbell: Great. Well, thanks for the question and the comments, Adrienne. I appreciate it. Yes, let me start on Target and then I'm going to ask Kecia to give some more color because Kecia is leading this for us. But we are, as I said in the comments, we're just thrilled with the partnership and the launch guest response. We feel really confident how we've come out of the gate operationally, working really well. And most importantly, as I mentioned, consumers are thrilled by this. They're really excited about the idea of bringing together 2 great retailers in a unique experience that nobody else is doing. This is totally new to beauty. And so we're really, really pleased with the results and the engagement and the partnership. Kecia, why don't you share a few more details about what we're seeing and maybe the outlook on stores. \nKecia Steelman: Yes. What we're most excited about really is the operational execution across both Ulta Beauty and the Target teams. The seamless integration between our technologies and making sure that we're capturing both the Target Circle members and the Ulta Beauty members and having them link their accounts were out of the gates really strong. We love what we see. The guests are really loving this experience overall. And there's just huge momentum that we're looking forward to continuing on getting the rest of the 100 stores open in Q3. \nScott Settersten: And then I'll follow up on the international piece and supply chain. So we don't really break out geographic sourcing exposure. But most of our products, lipsticks, serums are made in the U.S. or Europe. We do have some limited exposure to China with the Ulta Beauty brand, private label and a few specific brands in the assortment like Morphe, and some components, of course, which are part of our vendor partners supply chain as well.\n So again, we're keeping a close eye on that. There's nothing that we see as a critical watch out at this point in time, but we're just trying to plan ahead and making sure we're as well prepared as we can despite any eventual outcomes there or development. So we feel like we're well positioned for holiday and the second half of the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Simeon Siegel with BMO. \nSimeon Siegel: Congrats on the great results. Dave, to follow up and Kecia, to follow up on that just slightly from the loyalty angle. So can you just speak to your expectations of the member? But first of all, fantastic loyalty results. Can you just speak to your expectations of member growth maybe over the year and then beyond just with the Target relationship now in effect. And then the follow-up, Scott, as you look past this year, can you just speak to how you're viewing these margin rates as to whether they're a new base or whether you expect just give back from the benefits we're seeing right now? \nDavid Kimbell: Great. Thanks, Simeon. Yes, let me start with loyalty and let me just, before I talk specifically about Target, zoom out a little bit. And we're really, really pleased with our loyalty results in the quarter and really through this first half of the year to get back to a new high of 34.6 million members, 8% above last year, 4% above 2019. As I mentioned in the comments, that's faster than we had anticipated. But it's really a testament to an effort across the entire organization from our loyalty team, our analytics team, marketing, merchandising and of course, our store teams and e-commerce teams that are delivering a great experience every day.\n And the fact that we were able to increase total loyalty members by 2.3 million members, which is the largest growth we've had in any single quarter is just exceptional and again, really proud of the team and the effort. That's come through strong new member acquisition, strong reactivation rates of lapsed members and of course, high retention among our existing members. And so our loyalty program has long been a focus of ours. It's absolutely a key differentiating aspect of our total model. We're very proud of it, and we're continuing to innovate and drive that part of our business.\n And specifically about Target, I'm not going to give any specific numbers about our outlook other than one of the main reasons that we're really excited about this program is the connection that we see with our loyalty program, both in delighting our existing guests, and we think over time, increasing their total share of spend with Ulta Beauty with another key pillar in our omnichannel experience with our relationship with Target, but also attracting new guests. The Circle program has over 90 million members in it. They have 30 million people walking through a Target every week. So we feel like there is a very large opportunity for us to attract new loyalty guests into our program, get them engaged in the Ulta Beauty at Target experience, but then also introduce them to all things Ulta across all touch points. So we're confident. And too early to kind of talk about the experience so far. But as Kecia said, we're excited about the results so far and see it as a big driver. Scott, do you want to hit on the margin? \nScott Settersten: Sure, Simeon. So again, we're very, very proud of the results we posted this quarter and appreciative of all the hard work on behalf of our associates and brand partners to deliver great experiences to our guests, which at the end of the day is what delivers those kind of financial results. So I would say the comp performance, again, it was elevated over initial expectations. So the 56% versus last year and a 13% comp versus '19 reflects a mix of benefits, unique external factors, I guess, I would say, combined with the power of our model and all the great execution and things we're doing to drive stronger results and leverage across the P&L. I'd say it makes us increasingly more optimistic.\n Again, you've heard us say that we believe this is a double-digit EBIT margin business over the long term. Our goal is to expand operating margins, and we feel confident we can do that. I guess I would say we're not going to share too much today. We'll have more to say, more color to share on sales outlook and margin expansion opportunities when we get together at our Analyst Day here in October. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: So my first question is, your 2-year comp CAGR accelerated in 2Q versus the first quarter. You're fading that back down to get to low double-digit comps in the fourth quarter despite what should be more work from work and learn from school in the back half. Is this just looking out into the uncertainty? And related to that, have you seen any impact from Delta in August from any markets in particular? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. Great. Thanks, Chris. Yes, absolutely, we are so excited and encouraged by the first half results and the trends. And as you said, the strengthening we saw and the momentum we see throughout the first half. And we're feeling encouraged by what we're seeing so far in the third quarter. And that's why we have increased our sales expectation for the full year.\n I will say, so with that optimism and confidence, it does remain difficult for us with certainty to understand how these variables will impact our business through the remainder of this year. With the resurgence of variants, certainly, that's having a broader impact in the world around us. Our business remains healthy, but difficult to predict exactly how that will play out in consumer behavior. We're optimistic about holiday. We feel like it's going to be a strong holiday. But holiday is always a unique time of year, of course, with a lot of new dynamics going on and uncertainty how COVID and other influences will drive through that.\n And then we're lapping our business in the second half of the year in 2020 was stronger than the first half of the year, for sure, as we reopened stores and started to gain momentum. So we do believe our sales forecast is prudent. It's achievable, but it's also reflective of the uncertainty that we see out there.\n And last thing I'd say, as we've been doing throughout all of this, if the recovery is stronger or faster than planned, we're prepared. We're working closely with our brand partners to be ready to adapt and adjust. We're working hard to make sure we have the right inventory, the right store staffing, the right marketing plans to continue to lead the recovery in the beauty categories, we believe we've been doing so far this first half of the year. So optimistic but feel like our guidance is appropriate given the environment. \nChristopher Horvers: Makes sense. And as a follow-up, quick math suggests that it seems like you're implying maybe a 36.5%, 37% type gross margin in the back half. Is that in the ZIP code? And if that's the case, what drives the lower rate versus the first half? \nScott Settersten: Yes. I would just say, we're taking a more tempered view, I guess, of the promotional environment. Again, naturally, holiday is more promotional. We're competing against a wider variety of retailers during the gift-giving season. We've got some incremental supply chain costs that we're baking into the plan to be prudent around fuel costs and things like that. So again, on balance, we think it's a prudent estimate forecast and we think it's achievable. And if things turn out better, sales are stronger, we'll deliver better results. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. \nOlivia Tong Cheang: First, congrats on the quarter. The first question has to do with the margin because I imagine a lot of this is fixed cost leverage. But how much of this is, how much of the margin, incremental margin is an extension of some of the efficiency and promotional improvements lasting? And how does this, in any way, change your view on customer acquisition costs or additional promotional efficiencies over time?\n And then you also mentioned that the e-commerce sales are mostly incremental, which is fantastic. So can you talk a little bit about the profile of the customer that maybe primarily shops via online versus in-store? Is it changing? Is the incremental new people still coming in via omnichannel? Are they replacing customers who are back to shopping in-store now? Or can you just give a little bit more color there, that would be helpful. \nScott Settersten: Yes. So maybe I'll start with the margin. So it's not exactly clear. But if we're looking at the second quarter, again, we describe that the biggest drivers in the second quarter were the reserve adjustments versus last year. Again, this is versus 2020. And so they were pretty significant last year. So of course, we didn't absorb any of that this year. We're doing a much better job with the stronger sales and better discipline in the stores. So that was a pretty significant benefit. Promotional, less discounting was kind of in the middle of the list, I guess, I would say. Fixed cost is another major driver of gross margin expansion in the second quarter and for the first half of the year just because of the much higher sales levels overall.\n So when I think about those things and of course, the salon manager shift versus last year was another element of that. So again, we're not going to quantify those things. But as I think about the future and we were thinking about the back half of the year, merchandise margin, we still expect to be able to expand it. The promotionality discipline, I think, again, we got a good start on that last year with some good learnings. Those are being played forward now. We still think there's opportunity there for us. There's other things we can do as far as tools and process improvements to help that, aid that over the longer term.\n Fixed costs, again, once we got sales back on track, fixed cost leverage is the gift that keeps giving. So that's something, again, that we feel pretty confident in. And then there's other things we're working on as part of our ESG efforts that will continue to deliver benefits over the long term. So when we think about gross margin, merch margin being the most important piece of that, we still think there's plenty of opportunity for us over the longer term. \nDavid Kimbell: And on your e-com member profile, I'll just hit a couple of high points here, which is, first, our e-commerce business, very healthy and such a strong and important of our total omnichannel mix. And we're really pleased with how that's complementing and integrating with our store experience. And so we're so glad to see strength across both of those channels.\n Omnichannel guests are among our very best guests. Those that are shopping both in-store and online do demonstrate a high level of incrementality with their e-commerce purchases because what we typically see is those that have been shopping in-store that start shopping online continue to shop in-store at, or in some cases, even higher levels. And it's because they get more ingrained and integrated into the total Ulta Beauty experience. They become more loyal to Ulta Beauty and concentrate more of their beauty spend at Ulta.\n So last year, with the stores being closed and the dramatic increase in our e-commerce, we introduced a whole lot of new consumers to our e-commerce business. Now some of them have gone back to shopping only in-store, but most of them are continuing to shop in an e-commerce business, I'm sorry, in an omnichannel way. And the behavior is really positive, both helping to deliver our Q2 results. But importantly, as we grow that base of omnichannel shoppers, we'll have even more consumers shopping across channels going forward, which we know will drive total sales in the out-years going forward. So excited about this omnichannel behavior and believe that one of the lasting impacts of this disruption will be a significant increase in our e-commerce business and our omnichannel behaviors. \nOlivia Tong Cheang: Maybe if I could just follow up on makeup. You mentioned obviously that the momentum has continued 2Q versus 1Q, even if it isn't back to where it was before. Why do you think it hasn't fully recovered back to where it used to be given the replenishment, given that people are going out, there is a lot of innovation. Do we need another trend or is it just there is still some holdback? Just kind of curious given the strength particularly of other categories outside of makeup. \nDavid Kimbell: Sneaking in one more makeup question. But yes, I'll just be brief here, the makeup. We're encouraged by what we see. And I think it's just a testament that the other categories had been strong, skin care, hair care, bath, fragrance. And they remain strong. There's a high level of engagement. But makeup, the trends that we're seeing are encouraging. While it was slightly below 2019 levels in Q2, we had weeks and times during the quarter that it was positive versus 2019. Our mass business, we talked about in Q1, was above 2019 levels, and it accelerated in Q2, also above 2019.\n And our prestige business is improving. We're bringing in newness. Our biggest brands are performing well. New brands are performing. So I think it's just consumer behavior as we recover is there's a high level of engagement, high level of excitement about makeup, more usage occasions and the momentum is building. Time will tell exactly when we get back to steadily being above 2019 levels and growing from there, but we're encouraged by what we see. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Steph Wissink with Jefferies. \nStephanie Schiller Wissink: Hopefully, this is a quick one for you, but wanted to just talk about SG&A leverage because I don't think we've seen on a full year basis that in the guidance for quite some time. So I just wanted to understand a little bit about the key pieces. Maybe, Scott, if you could talk about what components of SG&A you expect to see the best leverage and where you might see some opportunity still in the future periods? \nScott Settersten: Yes. So if you're looking back at 2020, Steph, I think there's going to be a good story there as far as leverage on SG&A overall. Of course, the better comparison is 2019. So that's where I'll spend my time. As we look back there, there's still, I guess, I would say there's going to be leverage versus '19 now versus our earlier in the year outlook there. Again, a lot of that's due to stronger-than-expected sales. So that's good news.\n We expect dollars to be higher in '21 than '19 primarily on store growth, number one, wage pressures primarily in the stores and a big variable here is higher incentive compensation levels than what we saw back in 2019. You'll recall, 2019, we missed our internal targets by a fair range. And so that's going to be a headwind, a significant headwind when we're measuring back against 2019. Of course, we have that service manager role as well that's been reallocated from the gross margin line, where it's a good guide down to SG&A, where it's a headwind versus 2019. But again, that's a net benefit for the company overall at the operating margin level.\n We're also going to be pulling in some incremental advertising, marketing expense in the back half of the year. I think we've mentioned that in some interim investor calls here to take advantage of market share opportunities now and the strength of our business. And of course, we've got good sales trends here, too. So we're going to make some more significant investments there in the back half of the year in digital channels. So again, places we know that it works and it's effective and there are strong ROIs. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. \nIrwin Boruchow: Scott, can you talk a little bit more about just the e-commerce? I mean, I think you said that the dollars doubled versus '19, which I think implies year-over-year was down around 25% to 35%, which makes sense given what you're lapping. But now that your compares are more, I mean, actually they're still tough, but not quite as elevated, do you expect e-commerce growth to return when you get to the third quarter and back half? \nScott Settersten: Yes. Thanks, Ike. So again, yes, second quarter, a little bit unusual. I mean, we did see some growth in the first quarter. But again, we were lapping kind of just the initial stages, I guess, of the COVID and the shift and the store closings and kind of becoming a digital business 100% kind of overnight back in 2020.\n So it was what we expected. That was what was in our annual plan to see an overall decrease in the e-com versus last year. Again, brick-and-mortar, again, our guest demonstrating that brick-and-mortar is an important part of the beauty shopping experience and ecstatic to see traffic numbers coming back to the stores and again, sequentially improving here in 2021. So I think Dave called it out in his prepared remarks.\n We got to remember, last year, second quarter, we doubled our e-commerce business, right? So to expect a little bit of moderation here I don't think is anything extraordinary under the circumstances. As we think about the rest of the year, again, stores, the traffic trends are good. We're encouraged there. So I would expect that e-commerce is going to moderate as we look out to the rest of the year. And I wouldn't expect it to be a growth in absolute terms here as we look over the next couple of quarters. Again, for the full year, we expect e-commerce penetration to be in the low to mid-20% range. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: You had mentioned that the comp did come in higher than your expectations. I wondered if that was a commentary on both what you saw in prestige and mass. And within mass, are you seeing an acceleration in market share gains there, whether it's in cosmetics or other categories? \nKiley Rawlins: So Kate, I'm sorry, can you repeat the first part of your question. We didn't hear you. \nKatharine McShane: Oh, I'm sorry. I'll speak up a little bit. I just wondered based on your comments that you came in higher than your expectations for comp. Is that a similar commentary both for the prestige category and the mass category? And then just within mass, are you seeing an acceleration in share gains there versus what you saw in Q1? \nDavid Kimbell: Got it. Yes. Thanks for the question, Kate. And yes, we're really across the board. Yes, we were higher than our expectations and we're seeing strength versus expectations across really all aspects of our business. I talked about all of our categories demonstrating strong improvement. And in all but makeup, healthy growth versus 2019, and that is true both on the prestige and the mass side.\n And then within makeup specifically, and while we said it's not quite back to 2019, although getting closer and again showing moments through Q2 where we were above 2019. We saw improvement in both mass and prestige. Mass has recovered faster, but prestige is certainly showing signs. And we're seeing some good, and it's really driven by newness across the board, both some new brands that we brought in, but a strong newness across so many of our brands and different segments of makeup that are exciting our guests, getting them re-engaged in the category. So yes, we're seeing it across both price points and categories, and it's encouraging. \nOperator: Our last question comes from Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank. \nKrisztina Katai: Congrats on a very strong quarter. I wanted to touch on the membership base. You mentioned that it reached a new record. You are re-engaging with lapsed consumers and signing on new ones. So where do you think you are in terms of the target customer share of wallet compared to 2019?\n And then secondly, do you have any views on how the selling and competitive landscape is really evolving here as we exit the pandemic. And how are you thinking about the various players, including department stores, brand, DTC and specialty beauty players like Ulta and Sephora? \nDavid Kimbell: Great. Yes. Loyalty, as I mentioned earlier, we're really pleased and encouraged by the results we're seeing, both in the absolute number of active members as well as spend per member. We're seeing nice healthy improvement there, and it's just driven by high-level engagement across categories. And so as we look at share of wallet, we are confident that we're continuing to grow both share of categories and share of wallet, and feel like our efforts to lead the category recovery are driving a high level of engagement.\n And across the competitive environment, certainly, the beauty category is always highly competitive. This is a disruptive time with a lot of changes. We have a high level of respect for all of our competitors. But our focus is on Ulta Beauty and driving our business forward and leading the beauty category and leading the beauty recovery. Our model is unique. Nobody does what Ulta Beauty does. The assortment that we provide, the loyalty program, the guest experience, which is so important and done with excellence in our stores in particular and across all other touch points. And so we believe we have a unique business model that yes, while we certainly watch and are well aware of competitive activity, we're focused on playing offense and driving our business forward. And again, I couldn't be more proud of the way the team is delivering across every part of our business to ensure that Ulta Beauty is the really definitive leader in the beauty category and driving this recovery that we're very encouraged to see.\n So with that, thank you, again, for joining us today. I really appreciate your time. And I do want to thank all of our Ulta Beauty associates for their continued agility and commitment to serving our guests and taking care of each other, especially through the changing dynamics of COVID-19. We look forward to sharing more about why we are so excited about the future of Ulta Beauty when we host our 2021 Analyst Day here in the Chicago area in October. So have a good evening and thanks again for joining. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful evening.",

            "name": "David Kimbell",
            "content": "Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone.\n The Ulta Beauty team delivered excellent results again this quarter, and I want to start by expressing my sincere appreciation to all of our Ulta Beauty associates for their outstanding efforts to drive these results. As I have traveled around the country visiting with our teams across all parts of the company, I continue to feel inspired by their commitment and passion for our guests, our business and for each other.\n We are excited about the momentum we are seeing in our business and are optimistic about our future. The beauty category is recovering faster than we expected, and the investments we've made over the last year to adapt to the market disruption and strengthen our leadership position are delivering results. Our value proposition is strong, and we are evolving and innovating to lead in the new beauty landscape, capture more market share and drive profitable growth.\n For the second quarter, net sales increased 60.2% to $1.97 billion. Operating margin increased to 16.9% of sales and diluted EPS was $4.56 per share. These strong results exceeded our internal expectations and reflect our ongoing efforts to serve our guests, especially as we continue to adapt to the changing environment. In recognition of their dedication to our guests and their efforts to deliver these strong results, this quarter, we awarded a onetime discretionary appreciation bonus to eligible store and DC associates.\n For the quarter, comp sales increased 56.3% driven by strong growth in our brick-and-mortar channel. As consumer confidence, optimism and comfort to shop in physical stores continues to increase, we are seeing more of our members return to stores. Traffic trends in stores improved from the first quarter, but remained lower than 2019 levels. However, comp sales in stores increased this quarter compared to 2019 driven by strong average ticket growth.\n We continue to optimize operating hours, and I am pleased to share that our retail operating hours are nearly back to 2019 levels. As expected, e-commerce declined as compared to the second quarter last year but were more than double 2019 levels. The sales decline was driven by a decrease in the number of transactions. Average ticket remains strong. Recall that our e-commerce business increased more than 200% in the second quarter last year as we phased the reopening of stores.\n Guest utilization of buy online pickup in store remained high totaling 20% of e-commerce sales in the quarter. To enhance the experience, we made operational improvements to increase order accuracy and fulfillment speed. And in the second quarter, 97% of orders were ready for pickup within 2 hours. We have also increased the number of stores with dedicated parking spaces and we continue to look for opportunities to make curbside pickup available at nontraditional Ulta Beauty locations.\n Customer engagement in our digital platforms remain strong even as store traffic ramps up. Compared to the first quarter, our omnichannel guests, on average, maintained the same number of transactions in the online channel even as they increased their in-store transactions, reinforcing that e-commerce transactions are incremental and help drive greater overall member engagement and spend.\n From a category perspective, we increased market share across all major prestige beauty categories based on dollar sales for the 13 weeks ended July 31, 2021 compared to the same time period last year. We also saw sales strength across all of our major mass categories.\n Compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020, all major categories delivered robust double-digit comps as we anniversaried last year's phased reopening process and introduced more newness. Compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019, fragrance, bath, skin care and hair care, all delivered strong double-digit comp growth. Makeup was only slightly lower than 2019. While comp sales in the makeup category are not yet positive compared to 2019, momentum is building with both mass and prestige categories improving from the first quarter trend. Reductions in mask-wearing requirements, combined with an increase in makeup-wearing occasions, helped drive strong growth in face and lip, while engagement with eye continue to be healthy.\n During the quarter, we launched 3 new makeup brands, Bobbi Brown, Elaluz, a prestige brand founded by a well-known Brazilian influencer and makeup artist, and Undone Beauty. These new brands, combined with new product launches from a wide range of brands, including MAC, Clinique, NYX, e.l.f. and Maybelline, drove improved sales performance in the quarter.\n Skin care delivered another quarter of strong double-digit sales growth compared to 2019. Reflecting the strong connection between beauty and self-care, guests are maintaining their skin care regimens even as they increase makeup purchases. Moisturizers, serums and cleansers continue to drive category growth. We also saw robust growth in sun protection and self-tanning as consumers re-engaged with travel and vacation activities. New brands, including fresh, Good Molecules, which is exclusive to Ulta Beauty, and b.tan as well as new products from Tula, Shiseido, CeraVe, La Roche-Posay and The Cre\u0300me Shop, drove solid guest engagement.\n Hair care continued to deliver double-digit growth driven by newness and strong guest engagement with our strategic tent-pole events. We began the quarter with our semiannual Gorgeous Hair event, an event strategically designed to convert members who do not currently shop the hair care category or engage with our salon services. This year, we streamlined offers and invested in dedicated social and digital marketing campaigns to expand our reach. As a result, the event attracted new members to the category and delivered stronger-than-expected sales and profitability.\n We ended the quarter with our Jumbo Love event, a basket-building event focused on larger product sizes. We continued to narrow brand participation and simplify our presentation to guests. These improvements resulted in stronger sales and profitability. In addition to strong strategic events, we also launched a number of new hair care brands throughout the quarter, including Rizos Curls, Verb and CURLS, a well-established Black-owned brand. These new brands, combined with recently launched Briogeo and Kristin Ess, contributed to the strong category growth this quarter as consumers focus on building and maintaining hair health.\n Finally, fragrance and bath delivered exceptionally strong growth driven by Mother's Day and Father's Day sales as well as our Fragrance Crush events. Newness in fragrance from Marc Jacobs and Carolina Herrera as well as engagement with the base business from favorites like Dolce & Gabbana and Chanel drove meaningful market share growth. Body scrubs and moisturizers from brands like Truly and Tree Hut continued to drive outstanding sales growth, reflecting guests' continued commitment to self-care.\n Our Conscious Beauty platform continues to expand and resonate with guests. At the end of the second quarter, more than 270 brands were certified in at least 1 of the 5 Conscious Beauty pillars and now include fresh, Kylie Cosmetics, Happy Dance and Good Molecules, among others.\n To promote guest discovery and trial this quarter, we will offer guests the new Conscious Beauty sampler kit, which includes hero brands like Beekman 1802, Kinship, Tarte and Tula. We will also refresh our endcap in stores, adding products from Dermalogica, Sunday Riley, Florence and Truly. As we work to scale Conscious Beauty further, we are enhancing our search capabilities on ulta.com and in the mobile app to make it easier for guests to find certified products that reflect their personal values.\n Through the pandemic, the lines between health and beauty have blurred. Based on our proprietary research, we know that 65% of beauty enthusiasts believe beauty is significantly connected to wellness. Reflecting these consumer insights, this quarter, we launched The Wellness Shop in select stores and on ulta.com to help our guests navigate their personal wellness journey. With a guest category focus on self-care for the mind, body and spirit, The Wellness Shop features a curated selection of products across 5 key segments, including supplements and ingestibles and spa at home. From daily rituals to relaxation and sleep regimens, the shop addresses a variety of wellness needs in an accessible, easy-to-navigate presentation. Our guests are responding well to the platform, and we'll continue to increase awareness of the offering and expand its presence over time.\n Our services business is also gaining momentum. Sales from hair and brow services increased more than 60% compared to 2020. Despite capacity limitations due to mandates from the CDC and state and local authorities, we are increasing member engagement and driving retail attachment, especially through our salon backbar takeovers. Services play an important role in driving guest engagement, loyalty, frequency and spend. I'm excited to share that we plan to relaunch skin services in select stores in the third quarter. We plan to offer new services that target specific concerns such as hydration, anti-aging as well as acne facials that cater to our Gen Z guest, and we will test microchanneling, dermaplaning and HydraFacials in select stores.\n Turning now to our loyalty program. We are seeing faster recovery in active member growth than initially expected. We ended the second quarter with a record 34.6 million active members, 8% above last year and 4% above 2019. Spend per member also increased, driven by higher average ticket, surpassing both 2020 and 2019 levels.\n The majority of new member acquisition happens in stores and our talented store associates continue to convert new members at higher rates than in 2019. We are also improving our conversion rates online, reflecting improvements we had made in the online customer journey. In addition to growth in new members, we are accelerating reactivation of lapsed members and increasing retention rates of existing members as we continue to advance and apply our data and analytics capabilities.\n From a channel perspective, in-store-only members totaled 73% this quarter, increasing from 67% in the first quarter. As expected, the mix of omnichannel members moderated from the first quarter to 18% of total members, but remained well above 2019 levels. Importantly, omnichannel members continued to increase their spend across both store and digital channels. As we progress through the rest of the year, we expect the penetration of omnichannel guests will continue to moderate as in-store shopping increases, but remain above 2019 levels.\n Discovery and trial are critical parts of the beauty experience, and we offer a variety of physical and digital ways to discover new products, new trends and new applications. This quarter, we launched new functionality in our mobile app that allows guests greater access to select product scanning for content and reviews, loyalty information and virtual try-on while shopping in stores.\n In addition, we reintroduced testers in stores with expanded stations of testing and sanitation supplies. We continue to deliver hyper-relevant content to drive discovery and build stronger connections with our guests. This quarter, we introduced Beauty School Live Virtual Masterclasses focused on brand launches, demonstrations and beauty tutorials. BeautyBio founder Jamie O'Banion hosted a Megawatt Glow masterclass, showcasing skin care tools and products. And in honor of National Lipstick Day, we partnered with a NYX Professional Makeup pro artist to walk viewers through a long wear lip look.\n In July, we launched a partnership with Supergreat, a hyper-relevant, app-based, Gen Z-centric live stream platform that is 100% focused on beauty. From shoppable live videos to editorial content and exclusive product drops, the Supergreat community is an ideal partnership for experiential immersive beauty. While we are early in our pilot, we've already seen encouraging results with engagement tracking ahead of other live platforms.\n As part of our holistic marketing efforts to reinforce Ulta Beauty's authority in the skin care category, we launched #UltaSkinTok, our first multi-branded TikTok hashtag challenge. To drive increased awareness of our category breadth and depth, we asked audiences to post their favorite skin care products from Ulta Beauty. The hashtag has amassed more than 8 billion views to date with 1.6 million videos created.\n We want Ulta Beauty to be the most loved beauty destination and the most inclusive. Building on our focus as a diversity-forward company, we announced a number of commitments at the beginning of this fiscal year to further our efforts to champion diversity and inclusion. This quarter, we joined the 15 Percent Pledge, committing to dedicate 15% of our total assortment to Black-owned, Black-founded and Black-led brands. To date this year, we have welcomed 8 new Black-owned brands to the Ulta Beauty family, including Homebody, CAMILLE ROSE and mented, and we are on track to double the number of Black-owned brands in our assortment this year.\n As part of our cross-functional approach to integrate diversity and inclusion into all that we do, our teams launched a textured hair training series for all stylists to better enable more inclusive experiences in our salons. We also launched mandatory inclusion in action training in stores to understand what diversity, equity and inclusion means to Ulta Beauty.\n We strive to make a positive difference in the communities where we live and work. The Ulta Beauty Charitable Foundation focuses on improving the lives of women and families. This quarter, with the generosity of our guests, our teams raised more than $2 million for Save the Children, to support mothers and children in need. We also partnered with LinkedIn with the #BackToWork campaign, highlighting the pandemic's impact on women and providing resources to aid economic recovery.\n And as part of our ongoing efforts to reduce waste and minimize our impact on the environment, we recently launched the Consortium to Reinvent the Retail Bag, a multiyear collaboration across retail sectors that aims to identify, test and implement innovative new design solutions that serve the functions of today's single-use plastic retail bag.\n Finally, I am very excited to share that Ulta Beauty at Target has launched in 58 stores and online with plans to open about 100 stores by the end of the quarter. Over the last 9 months, the Ulta Beauty and Target teams have collaborated closely to create a unique way for guests to experience beauty, and we are excited to see it come to life.\n As guests come to Ulta Beauty at Target, they will be welcomed into a 1,000 square foot co-design space with bold new fixtures and lighting that celebrate premium beauty with a modern look. Each aspect of the shop was thoughtfully designed to make the space feel authentic to Ulta Beauty, Target and the featured brands within the assortment. From the unmistakable Ulta Beauty orange pop canopies and vivid graphics that weave into the existing Target store, everything was designed to create an inspiring and unique beauty experience for guests.\n With compelling product displays and unique discovery zones, the shop offers a curated selection of more than 50 prestige and emerging brands, including MAC, Clinique, Morphe, Tula, The Ordinary, Pattern, Madison Reed, Urban Decay and the Ulta Beauty Collection. The assortment is a compelling mix of best-selling items as well as limited edition collaborations and minis to drive discovery and trial.\n We're making the experience as seamless as possible both in-store and online. Guests shopping Ulta Beauty at Target on Target.com and the Target app will enjoy free shipping for qualifying orders and all of Target's same-day fulfillment services. And guests will benefit from rewards across both Ultamate Rewards and Target Circle.\n While it's only been 10 days since the first shop was opened, guest response has been overwhelmingly positive with enthusiasm about 2 of their favorite retailers coming together and excitement about the ability to earn points in both loyalty programs. We're thrilled about this partnership and how together we can change the way the world experiences beauty.\n Before I turn the call over to Scott, I want to announce that we will host an Analyst Day here in Chicago on October 19 to share how our strategic priorities are evolving and how we plan to continue to position Ulta Beauty to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. Given the ongoing uncertainty around the Delta variant, we are planning the event to accommodate both in-person and virtual participation. Our teams will continue to assess guidance from the CDC, and we will adapt our plans as necessary to ensure the safety of our team and attendees.\n And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? Great. Well, thanks for the question and the comments, Adrienne. I appreciate it. Yes, let me start on Target and then I'm going to ask Kecia to give some more color because Kecia is leading this for us. But we are, as I said in the comments, we're just thrilled with the partnership and the launch guest response. We feel really confident how we've come out of the gate operationally, working really well. And most importantly, as I mentioned, consumers are thrilled by this. They're really excited about the idea of bringing together 2 great retailers in a unique experience that nobody else is doing. This is totally new to beauty. And so we're really, really pleased with the results and the engagement and the partnership. Kecia, why don't you share a few more details about what we're seeing and maybe the outlook on stores. Great. Thanks, Simeon. Yes, let me start with loyalty and let me just, before I talk specifically about Target, zoom out a little bit. And we're really, really pleased with our loyalty results in the quarter and really through this first half of the year to get back to a new high of 34.6 million members, 8% above last year, 4% above 2019. As I mentioned in the comments, that's faster than we had anticipated. But it's really a testament to an effort across the entire organization from our loyalty team, our analytics team, marketing, merchandising and of course, our store teams and e-commerce teams that are delivering a great experience every day.\n And the fact that we were able to increase total loyalty members by 2.3 million members, which is the largest growth we've had in any single quarter is just exceptional and again, really proud of the team and the effort. That's come through strong new member acquisition, strong reactivation rates of lapsed members and of course, high retention among our existing members. And so our loyalty program has long been a focus of ours. It's absolutely a key differentiating aspect of our total model. We're very proud of it, and we're continuing to innovate and drive that part of our business.\n And specifically about Target, I'm not going to give any specific numbers about our outlook other than one of the main reasons that we're really excited about this program is the connection that we see with our loyalty program, both in delighting our existing guests, and we think over time, increasing their total share of spend with Ulta Beauty with another key pillar in our omnichannel experience with our relationship with Target, but also attracting new guests. The Circle program has over 90 million members in it. They have 30 million people walking through a Target every week. So we feel like there is a very large opportunity for us to attract new loyalty guests into our program, get them engaged in the Ulta Beauty at Target experience, but then also introduce them to all things Ulta across all touch points. So we're confident. And too early to kind of talk about the experience so far. But as Kecia said, we're excited about the results so far and see it as a big driver. Scott, do you want to hit on the margin? Yes. Great. Thanks, Chris. Yes, absolutely, we are so excited and encouraged by the first half results and the trends. And as you said, the strengthening we saw and the momentum we see throughout the first half. And we're feeling encouraged by what we're seeing so far in the third quarter. And that's why we have increased our sales expectation for the full year.\n I will say, so with that optimism and confidence, it does remain difficult for us with certainty to understand how these variables will impact our business through the remainder of this year. With the resurgence of variants, certainly, that's having a broader impact in the world around us. Our business remains healthy, but difficult to predict exactly how that will play out in consumer behavior. We're optimistic about holiday. We feel like it's going to be a strong holiday. But holiday is always a unique time of year, of course, with a lot of new dynamics going on and uncertainty how COVID and other influences will drive through that.\n And then we're lapping our business in the second half of the year in 2020 was stronger than the first half of the year, for sure, as we reopened stores and started to gain momentum. So we do believe our sales forecast is prudent. It's achievable, but it's also reflective of the uncertainty that we see out there.\n And last thing I'd say, as we've been doing throughout all of this, if the recovery is stronger or faster than planned, we're prepared. We're working closely with our brand partners to be ready to adapt and adjust. We're working hard to make sure we have the right inventory, the right store staffing, the right marketing plans to continue to lead the recovery in the beauty categories, we believe we've been doing so far this first half of the year. So optimistic but feel like our guidance is appropriate given the environment. And on your e-com member profile, I'll just hit a couple of high points here, which is, first, our e-commerce business, very healthy and such a strong and important of our total omnichannel mix. And we're really pleased with how that's complementing and integrating with our store experience. And so we're so glad to see strength across both of those channels.\n Omnichannel guests are among our very best guests. Those that are shopping both in-store and online do demonstrate a high level of incrementality with their e-commerce purchases because what we typically see is those that have been shopping in-store that start shopping online continue to shop in-store at, or in some cases, even higher levels. And it's because they get more ingrained and integrated into the total Ulta Beauty experience. They become more loyal to Ulta Beauty and concentrate more of their beauty spend at Ulta.\n So last year, with the stores being closed and the dramatic increase in our e-commerce, we introduced a whole lot of new consumers to our e-commerce business. Now some of them have gone back to shopping only in-store, but most of them are continuing to shop in an e-commerce business, I'm sorry, in an omnichannel way. And the behavior is really positive, both helping to deliver our Q2 results. But importantly, as we grow that base of omnichannel shoppers, we'll have even more consumers shopping across channels going forward, which we know will drive total sales in the out-years going forward. So excited about this omnichannel behavior and believe that one of the lasting impacts of this disruption will be a significant increase in our e-commerce business and our omnichannel behaviors. Sneaking in one more makeup question. But yes, I'll just be brief here, the makeup. We're encouraged by what we see. And I think it's just a testament that the other categories had been strong, skin care, hair care, bath, fragrance. And they remain strong. There's a high level of engagement. But makeup, the trends that we're seeing are encouraging. While it was slightly below 2019 levels in Q2, we had weeks and times during the quarter that it was positive versus 2019. Our mass business, we talked about in Q1, was above 2019 levels, and it accelerated in Q2, also above 2019.\n And our prestige business is improving. We're bringing in newness. Our biggest brands are performing well. New brands are performing. So I think it's just consumer behavior as we recover is there's a high level of engagement, high level of excitement about makeup, more usage occasions and the momentum is building. Time will tell exactly when we get back to steadily being above 2019 levels and growing from there, but we're encouraged by what we see. Got it. Yes. Thanks for the question, Kate. And yes, we're really across the board. Yes, we were higher than our expectations and we're seeing strength versus expectations across really all aspects of our business. I talked about all of our categories demonstrating strong improvement. And in all but makeup, healthy growth versus 2019, and that is true both on the prestige and the mass side.\n And then within makeup specifically, and while we said it's not quite back to 2019, although getting closer and again showing moments through Q2 where we were above 2019. We saw improvement in both mass and prestige. Mass has recovered faster, but prestige is certainly showing signs. And we're seeing some good, and it's really driven by newness across the board, both some new brands that we brought in, but a strong newness across so many of our brands and different segments of makeup that are exciting our guests, getting them re-engaged in the category. So yes, we're seeing it across both price points and categories, and it's encouraging. Great. Yes. Loyalty, as I mentioned earlier, we're really pleased and encouraged by the results we're seeing, both in the absolute number of active members as well as spend per member. We're seeing nice healthy improvement there, and it's just driven by high-level engagement across categories. And so as we look at share of wallet, we are confident that we're continuing to grow both share of categories and share of wallet, and feel like our efforts to lead the category recovery are driving a high level of engagement.\n And across the competitive environment, certainly, the beauty category is always highly competitive. This is a disruptive time with a lot of changes. We have a high level of respect for all of our competitors. But our focus is on Ulta Beauty and driving our business forward and leading the beauty category and leading the beauty recovery. Our model is unique. Nobody does what Ulta Beauty does. The assortment that we provide, the loyalty program, the guest experience, which is so important and done with excellence in our stores in particular and across all other touch points. And so we believe we have a unique business model that yes, while we certainly watch and are well aware of competitive activity, we're focused on playing offense and driving our business forward. And again, I couldn't be more proud of the way the team is delivering across every part of our business to ensure that Ulta Beauty is the really definitive leader in the beauty category and driving this recovery that we're very encouraged to see.\n So with that, thank you, again, for joining us today. I really appreciate your time. And I do want to thank all of our Ulta Beauty associates for their continued agility and commitment to serving our guests and taking care of each other, especially through the changing dynamics of COVID-19. We look forward to sharing more about why we are so excited about the future of Ulta Beauty when we host our 2021 Analyst Day here in the Chicago area in October. So have a good evening and thanks again for joining."

            "name": "Scott Settersten",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone.\n Starting with the income statement. Q2 sales increased 60.2% as we anniversaried the disruption of stores last year due to COVID-19. We opened 7 new stores during the quarter and closed 1 store. We also remodeled 5 stores and relocated 1 store.\n Total company comp increased 56.3% driven by a 52.5% increase in transactions and a 2.5% growth in average ticket. As Dave mentioned, the resurgence of traffic in stores drove the strong comp performance. Compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019, total sales increased 18% and comp sales increased 13.1%.\n From a mix perspective, cosmetics was 43% of sales compared to 45% last year. Skin care was 17% of sales compared to 18% last year, the fragrance and bath category increased 300 basis points to 12% of sales, and hair care products and styling tools was flat with last year at 21% of sales. The services category increased to 4% of sales compared to 3% last year.\n Q2 gross profit margin increased to 40.6% of sales compared to 26.8% last year. The increase was primarily due to the leverage of fixed costs, higher merchandise margin, more favorable channel mix and leverage of salon expenses. Strong top line growth drove significant leverage of fixed costs.\n The improvement in merchandise margin was primarily the result of anniversary-ing higher inventory reserves in the second quarter last year as well as higher sales, lower promotional activity and ongoing benefits from our cost optimization efforts. Recall that we increased inventory reserves by $16.5 million in the second quarter last year primarily to adjust for slow turning and discontinued makeup SKUs and permanently closed stores. As a percentage of sales, salon expenses were lower compared to last year, reflecting strong top line sales and the elimination of the salon manager role. As a reminder, we will anniversary this change in Q4.\n Comparing this year's performance to the second quarter of fiscal 2019, gross margin improved by 420 basis points. Higher merchandise margin, fixed cost leverage and leverage of salon expenses were partially offset by adverse channel mix. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased to 23.6% compared to 22.1% last year. Higher store payroll and benefits and higher marketing expense was partially offset by leverage of corporate overhead and variable store expenses.\n Store payroll and benefits deleveraged in the quarter primarily due to the anniversary-ing of the $48.2 million in employee retention credits made available last year under the CARES Act. In addition, reflecting the strong operational performance, we elected to grant discretionary appreciation bonuses to our nonexempt store and DC teams in recognition of their efforts.\n Marketing expense also deleveraged during the quarter, primarily reflecting increased spend on print marketing. Recall that last year, we significantly reduced our spend on print material while our stores were closed due to the pandemic. We are also expanding our investment in digital marketing to support key events and re-engage lapsed members. In addition, we are leveraging our CRM capabilities and working more closely with our brand partners to create more targeted digital marketing campaigns across multiple touch points. Strong top line growth resulted in nice leverage of corporate overhead and store expenses.\n Compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019, SG&A as a percentage of sales was flat. As a percentage of sales, lower store expenses were offset by higher store payroll and corporate overhead. Compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019, advertising in the second quarter of 2021 was flat as a percentage of sales.\n Operating margin was 16.9% of sales compared to 1.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 on a GAAP basis and 4.5% on an adjusted basis. Strong top line growth driven by brick-and-mortar, combined with the impact of our cost optimization efforts including promotional optimization, delivered record operating margin results.\n The tax rate increased to 24.4% compared to 20.6% last year due to a decrease in state tax credits as a result of an increase in pretax income. Diluted GAAP earnings per share were $4.56, which included $0.04 per share of tax benefit related to share-based compensation compared to $0.14 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of last year was $0.73.\n Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total inventory increased 5.5% compared to last year, reflecting the impact of 32 additional stores, the opening of our Jacksonville fast fulfillment center in Q3 of fiscal 2020 and increased inventory purchases to support higher demand. Capital expenditures were $22.7 million for the quarter driven by our new store opening program, investments in IT systems and store remodels and relocations. Depreciation was $69 million compared with $77.4 million last year, primarily reflecting the impact of last year's store impairments and the 19 stores which were permanently closed.\n We ended the quarter with $770.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. In the second quarter, we repurchased 746,000 shares at a cost of $243.5 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $886.2 million remaining under our current $1.6 billion repurchase authorization. We continue to expect to repurchase approximately $850 million of shares in fiscal 2021 but as always have the flexibility to modify the cadence of repurchases in response to market conditions.\n Turning now to our updated outlook for 2021. We are encouraged by our first half results and the trends we've experienced so far in the third quarter. While the operating environment continues to be dynamic and our near-term visibility remains limited, especially as it relates to the spread of COVID variants, we have increased our financial expectations for the year. We now expect net sales for the year to be between $8.1 billion and $8.3 billion with comp sales growth planned to be in the 30% to 32% range.\n We continue to expect comp results will moderate to the low double-digit range as we move through the second half. We expect to open approximately 44 net new stores and remodel or relocate 18 stores. We now expect operating margin rate for the year will be approximately 13% of sales. We continue to believe the largest driver of operating margin expansion will come from gross margin, driven by leverage of fixed cost, less headwind from channel shift, improving merchandise margin and leverage of salon costs.\n Based on the higher top line growth, we now expect to leverage SG&A more than previously expected as compared to fiscal 2020. These assumptions result in an expectation for diluted earnings per share in the range of $14.50 to $14.70 per share, including the impact of approximately $850 million in share repurchases. Like others, we are managing global supply chain constraints, port congestion and other headwinds, including the resurgence of COVID-19.\n Our teams are working diligently to mitigate risk and where appropriate, we are proactively working with our brand partners to prioritize receipts to ensure we have adequate inventory for the holiday season. As a result, we expect that our inventory levels at the end of the third quarter will likely be elevated above expected sales growth.\n We plan to spend between $225 million and $250 million in CapEx in fiscal 2021, including approximately $100 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $105 million for supply chain and IT and about $33 million for store maintenance and other. As a reminder, our guidance for 2021 assumes a consistent federal tax rate and no material increases in the federal minimum wage and does not include assumptions for any impact related to a resurgence of COVID-19.\n And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. And then I'll follow up on the international piece and supply chain. So we don't really break out geographic sourcing exposure. But most of our products, lipsticks, serums are made in the U.S. or Europe. We do have some limited exposure to China with the Ulta Beauty brand, private label and a few specific brands in the assortment like Morphe, and some components, of course, which are part of our vendor partners supply chain as well.\n So again, we're keeping a close eye on that. There's nothing that we see as a critical watch out at this point in time, but we're just trying to plan ahead and making sure we're as well prepared as we can despite any eventual outcomes there or development. So we feel like we're well positioned for holiday and the second half of the year. Sure, Simeon. So again, we're very, very proud of the results we posted this quarter and appreciative of all the hard work on behalf of our associates and brand partners to deliver great experiences to our guests, which at the end of the day is what delivers those kind of financial results. So I would say the comp performance, again, it was elevated over initial expectations. So the 56% versus last year and a 13% comp versus '19 reflects a mix of benefits, unique external factors, I guess, I would say, combined with the power of our model and all the great execution and things we're doing to drive stronger results and leverage across the P&L. I'd say it makes us increasingly more optimistic.\n Again, you've heard us say that we believe this is a double-digit EBIT margin business over the long term. Our goal is to expand operating margins, and we feel confident we can do that. I guess I would say we're not going to share too much today. We'll have more to say, more color to share on sales outlook and margin expansion opportunities when we get together at our Analyst Day here in October. Yes. I would just say, we're taking a more tempered view, I guess, of the promotional environment. Again, naturally, holiday is more promotional. We're competing against a wider variety of retailers during the gift-giving season. We've got some incremental supply chain costs that we're baking into the plan to be prudent around fuel costs and things like that. So again, on balance, we think it's a prudent estimate forecast and we think it's achievable. And if things turn out better, sales are stronger, we'll deliver better results. Yes. So maybe I'll start with the margin. So it's not exactly clear. But if we're looking at the second quarter, again, we describe that the biggest drivers in the second quarter were the reserve adjustments versus last year. Again, this is versus 2020. And so they were pretty significant last year. So of course, we didn't absorb any of that this year. We're doing a much better job with the stronger sales and better discipline in the stores. So that was a pretty significant benefit. Promotional, less discounting was kind of in the middle of the list, I guess, I would say. Fixed cost is another major driver of gross margin expansion in the second quarter and for the first half of the year just because of the much higher sales levels overall.\n So when I think about those things and of course, the salon manager shift versus last year was another element of that. So again, we're not going to quantify those things. But as I think about the future and we were thinking about the back half of the year, merchandise margin, we still expect to be able to expand it. The promotionality discipline, I think, again, we got a good start on that last year with some good learnings. Those are being played forward now. We still think there's opportunity there for us. There's other things we can do as far as tools and process improvements to help that, aid that over the longer term.\n Fixed costs, again, once we got sales back on track, fixed cost leverage is the gift that keeps giving. So that's something, again, that we feel pretty confident in. And then there's other things we're working on as part of our ESG efforts that will continue to deliver benefits over the long term. So when we think about gross margin, merch margin being the most important piece of that, we still think there's plenty of opportunity for us over the longer term. Yes. So if you're looking back at 2020, Steph, I think there's going to be a good story there as far as leverage on SG&A overall. Of course, the better comparison is 2019. So that's where I'll spend my time. As we look back there, there's still, I guess, I would say there's going to be leverage versus '19 now versus our earlier in the year outlook there. Again, a lot of that's due to stronger-than-expected sales. So that's good news.\n We expect dollars to be higher in '21 than '19 primarily on store growth, number one, wage pressures primarily in the stores and a big variable here is higher incentive compensation levels than what we saw back in 2019. You'll recall, 2019, we missed our internal targets by a fair range. And so that's going to be a headwind, a significant headwind when we're measuring back against 2019. Of course, we have that service manager role as well that's been reallocated from the gross margin line, where it's a good guide down to SG&A, where it's a headwind versus 2019. But again, that's a net benefit for the company overall at the operating margin level.\n We're also going to be pulling in some incremental advertising, marketing expense in the back half of the year. I think we've mentioned that in some interim investor calls here to take advantage of market share opportunities now and the strength of our business. And of course, we've got good sales trends here, too. So we're going to make some more significant investments there in the back half of the year in digital channels. So again, places we know that it works and it's effective and there are strong ROIs. Yes. Thanks, Ike. So again, yes, second quarter, a little bit unusual. I mean, we did see some growth in the first quarter. But again, we were lapping kind of just the initial stages, I guess, of the COVID and the shift and the store closings and kind of becoming a digital business 100% kind of overnight back in 2020.\n So it was what we expected. That was what was in our annual plan to see an overall decrease in the e-com versus last year. Again, brick-and-mortar, again, our guest demonstrating that brick-and-mortar is an important part of the beauty shopping experience and ecstatic to see traffic numbers coming back to the stores and again, sequentially improving here in 2021. So I think Dave called it out in his prepared remarks.\n We got to remember, last year, second quarter, we doubled our e-commerce business, right? So to expect a little bit of moderation here I don't think is anything extraordinary under the circumstances. As we think about the rest of the year, again, stores, the traffic trends are good. We're encouraged there. So I would expect that e-commerce is going to moderate as we look out to the rest of the year. And I wouldn't expect it to be a growth in absolute terms here as we look over the next couple of quarters. Again, for the full year, we expect e-commerce penetration to be in the low to mid-20% range."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to Ulta Beauty's conference call to discuss results for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rawlins, please proceed. \nKiley Rawlins: Thank you, Shamali. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Hosting our call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; Dave Kimbell, President; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Kecia Steelman, Chief Store Operations Officer, will join us for the Q&A session.  \n Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that statements made on this conference call, which are not historical facts, may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today, May 27, 2021. We have no obligation to update or revise our forward-looking statements, except as required by law, and you should not expect us to do so.  \n In today's comments, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which have been presented to reflect our view of ongoing operations by adjusting fiscal 2020 results for store impairment charges and adjusting both 2021 and 2020 for stock compensation and other tax credits. A reconciliation of these measures for the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release which is available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ulta.com.  \n Following prepared comments from our leadership team, we will open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] As always, I'll be available for any follow-up questions after the call. Now I'll turn the call over to Mary. Mary? \nMary Dillon: Thank you, Kylie, and good afternoon, everyone.  \n This afternoon, we reported record first quarter financial performance, with sales and earnings exceeding both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 levels. For the first quarter, net sales increased 65.2% to $1.9 billion. Operating margin was 15.8% of sales, and GAAP diluted EPS was $4.10 per share. Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter was $4.07 per share.  \n Fiscal 2021 is off to a fantastic start at Ulta Beauty, and I want to thank all our associates for their continued efforts to deliver great experiences and support our business in an environment that continues to be very dynamic. Now as you know, this will be the final time I speak with all of you as CEO as I will transition to Executive Chair of Ulta Beauty next week after our Annual Shareholder Meeting. I cannot express how much of an honor serving as the CEO of Ulta Beauty has been for me. I'm proud of what we've accomplished over the last 8 years and the amazing team and culture that we've built.  \n I want to thank my leadership team for their collaboration, agility and commitment to our associates and guests. And I want to thank all of you in the investor community for your interest and support. I am really excited about Ulta Beauty's future, and I'm confident this will be a seamless leadership transition.  \n Dave's passion for Ulta Beauty and our associates is unmatched. And he knows the beauty category, our business and our guests very well. In fact, his role as a Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Merchandising Officer and President have given him a much better understanding of the category, demand creation and the needs of our guests than I had when I assumed the CEO role 8 years ago. I know his knowledge and commitment will position him well to lead Ulta Beauty through its next chapter of growth.  \n And although many of you have met her, I want to take a moment to introduce Kecia Steelman, who is joining the call today and will become our Chief Operating Officer. Kecia has done an outstanding job as our Store Operations Leader for the past 7-plus years, and I'm excited that she will expand her scope to include supply chain, Ulta Beauty at Target and enterprise level continuous improvement efforts. As you get to know her in this new role, I know you'll be impressed by her knowledge, leadership style and passion for our business, associates and guests.  \n Although this change is somewhat bittersweet for me personally, I'm excited about my new role as Executive Chair. I look forward to supporting Dave, Kecia and the rest of the Ulta Beauty leadership team as they build on what we've accomplished together and continue to lead and disrupt the beauty category for many years to come.  \n Now I'll turn the call over to Dave to share more detail about the first quarter's results. \nDavid Kimbell: Thanks, Mary, for your kind words, confidence and support. We've worked together for a long time, and I'm grateful for the opportunity I've had to learn from you and to lead with you.  \n Under your leadership, Ulta Beauty has established a winning, engaging culture, become the largest U.S. beauty retailer, joined the Fortune 500 and tripled its market cap. And we have solidified the company as the preferred destination for beauty enthusiasts, created an inclusive, well-regarded workplace and become a recognized leader in the business and retail community. I want to thank you personally for your leadership and mentorship, and I look forward to your ongoing support and counsel as I transition into my new role.  \n Kecia, I'm thrilled to continue to work with you in your new role as Chief Operating Officer. We've worked closely for the last 7 years, and I look forward to leading with you and our experienced executive team in service of our associates, guests and shareholders.  \n I am excited and humbled to become the CEO of Ulta Beauty. Over the last several years, I've worked closely with Mary and the entire executive team to build our culture, strengthen our guest engagement, and develop our strategic plan, and I will work hard to ensure a seamless transition as we plan and execute the next chapter of our growth.  \n Over the last 60 days, I've spent time talking with and listening to our leaders and our associates across the enterprise. Most recently, Kecia and I visited our Greenwood distribution center and our new Jacksonville, Florida fast fulfillment center as well as a number of stores. And more than exceptional operations, we saw firsthand the commitment and passion our associates bring to serving our guests. Despite the challenges of maintaining COVID-related safety protocols, our DC teams continue to meet the growing demands across channels, and our store teams continue to create human connections and meaningful connections with our guests every day.  \n I continue to be proud of how our teams navigated the challenges of the last year with strength, grace and a commitment to our guests and to each other.  \n We are emerging from 2020 as a leader. We see this in our sales trends, market share gains, consumer sentiment, brand strength and most importantly, in our culture. I believe this is a testament to the choices we made throughout 2020 and also to the strength of our 31-year history as a vibrant company and successful category disruptor.  \n To build on this success, I am focused on 4 key areas as I transition into the CEO role: our culture, our members, omnichannel experiences and operational excellence. Ulta Beauty has built a guest- and associate-centric, values-based and high-performance culture. We value and encourage collaboration and enterprise thinking, and we respect and listen to our associates to continually improve as a company. These tenets are core to how we lead, how we engage with our guests and partners and how we make decisions. Our culture is a key part to our success and why I am committed to protecting and enhancing our culture as we move forward.  \n As we emerge from the challenges of the pandemic, consumers are creating new routines and habits, and we have the unique opportunity to build deeper connections and drive greater engagement with our members. Each of our more than 37,000 associates play a role in member engagement and retention. My vision is that, together, we can and will accelerate how we engage and delight our guests every day.  \n And not just in stores or online, but through a seamless omnichannel lens. Consumers are quickly evolving expectations for how physical and digital platforms work together to create holistic brand experiences. As we focus on longer-term growth for Ulta Beauty, we are thinking about how we can create emotional, immersive, human experiences across all touch points and how we can evolve our organization and the ways we work together to support a buy anywhere, fill anywhere approach.  \n Importantly, as we navigated the pandemic, we proactively took steps to optimize our cost structure while investing in new capabilities to support future growth. Looking forward, we see opportunities to drive greater efficiencies across enterprise-wide processes, to elevate our rigor and discipline, and to focus on metrics that are most important to achieving our operational and financial goals. By expanding our focus on operational excellence, we'll be able to invest more in creating great guest experiences while also improving profitability.  \n Now let's talk about our first quarter performance. For the quarter, comp store sales increased 65.9%. This outstanding performance was broad-based, with above plan performance across channels, categories and geographic markets. While we believe stimulus payments contributed to the quarter's strength, we also believe the relaxation of restrictions, increasing consumer confidence and a desire for newness are positively impacting consumer spending in the beauty category. Our differentiated model, combined with our efforts to create meaningful guest connections and experiences position us well to attract more guests and lead the category recovery.  \n Sales were strong across channels, with stores leading the way as consumers were increasingly comfortable with shopping in stores. As local restrictions lifted, we increased our operating hours and welcome brand partners back to stores. And as store traffic trends improved, we adjusted staffing levels to support the increased demand. While the hiring market remains challenging, we are pleased with our ability to hire and staff our stores.  \n E-commerce performance was also higher than expected. Strong traffic and higher average order value resulted in mid-teen growth on top of last year's 100% growth, with sales penetration in the mid-20s. This quarter, we continue to test ways to incentivize guests to use buy online, pickup in-store with new BOPIS-only promotions. Importantly, we drove above-trend BOPIS penetration while also continuing to drive growth through our store and ship-to-home channels.  \n For the quarter, BOPIS increased to about 16% of total e-commerce sales compared to about 4% in the first quarter last year and slightly above fourth quarter levels.  \n While we certainly expected brick-and-mortar would drive nice quarter nice comp growth in the quarter as we anniversaried store closures last year, the sales strength we're seeing in physical stores and in e-commerce continues to reinforce to us that e-commerce transactions are incremental and help drive greater overall member engagement and spend.  \n From a category perspective, we increased our market share across all major prestige beauty categories based on the NPD group's point-of-sale data for the quarter ending May 1, 2021. Additionally, we saw terrific strength across our mass categories and believe we are increasing our share within mass beauty as well. Newness in our strategic tent-pole events, 21 days of Beauty and Spring Haul, continue to resonate very well with guests. All major categories delivered robust double-digit comps as we anniversaried last year's store closures.  \n Compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, fragrance, bath, skincare and hair care all delivered robust double-digit comp growth. Now starting with one of our strategic growth categories. skincare delivered strong sales growth this quarter, driven by newness and great engagement in our tent-pole events. Guests continue to embrace skincare as a form of self-care and wellness with body care, sun protection and facial serums driving nice year-over-year growth. New brands, including Keys Soulcare, LOLI Beauty, and Urban Skin Pro as well as new products from Tula, Pacifica and [ Central Pay ] drove good guest engagement. And dermatologist-recommended brands, including CeraVe and La Roche-Posay, continued to see gains driven from interest and support on social media platforms.  \n Fragrance and bath was our strongest category again this quarter, demonstrating that consumers remain focused on self-care, even as they become more comfortable reentering public spaces. Newness in fragrance from Dolce & Gabbana, Versace and Carolina Herrera as well as continued strength in potty scrubs and moisturizers from brands like Truly, Tree Hut and Hempz drove exceptional category growth. Strong guest engagement with our monthly Fragrance Crush programs, Valentine's Day and Spring Haul also drove robust growth in the quarter.  \n We're seeing nice momentum in the hair care category as well, driven by newness, innovation and do-it-yourself beauty. The first quarter saw growth from new brands like Briogeo, Kristin Ess and Monday, as well as product launches from Redken, Curlsmith and Pattern. And our salon back bar takeovers helped drive growth for established brands like Living Proof, FEKKAI and Bumble and Bumble.  \n Reflecting ongoing DIY trends, hair color, color care and hair styling tools also contributed to the category's strong sales performance for this quarter. Compared to 2019, comp sales in the makeup category were negative, but we are encouraged by sequential improvement in the trends from Q4. Newness and innovation, combined with strong guest engagement during our tentpole events, delivered better-than-expected performance in this category. Subcategories that focus above the mass continue to perform well, including mascara, lashes and eyeliner. We're also beginning to see guests engage with categories like lip and face, driven by newness from brands like Benefit, Tarte and Morphe, as many begin to adjust to reduce COVID-19 restrictions and look to refresh their stash.  \n Newness from Nicks, e.l.f. and Kiss are driving strong growth in mass cosmetics, while newer prestige brands, including KBD, Vegan Beauty, HOURGLASS and Jaclyn Cosmetics are delivering growth and prestige. Although it remains difficult to predict the specific timing of a full recovery in makeup, we are seeing early signs that guests are engaging more with the category. Confidence is growing, restrictions are lifting, and many consumers are increasingly looking forward to a fresh start in a new post-COVID normal.  \n As travel and wearing occasions increase, the desire for something new is growing. At the same time, engagement with social media platforms like TikTok are bringing new life to the color cosmetic category, engaging younger audiences, driving trends and reinvigorating trial and usage. These drivers, combined with an expanded pipeline of newness expected in the second half of 2021, increase our optimism about the pace of recovery of the makeup category this year.  \n This quarter, we continued to enhance and expand our Conscious Beauty platform, an initiative intended to help guests discover brands and products that reflect their personal values. In Q1, we certified 27 additional brands, bringing the total number of brands in the program to 250. We refreshed our Conscious Beauty end cap in stores, adding new brands like Pure, First Aid Beauty and COOLA to the presentation. And celebrated Earth Day with a unique gift with purchase offer. We also launched our circular shopping pilot with reusable packaging pioneer loop in 10 of our brand partners.  \n Building on the success of this cross-category promote platform, earlier this month, we launched the Wellness Shop in a select number of stores and on ulta.com. With a focus on self-care for the mind, body and spirit, the Wellness Shop features a curated selection of products across 5 key segments to help our guests easily navigate their personal wellness journey. We built the assortment with hero brands like Love Wellness, megababe and Kitsch and also introduced new brands like BLUME, Goli and The Good Patch. From scalp care routines and bath and shower rituals to supplements and adaptogens to relaxation and sleep regimens, this new shop addresses a variety of wellness needs in a curated, easy-to-navigate presentation.  \n As the country's beauty retail leader, we have the power to shape how the world sees beauty and a responsibility to drive greater diversity, inclusivity and equity. In February, we announced tangible commitments to this effort and I am proud to share that we continue to make progress in support of our goals. This quarter, we debuted MUSE in multifaceted platform to celebrate, honor and amplify black voices in beauty and announced the partnership with CURLBOX, a subscription box service catering to [ curly ] and textured hair consumers, featuring some of our most coveted products and brands. We've launched 5 new black-owned brands, including BLK/OPL and Mented Cosmetics, Black Girl Sunscreen and Skincare, CAMILLE ROSE and Hair and Homebody, a wellness-focused bath and body brand. And we created new educational content for textured hair, which was deployed to our salon teams earlier this month.  \n Sales from our service businesses increased nearly 50% compared to 2020, but were still lower than 2019 levels, reflecting appointment constraints due to social distancing. We are excited to welcome walk-ins for salon and brow services in states where mandates allow it and hope to reengage skin services in select stores later this year. We continue to focus on strengthening our stylist teams and where we have high demand in capacity, we're hiring experienced stylists with existing books. As a result, we are seeing nice increases in our stylist sales productivity as compared to 2019.  \n Our mobile app, virtual try on and skin analysis tools continue to resonate with guests as easy and safe ways to discover and try new products. We continue to see good conversion and higher average order values from guests to engage in these experiences.  \n This quarter, our services and events team began leveraging these tools for one-on-one consultations and small group events. In April, we launched a modified in-store event strategy aligned with COVID protocols, utilizing our virtual tools and successfully executing 350 events with 17 prestige brand partners.  \n Turning now to our loyalty program. We increased our loyalty members by 1.7 million members in Q1, the largest increase we've seen in a single quarter. We ended the quarter with 32.3 million members above our initial expectations. While this level is about 2% lower than Q1 last year, it is 5% higher than Q4 and only slightly below our member level in the first quarter of 2019.  \n The recovery of our member base from Q4 was driven by strong reactivation back into Ulta Beauty stores as well as increased new member acquisition. Our store associates continue to deliver a compelling member experiencing, welcoming members back and converting new members at higher rates than in 2019. We are seeing strong retention across all tenures as we deepen engagement with members who continue to shop with us throughout the pandemic, manage at-risk members to prevent attrition and introduce Ulta Beauty to new or newly reactivated members. We continue to lean into our member data to target high-value audiences and apply predictive behavioral modeling while personalizing experiences with product recommendations, replenishment reminders and offers optimized for incremental response.  \n We're using engagement levers like the mobile app to communicate our holistic member experience and drive key moments like 21 Days of Beauty, where we featured personalized offer for every member to drive retention and increase sales per member. These efforts are helping us accelerate the recovery of our member base and give us confidence that we can get back to 2019 levels this year.  \n Before I turn the call over to Scott, I want to provide a quick comment on Ulta Beauty at Target. We continue to make progress across all of our work streams to bring this new experience to life for our guests and we're on track to open our first shops later this summer. We remain confident that this innovative partnership with the light guest and strengthen engagement with the Ulta Beauty brand. We have very strong support from our brand partners and are confident that our assortment, which is an exciting mix of large established favorites and vibrant, often exclusive emerging brands, with the light guest when we launch. I know there are many questions about the assortment and experience, but our focus now is on building guest anticipation and excitement for the launch. Stay tuned for more details closer to launch.  \n Now let me turn it over to Scott to provide more detail about our financial results. Scott? \nScott Settersten: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone.  \n Starting with the income statement. Q1 sales increased 65.2% as we anniversaried the temporary closure of all of our stores last year in response to COVID-19. We opened 28 new stores during the quarter, including our new Herald Square store in New York City and closed 2 stores. We also remodeled 3 stores and relocated 1 store.  \n Total company comp increased 65.9%, driven by an 8.8% growth in average ticket and a 52.5% increase in transactions. Compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, total sales increased 11.2% and comp store sales increased 7%. As Dave mentioned, we saw stronger-than-expected sales growth across channels, with brick-and-mortar and e-commerce contributing to the strong comp performance.  \n From a mix perspective, cosmetics was 45% of sales compared to 50% last year. Skin care increased 200 basis points to 19% of sales, the fragrance and bath category increased 400 basis points to 11% of sales, and hair care products and styling tools increased 90 basis points to 19% of sales. As a percent of sales, the services category was down 40 basis points to about 3%. Note, the nail category is now included in cosmetics, instead of Other and we have updated 2020 results to reflect this change.  \n Gross profit margin increased to 38.9% of sales compared to 25.9% last year. The increase was primarily due to significant leverage of fixed costs resulting from higher sales. In addition, gross margin benefited from higher merchandise margin, lower salon expenses and a more favorable channel mix.  \n While the higher sales delivered some benefit on merchandise margin, the improvement also reflects lower promotional activity in the quarter and ongoing benefits from our efficiencies for growth, or EFG, cost optimization program. Salon expenses were lower compared to last year, reflecting the elimination of the salon manager role. As a reminder, we will anniversary this change in Q4.  \n Comparing this year's performance to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, gross margin improved by 190 basis points. Higher merchandise margin, fixed cost leverage and lower salon expenses were partially offset by channel mix. As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased to 22.9% compared to 32.5% last year, reflecting strong expense leverage on higher sales. Compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, SG&A as a percent of sales was about 20 basis points favorable. As a percentage of sales, lower corporate overhead and store expenses were partially offset by higher advertising expense.  \n Operating margin was 15.8% of sales compared to negative 8.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 on a GAAP basis, and a negative 7% on an adjusted basis. Strong top line growth, especially in brick-and-mortar, combined with the impact of our cost optimization efforts, resulted in robust operating margin performance.  \n The tax rate increased to 24.5% compared to 23.6% last year, primarily due to a decrease in state tax credits. Diluted GAAP earnings per share was $4.10 compared to a diluted loss per share of $1.39 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $4.07 compared to a diluted loss per share of $1.13 a year ago.  \n Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total inventory increased 1% compared to last year, reflecting the impact of 26 additional stores as well as the opening of our Jacksonville fast fulfillment center, partially offset by lower inventory levels due to higher-than-expected sales. Capital expenditures were $34.6 million for the quarter, driven by our new store opening program, investments in IT systems and store remodels and relocations. The decrease in capital expenditures compared to the first quarter last year was primarily related to investments last year related to our planned Canadian expansion, which was suspended in the second half of fiscal 2020. Depreciation was $70.6 million compared to $76.6 million last year, primarily reflecting the impact of last year's store impairments in the 19 stores, which we permanently closed.  \n We ended the quarter with $947.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. In the first quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares at a cost of $392.3 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.1 billion remaining under our current $1.6 billion repurchase authorization. We continue to expect to repurchase approximately $850 million of shares in fiscal 2021, but as always, have the flexibility to modify the cadence of repurchases in response to market conditions.  \n Turning now to our updated outlook for 2021. We are encouraged by our first quarter results and the trends we've experienced so far in the second quarter, but we are still early in the year. While the presence of vaccines and new CDC guidance gives us optimism for the recovery, our visibility into the trajectory and sustainability of recent trends is limited and the second half of the year remains difficult to forecast. We now expect net sales for the year will be between $7.7 billion and $7.8 billion, with comp sales planned in the 23% to 25% range. We continue to expect comp results will vary significantly between the front half and the back half of the year as we lap store closures that occurred in the first half of 2020. But we now anticipate comp growth will be in the high 40s to low 50s for the first half of 2021 and then moderate to high single-digit growth for the second half.  \n We continue to expect to open approximately 40 net new stores in fiscal 2021 and to now remodel or relocate 19 stores. We now expect operating margin for the year will be approximately 11% of sales. We continue to expect the largest driver of operating margin expansion will come from gross margin, driven by leverage of fixed costs, less headwind from channel shift, improving merchandise margin and leverage of salon costs.  \n Based on higher top line growth, we now expect modest SG&A leverage for the year as compared to fiscal 2020. These assumptions result in an expectation for diluted earnings per share in the range of $11.50 to $11.95 per share, including the impact of approximately $850 million in share repurchases. We plan to spend between $225 million and $250 million in CapEx in fiscal 2021, including approximately $115 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $90 million for supply chain and IT and about $33 million for store maintenance and other.  \n As a reminder, our guidance for 2021 assumes a consistent federal tax rate and no material increases in the federal minimum wage and does not include assumptions for any impact related to a resurgence of COVID-19.  \n And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: So first, Mary, wish you all the best, and you're certainly going to be missed. \nMary Dillon: Thank you, Rupesh. \nRupesh Parikh: And then, I guess, for the team, just congrats on a really amazing quarter. So I guess the one question I have is, if you look at Q1, obviously, operating margins are now well above where they were in Q1 '19. Are there any new learnings that you can share in terms of maybe some new structural benefits you see in operating margins going forward just based on the performance we saw during the quarter? \nScott Settersten: Yes. So we're very proud, Rupesh, of the results that we were able to post in the first quarter and our teams did a great job collaborating with our brand partners to deliver a great experience to our guests and an outstanding financial performance. Part of what was driving some of that overperformance was obviously the very strong comp, right, in the sales generation versus what our initial expectations were. So nearly a 66% versus last year and about 7% versus fiscal 2019. \n So a lot of good things going into that. Besides the great tailwinds we saw from stimulus payments and optimism about the economy and the COVID vaccine rollout across the nation, there was also structural changes we made in our business model, right? So we've talked about these over the course of the last couple of calls. So there's some good things that we did, some great self-help things, but we also took advantage of a great sales environment. \n As we think about the 15.8 that we posted in the first quarter versus kind of the rest of the year and what our long-term expectations are, I would say that there was a bit of over-leverage maybe in the first quarter, right? So again, we didn't expect those sales levels obviously, as we get started in the year. And so the spending, we were unable to kind of match spending with the sales generation. So especially in the store environment, I mean, there were some longer lines at the checkout that maybe we would have preferred to see if we had that choice ahead of time. So as we're looking out to the rest -- the second half of the year, there's things around wages, store labor, some upward pressure in fuel and transportation costs. And then we're going to do some more advertising in the back half of the year than what we had initially planned to make sure we take advantage of the environment and make sure we really maximize market share gain opportunities in this environment. So longer term, very optimistic about operating margin expansion opportunities across the wide variety of elements in our business. \nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Altschwager with Baird. \nMark Altschwager: I was hoping you could speak a little bit more to the trend you're seeing in the recovery in stores, perhaps relative to 2019, I think comps up 7%, with some of the e-commerce growth you cited, if my math is right, I think it implies stores still down versus '19, but it sounds like traffic is recovering nicely. So just any insight there. Just bigger picture, how the Q1 results have really informed your thinking on the trajectory of the store productivity recovery through the remainder of the year? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes, Mark, yes, we are very encouraged by the performance of our store channel. In fact, our entire omnichannel experience, even as our e-comm performed above expectations, our stores strengthened. So it just reinforces for us, the importance and the power of our model and the connections that we've built. \n Yes. Yes. Stores did exceed our expectations, grew throughout the quarter. We saw -- as our guests became more comfortable in shopping in person, we certainly benefited from that and saw continued improvement throughout the quarter. Traffic was still down -- meaningfully down for the quarter, down in the 20% range. So the strength we saw in stores, we are pleased to see a lot of guests coming back in, but also strong -- saw strong ticket performance, which we think is driven by renewal reengagement in the category, trip consolidation, a lot of newness coming. But yes, so while we're encouraged by store, we know we still have opportunity ahead to get all of our guests back comfortable shopping in store, and we're continuing to see that trend. \n I will just say that the -- as I mentioned, the e-commerce business also exceeded our expectations, including strength in BOPIS, so it reinforces for us, not just any individual strength across either stores or e-commerce or any element, but the connected strength that we're seeing, which is a strong indicator to us that our members are getting back involved in all aspects of Ulta, and we're pleased with that and anticipate more to come. As we look out over the rest of this year, as it relates to store traffic, we would anticipate it getting -- continue to improve traffic, but there's still a lot of uncertainty about how the rest of the year will play out and exactly how that will translate into store behaviors, but we're encouraged by what we saw in Q1. \nMark Altschwager: That's really helpful. And maybe just as a quick follow-up to that, just the strength in BOPIS is nice to hear. Could you just maybe address e-commerce margins and how you're kind of closing the gap there relative to stores? I guess, maybe that would be for Scott. \nScott Settersten: Yes. So I guess I would start with overall versus last year, the channel shift is going to work to our advantage, right? So that's going to be a nice tailwind as we talk about gross margin specifically, but operating margins overall. So as you've heard us talk about before, Mark, many times, there's a lot of different levels we have at our disposal to help mitigate some of this -- the margin headwinds that come with that part of the business. So again, that's just part of how consumers are going to shop, and we're focused on making sure we deliver the best shopping experience regardless if it's in our stores or an online digital kind of environment. \n So BOPIS is one piece of that. We saw a nice increase this quarter. We're working on other ways we can motivate our guests to take advantage of that because that is a margin help for us on a rate basis. Again, we want to remind everyone that, as Dave mentioned during the prepared remarks, that our e-com business is largely an incremental piece. So it's driving a lot of incremental sales and the rate headwind we get from that is something we will take, all things considered, but we've got lots of ways to help improve that over the longer term. BOPIS is a piece of it, supply chain, getting closer to the guest is piece of it. And optimizing our promotional cadence overall is a big piece of it as well. So there's still a lot of ways for us to improve that as we look ahead. \nMark Altschwager: That's great. Congrats to the team on a strong start and best of luck. \nOperator: Our next question is from Oliver Chen with Cowen. \nOliver Chen: Great quarter and, Mary, we'll miss you a lot. Congrats on the next steps. The inventory position looks really, really tight in terms of it being somewhat low. Were sales left on the table? And what are your thoughts on inventory versus sales going forward in an environment where supply chains have been tougher and just making sure you're as well positioned as possible to realize the market share gains? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. Thanks for your question, Oliver. We feel good about our inventory position, but it's certainly true that we've been working hard to ensure that we maintain a strong level of in-stocks. We've been working very closely with all of our brand partners to respond to this increased demand. And fortunately, we're having good success with that. As we look forward over the year, we would anticipate inventory levels to be higher than 2020, but at a rate lower than our comp sales. \n So as far as leaving sales on the table, we feel like we were able to deliver and meet the demand. There are pockets of brands that had just extraordinary growth that we're working hard to maintain in-stock levels. But I'd say, overall, our guests were able to -- you'll find what they were looking for, and we felt like we met their expectations. And it's probably reflected in the strong basket size we saw both in-store and online. \n So a lot of work going on to ensure this. I know our brand partners are max -- really looking to maximize their production to meet this growing demand, and we feel confident we'll be able to meet our guest demand going forward. \nOliver Chen: And a follow-up, related question for Kecia or David. Supply chain priorities, just would love your take on the major priorities on the road map ahead as there are many initiatives you're working on? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. That's great. Kecia, do you want to give some highlights there? \nKecia Steelman: Yes. We're continuing to look for efficiencies within our supply chain and our network as we build out to support the -- not only the store business, but also the e-com business. So we'll have more to share here in the future, but we're continuing to look for efficiencies and the ways to get the products to our stores and to our consumers in the quickest, most efficient way possible. \nOperator: And our next question is from Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler. \nErinn Murphy: Mary, it's been an absolute pleasure working with you. And Dave and Kecia, congratulations. So my question is for Dave. On the cosmetics category, you mentioned it was still negative versus 2019. Could you just put a finer point on quantifying that? And then as you've kind of monitored the pace of reopening, has there been any key regional differences between markets like Florida or Texas that has been a little bit more outspoken in terms of the going out trend? And then what's implied in the guidance for cosmetics as you look at the back half of this year versus 2019 levels? \nDavid Kimbell: All right, Erinn, let me -- I'll tackle some of the your cosmetics questions and as both what we're seeing as it relates to the guidance. And I'll ask Kecia to kind of talk about our regional performance here. As far as makeup, as we said, well, and we're really pleased with the performance across all categories with strong growth versus 2020. We'll get extremely specific by category other than to say our makeup category was one major category where versus 2019, in total, we were still short of 2019 performance. \n Having said that, we're seeing lots of encouraging signs. Our mass business is particularly strong. We've always been -- we've been working on for many years, building a really differentiated mass assortment with many brands that are exclusive or in limited distribution with us. Those partners have been leading innovation and driving new ways to connect with our guests, and that strength has really showed up in Q4. \n We had strong positive growth on a number of our brands and brands across the assortment in our mass NICs, e.l.f., kiss, Morphe, Maybelline, really across the portfolio, really pleased with the business on that side of the business. Prestige makeup, was not quite as strong. We -- but again, encouraging signs. Newness is kicking in, and we see a lot more coming as we look into the balance of the year. The performance that we've had for a while, prepandemic on Prestige has been challenging, but so many of our brand partners have reacted with strong innovation -- strong product innovation, new marketing approaches, connection through social media. And as customers come back in, as our guests come back in, we're anticipating that part of our business really strengthening over the balance of the year. \n A couple of highlights where, again, newness, I talked about it in the script, but we're seeing some newness across different areas of the business. Anastasia and brows, Benefit with Mascara new entry -- expanded performance in our luxury segment with HOURGLASS, newer brands like KVD Vegan and Jaclyn cosmetics, performance from some of our strongest largest brands like Clinique and Tarte. So we're seeing some encouraging signs, not quite yet back to 2019 and some uncertainty, how that will play out for the rest of the year. \n As your question about performance and how makeup performance is reflected in our guidance, we'd say we're still watching it closely. We're not anticipating a massive turnaround, but we do see some encouraging signs. And if newness strengthened throughout the rest of the year, we'd anticipate it performing even better. So good signs in makeup, great signs happening in all categories outside of makeup, and so the balance of our portfolio feels really helpful -- healthy right now. Kecia, do you want to talk about some regional? \nKecia Steelman: Yes. Sure. We stayed really close to this as they were starting to list the mask mandates across the states. And we really didn't see the variances across the United States, like what we would have thought. It was strength across the whole U.S. in regards to traffic. And I think it was more related around the confidence of the vaccine, the vaccine rollout and people getting more confident with coming back out into the stores and also getting ready for the reemergence of getting the mask off in the near future. \n So there were no real regional variances that we saw across the U.S. There was strength in traffic really from coast to coast. \nErinn Murphy: That's great. And then just my quick follow-up. So 1.7 million gain in loyalty members this quarter. How did that break down between lapsed versus new consumers? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. We don't typically break that out that specifically. I'll just say we're really proud of our team in coming together to both reengage. I've talked in previous calls about the disruption in 2020 wasn't anything necessarily that they didn't like about Ulta. They just for all the obvious reasons, weren't engaged in 2020. And so the reengagement strategy across all aspects of our business, in particular, in our stores, really paid off with a lot of lapsed guests -- recently lapsed guest coming back in. But equally encouraged by the number of new members in this environment that we attracted. \n And what's exciting about that is there's a lot of disruption and a lot of potential new members that are maybe reevaluating their -- the way they engage in beauty, and we think our model is perfect for that. So strength across both, and we find it really a good sign and more to come throughout the rest of this year. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson. \nMichael Baker: Okay. Sort of following up on something that they talked about earlier. But if I have -- if I look at your guidance right here, you still have profits down, operating profit that is versus 2019. I think by about $50 million at the midpoint, yet you were up in the first quarter by $70 million. So that implies down somewhere in the $110 million, $125 million for the next 3 quarters. So what are the reasons that the operating profits would be down over the 3-year basis versus being up in the first quarter? \nScott Settersten: Yes. So there's a mix of things. Again, the elements that play here, whether you're comparing to last year 2020 or 2019, the drivers are largely the same. It's just the overall impact weight of those in any one particular period that you're looking at. \n So the primary reason is channel mix, right? When you're looking back to 2019, channel mix is a big influencer there. Again, we're doing a lot of things. Sales increase sales back into brick-and-mortar helps offset some of that headwind when you're looking to 2020. But back to 2019, that's a much larger part of our business. And as we've talked about before on a rate basis, it's definitely a pretty significant headwind for us. \n Again, a reminder, those are incremental sales. So it's helping the total dollar performance and profit performance, but it hurts us on a rate basis. The other thing is you still got COVID costs in there, right? In 2021, you had none in 2019. We still have social distancing. We mentioned salons were operating at 50% capacity. TBD when all that's going to be able to open up and when we'll be able to be in our full line of businesses as we want to be. There's things in our DCs where we still have the social distance. Again, you got to look beyond the headlines on a lot of these themes. And so we're operating at reduced capacities. We have to add weekend shifts to make sure we can get our pick bins filled and keep the product moving to support an accelerated brick-and-mortar bounce back as well as a continued strong e-commerce business here above what we expected this year. \n We also have wage pressure. Again, these are things most people are aware of, have seen in the headlines, whether it be just recruiting people to come back and fill open roles in our stores. Or pressure in the DC network. We see what others are doing out there to try to retain and find new employees. So again, we're not -- we have to compete with those people the same way everyone else has to do. And then lastly, I'd say a big piece is incentive compensation falling on the SG&A line. Again, when you think back to 2019 and our performance there, and what the outcome was for -- as far as incentive comp goes versus the performance, the expected performance now for 2021, that's a big headwind as well. So those are kind of the major elements, Mike. \nMichael Baker: Okay. That's helpful. And a lot of pressure there. But so as a follow-up, I think it's fair to say you got back to this 11%, or you will get back to this 11% quicker than you expected. But with all those pressures you just articulated, can we think about ever getting back to the 12% to 13% level that you ran out from, I think, like 2012 to 2019? Or do all those pressures make that not attainable? \nScott Settersten: Yes. So we're not providing any long-term guidance today. We'll save that for November at our planned Investor and Analyst Day. But obviously, the trends of the business are quite strong, right? First quarter, way exceeded our expectations. The early read on second quarter is it's going well. Again, you got to keep in mind what we're lapping, right? Last year, in the first quarter, we were on a decelerating trend and then all those stores closed. Second quarter, we're starting to open stores last year in a kind of a wave action, but there was still a lot of requirements and limited capacity, things we were dealing with. And so that's phenomena. That explains the comp guidance, 40 to 50 first half and much more moderated in the second half. So that's what's driving the lower operating margin expectations versus last year. \n Longer term, we feel like there's a lot of levers. Again, we've talked about this often with investors whether it be things around the e-commerce business with BOPIS and supply chain initiatives, our EFG work in the real estate area and other parts of our business and a lot of other -- Kecia mentioned a lot of efficiency work that's underway right now under the EFG umbrella gives us a lot of optimism for longer-term operating margin improvements. \nOperator: Our next question is from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets. \nAnthony Chukumba: Let me add my congratulations to Mary as well, though I'm sure I'll see you walking your daughters in the neighborhood. So glad... \nMary Dillon: That's right, Anthony, thank you. \nAnthony Chukumba: So my question, just a quick clarification. If I was looking at my notes from the last earnings call and  it said that you're going to -- you're planning to open those first Target shops and shops in the fall. And now you're saying late summer. So I just want to make sure I heard that correctly. And if so, just any reason that you were sort of moving up the rollout to the extent that you actually are moving up the rollout date? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. I'd say we're just getting a little more specific. We've been kind of talking in general terms previously and now a bit more specific in late summer. I'll say we're really excited about it. And I guess I'd ask Kecia to just give a quick update. Kecia, as I think was mentioned in the call, is leading our Target initiative, and we're very excited about the opportunity. Kecia, do you want to give where we are on that? \nKecia Steelman: Yes. Absolutely. What's been so exciting is that it's been highly collaborative with the Target team and we've got a cross-functional team that's hard at work to bring the Ulta Beauty at Target concept to life. We've crossed some critical milestones. We've built the joint project plan. Our fulfillment plans are all completed. Brand selections and store selections for this first wave are all done. We're finalizing our IT requirements, our training of our Target team members and the joint marketing strategies. But we're on track to deliver and launch this at the end of late summer, and we're really looking forward to this coming to life and having our guests see what this is all going to bring to play for Target and Ulta Beauty together. To the 90 million loyalty members of Target and 32 million of ours, I just think that the ecosystem that this is going to deliver for the world of beauty is going to be second to none. \nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call over to Dave Kimbell for closing remarks. \nDavid Kimbell: Great. Thank you all for joining us today. Fiscal 2021 is off to a great start, and I want to close by thanking the entire Ulta Beauty team for their collective efforts to support the business and to meaningfully engage with our guests at every touch point. Our team is the secret to our success, and I'm so grateful for their impact, particularly during these disrupted times. \n I also want to thank our brand partners for their continued support as we navigate the dynamic operating environment. We are encouraged by the momentum we're seeing in the business and excited about our opportunity as consumers gain confidence and engage in the new normal. While the sequence and sustainability of demand remains difficult to predict, our teams are prepared and actively engaged to capitalize on opportunities as they arise. We remain very excited about the opportunity for Ulta Beauty to continue leading the beauty category recovery and we look forward to speaking with all of you again in August when we report our second quarter results. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Kimbell",
            "content": "Thanks, Mary, for your kind words, confidence and support. We've worked together for a long time, and I'm grateful for the opportunity I've had to learn from you and to lead with you.  \n Under your leadership, Ulta Beauty has established a winning, engaging culture, become the largest U.S. beauty retailer, joined the Fortune 500 and tripled its market cap. And we have solidified the company as the preferred destination for beauty enthusiasts, created an inclusive, well-regarded workplace and become a recognized leader in the business and retail community. I want to thank you personally for your leadership and mentorship, and I look forward to your ongoing support and counsel as I transition into my new role.  \n Kecia, I'm thrilled to continue to work with you in your new role as Chief Operating Officer. We've worked closely for the last 7 years, and I look forward to leading with you and our experienced executive team in service of our associates, guests and shareholders.  \n I am excited and humbled to become the CEO of Ulta Beauty. Over the last several years, I've worked closely with Mary and the entire executive team to build our culture, strengthen our guest engagement, and develop our strategic plan, and I will work hard to ensure a seamless transition as we plan and execute the next chapter of our growth.  \n Over the last 60 days, I've spent time talking with and listening to our leaders and our associates across the enterprise. Most recently, Kecia and I visited our Greenwood distribution center and our new Jacksonville, Florida fast fulfillment center as well as a number of stores. And more than exceptional operations, we saw firsthand the commitment and passion our associates bring to serving our guests. Despite the challenges of maintaining COVID-related safety protocols, our DC teams continue to meet the growing demands across channels, and our store teams continue to create human connections and meaningful connections with our guests every day.  \n I continue to be proud of how our teams navigated the challenges of the last year with strength, grace and a commitment to our guests and to each other.  \n We are emerging from 2020 as a leader. We see this in our sales trends, market share gains, consumer sentiment, brand strength and most importantly, in our culture. I believe this is a testament to the choices we made throughout 2020 and also to the strength of our 31-year history as a vibrant company and successful category disruptor.  \n To build on this success, I am focused on 4 key areas as I transition into the CEO role: our culture, our members, omnichannel experiences and operational excellence. Ulta Beauty has built a guest- and associate-centric, values-based and high-performance culture. We value and encourage collaboration and enterprise thinking, and we respect and listen to our associates to continually improve as a company. These tenets are core to how we lead, how we engage with our guests and partners and how we make decisions. Our culture is a key part to our success and why I am committed to protecting and enhancing our culture as we move forward.  \n As we emerge from the challenges of the pandemic, consumers are creating new routines and habits, and we have the unique opportunity to build deeper connections and drive greater engagement with our members. Each of our more than 37,000 associates play a role in member engagement and retention. My vision is that, together, we can and will accelerate how we engage and delight our guests every day.  \n And not just in stores or online, but through a seamless omnichannel lens. Consumers are quickly evolving expectations for how physical and digital platforms work together to create holistic brand experiences. As we focus on longer-term growth for Ulta Beauty, we are thinking about how we can create emotional, immersive, human experiences across all touch points and how we can evolve our organization and the ways we work together to support a buy anywhere, fill anywhere approach.  \n Importantly, as we navigated the pandemic, we proactively took steps to optimize our cost structure while investing in new capabilities to support future growth. Looking forward, we see opportunities to drive greater efficiencies across enterprise-wide processes, to elevate our rigor and discipline, and to focus on metrics that are most important to achieving our operational and financial goals. By expanding our focus on operational excellence, we'll be able to invest more in creating great guest experiences while also improving profitability.  \n Now let's talk about our first quarter performance. For the quarter, comp store sales increased 65.9%. This outstanding performance was broad-based, with above plan performance across channels, categories and geographic markets. While we believe stimulus payments contributed to the quarter's strength, we also believe the relaxation of restrictions, increasing consumer confidence and a desire for newness are positively impacting consumer spending in the beauty category. Our differentiated model, combined with our efforts to create meaningful guest connections and experiences position us well to attract more guests and lead the category recovery.  \n Sales were strong across channels, with stores leading the way as consumers were increasingly comfortable with shopping in stores. As local restrictions lifted, we increased our operating hours and welcome brand partners back to stores. And as store traffic trends improved, we adjusted staffing levels to support the increased demand. While the hiring market remains challenging, we are pleased with our ability to hire and staff our stores.  \n E-commerce performance was also higher than expected. Strong traffic and higher average order value resulted in mid-teen growth on top of last year's 100% growth, with sales penetration in the mid-20s. This quarter, we continue to test ways to incentivize guests to use buy online, pickup in-store with new BOPIS-only promotions. Importantly, we drove above-trend BOPIS penetration while also continuing to drive growth through our store and ship-to-home channels.  \n For the quarter, BOPIS increased to about 16% of total e-commerce sales compared to about 4% in the first quarter last year and slightly above fourth quarter levels.  \n While we certainly expected brick-and-mortar would drive nice quarter nice comp growth in the quarter as we anniversaried store closures last year, the sales strength we're seeing in physical stores and in e-commerce continues to reinforce to us that e-commerce transactions are incremental and help drive greater overall member engagement and spend.  \n From a category perspective, we increased our market share across all major prestige beauty categories based on the NPD group's point-of-sale data for the quarter ending May 1, 2021. Additionally, we saw terrific strength across our mass categories and believe we are increasing our share within mass beauty as well. Newness in our strategic tent-pole events, 21 days of Beauty and Spring Haul, continue to resonate very well with guests. All major categories delivered robust double-digit comps as we anniversaried last year's store closures.  \n Compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, fragrance, bath, skincare and hair care all delivered robust double-digit comp growth. Now starting with one of our strategic growth categories. skincare delivered strong sales growth this quarter, driven by newness and great engagement in our tent-pole events. Guests continue to embrace skincare as a form of self-care and wellness with body care, sun protection and facial serums driving nice year-over-year growth. New brands, including Keys Soulcare, LOLI Beauty, and Urban Skin Pro as well as new products from Tula, Pacifica and [ Central Pay ] drove good guest engagement. And dermatologist-recommended brands, including CeraVe and La Roche-Posay, continued to see gains driven from interest and support on social media platforms.  \n Fragrance and bath was our strongest category again this quarter, demonstrating that consumers remain focused on self-care, even as they become more comfortable reentering public spaces. Newness in fragrance from Dolce & Gabbana, Versace and Carolina Herrera as well as continued strength in potty scrubs and moisturizers from brands like Truly, Tree Hut and Hempz drove exceptional category growth. Strong guest engagement with our monthly Fragrance Crush programs, Valentine's Day and Spring Haul also drove robust growth in the quarter.  \n We're seeing nice momentum in the hair care category as well, driven by newness, innovation and do-it-yourself beauty. The first quarter saw growth from new brands like Briogeo, Kristin Ess and Monday, as well as product launches from Redken, Curlsmith and Pattern. And our salon back bar takeovers helped drive growth for established brands like Living Proof, FEKKAI and Bumble and Bumble.  \n Reflecting ongoing DIY trends, hair color, color care and hair styling tools also contributed to the category's strong sales performance for this quarter. Compared to 2019, comp sales in the makeup category were negative, but we are encouraged by sequential improvement in the trends from Q4. Newness and innovation, combined with strong guest engagement during our tentpole events, delivered better-than-expected performance in this category. Subcategories that focus above the mass continue to perform well, including mascara, lashes and eyeliner. We're also beginning to see guests engage with categories like lip and face, driven by newness from brands like Benefit, Tarte and Morphe, as many begin to adjust to reduce COVID-19 restrictions and look to refresh their stash.  \n Newness from Nicks, e.l.f. and Kiss are driving strong growth in mass cosmetics, while newer prestige brands, including KBD, Vegan Beauty, HOURGLASS and Jaclyn Cosmetics are delivering growth and prestige. Although it remains difficult to predict the specific timing of a full recovery in makeup, we are seeing early signs that guests are engaging more with the category. Confidence is growing, restrictions are lifting, and many consumers are increasingly looking forward to a fresh start in a new post-COVID normal.  \n As travel and wearing occasions increase, the desire for something new is growing. At the same time, engagement with social media platforms like TikTok are bringing new life to the color cosmetic category, engaging younger audiences, driving trends and reinvigorating trial and usage. These drivers, combined with an expanded pipeline of newness expected in the second half of 2021, increase our optimism about the pace of recovery of the makeup category this year.  \n This quarter, we continued to enhance and expand our Conscious Beauty platform, an initiative intended to help guests discover brands and products that reflect their personal values. In Q1, we certified 27 additional brands, bringing the total number of brands in the program to 250. We refreshed our Conscious Beauty end cap in stores, adding new brands like Pure, First Aid Beauty and COOLA to the presentation. And celebrated Earth Day with a unique gift with purchase offer. We also launched our circular shopping pilot with reusable packaging pioneer loop in 10 of our brand partners.  \n Building on the success of this cross-category promote platform, earlier this month, we launched the Wellness Shop in a select number of stores and on ulta.com. With a focus on self-care for the mind, body and spirit, the Wellness Shop features a curated selection of products across 5 key segments to help our guests easily navigate their personal wellness journey. We built the assortment with hero brands like Love Wellness, megababe and Kitsch and also introduced new brands like BLUME, Goli and The Good Patch. From scalp care routines and bath and shower rituals to supplements and adaptogens to relaxation and sleep regimens, this new shop addresses a variety of wellness needs in a curated, easy-to-navigate presentation.  \n As the country's beauty retail leader, we have the power to shape how the world sees beauty and a responsibility to drive greater diversity, inclusivity and equity. In February, we announced tangible commitments to this effort and I am proud to share that we continue to make progress in support of our goals. This quarter, we debuted MUSE in multifaceted platform to celebrate, honor and amplify black voices in beauty and announced the partnership with CURLBOX, a subscription box service catering to [ curly ] and textured hair consumers, featuring some of our most coveted products and brands. We've launched 5 new black-owned brands, including BLK/OPL and Mented Cosmetics, Black Girl Sunscreen and Skincare, CAMILLE ROSE and Hair and Homebody, a wellness-focused bath and body brand. And we created new educational content for textured hair, which was deployed to our salon teams earlier this month.  \n Sales from our service businesses increased nearly 50% compared to 2020, but were still lower than 2019 levels, reflecting appointment constraints due to social distancing. We are excited to welcome walk-ins for salon and brow services in states where mandates allow it and hope to reengage skin services in select stores later this year. We continue to focus on strengthening our stylist teams and where we have high demand in capacity, we're hiring experienced stylists with existing books. As a result, we are seeing nice increases in our stylist sales productivity as compared to 2019.  \n Our mobile app, virtual try on and skin analysis tools continue to resonate with guests as easy and safe ways to discover and try new products. We continue to see good conversion and higher average order values from guests to engage in these experiences.  \n This quarter, our services and events team began leveraging these tools for one-on-one consultations and small group events. In April, we launched a modified in-store event strategy aligned with COVID protocols, utilizing our virtual tools and successfully executing 350 events with 17 prestige brand partners.  \n Turning now to our loyalty program. We increased our loyalty members by 1.7 million members in Q1, the largest increase we've seen in a single quarter. We ended the quarter with 32.3 million members above our initial expectations. While this level is about 2% lower than Q1 last year, it is 5% higher than Q4 and only slightly below our member level in the first quarter of 2019.  \n The recovery of our member base from Q4 was driven by strong reactivation back into Ulta Beauty stores as well as increased new member acquisition. Our store associates continue to deliver a compelling member experiencing, welcoming members back and converting new members at higher rates than in 2019. We are seeing strong retention across all tenures as we deepen engagement with members who continue to shop with us throughout the pandemic, manage at-risk members to prevent attrition and introduce Ulta Beauty to new or newly reactivated members. We continue to lean into our member data to target high-value audiences and apply predictive behavioral modeling while personalizing experiences with product recommendations, replenishment reminders and offers optimized for incremental response.  \n We're using engagement levers like the mobile app to communicate our holistic member experience and drive key moments like 21 Days of Beauty, where we featured personalized offer for every member to drive retention and increase sales per member. These efforts are helping us accelerate the recovery of our member base and give us confidence that we can get back to 2019 levels this year.  \n Before I turn the call over to Scott, I want to provide a quick comment on Ulta Beauty at Target. We continue to make progress across all of our work streams to bring this new experience to life for our guests and we're on track to open our first shops later this summer. We remain confident that this innovative partnership with the light guest and strengthen engagement with the Ulta Beauty brand. We have very strong support from our brand partners and are confident that our assortment, which is an exciting mix of large established favorites and vibrant, often exclusive emerging brands, with the light guest when we launch. I know there are many questions about the assortment and experience, but our focus now is on building guest anticipation and excitement for the launch. Stay tuned for more details closer to launch.  \n Now let me turn it over to Scott to provide more detail about our financial results. Scott? Yes, Mark, yes, we are very encouraged by the performance of our store channel. In fact, our entire omnichannel experience, even as our e-comm performed above expectations, our stores strengthened. So it just reinforces for us, the importance and the power of our model and the connections that we've built. \n Yes. Yes. Stores did exceed our expectations, grew throughout the quarter. We saw -- as our guests became more comfortable in shopping in person, we certainly benefited from that and saw continued improvement throughout the quarter. Traffic was still down -- meaningfully down for the quarter, down in the 20% range. So the strength we saw in stores, we are pleased to see a lot of guests coming back in, but also strong -- saw strong ticket performance, which we think is driven by renewal reengagement in the category, trip consolidation, a lot of newness coming. But yes, so while we're encouraged by store, we know we still have opportunity ahead to get all of our guests back comfortable shopping in store, and we're continuing to see that trend. \n I will just say that the -- as I mentioned, the e-commerce business also exceeded our expectations, including strength in BOPIS, so it reinforces for us, not just any individual strength across either stores or e-commerce or any element, but the connected strength that we're seeing, which is a strong indicator to us that our members are getting back involved in all aspects of Ulta, and we're pleased with that and anticipate more to come. As we look out over the rest of this year, as it relates to store traffic, we would anticipate it getting -- continue to improve traffic, but there's still a lot of uncertainty about how the rest of the year will play out and exactly how that will translate into store behaviors, but we're encouraged by what we saw in Q1. Yes. Thanks for your question, Oliver. We feel good about our inventory position, but it's certainly true that we've been working hard to ensure that we maintain a strong level of in-stocks. We've been working very closely with all of our brand partners to respond to this increased demand. And fortunately, we're having good success with that. As we look forward over the year, we would anticipate inventory levels to be higher than 2020, but at a rate lower than our comp sales. \n So as far as leaving sales on the table, we feel like we were able to deliver and meet the demand. There are pockets of brands that had just extraordinary growth that we're working hard to maintain in-stock levels. But I'd say, overall, our guests were able to -- you'll find what they were looking for, and we felt like we met their expectations. And it's probably reflected in the strong basket size we saw both in-store and online. \n So a lot of work going on to ensure this. I know our brand partners are max -- really looking to maximize their production to meet this growing demand, and we feel confident we'll be able to meet our guest demand going forward. Yes. That's great. Kecia, do you want to give some highlights there? All right, Erinn, let me -- I'll tackle some of the your cosmetics questions and as both what we're seeing as it relates to the guidance. And I'll ask Kecia to kind of talk about our regional performance here. As far as makeup, as we said, well, and we're really pleased with the performance across all categories with strong growth versus 2020. We'll get extremely specific by category other than to say our makeup category was one major category where versus 2019, in total, we were still short of 2019 performance. \n Having said that, we're seeing lots of encouraging signs. Our mass business is particularly strong. We've always been -- we've been working on for many years, building a really differentiated mass assortment with many brands that are exclusive or in limited distribution with us. Those partners have been leading innovation and driving new ways to connect with our guests, and that strength has really showed up in Q4. \n We had strong positive growth on a number of our brands and brands across the assortment in our mass NICs, e.l.f., kiss, Morphe, Maybelline, really across the portfolio, really pleased with the business on that side of the business. Prestige makeup, was not quite as strong. We -- but again, encouraging signs. Newness is kicking in, and we see a lot more coming as we look into the balance of the year. The performance that we've had for a while, prepandemic on Prestige has been challenging, but so many of our brand partners have reacted with strong innovation -- strong product innovation, new marketing approaches, connection through social media. And as customers come back in, as our guests come back in, we're anticipating that part of our business really strengthening over the balance of the year. \n A couple of highlights where, again, newness, I talked about it in the script, but we're seeing some newness across different areas of the business. Anastasia and brows, Benefit with Mascara new entry -- expanded performance in our luxury segment with HOURGLASS, newer brands like KVD Vegan and Jaclyn cosmetics, performance from some of our strongest largest brands like Clinique and Tarte. So we're seeing some encouraging signs, not quite yet back to 2019 and some uncertainty, how that will play out for the rest of the year. \n As your question about performance and how makeup performance is reflected in our guidance, we'd say we're still watching it closely. We're not anticipating a massive turnaround, but we do see some encouraging signs. And if newness strengthened throughout the rest of the year, we'd anticipate it performing even better. So good signs in makeup, great signs happening in all categories outside of makeup, and so the balance of our portfolio feels really helpful -- healthy right now. Kecia, do you want to talk about some regional? Yes. We don't typically break that out that specifically. I'll just say we're really proud of our team in coming together to both reengage. I've talked in previous calls about the disruption in 2020 wasn't anything necessarily that they didn't like about Ulta. They just for all the obvious reasons, weren't engaged in 2020. And so the reengagement strategy across all aspects of our business, in particular, in our stores, really paid off with a lot of lapsed guests -- recently lapsed guest coming back in. But equally encouraged by the number of new members in this environment that we attracted. \n And what's exciting about that is there's a lot of disruption and a lot of potential new members that are maybe reevaluating their -- the way they engage in beauty, and we think our model is perfect for that. So strength across both, and we find it really a good sign and more to come throughout the rest of this year. Yes. I'd say we're just getting a little more specific. We've been kind of talking in general terms previously and now a bit more specific in late summer. I'll say we're really excited about it. And I guess I'd ask Kecia to just give a quick update. Kecia, as I think was mentioned in the call, is leading our Target initiative, and we're very excited about the opportunity. Kecia, do you want to give where we are on that? Great. Thank you all for joining us today. Fiscal 2021 is off to a great start, and I want to close by thanking the entire Ulta Beauty team for their collective efforts to support the business and to meaningfully engage with our guests at every touch point. Our team is the secret to our success, and I'm so grateful for their impact, particularly during these disrupted times. \n I also want to thank our brand partners for their continued support as we navigate the dynamic operating environment. We are encouraged by the momentum we're seeing in the business and excited about our opportunity as consumers gain confidence and engage in the new normal. While the sequence and sustainability of demand remains difficult to predict, our teams are prepared and actively engaged to capitalize on opportunities as they arise. We remain very excited about the opportunity for Ulta Beauty to continue leading the beauty category recovery and we look forward to speaking with all of you again in August when we report our second quarter results. Thank you."

            "name": "Scott Settersten",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone.  \n Starting with the income statement. Q1 sales increased 65.2% as we anniversaried the temporary closure of all of our stores last year in response to COVID-19. We opened 28 new stores during the quarter, including our new Herald Square store in New York City and closed 2 stores. We also remodeled 3 stores and relocated 1 store.  \n Total company comp increased 65.9%, driven by an 8.8% growth in average ticket and a 52.5% increase in transactions. Compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, total sales increased 11.2% and comp store sales increased 7%. As Dave mentioned, we saw stronger-than-expected sales growth across channels, with brick-and-mortar and e-commerce contributing to the strong comp performance.  \n From a mix perspective, cosmetics was 45% of sales compared to 50% last year. Skin care increased 200 basis points to 19% of sales, the fragrance and bath category increased 400 basis points to 11% of sales, and hair care products and styling tools increased 90 basis points to 19% of sales. As a percent of sales, the services category was down 40 basis points to about 3%. Note, the nail category is now included in cosmetics, instead of Other and we have updated 2020 results to reflect this change.  \n Gross profit margin increased to 38.9% of sales compared to 25.9% last year. The increase was primarily due to significant leverage of fixed costs resulting from higher sales. In addition, gross margin benefited from higher merchandise margin, lower salon expenses and a more favorable channel mix.  \n While the higher sales delivered some benefit on merchandise margin, the improvement also reflects lower promotional activity in the quarter and ongoing benefits from our efficiencies for growth, or EFG, cost optimization program. Salon expenses were lower compared to last year, reflecting the elimination of the salon manager role. As a reminder, we will anniversary this change in Q4.  \n Comparing this year's performance to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, gross margin improved by 190 basis points. Higher merchandise margin, fixed cost leverage and lower salon expenses were partially offset by channel mix. As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased to 22.9% compared to 32.5% last year, reflecting strong expense leverage on higher sales. Compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, SG&A as a percent of sales was about 20 basis points favorable. As a percentage of sales, lower corporate overhead and store expenses were partially offset by higher advertising expense.  \n Operating margin was 15.8% of sales compared to negative 8.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 on a GAAP basis, and a negative 7% on an adjusted basis. Strong top line growth, especially in brick-and-mortar, combined with the impact of our cost optimization efforts, resulted in robust operating margin performance.  \n The tax rate increased to 24.5% compared to 23.6% last year, primarily due to a decrease in state tax credits. Diluted GAAP earnings per share was $4.10 compared to a diluted loss per share of $1.39 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $4.07 compared to a diluted loss per share of $1.13 a year ago.  \n Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total inventory increased 1% compared to last year, reflecting the impact of 26 additional stores as well as the opening of our Jacksonville fast fulfillment center, partially offset by lower inventory levels due to higher-than-expected sales. Capital expenditures were $34.6 million for the quarter, driven by our new store opening program, investments in IT systems and store remodels and relocations. The decrease in capital expenditures compared to the first quarter last year was primarily related to investments last year related to our planned Canadian expansion, which was suspended in the second half of fiscal 2020. Depreciation was $70.6 million compared to $76.6 million last year, primarily reflecting the impact of last year's store impairments in the 19 stores, which we permanently closed.  \n We ended the quarter with $947.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. In the first quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares at a cost of $392.3 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.1 billion remaining under our current $1.6 billion repurchase authorization. We continue to expect to repurchase approximately $850 million of shares in fiscal 2021, but as always, have the flexibility to modify the cadence of repurchases in response to market conditions.  \n Turning now to our updated outlook for 2021. We are encouraged by our first quarter results and the trends we've experienced so far in the second quarter, but we are still early in the year. While the presence of vaccines and new CDC guidance gives us optimism for the recovery, our visibility into the trajectory and sustainability of recent trends is limited and the second half of the year remains difficult to forecast. We now expect net sales for the year will be between $7.7 billion and $7.8 billion, with comp sales planned in the 23% to 25% range. We continue to expect comp results will vary significantly between the front half and the back half of the year as we lap store closures that occurred in the first half of 2020. But we now anticipate comp growth will be in the high 40s to low 50s for the first half of 2021 and then moderate to high single-digit growth for the second half.  \n We continue to expect to open approximately 40 net new stores in fiscal 2021 and to now remodel or relocate 19 stores. We now expect operating margin for the year will be approximately 11% of sales. We continue to expect the largest driver of operating margin expansion will come from gross margin, driven by leverage of fixed costs, less headwind from channel shift, improving merchandise margin and leverage of salon costs.  \n Based on higher top line growth, we now expect modest SG&A leverage for the year as compared to fiscal 2020. These assumptions result in an expectation for diluted earnings per share in the range of $11.50 to $11.95 per share, including the impact of approximately $850 million in share repurchases. We plan to spend between $225 million and $250 million in CapEx in fiscal 2021, including approximately $115 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $90 million for supply chain and IT and about $33 million for store maintenance and other.  \n As a reminder, our guidance for 2021 assumes a consistent federal tax rate and no material increases in the federal minimum wage and does not include assumptions for any impact related to a resurgence of COVID-19.  \n And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. Yes. So we're very proud, Rupesh, of the results that we were able to post in the first quarter and our teams did a great job collaborating with our brand partners to deliver a great experience to our guests and an outstanding financial performance. Part of what was driving some of that overperformance was obviously the very strong comp, right, in the sales generation versus what our initial expectations were. So nearly a 66% versus last year and about 7% versus fiscal 2019. \n So a lot of good things going into that. Besides the great tailwinds we saw from stimulus payments and optimism about the economy and the COVID vaccine rollout across the nation, there was also structural changes we made in our business model, right? So we've talked about these over the course of the last couple of calls. So there's some good things that we did, some great self-help things, but we also took advantage of a great sales environment. \n As we think about the 15.8 that we posted in the first quarter versus kind of the rest of the year and what our long-term expectations are, I would say that there was a bit of over-leverage maybe in the first quarter, right? So again, we didn't expect those sales levels obviously, as we get started in the year. And so the spending, we were unable to kind of match spending with the sales generation. So especially in the store environment, I mean, there were some longer lines at the checkout that maybe we would have preferred to see if we had that choice ahead of time. So as we're looking out to the rest -- the second half of the year, there's things around wages, store labor, some upward pressure in fuel and transportation costs. And then we're going to do some more advertising in the back half of the year than what we had initially planned to make sure we take advantage of the environment and make sure we really maximize market share gain opportunities in this environment. So longer term, very optimistic about operating margin expansion opportunities across the wide variety of elements in our business. Yes. So I guess I would start with overall versus last year, the channel shift is going to work to our advantage, right? So that's going to be a nice tailwind as we talk about gross margin specifically, but operating margins overall. So as you've heard us talk about before, Mark, many times, there's a lot of different levels we have at our disposal to help mitigate some of this -- the margin headwinds that come with that part of the business. So again, that's just part of how consumers are going to shop, and we're focused on making sure we deliver the best shopping experience regardless if it's in our stores or an online digital kind of environment. \n So BOPIS is one piece of that. We saw a nice increase this quarter. We're working on other ways we can motivate our guests to take advantage of that because that is a margin help for us on a rate basis. Again, we want to remind everyone that, as Dave mentioned during the prepared remarks, that our e-com business is largely an incremental piece. So it's driving a lot of incremental sales and the rate headwind we get from that is something we will take, all things considered, but we've got lots of ways to help improve that over the longer term. BOPIS is a piece of it, supply chain, getting closer to the guest is piece of it. And optimizing our promotional cadence overall is a big piece of it as well. So there's still a lot of ways for us to improve that as we look ahead. Yes. So there's a mix of things. Again, the elements that play here, whether you're comparing to last year 2020 or 2019, the drivers are largely the same. It's just the overall impact weight of those in any one particular period that you're looking at. \n So the primary reason is channel mix, right? When you're looking back to 2019, channel mix is a big influencer there. Again, we're doing a lot of things. Sales increase sales back into brick-and-mortar helps offset some of that headwind when you're looking to 2020. But back to 2019, that's a much larger part of our business. And as we've talked about before on a rate basis, it's definitely a pretty significant headwind for us. \n Again, a reminder, those are incremental sales. So it's helping the total dollar performance and profit performance, but it hurts us on a rate basis. The other thing is you still got COVID costs in there, right? In 2021, you had none in 2019. We still have social distancing. We mentioned salons were operating at 50% capacity. TBD when all that's going to be able to open up and when we'll be able to be in our full line of businesses as we want to be. There's things in our DCs where we still have the social distance. Again, you got to look beyond the headlines on a lot of these themes. And so we're operating at reduced capacities. We have to add weekend shifts to make sure we can get our pick bins filled and keep the product moving to support an accelerated brick-and-mortar bounce back as well as a continued strong e-commerce business here above what we expected this year. \n We also have wage pressure. Again, these are things most people are aware of, have seen in the headlines, whether it be just recruiting people to come back and fill open roles in our stores. Or pressure in the DC network. We see what others are doing out there to try to retain and find new employees. So again, we're not -- we have to compete with those people the same way everyone else has to do. And then lastly, I'd say a big piece is incentive compensation falling on the SG&A line. Again, when you think back to 2019 and our performance there, and what the outcome was for -- as far as incentive comp goes versus the performance, the expected performance now for 2021, that's a big headwind as well. So those are kind of the major elements, Mike. Yes. So we're not providing any long-term guidance today. We'll save that for November at our planned Investor and Analyst Day. But obviously, the trends of the business are quite strong, right? First quarter, way exceeded our expectations. The early read on second quarter is it's going well. Again, you got to keep in mind what we're lapping, right? Last year, in the first quarter, we were on a decelerating trend and then all those stores closed. Second quarter, we're starting to open stores last year in a kind of a wave action, but there was still a lot of requirements and limited capacity, things we were dealing with. And so that's phenomena. That explains the comp guidance, 40 to 50 first half and much more moderated in the second half. So that's what's driving the lower operating margin expectations versus last year. \n Longer term, we feel like there's a lot of levers. Again, we've talked about this often with investors whether it be things around the e-commerce business with BOPIS and supply chain initiatives, our EFG work in the real estate area and other parts of our business and a lot of other -- Kecia mentioned a lot of efficiency work that's underway right now under the EFG umbrella gives us a lot of optimism for longer-term operating margin improvements."

            "name": "Mary Dillon",
            "content": "Thank you, Kylie, and good afternoon, everyone.  \n This afternoon, we reported record first quarter financial performance, with sales and earnings exceeding both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 levels. For the first quarter, net sales increased 65.2% to $1.9 billion. Operating margin was 15.8% of sales, and GAAP diluted EPS was $4.10 per share. Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter was $4.07 per share.  \n Fiscal 2021 is off to a fantastic start at Ulta Beauty, and I want to thank all our associates for their continued efforts to deliver great experiences and support our business in an environment that continues to be very dynamic. Now as you know, this will be the final time I speak with all of you as CEO as I will transition to Executive Chair of Ulta Beauty next week after our Annual Shareholder Meeting. I cannot express how much of an honor serving as the CEO of Ulta Beauty has been for me. I'm proud of what we've accomplished over the last 8 years and the amazing team and culture that we've built.  \n I want to thank my leadership team for their collaboration, agility and commitment to our associates and guests. And I want to thank all of you in the investor community for your interest and support. I am really excited about Ulta Beauty's future, and I'm confident this will be a seamless leadership transition.  \n Dave's passion for Ulta Beauty and our associates is unmatched. And he knows the beauty category, our business and our guests very well. In fact, his role as a Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Merchandising Officer and President have given him a much better understanding of the category, demand creation and the needs of our guests than I had when I assumed the CEO role 8 years ago. I know his knowledge and commitment will position him well to lead Ulta Beauty through its next chapter of growth.  \n And although many of you have met her, I want to take a moment to introduce Kecia Steelman, who is joining the call today and will become our Chief Operating Officer. Kecia has done an outstanding job as our Store Operations Leader for the past 7-plus years, and I'm excited that she will expand her scope to include supply chain, Ulta Beauty at Target and enterprise level continuous improvement efforts. As you get to know her in this new role, I know you'll be impressed by her knowledge, leadership style and passion for our business, associates and guests.  \n Although this change is somewhat bittersweet for me personally, I'm excited about my new role as Executive Chair. I look forward to supporting Dave, Kecia and the rest of the Ulta Beauty leadership team as they build on what we've accomplished together and continue to lead and disrupt the beauty category for many years to come.  \n Now I'll turn the call over to Dave to share more detail about the first quarter's results. Thank you, Rupesh. That's right, Anthony, thank you."

            "content": "Yes. We're continuing to look for efficiencies within our supply chain and our network as we build out to support the -- not only the store business, but also the e-com business. So we'll have more to share here in the future, but we're continuing to look for efficiencies and the ways to get the products to our stores and to our consumers in the quickest, most efficient way possible. Yes. Sure. We stayed really close to this as they were starting to list the mask mandates across the states. And we really didn't see the variances across the United States, like what we would have thought. It was strength across the whole U.S. in regards to traffic. And I think it was more related around the confidence of the vaccine, the vaccine rollout and people getting more confident with coming back out into the stores and also getting ready for the reemergence of getting the mask off in the near future. \n So there were no real regional variances that we saw across the U.S. There was strength in traffic really from coast to coast. Yes. Absolutely. What's been so exciting is that it's been highly collaborative with the Target team and we've got a cross-functional team that's hard at work to bring the Ulta Beauty at Target concept to life. We've crossed some critical milestones. We've built the joint project plan. Our fulfillment plans are all completed. Brand selections and store selections for this first wave are all done. We're finalizing our IT requirements, our training of our Target team members and the joint marketing strategies. But we're on track to deliver and launch this at the end of late summer, and we're really looking forward to this coming to life and having our guests see what this is all going to bring to play for Target and Ulta Beauty together. To the 90 million loyalty members of Target and 32 million of ours, I just think that the ecosystem that this is going to deliver for the world of beauty is going to be second to none."

As always, the IR team will be available for any follow-up questions after the call.\n Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dave. Dave? \nDavid Kimbell: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. Our fourth quarter was a strong end to a record-setting year. For the first time in our 33-year history, our annual revenue surpassed $10 billion, and our annual net income exceeded $1 billion. In addition, we expanded our loyalty program to more than 40 million members. Achieving such meaningful milestones reflects healthy consumer engagement with the beauty category, the power of Ulta Beauty's highly differentiated model and the impact of our winning culture and outstanding teams.\n The Ulta Beauty team continues to execute with excellence and inspire me daily with their passion and leadership. I want to thank all of our associates for their commitment to delivering great guest experiences and for working together as one team to move our business forward. I am honored to lead such a great company of talented associates who bring our mission, vision and values to life for all of our stakeholders.\n Now to the results. Starting with the fourth quarter, net sales increased 18.2% to $3.2 billion. Operating profit increased to 13.9% of sales, and diluted EPS increased 23.5% to $6.68 per share. Sales of all major categories exceeded our expectations, and we saw solid sales momentum across both our store and digital channels.\n Additionally, we continued to see healthy growth in spend per member across all income demographics. This broad-based strength reflects successful execution of our key fourth quarter events, including holiday, Jumbo Love and Love Your Skin. Our holiday marketing plan, which included new television advertising, engaging storytelling and robust digital and social support, delivered strong guest engagement and drove significant increases in top-of-mind awareness. Our holiday gifting assortment, which was thoughtfully curated across every category and budget, resonated with guests, and our innovative and inclusive gift card program delivered strong double-digit growth across Ulta Beauty-owned and third-party channels.\n Turning to performance by category. All major categories delivered double-digit growth again this quarter, and we increased our market share in prestige beauty versus the fourth quarter last year based on data from the NPD Group.\n Skin care delivered the strongest growth this quarter with double-digit growth in both prestige and mass. Growth in the quarter was primarily driven by serums, moisturizers, acne treatments and holiday gift sets. Guests engaged with newness from brands like Drunk Elephant, The Ordinary and Hero cosmetics. While dermatology-based brands like La Roche-Posay and CeraVe also resonated strongly with guests. Our successful Love Your Skin event also contributed to the category's strong growth.  \n In addition to converting members to the skin care category with prestige skin care offers, we also introduced guests to our wellness assortment with new beauty steals from a variety of brands, including Truly, Love Wellness and Sugarbear.\n The fragrance and bath category delivered another quarter of double-digit growth on top of strong double-digit growth last year. Compelling newness from luxury brands like Burberry, YSL and Dior as well as exclusive newness from Billie Eilish and Ariana Grande including her latest fragrance, MOD, contributed to the positive growth. In addition, the category benefited from strong engagement with our exclusive holiday fragrance gift sets and monthly Fragrance Crush programs.  \n Growth of the makeup category accelerated from the third quarter with double-digit growth in both prestige and mass makeup. Top subcategories were base and lip driven by newness in foundation, concealers and lip balms and glosses. New brands like Fenty Beauty, r.e.m. beauty and recently launched Dior contributed to growth during the quarter, while new products from a wide range of brands, including Tarte, e.l.f., NYX and Clinique also continued to engage guests.\n Finally, hair care delivered double-digit growth driven by newness and innovation focused on hair health. Newer brands like OLAPLEX, MA\u00cbLYS and recently launched Donna's Recipe contributed to the quarter's growth. Our Jumbo Love event drove healthy growth for key professional brands like Pureology, Redken and Biolage as well as masstige brands, KRISTIN ESS and Batiste.\n Hair tools continued to experience broad softness as we lapped strong newness last year. Our services business also delivered strong double-digit growth again this quarter, driven by an increase in transactions. Leveraging our CRM capabilities, we continue to welcome new members to services while increasing frequency with members who already engaged in our service offering. And the salon back bar takeovers which give our stylists a unique opportunity to introduce new brands and products to guests, help drive growth and new member acquisition for OUAI and Bumble and bumble.\n Now turning to the full year. Strong consumer demand and outstanding execution by our teams fueled broad-based strength across our business. Net sales for the year increased 18.3% to $10.2 billion. Operating profit increased to 16.1% of sales, and diluted EPS increased 33.5% to a record $24.01 per share.\n In 2021, we introduced a new strategic framework designed to guide our priorities and enable Ulta Beauty to expand our market leadership and drive profitable growth. Let me share a few highlights of the progress we made against this framework in fiscal 2022.\n Our first strategic pillar is to drive growth through an expanded definition of All Things Beauty. And this year, we continued to enhance our offerings to engage and excite beauty enthusiasts. All major categories delivered double-digit comp growth, and we increased our market share in prestige beauty versus fiscal 2021 based on data from the NPD Group.\n We strengthened our assortment with the addition of leading brands in every major category, including Fenty Beauty, Dior, BYOMA and MA\u00cbLYS and expanded MAC and Chanel  Beaut\u00e9 into more doors. We also introduced guests to exciting emerging brands, including about-face, Divi, sk*p and Vacation through our Sparked platform.\n We enhanced conscious beauty at Ulta Beauty, ending the year with 300 brands certified in at least 1 conscious beauty pillar and made it easier for guests to identify brands and products that reflect their values in this important space. We added 12 black-owned and founded brands to our assortment and launched our Muse Accelerator program to help early-stage BIPOC brands prepare for retail readiness. And we expanded The Wellness Shop to an additional 330 stores and enhanced our online offering to include intimate wellness.\n Turning now to our second strategic pillar, All In Your World. We're focused on evolving guest experiences through a personalized connected omni-channel ecosystem. In fiscal 2022, we continued to enhance the guest experience across all our touch points. We expanded our physical footprint, opening 47 new stores and renovating or relocating 32 stores. We relaunched makeup services and introduced new salon services, including curl-specific treatments and extensions. These enhancements, combined with record-setting stylist productivity and increased transactions, resulted in strong double-digit growth for our services business.\n Reflecting our efforts to enhance our buy anywhere, fill anywhere capabilities, we expanded our same-day delivery offering to 6 new markets and delivered significant improvement in guest satisfaction with the BOPIS experience. Between BOPIS, same-day delivery and ship from store capabilities, 31% of our digital orders this year were fulfilled by stores, up from 28% last year.\n We also created new digital experiences through the phased refresh of our digital store and the expansion of virtual try-on capabilities, including GLAMlab Skin Advisor 2.0 and the hair style try-on.\n Finally, our successful partnership with Target continued to grow with the opening of 254 additional Ulta Beauty at Target shop-in-shop locations. We also created a dedicated field team to help unlock greater opportunity with the partnership, and through engaging store visits and communications, this team had a positive impact on staffing, training and loyalty.\n Moving to our third strategic pillar, expanding and deepening our engagement with guests by ensuring Ulta Beauty operates at the heart of the beauty community. During the year, we continued to drive guest love, loyalty and share of wallet, and our efforts created stronger, more emotional connections with our guests. Overall, unaided awareness grew significantly with meaningful gains among key audiences including Gen Z, Hispanic and Black beauty consumers.\n Importantly, we increased the number of active members in our loyalty program by more than 3 million members, ending fiscal 2022 with a record-breaking 40.2 million Ultamate Reward members, who shopped more frequently and spent more with us on average. And we launched our retail media network, UB Media, with a dedicated sales team and supported by new processes and tools.\n Our fourth strategic pillar is to drive operational excellence and optimization to enable us to capture additional market share on guest experience enhancements and deliver future profitable growth.  In fiscal 2022, we made progress on a number of initiatives that will enable us to scale more easily, including successfully executing Phase 1 of Project SOAR, our 3-year effort to upgrade our enterprise resource planning platform on time and on budget.\n In addition to successfully navigating inflationary pressures in wages and fuel, we initiated a multiyear supply chain optimization effort, breaking ground on our first market fulfillment center and beginning the planned retrofit of our Greenwood distribution center. Both facilities are on track to be fully operational in fiscal 2023.  \n Our winning culture is key to driving our success, so our fifth strategic pillar is focused on protecting and cultivating our world-class culture and talent. Our vision is to create a highly aligned, engaged workforce and an inclusive workplace that creates opportunities for our people and our business, and I am proud of the progress we made last year.\n With strong participation rates in our annual company-wide engagement survey, our overall engagement remains high and continued to exceed retail benchmarks. And our investments in our team and culture enabled us to promote more than 11,000 associates into new roles and improve associate retention across the enterprise.\n Finally, our sixth strategic pillar is to expand our environmental and social impact. As the largest U.S. beauty retailer, we can influence how the world sees beauty while driving positive impact. In fiscal 2022, we delivered on our DEI commitments by investing $50 million across our major areas of focus, including multicultural media to amplify underrepresented voices, dedicated support for BIPOC brands, and associate training to reinforce inclusivity and address unconscious bias.\n On the environmental side, we continue to reduce our energy usage through the expansion of our LED lighting retrofit program to an additional 100 stores and our Chambersburg DC as well as additional energy efficiency project in select stores. We also enhanced our ESG disclosures in our second ESG report and submitted emissions targets to The Science Based Target Initiative, a globally recognized organization that validates these targets.\n Fiscal 2022 was an outstanding year, and I am incredibly proud of our associates' dedication to delivering value for all stakeholders while building the foundation for the future. As we move into fiscal 2023, we remain optimistic about the strength and resiliency of the beauty category and the opportunities for Ulta Beauty. Over the last 2 years, the U.S. beauty category experienced unprecedented growth, reflecting various factors such as product innovation, expanding regimens, new social media platforms, return to work and resumed social activities, and the elevated connection between beauty and overall self-care.\n In addition to these consumer drivers, an elevated level of price increases also contributed to growth for the category. While some are unique to the post-pandemic recovery, we believe other factors will continue driving growth for the category. Importantly, consumer engagement with beauty is stronger than ever and is more connected with wellness. These factors give us confidence that the growth of the U.S. beauty category will remain healthy but moderate to the higher end of the category's historical annual growth rate of between 2% and 5%, barring a major economic event.\n Building on the progress made in fiscal 2022, we intend to continue executing against our strategic framework to further expand our market leadership, drive profitable growth and transform our business for the future in fiscal 2023. Starting with our consumer-centric strategic pillars, we will continue to innovate, evolve and expand All Things Beauty to excite and engage the beauty enthusiast. Today, Ulta Beauty is the preferred destination for mass and prestige beauty. To maintain this leadership and capture additional market share, we will continue to add relevant brands to our assortment across categories and price points.\n Additionally, building on customer insights and strong engagement with our current portfolio of luxury brands, we see luxury beauty as an emerging opportunity. In fiscal 2023, we will expand our luxury beauty offering with an engaging experience in select stores and an elevated presence on ulta.com. In addition to strengthening our core assortment, we will continue to expand, evolve and amplify our cross-category platforms, including Conscious Beauty, our BIPOC-founded brands, The Wellness Shop and Sparked, our emerging brands platform.\n As we meet beauty enthusiasts, wherever they are in their beauty journey, All In Your World, we will continue to invest in our omni-channel experiences. Our physical footprint is a strategic advantage, and we plan to open 25 to 30 net new stores and remodel or relocate 20 to 30 stores throughout the year. As we expand our physical footprint, we will also accelerate growth across digital platforms, supported by the completed transition of our digital store to a modern technology and architecture as well as the expansion of our buy anywhere, fill anywhere capabilities.\n Our partnership with Target will continue to expand as we support additional Ulta Beauty at Target shops, evolve the assortment and leverage our dedicated field team to deliver elevated guest experiences. This newest touch point is introducing new guests to Ulta Beauty, and we intend to leverage our customer insights and CRM capabilities to continue driving additional member acquisition and bounce back to Ulta Beauty.\n To operate at the heart of the beauty community, we will continue to create and nurture authentic meaningful connections with our guests to drive stronger relevance and brand consideration, especially with key constituents. We plan to expand the power of our loyalty program by enhancing our media mix to acquire new members and elevate the loyalty program throughout our digital shopping experience.\n We plan to leverage our analytics and data insights further to reactivate lapsed guests, increased retention and shift share of wallet. And we intend to leverage our digital and physical assets to drive greater omni-channel member penetration. Finally, we plan to accelerate UB Media to capture greater demand from our brand partners. Building on the foundation established in 2022, we will offer new opportunities on Ulta-owned properties and enhanced existing products with advanced reporting and optimized audience selection.\n Turning now to our operational excellence and optimization efforts. In fiscal 2023, we plan to implement the next phase of Project SOAR, transitioning key supply chain and merchandising processes to the new platform. We will continue our supply chain optimization efforts as we complete the retrofit of our Greenwood DC and the opening of our first market fulfillment center. In addition, we will begin the retrofit of our Dallas DC and construction of our second market fulfillment center here in Bolingbrook, Illinois. This new facility will replace our existing Romeoville facility and transition our experienced team to a new state-of-the-art facility. In addition to these transformation initiatives, we will leverage our established continuous improvement capabilities to drive additional cost efficiencies.\n Our success is enabled by our world-class culture. Values-based and anchored in caring for each other, the Ulta Beauty culture attracts and retains top talent who deliver great guest experiences across multiple channels every day. To protect and cultivate our culture and enable future business performance, we will invest purposefully in our associates and teams. This year, we plan to modernize our talent strategy and planning practices, enrich our learning and development offerings, and enable a leading DEI ecosystem.\n Finally, in 2023, we will stay focused on our environmental and social impact. Being good stewards of resources, taking care of each other and creating a positive impact on the world is part of our DNA, and our ESG priorities are integrated into our guest-facing, operational excellence and culture strategies.\n Building on progress made to date, we expect The Science Based Targets Initiative to take action on our submission in the first quarter, and based on their feedback, we plan to develop a road map to achieve our emission reduction targets. We also plan to launch packaging, recycling and reusable bag pilots as we explore ways to support a more sustainable beauty industry. We will continue working to expand our DEI efforts to amplify underrepresented voices, support Black entrepreneurs in the business industry, ensure inclusivity remains a top priority in every guest engagement, and foster an inclusive bias-free and equitable workplace for all associates.\n And we will continue to strengthen our corporate governance practices. Over the last several years, our Board has updated our governance guidelines to better express our commitment to diversity, implemented an age limit for directors to encourage Board refreshment and updated committee charters to address oversight of ESG risks. This year, our Board will propose, for stockholder approval, changes to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, which, among other things, will declassify the Board and provide for the annual election of each director for 1-year terms.\n If approved, the Board will be fully declassified by our 2025 annual stockholder meeting. These proactive measures reflect our commitment to operating with best-in-class governance practices. More detail about these proposed changes will be provided in our 2023 proxy statements.\n In closing, the Ulta Beauty team delivered an outstanding performance in fiscal 2022, on top of a very strong performance in fiscal '21. As we look to 2023, I am optimistic about our opportunities to expand our market leadership and drive profitable growth. We are leaders in a culturally relevant growing category with a strong proven business model and a winning culture with outstanding associates who are passionate about caring for our guests and each other.\n I remain confident we will continue to lead the category and move beauty forward in ways that have a positive impact on our guests, our associates and the communities we serve.\n And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? \nScott Settersten: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our financial results, I want to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to our teams for delivering these exceptional results for our shareholders. We have long known our associates are our competitive advantage, and this year's results are an ongoing reflection of their relentless commitment to our guests and to executing with excellence.\n Now to our fourth quarter results beginning with the income statement. Results for the quarter were well ahead of our expectations, primarily driven by strong holiday sales and robust guest demand, which accelerated post holiday.\n Sales growth across both physical and digital channels were stronger than expected, resulting in less gross margin deleverage than planned and greater SG&A leverage. As a result, operating margin increased to 13.9% for the quarter. Net sales for the quarter increased 18.2%, driven by 15.6% growth in comp sales and strong new store performance.\n In addition, other revenue increased $18 million, primarily due to credit card income growth and an increase in royalty income from our partnership with Target. The growth in comp sales was primarily a result of a 13.6% increase in transactions driven by double-digit growth in store traffic. Average ticket increased 1.8% driven by higher average selling price, which more than offset lower units per transaction. Similar to last quarter, we estimate that product price increases contributed about 500 basis points to the overall comp increase. \n Looking at the cadence of sales through the quarter, sales moderated in November from the third quarter trend as we lapped more challenging comparisons, but well-executed holiday plans drove strong results and momentum that accelerated in January. Post-holiday results benefited from robust guest traffic in stores and the lapping of weather and impacts from COVID-19 variants during the same period last year. During the quarter, we opened 12 new stores, relocated 1 and remodeled 12 stores.\n For the quarter, gross margin was flat compared to the same period last year at 37.6%. Leverage of fixed costs, favorable channel mix shifts and strong growth in other revenue were offset by higher inventory shrink. The impact of promotional activity was flat compared to last year.\n Consistent with trends we experienced in the first 3 quarters of the year, in the fourth quarter, robust top line growth delivered significant fixed cost leverage. Channel mix was favorable as the penetration of e-commerce sales was about 270 basis points lower than last year, and solid growth in other revenue was primarily driven by increased credit card income and royalties earned through our Target partnership.\n SG&A increased 17% to $763 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased 20 basis points to 23.6% compared to 23.8% last year, primarily due to leverage in marketing expenses and incentive compensation due to higher sales, partially offset by deleverage of store payroll and benefits and corporate overhead.\n Marketing expenses during the quarter were lower as a percentage of sales compared to the same period last year. As we have discussed on previous calls, this year, we offset the incremental marketing expense of digital campaigns we manage for our brand partners with vendor income that is a direct reimbursement for these specific costs within total marketing expense. We will begin to cycle this change in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.\n Incentive compensation drove 50 basis points of leverage in the quarter, primarily driven by higher sales and a shift in the timing of bonus accruals for store associates. Offsetting these benefits, corporate overhead expense was higher than the same period last year, primarily reflecting investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR and other IT capabilities, UB Media and Ulta Beauty at Target.\n Store payroll and benefits spend in the quarter was higher than last year driven by an increase in the number of store associates and higher average wage rates. Operating margin was 13.9% compared to 13.8% last year. Healthy top line growth driven primarily by stores combined with the impact of our ongoing cost optimization efforts supported better operating margin performance.\n The company's tax rate increased to 24.6% compared to 22.9% in the fourth quarter last year. A higher effective tax rate is primarily due to less benefit from income tax accounting for share-based compensation and state tax credits.\n Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 23.5% to $6.68 compared to $5.41 last year.\n To recap the full year, net sales increased 18.3% to $10.2 billion. Comp sales increased 15.6% driven by a 10.8% increase in transactions and a 4.3% increase in average ticket. We estimate that product price increases contributed about 400 basis points to the overall comp increase for the year. Operating profit increased to 16.1% of sales primarily driven by strong revenue growth, and diluted EPS increased 33.5% to a record $24.01 per share.\n Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 7% to $1.6 billion compared to $1.5 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 47 new stores, the increase reflects inventory purchases to support new brand launches and brand expansions as well as the impact of inventory cost increases.\n Our well-established business model continues to generate significant cash from operations, including more than $1.4 billion in fiscal 2022. Our capital allocation philosophy remains consistent. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business to drive future growth followed by returning excess cash to our shareholders.\n In fiscal 2022, we invested $312 million in capital expenditures, including approximately $136 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $74 million for IT, $70 million for supply chain, and $32 million for store maintenance and other. Depreciation for the year was $241 million compared to $268 million last year primarily due to a shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense.\n During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 722,000 shares at a cost of $328 million, bringing total share repurchases to $900 million for the year. Since launching our stock buyback program in 2014, we purchased more than 16 million shares at a weighted average price of $293, effectively returning $4.8 billion to shareholders while continuing to invest in strategic growth drivers.\n Turning to our outlook for fiscal 2023. We ended fiscal 2022 with strong momentum and are confident the U.S. beauty category will remain healthy. Our financial expectations reflect this optimism but are risk adjusted to reflect an uncertain macro environment, increasing competitive pressures and the reality that we will lap 2 years of stronger-than-expected performance.\n Specifically for fiscal 2023, we plan to open between 25 and 30 net new stores and remodel or relocate 20 to 30 existing stores. As we shared on our last earnings call, we are seeing project delays resulting from external real estate and construction issues as well as supply chain disruption for key equipment. We continue to expect to open about 100 stores over the next 2 years, but the timing of openings are expected to shift between fiscal 2023 and 2024 as we navigate these external challenges.\n We expect net sales will increase 7% to 8% with comp sales growth between 4% and 5%. We anticipate comp growth in the first half will be in the upper single-digit range driven by stronger growth in the first quarter and then moderate to low single-digit growth in the second half of the year. We expect operating margin for the year will be between 14.7% and 15% of sales driven primarily by SG&A deleverage, reflecting investments to support our strategic priorities and higher store expenses as well as ongoing wage pressures.\n We expect gross margin will deleverage modestly as we lap benefits from the timing of retail price changes in 2022 and plan for a more normalized promotional environment in 2023. We expect to invest an incremental $60 million to $70 million to support our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, our digital store and other IT capabilities and UB Media. In fiscal 2022, we invested $52 million to support our strategic agenda.\n These assumptions result in guidance for diluted earnings per share in the range of $24.70 to $25.40 per share, including the impact of approximately $900 million in share repurchases. As a reminder, fiscal 2023 will be a 53-week year. We anticipate the additional week will add between $165 million to $175 million in sales and approximately $0.40 of earnings per share.\n Finally, we plan to spend between $400 million to $475 million in CapEx, including approximately $200 million to $220 million for supply chain and IT; $155 million to $205 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures; and $45 million to $50 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be between $245 million to $250 million.\n In closing, our business has recovered from the pandemic faster than initially expected. Our annual net sales this year exceeded $10 billion, which is 2 years earlier than planned and when combined with our ongoing efforts to optimize our model, has enabled record profitability. In fiscal 2022, operating margin was a record 16.1% of sales as compared to 12.1% in fiscal 2019 driven primarily by fixed cost leverage, higher merchandise margin and other revenue growth, partially offset by shrink and channel mix.\n While stronger revenue growth has resulted in a meaningful improvement compared to pre-pandemic levels, our efforts to optimize our model through this period of disruption are delivering sustainable benefits. As a result, we are updating our expectations for operating margins. We remain confident we can deliver comp sales growth between 3% to 5% but now believe we can maintain operating margins between 14% to 15% of sales over the next few years. We believe the outlook for the beauty category is bright, and we are confident our strategic framework and strong financial foundation will enable us to drive long-term growth and shareholder returns.\n And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: I think you mentioned there were 5 points of pricing that you got in the comp for Q4. How should we think about the role of higher prices in the 2023 comp guide? \nDavid Kimbell: Kate, yes, thanks for the question. Yes, we -- 500 basis points in Q4 similar to Q3. The pricing, what we anticipate for pricing going forward into 2023 is a more normalized level. 2022 is really unprecedented across the category. We believe that, that will return to kind of more steady state level of price increases going forward or at least into 2023.\n So that is included in our comp guidance and is, in part, driving the stronger first half versus second half. As Scott mentioned, high single digits in the first half, lower single digits in the second half. One contributor to that is lapping price increases. Many of them happened through the second quarter into the third quarter last year. So as we lap those, the comparables get a little tougher. So it's incorporated in our guidance, and we anticipate it being at a more moderate normalized rate going forward. \nOperator: Our next question is from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets. \nAnthony Chukumba: Congrats on an incredibly strong year. I was intrigued by your comments about, I guess, this luxury department is -- or expanding the luxury beauty offering in select stores and online. What exactly does that look like? Because when I think about Ulta, particularly where you are now versus where you were, let's say, 10 years ago, you have a ton of luxury brands. So if you can just help me sort of dimensionalize that. \nDavid Kimbell: Absolutely. Thanks for the question. We are excited about the luxury opportunity, and we have been participating in luxury for a while. We've had a long-term relationship with Chanel, among many other brands. But what's evolving and changing is an expanded presence of luxury in select stores and online. We recently launched Dior in makeup and skin care. We had the Dior fragrance business. So Dior is another along with Chanel, key anchors of our expanded luxury business.\n NATASHA DENONA, which is a beautiful and elevated color brand; HOURGLASS, Chanel N\u00b01, Lanc\u00f4me Absolue, we believe other luxury brands over time, now that complements a portfolio of luxury fragrance brands that we have, including YSL, TOM FORD, Gucci and others. And so the effort here is to make a stronger statement in luxury that further reinforces our All Things Beauty all in one place.\n The idea that you can shop across all price points, all categories and luxury, while we had a presence, we felt there was an opportunity to expand and solidify. And that's the actions we've been taking so far this year, and we're really encouraged by the results of the launch of several of these brands including Dior and excited about the opportunity ahead. \nOperator: Our next question is from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: So a couple of related questions about the business momentum. You talked about the acceleration in January. If you teased out the Omicron lap and weather, was there an underlying acceleration? You also lapped the launch of Fenty and OLAPLEX into the first quarter. How did that play out relative to your expectations? Did it sort of -- did the business slow in line with the lift that you saw last year? Or did it do better? And then last related question is, as you think about the high single-digit comp guide in the first quarter, are you essentially assuming that from today forward to the balance of the year the business comps in line with the annual guide? \nDavid Kimbell: Let's see. So a few things in that. First of all, yes, January was elevated, as Scott said there. And there were multiple factors. It's hard to nail down exact drivers, exact -- the exact elements of the contribution, but you mentioned a few, Omicron, lapping Omicron being one of those. And -- but we -- the underlying consumer engagement was strong as we emerged out of holiday. There's no doubt about that. The importance of the category, the elevated connection between beauty and wellness is showing up in January and gives us confidence as we go into the year.\n We are lapping some major launches, OLAPLEX in January. Fenty, actually, the launch happened in Q1 of last year, so that launch was not lapped in January but will be lapped here in the first quarter. And as we look into the year, again, the outlook that we have is 4% to 5% comp growth, stronger in the first half -- higher in the first half, a double digit -- I'm sorry, high single digits -- excuse me, high single digit in the first half of the year, lower single digit in the second half of the year leading to the 4% to 5% comp guidance for the full year. The drivers, again, of that are import pricing, some continued momentum coming out of the strength we saw in January and other factors that lead to a bit stronger in the first half of the year. \nOperator: Our next question is from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Congratulations on the quarter and the year and the great start to the new year. David, I guess -- well, actually -- so I'll start with kind of a question about the model itself. So pre-COVID, sales per gross square foot was kind of averaging in the $500 a square foot and at that time, sort of the potential margin at 15%. We're now kind of post COVID in that $800 a square foot range. And it looks like these are new TAM bolt-on services, BIPOC, Conscious Beauty. It doesn't look skin care -- it doesn't seem like there's kind of a replacement or a shift going on. So I'm just wondering if you can kind of talk about the 15% sustainable margin and how we should think about sort of that on a longer-term basis after you get through the investment phase. \nScott Settersten: Yes, Adrienne. Maybe I'll just give that a slightly different spin. So again, as we said, we're confident that we can deliver now adjusted 14% to 15% operating margin on a 3% to 5% comp for the next few years. Again, we came -- at our Analyst Day back in late fall 2021, we were giving our point of view on the financial model through the end of 2024. So since then, a lot of things have changed. I think less so on the sales drivers because there's a lot -- again, this category provides a lot of opportunities for us to drive the top line through various means.\n Really, the change is versus 2019, a lot are in the infrastructure, the cost infrastructure of the business overall. So you've probably heard us refer to some of this in the past. So we -- of course, we benefited here over the last couple of years from double-digit sales growth, driving a lot of fixed cost leverage across the business. There's also been a more rational promotional environment the last couple of years. And so -- and these elevated sales levels have also mitigated some of the other inflationary cost pressures that we are experiencing across the business.\n So as we look to 2023, we expect sales growth to moderate from where it's been the last couple of years. And so that will -- that's going to drive some deleverage. That's our year-over-year tougher comparisons. We've described that. I mean, as we think about, again, stronger and sustainable operating margins, we just feel like the business is in a much healthier position today than it was back in 2019.\n Again, we've described improved capabilities across the business, like ship from store and BOPIS helping to do that. Our ESG initiative that we started years ago now are continuing to drive significant benefits to the business overall. And we believe that, coupled with some of the new initiatives that we have along the lines of continuous improvement and some of the other long-term strategic investments we're making for the business, help give us comfort that we can hold on to those stronger margins with a 3% to 5% comp over the next few years. \nOperator: Our next question is from Kelly Crago with Citi. \nKelly Crago: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about category growth and break down how you're looking at growth by category in F '23. And then just talk about some of the opportunities you have in skin. I think at 17% of sales, you indexed lower than the beauty category overall. So just curious if you have any initiatives in place to expand. I think you talked about maybe eyeing some square footage in stores dedicated to skin care. So anything else from like a brand perspective? Any partnerships there? Would be helpful. \nDavid Kimbell: Great. Yes. Of course, our assortment is key to our success. One of the things that's really encouraging to us and again, gives us confidence moving forward is our performance has been broad-based. We're seeing double-digit growth across all major categories. And as we look forward into 2023, we see good healthy momentum in each of the categories. So we feel confident.\n And fundamentally, it's driven by a overarching beauty trend and understanding of the power and importance of beauty and how it connects to overall wellness and self-care. That elevated connection, the increased emotional connection and the importance that beauty plays is fueling the entire category. And that's what's helping drive each element in each individual subcategory within the total beauty space.\n So we feel clearly good about what 2022 looked like and have good optimism going forward. A lot of newness, a lot of activity across each of our major categories. We've got newness in makeup and in hair care and fragrance. We'll continue to drive innovation in things we're excited about.\n Skin care is -- as we mentioned in the script, was our fastest-growing category. We had double-digit growth in each category, but skin care led the way. And we feel like there's even more opportunity. We've launched new products like Drunk Elephant. We've had great growth with The Ordinary, Hero Cosmetics. We have in our newest store design that we started rolling out last year. We brought skin care together, and our other categories, makeup with skin care and a more prominent front-of-store location that allows our guests to engage across all price points in a really elevated, beautiful way.\n We're bringing new brands in. We just launched a partnership, an exclusive partnership with Beautycounter, which spans both color and skin care but has a very strong skin care presence. So we'll bring innovation across all parts of the business, and we see strong trends, most of which are rooted in wellness and overall health and self-care, which we think will drive each of the categories in a positive way going into 2023. \nOperator: Our next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: I hope you can hear me, and well done on 2022. Scott, I may have missed this, but I heard modest deleverage on gross margin. I don't know if you gave any framework for that. But if this math is right, down 50 or so, it means SG&A dollars would be up around 8%. And if those are roughly right numbers, can you get us the building blocks to why SG&A is up that much? And then obviously, if gross is down even less, then the dollars are greater. It just seems like a big amount. I'm curious what the building blocks are. \nScott Settersten: Sure, Simeon. So yes, we expect operating margin is going to be leveraged in fiscal 2023 compared to last year driven by slight deleverage in gross margin, but the primary lever is going to be SG&A. That's where most of the pressure will come from during the year. We expect gross margin, again, modest deleverage there as we lap benefits and the timing of retail price increases during 2022, and we plan for a more normalized promotional environment overall. Those headwinds will probably be offset by growth in other revenue and continued fixed cost leverage.\n So on the SG&A side, it really comes down to continuing our efforts with our strategic investments, our strategic initiatives across the business. So again, last year, we got out of the gates on most all of those things, Project SOAR being the largest by far but Digital Store of the Future, UB Media. There are a number of other digital investments across the business, so really getting into the thick of it, I guess, I would say, during 2023, so that's the primary driver of it.\n But there's also inflationary pressures in store expenses. And of course, we referenced the wage pressure as well, and most of that falls through to our field teams, which is recognized in our SG&A line. So that's it by far.\n I'd say overall, we feel good about where we are. We've got a good plan. We think it's balanced in all ways and takes recognition of both the opportunities we have but also the risks that we see in 2023. \nOperator: Our next question is from Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. \nJungwon Kim: This is Jonna on for Oliver. Just curious what you're seeing in terms of the promotional environment broader in the industry and you talked about normalizing promo levels. But what are your strategies as you think about 2023? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. We -- in the fourth quarter, we saw, we'd call it, rational promotional intensity. It was relatively flat to the previous year, still down versus 2019. And of course, as we -- I guess, we probably have said several times, Q4 is an elevated promotional quarter because of the role of holiday and the gifting and the competition that we have with all gifting, not just within beauty. So -- but nothing extraordinary in Q4.\n As we look into this fiscal year, we do see that continue to normalize. The step down of the improvements that we've made versus 2019 over the last couple of years will moderate somewhat. We won't continue the pace of improvement. We'll see a more normalized level of promotion, not back to previous pre-pandemic levels, but it is a competitive environment. There are added points of distribution, brands, bringing newness and innovation and competing. So we would anticipate, as I said, a somewhat normalized level of promotion but not in a rational level of promotion as we look going forward. \nOperator: Our next question is from Dana Telsey with the Telsey Group. \nDana Telsey: Making sure you can hear me okay. As you think about the levels of strength that are out there and obviously was incorporated into the results, how are you looking at that for 2023? And what are you baking in? And then just on pricing, where the expectation to go to a more normalized pricing cadence, what do you see in that more normalized pricing cadence of increases? And does it differ by category? \nKecia Steelman: Maybe I'll start, Dana. Like you're hearing from the broader retail industry, organized retail crime and shrink is a real issue out there, and we're not immune to what's happening. The concern is really twofold. Firstly, it's about safety and well-being of our associates and our guests. The news groups are coming in to the stores. It's really upsetting and can take an emotional toll on everyone that's involved. And secondly, as you mentioned, it's clearly a financial impact to our bottom line. \n We're continuing to invest in measures to not only deter but catch those who are conducting these activities. So the investments are around increasing our talent level, targeting our payroll in both our store and our loss prevention team, testing new technology, and then also installing new fixtures that can protect some of our key categories. Fragrance is the one we're really leaning into right now.\n What we're seeing is when we're investing in these locked cases in fragrance, we're seeing sales go up and shrink goes down. And our associates are very, very thankful for this because it's really deterring these bad actors from coming into our stores. We're going to be at 75% of the chain by the end of the year with these new fixtures. \n And then in regards to what the shrink impact is, it's about 70 basis points of headwinds that we had in 2022 to gross margin, and we're proactively taking these steps, as I mentioned before, to make sure that we understand these macro factors are going to continue to persist, but we're looking at only a modest benefit and shrink improvement in 2023. \nDavid Kimbell: And on the pricing side, we don't see any real differences by category. What we saw in 2022 was really broad-based across categories because the inflationary pressures for brands was -- really impacted all segments. So as we look forward, by normalize, we mean every year in beauty over time, there's a percentage of brands that go through just more standard price increases, and we anticipate kind of going back into that. And we think it will be across categories. \nOperator: Our next question would be from Mark Altschwager with Baird. \nMark Altschwager: So it sounds like things are going great with Target. Just any color you can provide on the incrementality of that new Target customer that may be returning to Ulta? And then separately, I know there's been some supply chain delays impacting your store openings, but just wondering if you could provide a broader update on how you view the store runway and perhaps how any of the learnings from the Target relationship are impacting the pace of openings over the next few years. \nKecia Steelman: I'll go ahead and start. And what I would say is that we've got 3 areas of really concentrated efforts in our partnership with the Ulta Beauty and Target partnership. First is about deepening the guest engagement. It's really focusing on new guest acquisition, increasing the spend of the existing linked Circle and Ulta Beauty reward members in engaging that lapsed member. When we see the Ulta Beauty at Target member coming in and engaging with Ulta Beauty itself, what we're seeing is we like what their spend patterns look like. They're at our average spend, if not, even higher. So we like what we're seeing from the ecosystem.\n In regards to new store growth, I mean, listen, we've got competition out there always on in regards to where we're opening up new stores. So we are looking at this as part of the ecosystem where we actually would even have, in some locations, Ulta Beauty at Target in the same center as an Ulta Beauty store. And what we're seeing is that's really -- it's performing very nicely that the customer is shopping in both.\n So while there's competition out there, it's not necessarily playing into what our new store opening guidelines looks like. Maybe you want to weigh in on the supply chain with supplies for new stores. \nScott Settersten: Yes. So for our new store outlook, our long-term outlook, still 1,500 to 1,700 stores with roughly 800 Ulta Beauty at Target locations on top of that. So again, we're still very comfortable from everything we've seen, the interaction between, as Kecia just described, between the shop in shops and what we're doing in our stand-alone stores, are happy with the overall performance.\n Again, this year, there's just a shift or just smart business, we think, not chasing a number with new store openings and trying to be wise about how we plan that to make sure we keep good disciplines on site selection and the cost ramifications because these are long-term investments. \nDavid Kimbell: All right. Great. Well, thank you all for your interest and engagement today. And I want to close by thanking all 53,000 Ulta Beauty associates for delivering just excellent financial results in 2022 while executing against our strategic priorities. I am excited about the future of Ulta Beauty and believe firmly in our differentiated business model, strategic framework and talented and committed teams will continue to drive success and create significant shareholder value.\n We look forward to speaking to all of you again when we report results for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 on May 25. Have a good evening and talk to you all soon. Thanks. \nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Kimbell",
            "content": "Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. Our fourth quarter was a strong end to a record-setting year. For the first time in our 33-year history, our annual revenue surpassed $10 billion, and our annual net income exceeded $1 billion. In addition, we expanded our loyalty program to more than 40 million members. Achieving such meaningful milestones reflects healthy consumer engagement with the beauty category, the power of Ulta Beauty's highly differentiated model and the impact of our winning culture and outstanding teams.\n The Ulta Beauty team continues to execute with excellence and inspire me daily with their passion and leadership. I want to thank all of our associates for their commitment to delivering great guest experiences and for working together as one team to move our business forward. I am honored to lead such a great company of talented associates who bring our mission, vision and values to life for all of our stakeholders.\n Now to the results. Starting with the fourth quarter, net sales increased 18.2% to $3.2 billion. Operating profit increased to 13.9% of sales, and diluted EPS increased 23.5% to $6.68 per share. Sales of all major categories exceeded our expectations, and we saw solid sales momentum across both our store and digital channels.\n Additionally, we continued to see healthy growth in spend per member across all income demographics. This broad-based strength reflects successful execution of our key fourth quarter events, including holiday, Jumbo Love and Love Your Skin. Our holiday marketing plan, which included new television advertising, engaging storytelling and robust digital and social support, delivered strong guest engagement and drove significant increases in top-of-mind awareness. Our holiday gifting assortment, which was thoughtfully curated across every category and budget, resonated with guests, and our innovative and inclusive gift card program delivered strong double-digit growth across Ulta Beauty-owned and third-party channels.\n Turning to performance by category. All major categories delivered double-digit growth again this quarter, and we increased our market share in prestige beauty versus the fourth quarter last year based on data from the NPD Group.\n Skin care delivered the strongest growth this quarter with double-digit growth in both prestige and mass. Growth in the quarter was primarily driven by serums, moisturizers, acne treatments and holiday gift sets. Guests engaged with newness from brands like Drunk Elephant, The Ordinary and Hero cosmetics. While dermatology-based brands like La Roche-Posay and CeraVe also resonated strongly with guests. Our successful Love Your Skin event also contributed to the category's strong growth.  \n In addition to converting members to the skin care category with prestige skin care offers, we also introduced guests to our wellness assortment with new beauty steals from a variety of brands, including Truly, Love Wellness and Sugarbear.\n The fragrance and bath category delivered another quarter of double-digit growth on top of strong double-digit growth last year. Compelling newness from luxury brands like Burberry, YSL and Dior as well as exclusive newness from Billie Eilish and Ariana Grande including her latest fragrance, MOD, contributed to the positive growth. In addition, the category benefited from strong engagement with our exclusive holiday fragrance gift sets and monthly Fragrance Crush programs.  \n Growth of the makeup category accelerated from the third quarter with double-digit growth in both prestige and mass makeup. Top subcategories were base and lip driven by newness in foundation, concealers and lip balms and glosses. New brands like Fenty Beauty, r.e.m. beauty and recently launched Dior contributed to growth during the quarter, while new products from a wide range of brands, including Tarte, e.l.f., NYX and Clinique also continued to engage guests.\n Finally, hair care delivered double-digit growth driven by newness and innovation focused on hair health. Newer brands like OLAPLEX, MAE\u0308LYS and recently launched Donna's Recipe contributed to the quarter's growth. Our Jumbo Love event drove healthy growth for key professional brands like Pureology, Redken and Biolage as well as masstige brands, KRISTIN ESS and Batiste.\n Hair tools continued to experience broad softness as we lapped strong newness last year. Our services business also delivered strong double-digit growth again this quarter, driven by an increase in transactions. Leveraging our CRM capabilities, we continue to welcome new members to services while increasing frequency with members who already engaged in our service offering. And the salon back bar takeovers which give our stylists a unique opportunity to introduce new brands and products to guests, help drive growth and new member acquisition for OUAI and Bumble and bumble.\n Now turning to the full year. Strong consumer demand and outstanding execution by our teams fueled broad-based strength across our business. Net sales for the year increased 18.3% to $10.2 billion. Operating profit increased to 16.1% of sales, and diluted EPS increased 33.5% to a record $24.01 per share.\n In 2021, we introduced a new strategic framework designed to guide our priorities and enable Ulta Beauty to expand our market leadership and drive profitable growth. Let me share a few highlights of the progress we made against this framework in fiscal 2022.\n Our first strategic pillar is to drive growth through an expanded definition of All Things Beauty. And this year, we continued to enhance our offerings to engage and excite beauty enthusiasts. All major categories delivered double-digit comp growth, and we increased our market share in prestige beauty versus fiscal 2021 based on data from the NPD Group.\n We strengthened our assortment with the addition of leading brands in every major category, including Fenty Beauty, Dior, BYOMA and MAE\u0308LYS and expanded MAC and Chanel  Beaute\u0301 into more doors. We also introduced guests to exciting emerging brands, including about-face, Divi, sk*p and Vacation through our Sparked platform.\n We enhanced conscious beauty at Ulta Beauty, ending the year with 300 brands certified in at least 1 conscious beauty pillar and made it easier for guests to identify brands and products that reflect their values in this important space. We added 12 black-owned and founded brands to our assortment and launched our Muse Accelerator program to help early-stage BIPOC brands prepare for retail readiness. And we expanded The Wellness Shop to an additional 330 stores and enhanced our online offering to include intimate wellness.\n Turning now to our second strategic pillar, All In Your World. We're focused on evolving guest experiences through a personalized connected omni-channel ecosystem. In fiscal 2022, we continued to enhance the guest experience across all our touch points. We expanded our physical footprint, opening 47 new stores and renovating or relocating 32 stores. We relaunched makeup services and introduced new salon services, including curl-specific treatments and extensions. These enhancements, combined with record-setting stylist productivity and increased transactions, resulted in strong double-digit growth for our services business.\n Reflecting our efforts to enhance our buy anywhere, fill anywhere capabilities, we expanded our same-day delivery offering to 6 new markets and delivered significant improvement in guest satisfaction with the BOPIS experience. Between BOPIS, same-day delivery and ship from store capabilities, 31% of our digital orders this year were fulfilled by stores, up from 28% last year.\n We also created new digital experiences through the phased refresh of our digital store and the expansion of virtual try-on capabilities, including GLAMlab Skin Advisor 2.0 and the hair style try-on.\n Finally, our successful partnership with Target continued to grow with the opening of 254 additional Ulta Beauty at Target shop-in-shop locations. We also created a dedicated field team to help unlock greater opportunity with the partnership, and through engaging store visits and communications, this team had a positive impact on staffing, training and loyalty.\n Moving to our third strategic pillar, expanding and deepening our engagement with guests by ensuring Ulta Beauty operates at the heart of the beauty community. During the year, we continued to drive guest love, loyalty and share of wallet, and our efforts created stronger, more emotional connections with our guests. Overall, unaided awareness grew significantly with meaningful gains among key audiences including Gen Z, Hispanic and Black beauty consumers.\n Importantly, we increased the number of active members in our loyalty program by more than 3 million members, ending fiscal 2022 with a record-breaking 40.2 million Ultamate Reward members, who shopped more frequently and spent more with us on average. And we launched our retail media network, UB Media, with a dedicated sales team and supported by new processes and tools.\n Our fourth strategic pillar is to drive operational excellence and optimization to enable us to capture additional market share on guest experience enhancements and deliver future profitable growth.  In fiscal 2022, we made progress on a number of initiatives that will enable us to scale more easily, including successfully executing Phase 1 of Project SOAR, our 3-year effort to upgrade our enterprise resource planning platform on time and on budget.\n In addition to successfully navigating inflationary pressures in wages and fuel, we initiated a multiyear supply chain optimization effort, breaking ground on our first market fulfillment center and beginning the planned retrofit of our Greenwood distribution center. Both facilities are on track to be fully operational in fiscal 2023.  \n Our winning culture is key to driving our success, so our fifth strategic pillar is focused on protecting and cultivating our world-class culture and talent. Our vision is to create a highly aligned, engaged workforce and an inclusive workplace that creates opportunities for our people and our business, and I am proud of the progress we made last year.\n With strong participation rates in our annual company-wide engagement survey, our overall engagement remains high and continued to exceed retail benchmarks. And our investments in our team and culture enabled us to promote more than 11,000 associates into new roles and improve associate retention across the enterprise.\n Finally, our sixth strategic pillar is to expand our environmental and social impact. As the largest U.S. beauty retailer, we can influence how the world sees beauty while driving positive impact. In fiscal 2022, we delivered on our DEI commitments by investing $50 million across our major areas of focus, including multicultural media to amplify underrepresented voices, dedicated support for BIPOC brands, and associate training to reinforce inclusivity and address unconscious bias.\n On the environmental side, we continue to reduce our energy usage through the expansion of our LED lighting retrofit program to an additional 100 stores and our Chambersburg DC as well as additional energy efficiency project in select stores. We also enhanced our ESG disclosures in our second ESG report and submitted emissions targets to The Science Based Target Initiative, a globally recognized organization that validates these targets.\n Fiscal 2022 was an outstanding year, and I am incredibly proud of our associates' dedication to delivering value for all stakeholders while building the foundation for the future. As we move into fiscal 2023, we remain optimistic about the strength and resiliency of the beauty category and the opportunities for Ulta Beauty. Over the last 2 years, the U.S. beauty category experienced unprecedented growth, reflecting various factors such as product innovation, expanding regimens, new social media platforms, return to work and resumed social activities, and the elevated connection between beauty and overall self-care.\n In addition to these consumer drivers, an elevated level of price increases also contributed to growth for the category. While some are unique to the post-pandemic recovery, we believe other factors will continue driving growth for the category. Importantly, consumer engagement with beauty is stronger than ever and is more connected with wellness. These factors give us confidence that the growth of the U.S. beauty category will remain healthy but moderate to the higher end of the category's historical annual growth rate of between 2% and 5%, barring a major economic event.\n Building on the progress made in fiscal 2022, we intend to continue executing against our strategic framework to further expand our market leadership, drive profitable growth and transform our business for the future in fiscal 2023. Starting with our consumer-centric strategic pillars, we will continue to innovate, evolve and expand All Things Beauty to excite and engage the beauty enthusiast. Today, Ulta Beauty is the preferred destination for mass and prestige beauty. To maintain this leadership and capture additional market share, we will continue to add relevant brands to our assortment across categories and price points.\n Additionally, building on customer insights and strong engagement with our current portfolio of luxury brands, we see luxury beauty as an emerging opportunity. In fiscal 2023, we will expand our luxury beauty offering with an engaging experience in select stores and an elevated presence on ulta.com. In addition to strengthening our core assortment, we will continue to expand, evolve and amplify our cross-category platforms, including Conscious Beauty, our BIPOC-founded brands, The Wellness Shop and Sparked, our emerging brands platform.\n As we meet beauty enthusiasts, wherever they are in their beauty journey, All In Your World, we will continue to invest in our omni-channel experiences. Our physical footprint is a strategic advantage, and we plan to open 25 to 30 net new stores and remodel or relocate 20 to 30 stores throughout the year. As we expand our physical footprint, we will also accelerate growth across digital platforms, supported by the completed transition of our digital store to a modern technology and architecture as well as the expansion of our buy anywhere, fill anywhere capabilities.\n Our partnership with Target will continue to expand as we support additional Ulta Beauty at Target shops, evolve the assortment and leverage our dedicated field team to deliver elevated guest experiences. This newest touch point is introducing new guests to Ulta Beauty, and we intend to leverage our customer insights and CRM capabilities to continue driving additional member acquisition and bounce back to Ulta Beauty.\n To operate at the heart of the beauty community, we will continue to create and nurture authentic meaningful connections with our guests to drive stronger relevance and brand consideration, especially with key constituents. We plan to expand the power of our loyalty program by enhancing our media mix to acquire new members and elevate the loyalty program throughout our digital shopping experience.\n We plan to leverage our analytics and data insights further to reactivate lapsed guests, increased retention and shift share of wallet. And we intend to leverage our digital and physical assets to drive greater omni-channel member penetration. Finally, we plan to accelerate UB Media to capture greater demand from our brand partners. Building on the foundation established in 2022, we will offer new opportunities on Ulta-owned properties and enhanced existing products with advanced reporting and optimized audience selection.\n Turning now to our operational excellence and optimization efforts. In fiscal 2023, we plan to implement the next phase of Project SOAR, transitioning key supply chain and merchandising processes to the new platform. We will continue our supply chain optimization efforts as we complete the retrofit of our Greenwood DC and the opening of our first market fulfillment center. In addition, we will begin the retrofit of our Dallas DC and construction of our second market fulfillment center here in Bolingbrook, Illinois. This new facility will replace our existing Romeoville facility and transition our experienced team to a new state-of-the-art facility. In addition to these transformation initiatives, we will leverage our established continuous improvement capabilities to drive additional cost efficiencies.\n Our success is enabled by our world-class culture. Values-based and anchored in caring for each other, the Ulta Beauty culture attracts and retains top talent who deliver great guest experiences across multiple channels every day. To protect and cultivate our culture and enable future business performance, we will invest purposefully in our associates and teams. This year, we plan to modernize our talent strategy and planning practices, enrich our learning and development offerings, and enable a leading DEI ecosystem.\n Finally, in 2023, we will stay focused on our environmental and social impact. Being good stewards of resources, taking care of each other and creating a positive impact on the world is part of our DNA, and our ESG priorities are integrated into our guest-facing, operational excellence and culture strategies.\n Building on progress made to date, we expect The Science Based Targets Initiative to take action on our submission in the first quarter, and based on their feedback, we plan to develop a road map to achieve our emission reduction targets. We also plan to launch packaging, recycling and reusable bag pilots as we explore ways to support a more sustainable beauty industry. We will continue working to expand our DEI efforts to amplify underrepresented voices, support Black entrepreneurs in the business industry, ensure inclusivity remains a top priority in every guest engagement, and foster an inclusive bias-free and equitable workplace for all associates.\n And we will continue to strengthen our corporate governance practices. Over the last several years, our Board has updated our governance guidelines to better express our commitment to diversity, implemented an age limit for directors to encourage Board refreshment and updated committee charters to address oversight of ESG risks. This year, our Board will propose, for stockholder approval, changes to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, which, among other things, will declassify the Board and provide for the annual election of each director for 1-year terms.\n If approved, the Board will be fully declassified by our 2025 annual stockholder meeting. These proactive measures reflect our commitment to operating with best-in-class governance practices. More detail about these proposed changes will be provided in our 2023 proxy statements.\n In closing, the Ulta Beauty team delivered an outstanding performance in fiscal 2022, on top of a very strong performance in fiscal '21. As we look to 2023, I am optimistic about our opportunities to expand our market leadership and drive profitable growth. We are leaders in a culturally relevant growing category with a strong proven business model and a winning culture with outstanding associates who are passionate about caring for our guests and each other.\n I remain confident we will continue to lead the category and move beauty forward in ways that have a positive impact on our guests, our associates and the communities we serve.\n And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? Kate, yes, thanks for the question. Yes, we -- 500 basis points in Q4 similar to Q3. The pricing, what we anticipate for pricing going forward into 2023 is a more normalized level. 2022 is really unprecedented across the category. We believe that, that will return to kind of more steady state level of price increases going forward or at least into 2023.\n So that is included in our comp guidance and is, in part, driving the stronger first half versus second half. As Scott mentioned, high single digits in the first half, lower single digits in the second half. One contributor to that is lapping price increases. Many of them happened through the second quarter into the third quarter last year. So as we lap those, the comparables get a little tougher. So it's incorporated in our guidance, and we anticipate it being at a more moderate normalized rate going forward. Absolutely. Thanks for the question. We are excited about the luxury opportunity, and we have been participating in luxury for a while. We've had a long-term relationship with Chanel, among many other brands. But what's evolving and changing is an expanded presence of luxury in select stores and online. We recently launched Dior in makeup and skin care. We had the Dior fragrance business. So Dior is another along with Chanel, key anchors of our expanded luxury business.\n NATASHA DENONA, which is a beautiful and elevated color brand; HOURGLASS, Chanel N\u00b01, Lanco\u0302me Absolue, we believe other luxury brands over time, now that complements a portfolio of luxury fragrance brands that we have, including YSL, TOM FORD, Gucci and others. And so the effort here is to make a stronger statement in luxury that further reinforces our All Things Beauty all in one place.\n The idea that you can shop across all price points, all categories and luxury, while we had a presence, we felt there was an opportunity to expand and solidify. And that's the actions we've been taking so far this year, and we're really encouraged by the results of the launch of several of these brands including Dior and excited about the opportunity ahead. Let's see. So a few things in that. First of all, yes, January was elevated, as Scott said there. And there were multiple factors. It's hard to nail down exact drivers, exact -- the exact elements of the contribution, but you mentioned a few, Omicron, lapping Omicron being one of those. And -- but we -- the underlying consumer engagement was strong as we emerged out of holiday. There's no doubt about that. The importance of the category, the elevated connection between beauty and wellness is showing up in January and gives us confidence as we go into the year.\n We are lapping some major launches, OLAPLEX in January. Fenty, actually, the launch happened in Q1 of last year, so that launch was not lapped in January but will be lapped here in the first quarter. And as we look into the year, again, the outlook that we have is 4% to 5% comp growth, stronger in the first half -- higher in the first half, a double digit -- I'm sorry, high single digits -- excuse me, high single digit in the first half of the year, lower single digit in the second half of the year leading to the 4% to 5% comp guidance for the full year. The drivers, again, of that are import pricing, some continued momentum coming out of the strength we saw in January and other factors that lead to a bit stronger in the first half of the year. Great. Yes. Of course, our assortment is key to our success. One of the things that's really encouraging to us and again, gives us confidence moving forward is our performance has been broad-based. We're seeing double-digit growth across all major categories. And as we look forward into 2023, we see good healthy momentum in each of the categories. So we feel confident.\n And fundamentally, it's driven by a overarching beauty trend and understanding of the power and importance of beauty and how it connects to overall wellness and self-care. That elevated connection, the increased emotional connection and the importance that beauty plays is fueling the entire category. And that's what's helping drive each element in each individual subcategory within the total beauty space.\n So we feel clearly good about what 2022 looked like and have good optimism going forward. A lot of newness, a lot of activity across each of our major categories. We've got newness in makeup and in hair care and fragrance. We'll continue to drive innovation in things we're excited about.\n Skin care is -- as we mentioned in the script, was our fastest-growing category. We had double-digit growth in each category, but skin care led the way. And we feel like there's even more opportunity. We've launched new products like Drunk Elephant. We've had great growth with The Ordinary, Hero Cosmetics. We have in our newest store design that we started rolling out last year. We brought skin care together, and our other categories, makeup with skin care and a more prominent front-of-store location that allows our guests to engage across all price points in a really elevated, beautiful way.\n We're bringing new brands in. We just launched a partnership, an exclusive partnership with Beautycounter, which spans both color and skin care but has a very strong skin care presence. So we'll bring innovation across all parts of the business, and we see strong trends, most of which are rooted in wellness and overall health and self-care, which we think will drive each of the categories in a positive way going into 2023. Yes. We -- in the fourth quarter, we saw, we'd call it, rational promotional intensity. It was relatively flat to the previous year, still down versus 2019. And of course, as we -- I guess, we probably have said several times, Q4 is an elevated promotional quarter because of the role of holiday and the gifting and the competition that we have with all gifting, not just within beauty. So -- but nothing extraordinary in Q4.\n As we look into this fiscal year, we do see that continue to normalize. The step down of the improvements that we've made versus 2019 over the last couple of years will moderate somewhat. We won't continue the pace of improvement. We'll see a more normalized level of promotion, not back to previous pre-pandemic levels, but it is a competitive environment. There are added points of distribution, brands, bringing newness and innovation and competing. So we would anticipate, as I said, a somewhat normalized level of promotion but not in a rational level of promotion as we look going forward. And on the pricing side, we don't see any real differences by category. What we saw in 2022 was really broad-based across categories because the inflationary pressures for brands was -- really impacted all segments. So as we look forward, by normalize, we mean every year in beauty over time, there's a percentage of brands that go through just more standard price increases, and we anticipate kind of going back into that. And we think it will be across categories. All right. Great. Well, thank you all for your interest and engagement today. And I want to close by thanking all 53,000 Ulta Beauty associates for delivering just excellent financial results in 2022 while executing against our strategic priorities. I am excited about the future of Ulta Beauty and believe firmly in our differentiated business model, strategic framework and talented and committed teams will continue to drive success and create significant shareholder value.\n We look forward to speaking to all of you again when we report results for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 on May 25. Have a good evening and talk to you all soon. Thanks."

            "name": "Scott Settersten",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our financial results, I want to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to our teams for delivering these exceptional results for our shareholders. We have long known our associates are our competitive advantage, and this year's results are an ongoing reflection of their relentless commitment to our guests and to executing with excellence.\n Now to our fourth quarter results beginning with the income statement. Results for the quarter were well ahead of our expectations, primarily driven by strong holiday sales and robust guest demand, which accelerated post holiday.\n Sales growth across both physical and digital channels were stronger than expected, resulting in less gross margin deleverage than planned and greater SG&A leverage. As a result, operating margin increased to 13.9% for the quarter. Net sales for the quarter increased 18.2%, driven by 15.6% growth in comp sales and strong new store performance.\n In addition, other revenue increased $18 million, primarily due to credit card income growth and an increase in royalty income from our partnership with Target. The growth in comp sales was primarily a result of a 13.6% increase in transactions driven by double-digit growth in store traffic. Average ticket increased 1.8% driven by higher average selling price, which more than offset lower units per transaction. Similar to last quarter, we estimate that product price increases contributed about 500 basis points to the overall comp increase. \n Looking at the cadence of sales through the quarter, sales moderated in November from the third quarter trend as we lapped more challenging comparisons, but well-executed holiday plans drove strong results and momentum that accelerated in January. Post-holiday results benefited from robust guest traffic in stores and the lapping of weather and impacts from COVID-19 variants during the same period last year. During the quarter, we opened 12 new stores, relocated 1 and remodeled 12 stores.\n For the quarter, gross margin was flat compared to the same period last year at 37.6%. Leverage of fixed costs, favorable channel mix shifts and strong growth in other revenue were offset by higher inventory shrink. The impact of promotional activity was flat compared to last year.\n Consistent with trends we experienced in the first 3 quarters of the year, in the fourth quarter, robust top line growth delivered significant fixed cost leverage. Channel mix was favorable as the penetration of e-commerce sales was about 270 basis points lower than last year, and solid growth in other revenue was primarily driven by increased credit card income and royalties earned through our Target partnership.\n SG&A increased 17% to $763 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased 20 basis points to 23.6% compared to 23.8% last year, primarily due to leverage in marketing expenses and incentive compensation due to higher sales, partially offset by deleverage of store payroll and benefits and corporate overhead.\n Marketing expenses during the quarter were lower as a percentage of sales compared to the same period last year. As we have discussed on previous calls, this year, we offset the incremental marketing expense of digital campaigns we manage for our brand partners with vendor income that is a direct reimbursement for these specific costs within total marketing expense. We will begin to cycle this change in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.\n Incentive compensation drove 50 basis points of leverage in the quarter, primarily driven by higher sales and a shift in the timing of bonus accruals for store associates. Offsetting these benefits, corporate overhead expense was higher than the same period last year, primarily reflecting investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR and other IT capabilities, UB Media and Ulta Beauty at Target.\n Store payroll and benefits spend in the quarter was higher than last year driven by an increase in the number of store associates and higher average wage rates. Operating margin was 13.9% compared to 13.8% last year. Healthy top line growth driven primarily by stores combined with the impact of our ongoing cost optimization efforts supported better operating margin performance.\n The company's tax rate increased to 24.6% compared to 22.9% in the fourth quarter last year. A higher effective tax rate is primarily due to less benefit from income tax accounting for share-based compensation and state tax credits.\n Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 23.5% to $6.68 compared to $5.41 last year.\n To recap the full year, net sales increased 18.3% to $10.2 billion. Comp sales increased 15.6% driven by a 10.8% increase in transactions and a 4.3% increase in average ticket. We estimate that product price increases contributed about 400 basis points to the overall comp increase for the year. Operating profit increased to 16.1% of sales primarily driven by strong revenue growth, and diluted EPS increased 33.5% to a record $24.01 per share.\n Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 7% to $1.6 billion compared to $1.5 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 47 new stores, the increase reflects inventory purchases to support new brand launches and brand expansions as well as the impact of inventory cost increases.\n Our well-established business model continues to generate significant cash from operations, including more than $1.4 billion in fiscal 2022. Our capital allocation philosophy remains consistent. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business to drive future growth followed by returning excess cash to our shareholders.\n In fiscal 2022, we invested $312 million in capital expenditures, including approximately $136 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $74 million for IT, $70 million for supply chain, and $32 million for store maintenance and other. Depreciation for the year was $241 million compared to $268 million last year primarily due to a shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense.\n During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 722,000 shares at a cost of $328 million, bringing total share repurchases to $900 million for the year. Since launching our stock buyback program in 2014, we purchased more than 16 million shares at a weighted average price of $293, effectively returning $4.8 billion to shareholders while continuing to invest in strategic growth drivers.\n Turning to our outlook for fiscal 2023. We ended fiscal 2022 with strong momentum and are confident the U.S. beauty category will remain healthy. Our financial expectations reflect this optimism but are risk adjusted to reflect an uncertain macro environment, increasing competitive pressures and the reality that we will lap 2 years of stronger-than-expected performance.\n Specifically for fiscal 2023, we plan to open between 25 and 30 net new stores and remodel or relocate 20 to 30 existing stores. As we shared on our last earnings call, we are seeing project delays resulting from external real estate and construction issues as well as supply chain disruption for key equipment. We continue to expect to open about 100 stores over the next 2 years, but the timing of openings are expected to shift between fiscal 2023 and 2024 as we navigate these external challenges.\n We expect net sales will increase 7% to 8% with comp sales growth between 4% and 5%. We anticipate comp growth in the first half will be in the upper single-digit range driven by stronger growth in the first quarter and then moderate to low single-digit growth in the second half of the year. We expect operating margin for the year will be between 14.7% and 15% of sales driven primarily by SG&A deleverage, reflecting investments to support our strategic priorities and higher store expenses as well as ongoing wage pressures.\n We expect gross margin will deleverage modestly as we lap benefits from the timing of retail price changes in 2022 and plan for a more normalized promotional environment in 2023. We expect to invest an incremental $60 million to $70 million to support our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, our digital store and other IT capabilities and UB Media. In fiscal 2022, we invested $52 million to support our strategic agenda.\n These assumptions result in guidance for diluted earnings per share in the range of $24.70 to $25.40 per share, including the impact of approximately $900 million in share repurchases. As a reminder, fiscal 2023 will be a 53-week year. We anticipate the additional week will add between $165 million to $175 million in sales and approximately $0.40 of earnings per share.\n Finally, we plan to spend between $400 million to $475 million in CapEx, including approximately $200 million to $220 million for supply chain and IT; $155 million to $205 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures; and $45 million to $50 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be between $245 million to $250 million.\n In closing, our business has recovered from the pandemic faster than initially expected. Our annual net sales this year exceeded $10 billion, which is 2 years earlier than planned and when combined with our ongoing efforts to optimize our model, has enabled record profitability. In fiscal 2022, operating margin was a record 16.1% of sales as compared to 12.1% in fiscal 2019 driven primarily by fixed cost leverage, higher merchandise margin and other revenue growth, partially offset by shrink and channel mix.\n While stronger revenue growth has resulted in a meaningful improvement compared to pre-pandemic levels, our efforts to optimize our model through this period of disruption are delivering sustainable benefits. As a result, we are updating our expectations for operating margins. We remain confident we can deliver comp sales growth between 3% to 5% but now believe we can maintain operating margins between 14% to 15% of sales over the next few years. We believe the outlook for the beauty category is bright, and we are confident our strategic framework and strong financial foundation will enable us to drive long-term growth and shareholder returns.\n And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. Yes, Adrienne. Maybe I'll just give that a slightly different spin. So again, as we said, we're confident that we can deliver now adjusted 14% to 15% operating margin on a 3% to 5% comp for the next few years. Again, we came -- at our Analyst Day back in late fall 2021, we were giving our point of view on the financial model through the end of 2024. So since then, a lot of things have changed. I think less so on the sales drivers because there's a lot -- again, this category provides a lot of opportunities for us to drive the top line through various means.\n Really, the change is versus 2019, a lot are in the infrastructure, the cost infrastructure of the business overall. So you've probably heard us refer to some of this in the past. So we -- of course, we benefited here over the last couple of years from double-digit sales growth, driving a lot of fixed cost leverage across the business. There's also been a more rational promotional environment the last couple of years. And so -- and these elevated sales levels have also mitigated some of the other inflationary cost pressures that we are experiencing across the business.\n So as we look to 2023, we expect sales growth to moderate from where it's been the last couple of years. And so that will -- that's going to drive some deleverage. That's our year-over-year tougher comparisons. We've described that. I mean, as we think about, again, stronger and sustainable operating margins, we just feel like the business is in a much healthier position today than it was back in 2019.\n Again, we've described improved capabilities across the business, like ship from store and BOPIS helping to do that. Our ESG initiative that we started years ago now are continuing to drive significant benefits to the business overall. And we believe that, coupled with some of the new initiatives that we have along the lines of continuous improvement and some of the other long-term strategic investments we're making for the business, help give us comfort that we can hold on to those stronger margins with a 3% to 5% comp over the next few years. Sure, Simeon. So yes, we expect operating margin is going to be leveraged in fiscal 2023 compared to last year driven by slight deleverage in gross margin, but the primary lever is going to be SG&A. That's where most of the pressure will come from during the year. We expect gross margin, again, modest deleverage there as we lap benefits and the timing of retail price increases during 2022, and we plan for a more normalized promotional environment overall. Those headwinds will probably be offset by growth in other revenue and continued fixed cost leverage.\n So on the SG&A side, it really comes down to continuing our efforts with our strategic investments, our strategic initiatives across the business. So again, last year, we got out of the gates on most all of those things, Project SOAR being the largest by far but Digital Store of the Future, UB Media. There are a number of other digital investments across the business, so really getting into the thick of it, I guess, I would say, during 2023, so that's the primary driver of it.\n But there's also inflationary pressures in store expenses. And of course, we referenced the wage pressure as well, and most of that falls through to our field teams, which is recognized in our SG&A line. So that's it by far.\n I'd say overall, we feel good about where we are. We've got a good plan. We think it's balanced in all ways and takes recognition of both the opportunities we have but also the risks that we see in 2023. Yes. So for our new store outlook, our long-term outlook, still 1,500 to 1,700 stores with roughly 800 Ulta Beauty at Target locations on top of that. So again, we're still very comfortable from everything we've seen, the interaction between, as Kecia just described, between the shop in shops and what we're doing in our stand-alone stores, are happy with the overall performance.\n Again, this year, there's just a shift or just smart business, we think, not chasing a number with new store openings and trying to be wise about how we plan that to make sure we keep good disciplines on site selection and the cost ramifications because these are long-term investments."

            "content": "Maybe I'll start, Dana. Like you're hearing from the broader retail industry, organized retail crime and shrink is a real issue out there, and we're not immune to what's happening. The concern is really twofold. Firstly, it's about safety and well-being of our associates and our guests. The news groups are coming in to the stores. It's really upsetting and can take an emotional toll on everyone that's involved. And secondly, as you mentioned, it's clearly a financial impact to our bottom line. \n We're continuing to invest in measures to not only deter but catch those who are conducting these activities. So the investments are around increasing our talent level, targeting our payroll in both our store and our loss prevention team, testing new technology, and then also installing new fixtures that can protect some of our key categories. Fragrance is the one we're really leaning into right now.\n What we're seeing is when we're investing in these locked cases in fragrance, we're seeing sales go up and shrink goes down. And our associates are very, very thankful for this because it's really deterring these bad actors from coming into our stores. We're going to be at 75% of the chain by the end of the year with these new fixtures. \n And then in regards to what the shrink impact is, it's about 70 basis points of headwinds that we had in 2022 to gross margin, and we're proactively taking these steps, as I mentioned before, to make sure that we understand these macro factors are going to continue to persist, but we're looking at only a modest benefit and shrink improvement in 2023. I'll go ahead and start. And what I would say is that we've got 3 areas of really concentrated efforts in our partnership with the Ulta Beauty and Target partnership. First is about deepening the guest engagement. It's really focusing on new guest acquisition, increasing the spend of the existing linked Circle and Ulta Beauty reward members in engaging that lapsed member. When we see the Ulta Beauty at Target member coming in and engaging with Ulta Beauty itself, what we're seeing is we like what their spend patterns look like. They're at our average spend, if not, even higher. So we like what we're seeing from the ecosystem.\n In regards to new store growth, I mean, listen, we've got competition out there always on in regards to where we're opening up new stores. So we are looking at this as part of the ecosystem where we actually would even have, in some locations, Ulta Beauty at Target in the same center as an Ulta Beauty store. And what we're seeing is that's really -- it's performing very nicely that the customer is shopping in both.\n So while there's competition out there, it's not necessarily playing into what our new store opening guidelines looks like. Maybe you want to weigh in on the supply chain with supplies for new stores."

Following our prepared comments, we'll open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] And as always, the IR team will be available for any follow-up questions after the call.\n Now I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave? \nDavid Kimbell: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. The Ulta Beauty team delivered outstanding performance this quarter with strong revenue growth driving operating margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth. We accomplished these results because the Ulta Beauty teams continue to execute at a high level, and I want to thank all of our associates for their commitment to delivering great guest experiences, ensuring operational excellence, strengthening our culture and working together as one team to move our business forward as the leader in beauty.\n For the third quarter, net sales increased 17.2% to $2.3 billion, and comp sales increased 14.6%. Operating margin increased to 15.5% of sales and diluted EPS increased 35.5% to $5.34 per share. Reflecting these results and our updated fourth quarter expectations, we have increased our outlook for the full year. Scott will share more details about our expectations later in the call.\n Our third quarter results are a testament to the resilience of the beauty category and our team's ability to drive strong guest engagement that fueled broad-based growth across our business. All major categories exceeded our expectations, and we increased our market share in Prestige Beauty versus the fiscal third quarter last year based on dollar sales according to point-of-sale data from the NPD Group.\n We delivered growth across our store and digital channels and achieved record loyalty membership of 39 million members. Additionally, we continue to see growth in spend per member across all income demographics.\n Our strategic framework, anchored by the power of our differentiated model, continues to drive our ambitions and successes as we work to expand our market leadership and drive profitable growth. This afternoon, I'll share an update on our progress against several of our strategic pillars.\n Starting with our efforts to drive disruptive growth through an expanded definition of All Things Beauty, our strategy to engage and delight beauty enthusiasts with a thoughtfully curated assortment focused on inclusivity and leading trends is delivering results. Our double-digit comp this quarter was a result of growth from our core assortment, price increases executed this year and compelling newness.\n Although pricing contributed more to our comp than last quarter, the majority of our third quarter comp was fueled by growth from our core assortment and newness. Historically, sales of new products have averaged 20% to 30% of our sales, and the overall mix of newness this year has been in line with our historical experience.\n Turning to performance by category. Skincare, fragrance and bath, haircare and makeup all delivered double-digit comp growth against the third quarter last year. From a segment perspective, we saw double-digit sales growth across both prestige and mass, with mass generally outperforming prestige. While it's hard to know with certainty if we are starting to see consumers trade down, as the only beauty retailer that offers a wide variety of price points from entry level mass to high-end luxury and everything in between, Ulta Beauty is uniquely positioned to capture any consumer shifts within price points in the beauty category.\n Turning to the performance of our core categories, starting with our fastest-growing category, skincare. Beauty enthusiasts are maintaining their skincare routines with a focus on science-backed and dermatologist-recommended products. Guests are engaging with newer brands, like Drunk Elephant, Supergoop! and Good Molecules, while new products from established brands like The Ordinary, Hero Cosmetics and La Roche-Posay also contributed to sales growth.\n To drive discovery and support guest education, this quarter, we introduced our skincare we love wall in all stores. This curated presentation highlights exciting brands and best-selling items across key categories. The fragrance and bath category delivered another impressive quarter as Gen Z guests engaged with the category, leveraging multiple fragrances to express themselves. Recently launched Ulta Beauty exclusive Billie Eilish as well as new scents from Burberry, Gucci and Victor and Ralph drove meaningful sales growth. While our monthly fragrance crush program drove engagement with established brands, including Versace and Jimmy Choo.\n In addition, the category benefited from strong guest engagement with our holiday fragrance gift sets, which were available earlier this year.\n Haircare, our second largest category, delivered solid growth, primarily driven by newness and innovation. Key category trends include hair health, damage repair and targeted treatments. Prestige brands, including [ Vie ] and Briogeo, saw strength in treatments and core assortments, while masstige brands, including Eva Nyc, Batiste and KRISTIN ESS, and professional brands such as Pureology, Redken and Kenra, continued to resonate with guests.\n Within the category, strong hair product growth was offset by softer performance in hair tools as we lapped strong performance last year.\n Finally, our largest category, makeup, delivered double-digit comp growth driven by newness and the strength of our key events, including 21 Days of Beauty and Fall Haul. Growth in foundation, concealers, blush and lip continue to lead the category. New brands like Fenty, r.e.m. beauty and N\u00b01 DE CHANEL drove sales during the quarter, while new products from a wide range of brands, including Clinique, e.l.f. and NYX also contributed to growth. In addition, the expansion of MAC, Chanel Beaut\u00e9 and Bobby Brown into more stores has continued to drive prestige sales.\n Now let me give you an update on our key cross-category platforms. Conscious Beauty, Black-Owned and BIPOC brands and Wellness. With 290 certified brands, Conscious Beauty continues to resonate strongly with beauty enthusiasts, reflecting growing interest in products that are good for the world. This quarter, we certified 15 new brands, including 8 cosmetics, Morphe and DIME Beauty, and introduced the Conscious Beauty essentials kit, featuring minis for more than 15 brands, such as Dermalogica, COOLA and our own Ulta Beauty Collection.\n During the quarter, we expanded our BIPOC brand assortment with 4 new BIPOC brands: [indiscernible], BREAD BEAUTY SUPPLY, sugardoh and Undefined Beauty. As another way we look to create foundational industry change, we proudly launched our MUSE Accelerator program to support early-stage BIPOC brands as they prepare for retail readiness. Our inaugural class included 8 BIPOC founders, with innovative brands across skin care, makeup, fragrance, haircare and wellness.\n In addition to financial support, each MUSE Accelerator participant took part in an intensive 10-week training program, learning from Ulta Beauty leaders, industry subject matter experts and leading BIPOC brand owners. We are honored and excited to be a part of their journey as they build their business and expand their reach.\n Finally, we continue to increase our presence in wellness. During the quarter, we further enhanced our assortment to reflect our guest evolving needs. And in September, we expanded our offering to include intimate wellness as the sixth online-only pillar of the wellness shop.\n While wellness represents a small part of our overall business today, we believe it is a significant longer-term growth opportunity given the incrementality of the purchase and the strong emotional connection consumers have with self-care.\n Turning now to our efforts to evolve the omnichannel experience through a connected physical and digital ecosystem, all in your world. Store traffic trends accelerated this quarter and exceeded pre-pandemic levels for the first time, representing an important milestone in our COVID recovery. In addition to strong sales growth from stores, we continue to deliver growth in e-commerce, further reinforcing the incrementality of this important channel. The convenience of BOPIS for e-commerce orders continues to resonate with guests. During the quarter, BOPIS increased 18% to 23% of e-commerce sales, compared to 20% last year. Our services business accelerated and delivered another quarter of double-digit comp growth, primarily due to higher stylist retention, increased stylist productivity and increased capacity in our salons as we lap capacity constraints due to the pandemic.\n Our targeted CRM efforts to drive awareness, trial and frequency are working, delivering increases in salon appointments from both existing and new members. Additionally, our in-store back bar events continue to drive product attachment and new guest acquisition for participating brands.\n As industry leaders, we're always working to enhance guest experiences across all of our platforms. During the quarter, we introduced a new layout in about a dozen stores to showcase our categories better, improve navigation, enhance the services experience and create more opportunities for discovery. The most noticeable changes include the repositioning of skincare, an important growth category. To the front of the store. All products grew by category with delineated fixtures and visuals and a flow from prestige to masstige to mass. \n Elevated gondolas that showcase key iconic and service brands, new beauty bars that offer our brow and makeup services as well as supporting in-store events, dedicated space in the front of the store to feature brand and product launches across categories and a relocated checkout closer to the salon. We are excited to introduce this new store layout to guest. And as we've done in the past, we intend to introduce this new experience in new stores, remodels and relocations. At this time, we have no plans to retrofit existing stores.\n Stores are a critical part of our ecosystem. And while most Ulta Beauty's transactions occur in-stores, we know the guest journey often begins online. To assist guests along their journey, we offer a suite of virtual digital tools, including GLAMlab, Skin Advisor and our hairstyle tool, among others. \n The latest addition is a fragrance finder designed to help guests explore fragrances by favorite brand or ingredient, launched just in time for the holiday season. Finally, we continue to be excited about the long-term opportunity with our strategic Target partnership. This touch point enables us to connect and reconnect with members. And while the partnership isn't material yet to our overall member growth, it has contributed positively. Importantly, we are seeing members bounce back to Ulta Beauty after becoming an active member while at the Ulta Beauty at Target shop.\n Now let me give you an update on some of the steps we're taking to drive love, loyalty and emotional connection with Ulta Beauty. Recognizing the beauty is personal, we are on a multiyear journey to create stronger, more emotional connections with our guests and bring our brand purpose to life. Launched in September, our latest brand building campaign Beauty And is rooted in insights from cultural leaders and beauty enthusiasts. The creative content on owned and paid channels has driven broad improvement in top-of-mind awareness and is resonating with our guests, particularly Black and Latinx beauty enthusiasts.\n Turning to our loyalty program. Our efforts to nurture loyalty in personalized ways is driving member growth and delivering incremental value. We ended the quarter with 39 million active members, 9% higher than the third quarter last year. Overall spend per member increased driven by increased frequency and higher average ticket. While price increases are having an impact, we are encouraged to see unit growth per member. Our loyalty program is a strategic asset and an important driver of our long-term growth. We prioritize member engagement, loyalty and retention across every Ulta Beauty touch point. The growth and strength of our loyalty program starts with ensuring that our existing guests stay engaged. Nurturing our existing members through our Member Love events and life cycle marketing strategies has enabled us to maintain healthy retention rates, which have contributed to member growth and higher spend per member.\n Member reactivation remains a priority, and we are leveraging CRM tools to personalize offers and reengage members in more targeted ways. And, of course, conversion of new members also contributes to overall member growth, and we continue to acquire new members in our stores, digital platforms and through our partnership with Target.\n Shifting now to our plans and expectations for holiday. The holiday season is in full flow, and our teams are executing well. While predicting holiday shopping patterns this year is challenging, I am optimistic about the opportunity for Ulta Beauty this holiday season. Our engaging holiday messaging, one-of-a-kind assortment, with exceptional seasonal options and diverse touch points, all paired with our team's unrelenting passion for delivering great guest experiences, position us well to deliver another successful holiday season.\n Grounded and robust consumer insights, our holiday marketing strategy positions Ulta Beauty as the place for gifting, glamming and self-care this season. Our intent is to empower guests to celebrate the season however they want. And our integrated media plan for the holiday aims to build broad awareness of Ulta Beauty as a holiday destination, spark connection with key audiences, leverage our beauty expertise and drive consideration and purchase.\n Our merchandising team has built an outstanding holiday gifting assortment, whether guests want to gift others or treat themselves, we have thoughtfully curated options across every category and budget, with a balanced approach to the mix of seasonal holiday items and core items that make great gifts. We entered the holiday season with well-staffed stores and DCs, and our teams are excited, engaged and ready.\n For the first time since 2019, our store teams gathered in person to review our holiday strategies. And I know their excitement and enthusiasm for our plans will be felt in every guest interaction. And our corporate and DC teams have worked cross-functionally to ensure Ulta Beauty is positioned to deliver for our store teams and our guests.\n In closing, I am incredibly proud of our year-to-date results, and I'm excited about our holiday plans. Even as consumers continue to navigate economic headwinds, we believe the beauty category will remain resilient, and we are confident that our differentiated model and growth strategy, combined with our outstanding associates, will continue to position Ulta Beauty as the preferred beauty destination.\n And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? \nScott Settersten: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported results that were better than our initial expectations. Strong double-digit revenue growth resulted in record-setting third quarter operating margin performance. These excellent results reflect the continued focus and hard work of our store, DC and corporate teams. And I want to thank all of our Ulta Beauty associates for working together to deliver another outstanding quarter for our shareholders.\n Now to the financial results, starting with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter increased 17.2% driven by comp sales growth of 14.6% and strong new store performance. In addition, other revenue increased $20 million, primarily due to credit card income growth, higher loyalty point redemptions and an increase in royalty income from our partnership with Target.\n Breaking down the comp performance further, comp transactions for the quarter increased 10.7%, primarily driven by strong growth from in-store transactions. Average ticket increased 3.5% due to an increase in average selling price partially offset by slightly lower average units per transaction. The increase in average selling price primarily reflects the impact of retail price increases executed this year. We estimate that price increases contributed about 500 basis points to the overall comp increase. While average units per transaction was slightly lower than last year, the total number of units sold increased about 10% on a comp basis.\n During the quarter, we opened 18 new stores, relocated one store and remodeled 8 stores. For the quarter, gross margin increased 160 basis points to 41.2% of sales compared to 39.6% last year. The increase was primarily due to the leverage of store fixed costs, other revenue growth and higher merchandise margin partially offset by higher inventory shrink. Robust top line growth and benefits from our ongoing occupancy cost optimization efforts resulted in healthy leverage of store fixed costs.\n The improvement in merchandise margin was primarily due to benefits resulting from the timing of retail price changes partially offset by brand mix. As we have discussed, we have executed a number of price increases from our brand partners this year. Generally, when the new price is effective at the shelf, we are still selling the inventory purchased at the lower cost. As a result, there's a short-term benefit to cost of goods as we move through the lower cost inventory.\n As expected, our promotional activity increased from the second quarter, but the impact to margin was not meaningful compared to last year. SG&A increased 18.6% to $597.2 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 30 basis points to 25.5% compared to 25.2% last year, primarily due to increases in store payroll and benefits and corporate overhead partially offset by lower marketing expenses.\n Store payroll and benefits deleverage this quarter primarily due to increased labor hours to maintain service standards, higher average wage rates to support recruitment and retention and a timing shift of incentive compensation accruals.\n Corporate overhead expense deleveraged in the quarter, primarily reflecting investments related to our strategic priorities including Project SOAR and other IT capabilities, UB Media and Ulta Beauty at Target. These headwinds were partially offset by lower marketing expense. As we have discussed on previous calls, this year, we are offsetting the incremental marketing expense of digital campaigns we manage for our brand partners, with vendor income that is a direct reimbursement for these specific costs within total marketing expense.\n Similar to what we saw in the first half, this resulted in about 70 basis points of favorable impact to SG&A in the quarter. Operating income for the quarter increased 27.3% to $361.9 million. As a percentage of sales, operating margin increased 130 basis points to 15.5% of sales compared to 14.2% last year. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 35.5% to $5.34 per share, compared to $3.94 per share last year.\n Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total inventory increased 10.3%. In addition to the impact of 41 additional stores, the increase reflects purchases to support key brand launches and increases in inventory costs as well as ongoing efforts to maintain strong in-stock to support expected demand.\n Capital expenditures in the quarter were $83.5 million compared to $51.1 million last year. The increase was primarily related to investments in new remodeled and relocated stores, IT projects and merchandising improvements.\n Depreciation was $58.5 million compared to $65.2 million last year, primarily due to a shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense. We ended the quarter with $250.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the quarter, we repurchased 340,000 shares at a cost of $137.5 million. At the end of the third quarter, we had $1.4 billion remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization.\n Turning now to our outlook. We have raised our financial guidance for fiscal 2022 to reflect our strong third quarter performance and increased expectations for the fourth quarter. We now expect net sales for the year will be between $9.95 billion and $10 billion, with comp sales growth between 12.6% and 13.2%. This guidance reflects our expectation that fourth quarter comp growth will be between 6% and 8%, up from our previous expectation for low single-digit increase.\n Sales growth moderated in November as we lapped last year's strong performance, but we are pleased with the sales trends we saw through the Thanksgiving holiday shopping weekend, including Cyber Monday. We still have several important weeks left in the holiday season, and the operating environment continues to be dynamic. Our Q4 comp outlook, reflects both the expected resilience of the beauty category as well as potential risks from shifts in consumer spending, increased points of distribution for Prestige Beauty and higher promotional activity.\n For the year, we plan to open approximately 47 net new stores and remodel or relocate 33 stores. Our new store performance continues to be strong. But like many other major retailers, we are seeing project delays resulting from external real estate and construction issues as well as supply chain disruption for key equipment. These external factors have impacted our fiscal 2022 plans and will likely shift new stores originally planned for fiscal 2023 into 2024. We continue to expect to open about 100 stores over the next 2 years, but the timing of opening between fiscal 2023 and 2024 may shift as we navigate these external challenges.\n The operating environment is fluid, and we will provide specific targets for fiscal 2023 when we report in March. We now expect operating margins for the year will be between 15.5% and 15.6% of sales. We expect gross margin for the year will increase with leverage of fixed costs and growth in other revenue partially offset by lower merchandise margin, higher shrink and higher supply chain costs. We continue to expect SG&A expense for the year will increase between 15% and 16% or approximately flat as a percentage of sales, driven primarily by $60 million to $65 million of expenses related to our strategic priorities as well as higher wage rate growth across the enterprise, partially offset by lower marketing expense. Reflecting these assumptions, we now expect diluted earnings per share for the year will be between $22.60 and $22.90.\n One final update. We now expect to spend between $300 million and $350 million in CapEx in fiscal 2022, including approximately $160 million for supply chain and IT; $140 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures; and about $30 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be around $250 million.\n While we are not providing guidance for next year on this call, we want to share some high-level thoughts for your consideration as you model fiscal 2023. The beauty category has been stronger this year than expected. Barring a major economic event, we would expect category growth to continue in 2023, albeit at lower rates, reflecting strong consumer engagement with the category, and we remain confident we can deliver comp sales growth in fiscal 2023 within our longer-term targeted range of 3% to 5%.\n In this sales scenario, we would expect operating margin deleverage versus our fiscal 2022 guidance. In addition to inflationary pressures on wage rates and other operational expenses, we expect to increase investment spending related to our strategic priorities, reflecting timing shifts from fiscal 2022 and the planned ramp-up of key IT and supply chain investments.\n Finally, fiscal 2023 will be a 53-week year for Ulta Beauty. We are still finalizing our budget for fiscal 2023 and plan to provide specific financial guidance and update our longer-term growth targets, if appropriate, on our March earnings call.\n And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. \nSteven Forbes: Dave, Scott, I wanted to focus and start with member engagement. But Dave, curious if you can expand on how member engagement trends within the recent member cohorts differ or I guess, are similar from the more mature cohorts in terms of retention, repeat behavior, the maturation of wallet share, channel preferences, really just any color that helps maybe underpin your conviction for a positive comp outlook next year. \nDavid Kimbell: Great. Thanks, Steve. Yes, as I said in the remarks, our loyalty program, our membership is vital and critical to our long-term success and one that we're extremely proud of what we've built the relationship that we have with our guests. Yes, I guess, a few things that I'd call out. Naturally, our longer tenured. You get -- if you're tenured 3-plus years, we see kind of a higher level of retention, higher level of engagement that tends to grow over time. Greater percentage of our guests, the longer they're here, move into our higher levels, platinum and diamond levels. So naturally, with that tenure comes greater engagement.\n And as I mentioned, one of the drivers of our third quarter growth, 9% growth in our total membership was healthy retention and it's been a big focus for our entire team. Our loyalty team, our store teams, our digital, everybody that participates into delivering a great experience. So that's key and really job one is engaging and retaining our existing guests.\n Our newer members that we acquire in stores, online and increasingly with our partnership with Target play an important role. Their spend per member makes sense. It's on average lower, and we work hard to get them into the full Ulta Beauty experience. Often they enter into one category or one experience. They might come in store, we try to move them online. They might come in to makeup, we try to move them into skincare, get them into services. We have a full suite of activities and experiences designed to engage our new members through -- and including their what we call their sophomore year, their second year with us, which is important pivot year into long-term retention.\n So we look across all spectrum, what we're excited about now and encouraged by is we're seeing strength across all sectors, all income demographics, all geographies. We have a healthy member base. That's what's driving the 9% growth in our loyalty and of course that, in turn, played a big role in the sales performance we had in the third quarter. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. \nIrwin Boruchow: Congrats, great quarter. I guess, Scott, I was going to focus on the margins with you. Merch margin is better in 3Q. It sounds like you're off to a good start on the promotional side in 4Q as well. You're going to end the -- I mean, it's a good problem to have, you're going to end the year closer to 16% margins. Your long-term target is 13% to 14%.\n I guess, just with merch margins as elevated as they are and as healthy as they are, are you guys starting to think more longer term about the AUR dynamics in the business and maybe that this elevated level of merch margin that you're at might be more sustainable than maybe what you had originally thought and maybe that 13% to 14% actually can move a bit higher? I mean it more is a high-level question, not necessarily 2023, but that's kind of where I was coming from. \nScott Settersten: Yes. Thanks, Ike. I think probably gets to a larger picture versus the AUR piece of your question there. So let me start it, because I know this is at the top of the list for all investors right now as we're thinking about next year. So let me start by saying we are very proud of what the Ulta Beauty team has been able to deliver over the last several years with respect to our operating margin profile overall.\n We continue to lead the beauty category, capture market share gains and deliver some of the strongest operating margins in all of retail, while also absorbing significant cost pressures driven by an e-commerce business that we doubled the size of since 2019, along with wage pressures, supply chain disruptions, fuel costs and other inflationary pressures across the business. And also continuing to make significant investments to innovate and build a healthy and vibrant business for the long term.\n Having said that, we've been very transparent with investors all year when discussing the continued beauty rebound in 2022, and that sales trends have been much stronger than what we expected back in the fall of 2021 when we provided our long-term financial outlook. And that sales performance is driving stronger-than-expected operating margins driven primarily by fixed cost leverage, price increase benefits and gross margin that are extraordinary this year and more moderate promotion levels and that the sales increases have been outpacing the inflationary cost pressures that we've seen in our business.\n So again, big picture, let me just lay out a couple of the bigger variables here as we're thinking about modeling for next year. So again, back to what we referenced in the script, we do expect we can grow sales next year in line with our longer-term 3% to 5% comp target.\n So on the top line, merchants have done an outstanding job. We feel good about the queue for newness next year. We've got some great things lined up. But we're going to be lapping over some extraordinary newness this year, right, with these leading brands in each of our key categories, Fenty in makeup, Drunk Elephant in skincare and OLAPLEX in haircare, all right?\n Price increase is another major lever. So we're kind of in uncharted territory right now, right? The percentage of our assortment where we've seen increases and the depth of those increases is something we've never experienced in all the years here at Ulta Beauty. So we're going to be cycling over some of that next year, and it's kind of yet to be seen how the consumer is going to react to that over the longer period of time.\n So elasticity and resilient, while it's been resilient so far, there's a question of how far we're able to push this without seeing some kind of impact.\n Lastly, on the top line, I'd say we're going to lean into our very powerful loyalty program, the benefits of our credit card. And of course, we're going to look to continue to see benefit from our Ulta Beauty at Target relationship next year.\n Thinking about the rest of the P&L then on the gross margin piece of it, promotion levels, we think, will likely be higher next year than they have been the last couple of years. Channel mix been kind of a benefit this year because stores, the big bounce back and traffic we've seen in stores has helped, right, some of the margin headwinds that we see from our digital business. Pricing benefits, we -- again, this gross margin benefit from the timing between price versus the inventory change has contributed meaningful benefits this year. And again, some of that will recur next year, but the question is to what significance?\n Wage pressure will continue. Fuel will probably moderate, right? We've seen that here more recently. Supply chain investments will ramp up next year. And of course, UB Media will accelerate, it will step up there. So ramp-up will contribute on the margin line, gross margin line.\n In SG&A, we got store payroll upward pressure on wages, which we expect to continue, maybe not to the same rate we've seen here this year, but certainly will continue upward. Variable cost, inflationary pressures, again, credit card fees, I mean we're seeing it in every part of our business right now. We've been able to mitigate a lot of that. And super high sales increases help camouflage that a bit as well.\n And then, of course, our strategic investments, as we mentioned in the script, we plan to ramp those up, and that's coming in 2023. So other digital investments UB Media and UB at Target as well.\n So we've got mitigating strategies in place, right? You've heard us talk about some of these over the years, and we've demonstrated the company we are able to deliver, we've delivered hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits from our EFG efforts, and we've got plenty of margin enhancement and cost optimization opportunities in front of us, and we're building out new continuous improvement capabilities, which, again, you've heard us talk about are building for the long-term cost optimization of the business.\n So I'll close it up by saying, even in what we see as a more uncertain environment, being with us here into next year, we are well positioned. We've got a strong business model. We are in a great category that's growing and we've got a very -- a business that delivers very healthy margins. And we expect to be able to grow the top line next year even off extraordinary performance in 2021 and '22. So we feel good about where we are. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. \nLorraine Maikis: Your sales guidance continues to include pressure from increased points of distribution for prestige. Can you talk about what you're seeing in the fleet when one of these new stores open and how meaningful it is? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. We're certainly watching, monitoring, tracking all competitive activity across the landscape. And as I've said before, our focus continues to really be on offense for us to really leverage what we do best, the unique differentiated model we have. Nobody does what Ulta Beauty does. So our competitive strategy is to lead and to drive our business forward. Having said that, we are watching, there are changes. When stores, competitive stores open, depending on the circumstances, the situation, we can see a relatively minor impact. Typically, over time, our business sustains and recovers any short-term impact. So we're confident.\n And again, our focus is on delivering what our experience is. What we found over time is doing that allows us to continue to find growth and deliver an experience that our guest continues to want to find at Ulta Beauty. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ashley Helgans with Jefferies. \nAshley Helgans: Congrats on the quarter. So we just wanted to ask about the promotional landscape that you've seen heading into holiday. And if you feel discounting at other retailers has been as heavy as initially expected? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. I guess we'd say for holiday, a little early to know exactly. I mean we're right in the middle of the battle here, I guess, with our biggest weeks of the holiday period still ahead of us. And we know we've been -- I think we shared this at our last call and really any time we're talking about holiday. Holiday is a more promotional period. The November, December period is different than the other 10 months of the year because the gifting aspects, the idea that we're not just competing with beauty, we're competing with other gift categories across retail.\n The landscape, it's hard for us to judge midstream exactly. What we've been delivering is an aggressive promotional, but not wildly different than what we've done in the past. So we've seen consistency there. So far, we're really encouraged by what we're seeing, feeling like Ulta Beauty is well positioned and competing effectively, but we're also monitoring, tracking and ensuring that we close out this next, I guess, 24, 25 days with excellence as we complete the holiday and that's our focus going forward. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson. \nMichael Baker: I just wanted to ask a little bit about cadence, the month throughout the third quarter. And then November, you said it slowed. I guess I'm just wondering, within your 6% to 8% guidance for the fourth quarter, we know the comparisons get easier in December relative to November. Is that contemplated within the guidance? Or maybe another way to ask it is, is November slow? Did it slow below 6% to 8% and you need to pick up to get there? Or is it within that range? \nDavid Kimbell: Well, what I will say is, first on the third quarter, we saw a strong growth throughout the quarter, although October was modestly -- decelerated modestly, but still double-digit growth in each period of the quarter. As is suggested in our 6% to 8% guidance for the fourth quarter, we're anticipating deceleration from what we saw in the third quarter and really throughout the year. And we've been kind of anticipating this all year as we -- our comps are strong.\n And again, we're in a different type of period in holiday. We're not going to get into specific week-by-week replay yet. We'll -- as I said, we're right in the middle of it. We've got big weeks ahead of us. We'll obviously share, when we share our fourth quarter results, all the details. But what I will say is, again, reflected in the 6% to 8% is an anticipated healthy growth, but not to the level of what we saw in the third quarter, and we're encouraged by what we're seeing so far in the holiday period, knowing that there's a lot of ground still to cover as we complete holiday. And January is a big important period for us as well. So still a lot ahead of us, but encouraged by what we're seeing so far. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Great. Scott, I was wondering if you can talk about -- you had mentioned sort of the vendor contribution that was offsetting some of the lower marketing spend. So does that mean that they want to present their brands more aggressively, and therefore, are taking more space either on the 21 Days of Beauty or gift with purchase that type of thing.\n And then I also wanted to know, Dave, at the beginning of the pandemic, you pulled out of the international Canada opening. Now that the domestic business seems to be on pretty good footing, how are you thinking about kind of reentry into that market? \nScott Settersten: Yes. So I'll start. So the first part of your question, yes, it's an accounting recognition of how the debits and credits flow through the P&L, Adrienne. So there's really nothing related to the vendor choices or how we work or execute any of those kinds of things. It's just accounting convention, matching up expense with income when it's incremental expenses related to these marketing activities and then the rest of it kind of rolls through the gross margin through our inventory accounting. \nDavid Kimbell: And on your question about Canada and international, as you stated, we obviously stopped that early in the pandemic. Right now, we have no plans, consistent with what we shared at our Analyst Day. No plans to expand internationally at this time, although we are always looking for opportunities to find new growth potential. And so in our future at some point, that's possible, but nothing in our immediate plans for sure. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Korinne Wolfmeyer with Piper Sandler. \nKorinne Wolfmeyer: Congrats on the quarter. So I'd like to expand a little bit on what you're seeing within the specific product categories. I mean you did note pretty strong growth for all categories. But as we head into the early parts here of Q4 and the holiday season, can you talk about kind of specific trends you're seeing for cosmetics, skincare, fragrance? What categories are maybe requiring a little bit heavier promotional activity for holiday? Just any color you can provide there would be helpful. \nDavid Kimbell: Well, I'll start with saying, yes, we're really encouraged by what we saw in the third quarter. And really, we've seen this trend for the first 3 quarters, a strong growth across all categories, which is obviously a great place to be. The strength we're seeing in our business is not outweighted by one specific category. It's balanced across our portfolio. And it's because we've -- our team across both merchandising, marketing, our stores have done a great job engaging our guests in our entire assortment.\n And so we're excited and encouraged to see strength across -- double-digit growth across all key categories. Each one has unique stories, makeup driven by this increased engagement in social activities, plus strong product trends that are highlighted through social media and new product growth that a spectrum of newness that's really working. So a collection of activity that's coming together, both product newness, marketing newness and engagement opportunities. Skincare continued strength by both science-backed, clinically proven dermatologists recommended solutions. So that engagement that many people elevated through the pandemic has sustained.\n It's actually our fastest-growing category in the third quarter. Haircare, we've been driving that growth as a leader in haircare and strong trends, a healthy portfolio of newness that continues to drive great engagement. And then really all year, pleased with fragrance and bath.\n As I look in the innovation and engagement, I mentioned Gen Z being a part of that and really the whole portfolio working quite well across that important category. As we look in the fourth quarter, again, not getting in -- we won't get into any specifics right now. We're in the middle of holiday. And so there's a lot to cover. I wouldn't say there's anything jumping out uniquely for any category from a promotional standpoint. And we come in really with a focus in the fourth quarter of what we call gifting and glamming. And the gifting component is a mix of holiday-specific, but core items that serve all year long, and the team has done a nice job with a balance there.\n So we feel great about our assortment. It's -- again, we're encouraged by what we're seeing to this point in the holiday and confident that we'll be able to deliver a strong holiday across all of our categories. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James. \nOlivia Tong Cheang: I have two questions. First one on newness. Because you had a few brands that really anchored newness, and I would imagine contributed towards the upper end of your average ranges this year, so could you talk about your view on innovation, the level of innovation as you think about the next 12 months versus the prior 12?\n And then you also mentioned in your prepared comments that mass is outperforming for stage, but in your view, wasn't definitively trade down. So could we dig into that a little? Is there more newness in one versus the other? Or any other reason that you think that mass is starting to outperform prestige if it wasn't related to a [ stretched ] consumer? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. So just on the broader idea of newness, it's important to our business and the beauty category always. And as I mentioned in our remarks, typically 20% to 30% of sales are new items, and that's the range that we will land this year and anticipate we'll be able to continue to be in that range going forward. As I -- we did -- Scott mentioned, we had some really important new brands in 2022. But we're excited and encouraged by the outlook. This category, both big brands like some mentioned, but also new and emerging brands that take off and connect. I mentioned a couple of those like Good Molecules, among others.\n So we've got a portfolio of brands as we look forward into next year and confident about newness, both new brands and newness from our existing brands. That plays a big role. And as we work with all of them and see their pipeline, we're encouraged by what we're seeing. The trends are strong across each of the categories. And we're seeing healthy growth. And we think newness will play an important part in that going forward, knowing that we've got some of these big brands that Scott mentioned earlier to launch or to lap.\n As it relates to the mass and prestige, we did see mass growing somewhat faster than prestige. But both sides were strong and healthy. So I wouldn't say the strength in mass or the somewhat higher growth in mass as we look at it and do -- and analyze our members didn't come at the expense of prestige. It just a came because mass is strong and there's good newness brands like e.l.f., NYX, Ordinary, La Roche-Posay [indiscernible] strong newness and engagement. And so they're just capturing and growing. But prestige is doing really well, too. So I don't look at them being a little bit higher than prestige as coming at the expense of just their -- several of these brands and some of our bigger brands are hitting the mark and that's working.\n All of our analysis suggests that we have not seen clear\t signs of trade down. But I'd reinforce, if there is that, we are uniquely positioned to deliver and support our guests regardless of what choices they make from a price point. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Scott, can you help stress test a couple of the key variables that are going to impact Ulta's gross overall operating margin in 2023 between the expense spending that you slated for this year and the step-up that you had originally planned for 2023. Is it reasonable that we think around about that as like a $50 million, 5-0, increase in the next year? And then the second part of the question, you're on pace to have a 15.5% to 15.6% operating margin this year.\n If you were to take the level of promotional activity from 2019 and apply it, all else being equal, to this year, is it reasonable that you would have like a 14.5% operating margin. So a worst case, if promotions go back to 2019 levels, that would be like 100 basis points to the operating margin. \nScott Settersten: Is this the Michael Lasser that I know? I mean... \nMichael Lasser: I'm trying. \nScott Settersten: I appreciate your question, Michael. Yes, and I understand. But we can't -- we're not going to piecemeal out the bits and pieces of the variables and the formula for our EBIT margin for next year. It's just -- it's too hard, and that's why we said we would -- we'll update in March if it's appropriate, okay? And we kind of see how 2022 shakes out here in totality. And then look at our '23 plan, which we're in the heat of battle on right now, finalizing here, which the final step of that is as we get finalized through the holiday season, so to see what the numbers look like.\n So we either -- as I've laid out for Ike here a little bit earlier in the call, all the different variables and of course, they're all on wide continuums, right? And so we're doing our best to assess each one of those. And coming up with our best idea of how we think it's going to shake out for next year. Again, we're very optimistic about the long-term options for our business. I mean we're in a great position. We've got lots of levers to push and pull, to deliver healthy operating margins over the long term. \nKiley Rawlins: John, I think we have time for one more question, please. \nOperator: And the final question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. \nMichael Binetti: Congrats on the nice quarter. Maybe since you mentioned it a few times now, how much is shrink versus 2019 as a percent of sales? I'm wondering if that's becoming a meaningful number? And maybe you could just help us orient how much incentive comp influences the margin this year. I don't know if I heard that.\n And I guess, just maybe touching on Ike and Michael's question, you seem to be getting the higher margins the right way here with all the extra sales and gross profit dollars from driving the business and leveraging the fixed costs. You'll be at a revenue level this year we didn't expect to see until 2024, and you're still seeing the algo next year. I know you gave the long list to Ike in the middle of the P&L, but it feels like you earn some upside to the framework at that 13% to 14%. I'm just wondering if you can give us color on what you think relative to the framework you laid out remain structurally higher or what you think needs more investment than what you thought at the Analyst Day framework to bring all those extra dollars down to that 13% and 14%. \nScott Settersten: Yes, Michael. So working backwards. So the shrink part of your question, I mean, shrink when you think about our category, we are especially susceptible to some of the trends that you see across retail. But that's not new to us. We've been dealing with this since the very early days because of the category we operate in.\n So I want to make sure I say thank you to our teams, to our LP teams, our store operations teams and all the support personnel that have been working hard to try to mitigate the losses that we've seen step up here, accelerate over the last couple of years. Again, when times get tough, shrink goes up. We've seen that in retail over a long period of time.\n On the incentive compensation, I would say, we -- for the year, it's going to be flattish versus 2021. Again, our performance has been super strong this year. And then back to the operating margin question, which everyone has, again, we really can't provide any more quantitative detail at this point in time. I would just point back to the long laundry list of different variables that I described earlier in the call.\n And just that we're a pragmatic team. We're trying to optimize with all the things that we have, the challenges and the opportunities, we're going to do our best to lean in where we can and try to optimize and deliver the best overall financial performance that we're capable of, whether it's the fourth quarter or 2023. You can rely on us for that. \nDavid Kimbell: All right. With that, I'm going to wrap it up. And I want to first thank you. Thank you for your interest and engagement in Ulta Beauty. And I want to close by thanking our more than 40,000 Ulta Beauty associates for delivering another excellent quarter while also executing against our strategic priorities. Our teams have been working hard to get our stores, digital channels and DCs ready for this holiday season, and I sincerely appreciate their focus and commitment to delivering meaningful guest experiences across every single touch point.\n We hope you all have a happy and healthy holiday season, and we look forward to speaking to all of you again in early March when we report results for fiscal 2022 and share our plans for fiscal 2023. Have a great evening, everybody. Thanks again. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.",

            "name": "David Kimbell",
            "content": "Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. The Ulta Beauty team delivered outstanding performance this quarter with strong revenue growth driving operating margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth. We accomplished these results because the Ulta Beauty teams continue to execute at a high level, and I want to thank all of our associates for their commitment to delivering great guest experiences, ensuring operational excellence, strengthening our culture and working together as one team to move our business forward as the leader in beauty.\n For the third quarter, net sales increased 17.2% to $2.3 billion, and comp sales increased 14.6%. Operating margin increased to 15.5% of sales and diluted EPS increased 35.5% to $5.34 per share. Reflecting these results and our updated fourth quarter expectations, we have increased our outlook for the full year. Scott will share more details about our expectations later in the call.\n Our third quarter results are a testament to the resilience of the beauty category and our team's ability to drive strong guest engagement that fueled broad-based growth across our business. All major categories exceeded our expectations, and we increased our market share in Prestige Beauty versus the fiscal third quarter last year based on dollar sales according to point-of-sale data from the NPD Group.\n We delivered growth across our store and digital channels and achieved record loyalty membership of 39 million members. Additionally, we continue to see growth in spend per member across all income demographics.\n Our strategic framework, anchored by the power of our differentiated model, continues to drive our ambitions and successes as we work to expand our market leadership and drive profitable growth. This afternoon, I'll share an update on our progress against several of our strategic pillars.\n Starting with our efforts to drive disruptive growth through an expanded definition of All Things Beauty, our strategy to engage and delight beauty enthusiasts with a thoughtfully curated assortment focused on inclusivity and leading trends is delivering results. Our double-digit comp this quarter was a result of growth from our core assortment, price increases executed this year and compelling newness.\n Although pricing contributed more to our comp than last quarter, the majority of our third quarter comp was fueled by growth from our core assortment and newness. Historically, sales of new products have averaged 20% to 30% of our sales, and the overall mix of newness this year has been in line with our historical experience.\n Turning to performance by category. Skincare, fragrance and bath, haircare and makeup all delivered double-digit comp growth against the third quarter last year. From a segment perspective, we saw double-digit sales growth across both prestige and mass, with mass generally outperforming prestige. While it's hard to know with certainty if we are starting to see consumers trade down, as the only beauty retailer that offers a wide variety of price points from entry level mass to high-end luxury and everything in between, Ulta Beauty is uniquely positioned to capture any consumer shifts within price points in the beauty category.\n Turning to the performance of our core categories, starting with our fastest-growing category, skincare. Beauty enthusiasts are maintaining their skincare routines with a focus on science-backed and dermatologist-recommended products. Guests are engaging with newer brands, like Drunk Elephant, Supergoop! and Good Molecules, while new products from established brands like The Ordinary, Hero Cosmetics and La Roche-Posay also contributed to sales growth.\n To drive discovery and support guest education, this quarter, we introduced our skincare we love wall in all stores. This curated presentation highlights exciting brands and best-selling items across key categories. The fragrance and bath category delivered another impressive quarter as Gen Z guests engaged with the category, leveraging multiple fragrances to express themselves. Recently launched Ulta Beauty exclusive Billie Eilish as well as new scents from Burberry, Gucci and Victor and Ralph drove meaningful sales growth. While our monthly fragrance crush program drove engagement with established brands, including Versace and Jimmy Choo.\n In addition, the category benefited from strong guest engagement with our holiday fragrance gift sets, which were available earlier this year.\n Haircare, our second largest category, delivered solid growth, primarily driven by newness and innovation. Key category trends include hair health, damage repair and targeted treatments. Prestige brands, including [ Vie ] and Briogeo, saw strength in treatments and core assortments, while masstige brands, including Eva Nyc, Batiste and KRISTIN ESS, and professional brands such as Pureology, Redken and Kenra, continued to resonate with guests.\n Within the category, strong hair product growth was offset by softer performance in hair tools as we lapped strong performance last year.\n Finally, our largest category, makeup, delivered double-digit comp growth driven by newness and the strength of our key events, including 21 Days of Beauty and Fall Haul. Growth in foundation, concealers, blush and lip continue to lead the category. New brands like Fenty, r.e.m. beauty and N\u00b01 DE CHANEL drove sales during the quarter, while new products from a wide range of brands, including Clinique, e.l.f. and NYX also contributed to growth. In addition, the expansion of MAC, Chanel Beaute\u0301 and Bobby Brown into more stores has continued to drive prestige sales.\n Now let me give you an update on our key cross-category platforms. Conscious Beauty, Black-Owned and BIPOC brands and Wellness. With 290 certified brands, Conscious Beauty continues to resonate strongly with beauty enthusiasts, reflecting growing interest in products that are good for the world. This quarter, we certified 15 new brands, including 8 cosmetics, Morphe and DIME Beauty, and introduced the Conscious Beauty essentials kit, featuring minis for more than 15 brands, such as Dermalogica, COOLA and our own Ulta Beauty Collection.\n During the quarter, we expanded our BIPOC brand assortment with 4 new BIPOC brands: [indiscernible], BREAD BEAUTY SUPPLY, sugardoh and Undefined Beauty. As another way we look to create foundational industry change, we proudly launched our MUSE Accelerator program to support early-stage BIPOC brands as they prepare for retail readiness. Our inaugural class included 8 BIPOC founders, with innovative brands across skin care, makeup, fragrance, haircare and wellness.\n In addition to financial support, each MUSE Accelerator participant took part in an intensive 10-week training program, learning from Ulta Beauty leaders, industry subject matter experts and leading BIPOC brand owners. We are honored and excited to be a part of their journey as they build their business and expand their reach.\n Finally, we continue to increase our presence in wellness. During the quarter, we further enhanced our assortment to reflect our guest evolving needs. And in September, we expanded our offering to include intimate wellness as the sixth online-only pillar of the wellness shop.\n While wellness represents a small part of our overall business today, we believe it is a significant longer-term growth opportunity given the incrementality of the purchase and the strong emotional connection consumers have with self-care.\n Turning now to our efforts to evolve the omnichannel experience through a connected physical and digital ecosystem, all in your world. Store traffic trends accelerated this quarter and exceeded pre-pandemic levels for the first time, representing an important milestone in our COVID recovery. In addition to strong sales growth from stores, we continue to deliver growth in e-commerce, further reinforcing the incrementality of this important channel. The convenience of BOPIS for e-commerce orders continues to resonate with guests. During the quarter, BOPIS increased 18% to 23% of e-commerce sales, compared to 20% last year. Our services business accelerated and delivered another quarter of double-digit comp growth, primarily due to higher stylist retention, increased stylist productivity and increased capacity in our salons as we lap capacity constraints due to the pandemic.\n Our targeted CRM efforts to drive awareness, trial and frequency are working, delivering increases in salon appointments from both existing and new members. Additionally, our in-store back bar events continue to drive product attachment and new guest acquisition for participating brands.\n As industry leaders, we're always working to enhance guest experiences across all of our platforms. During the quarter, we introduced a new layout in about a dozen stores to showcase our categories better, improve navigation, enhance the services experience and create more opportunities for discovery. The most noticeable changes include the repositioning of skincare, an important growth category. To the front of the store. All products grew by category with delineated fixtures and visuals and a flow from prestige to masstige to mass. \n Elevated gondolas that showcase key iconic and service brands, new beauty bars that offer our brow and makeup services as well as supporting in-store events, dedicated space in the front of the store to feature brand and product launches across categories and a relocated checkout closer to the salon. We are excited to introduce this new store layout to guest. And as we've done in the past, we intend to introduce this new experience in new stores, remodels and relocations. At this time, we have no plans to retrofit existing stores.\n Stores are a critical part of our ecosystem. And while most Ulta Beauty's transactions occur in-stores, we know the guest journey often begins online. To assist guests along their journey, we offer a suite of virtual digital tools, including GLAMlab, Skin Advisor and our hairstyle tool, among others. \n The latest addition is a fragrance finder designed to help guests explore fragrances by favorite brand or ingredient, launched just in time for the holiday season. Finally, we continue to be excited about the long-term opportunity with our strategic Target partnership. This touch point enables us to connect and reconnect with members. And while the partnership isn't material yet to our overall member growth, it has contributed positively. Importantly, we are seeing members bounce back to Ulta Beauty after becoming an active member while at the Ulta Beauty at Target shop.\n Now let me give you an update on some of the steps we're taking to drive love, loyalty and emotional connection with Ulta Beauty. Recognizing the beauty is personal, we are on a multiyear journey to create stronger, more emotional connections with our guests and bring our brand purpose to life. Launched in September, our latest brand building campaign Beauty And is rooted in insights from cultural leaders and beauty enthusiasts. The creative content on owned and paid channels has driven broad improvement in top-of-mind awareness and is resonating with our guests, particularly Black and Latinx beauty enthusiasts.\n Turning to our loyalty program. Our efforts to nurture loyalty in personalized ways is driving member growth and delivering incremental value. We ended the quarter with 39 million active members, 9% higher than the third quarter last year. Overall spend per member increased driven by increased frequency and higher average ticket. While price increases are having an impact, we are encouraged to see unit growth per member. Our loyalty program is a strategic asset and an important driver of our long-term growth. We prioritize member engagement, loyalty and retention across every Ulta Beauty touch point. The growth and strength of our loyalty program starts with ensuring that our existing guests stay engaged. Nurturing our existing members through our Member Love events and life cycle marketing strategies has enabled us to maintain healthy retention rates, which have contributed to member growth and higher spend per member.\n Member reactivation remains a priority, and we are leveraging CRM tools to personalize offers and reengage members in more targeted ways. And, of course, conversion of new members also contributes to overall member growth, and we continue to acquire new members in our stores, digital platforms and through our partnership with Target.\n Shifting now to our plans and expectations for holiday. The holiday season is in full flow, and our teams are executing well. While predicting holiday shopping patterns this year is challenging, I am optimistic about the opportunity for Ulta Beauty this holiday season. Our engaging holiday messaging, one-of-a-kind assortment, with exceptional seasonal options and diverse touch points, all paired with our team's unrelenting passion for delivering great guest experiences, position us well to deliver another successful holiday season.\n Grounded and robust consumer insights, our holiday marketing strategy positions Ulta Beauty as the place for gifting, glamming and self-care this season. Our intent is to empower guests to celebrate the season however they want. And our integrated media plan for the holiday aims to build broad awareness of Ulta Beauty as a holiday destination, spark connection with key audiences, leverage our beauty expertise and drive consideration and purchase.\n Our merchandising team has built an outstanding holiday gifting assortment, whether guests want to gift others or treat themselves, we have thoughtfully curated options across every category and budget, with a balanced approach to the mix of seasonal holiday items and core items that make great gifts. We entered the holiday season with well-staffed stores and DCs, and our teams are excited, engaged and ready.\n For the first time since 2019, our store teams gathered in person to review our holiday strategies. And I know their excitement and enthusiasm for our plans will be felt in every guest interaction. And our corporate and DC teams have worked cross-functionally to ensure Ulta Beauty is positioned to deliver for our store teams and our guests.\n In closing, I am incredibly proud of our year-to-date results, and I'm excited about our holiday plans. Even as consumers continue to navigate economic headwinds, we believe the beauty category will remain resilient, and we are confident that our differentiated model and growth strategy, combined with our outstanding associates, will continue to position Ulta Beauty as the preferred beauty destination.\n And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? Great. Thanks, Steve. Yes, as I said in the remarks, our loyalty program, our membership is vital and critical to our long-term success and one that we're extremely proud of what we've built the relationship that we have with our guests. Yes, I guess, a few things that I'd call out. Naturally, our longer tenured. You get -- if you're tenured 3-plus years, we see kind of a higher level of retention, higher level of engagement that tends to grow over time. Greater percentage of our guests, the longer they're here, move into our higher levels, platinum and diamond levels. So naturally, with that tenure comes greater engagement.\n And as I mentioned, one of the drivers of our third quarter growth, 9% growth in our total membership was healthy retention and it's been a big focus for our entire team. Our loyalty team, our store teams, our digital, everybody that participates into delivering a great experience. So that's key and really job one is engaging and retaining our existing guests.\n Our newer members that we acquire in stores, online and increasingly with our partnership with Target play an important role. Their spend per member makes sense. It's on average lower, and we work hard to get them into the full Ulta Beauty experience. Often they enter into one category or one experience. They might come in store, we try to move them online. They might come in to makeup, we try to move them into skincare, get them into services. We have a full suite of activities and experiences designed to engage our new members through -- and including their what we call their sophomore year, their second year with us, which is important pivot year into long-term retention.\n So we look across all spectrum, what we're excited about now and encouraged by is we're seeing strength across all sectors, all income demographics, all geographies. We have a healthy member base. That's what's driving the 9% growth in our loyalty and of course that, in turn, played a big role in the sales performance we had in the third quarter. Yes. We're certainly watching, monitoring, tracking all competitive activity across the landscape. And as I've said before, our focus continues to really be on offense for us to really leverage what we do best, the unique differentiated model we have. Nobody does what Ulta Beauty does. So our competitive strategy is to lead and to drive our business forward. Having said that, we are watching, there are changes. When stores, competitive stores open, depending on the circumstances, the situation, we can see a relatively minor impact. Typically, over time, our business sustains and recovers any short-term impact. So we're confident.\n And again, our focus is on delivering what our experience is. What we found over time is doing that allows us to continue to find growth and deliver an experience that our guest continues to want to find at Ulta Beauty. Yes. I guess we'd say for holiday, a little early to know exactly. I mean we're right in the middle of the battle here, I guess, with our biggest weeks of the holiday period still ahead of us. And we know we've been -- I think we shared this at our last call and really any time we're talking about holiday. Holiday is a more promotional period. The November, December period is different than the other 10 months of the year because the gifting aspects, the idea that we're not just competing with beauty, we're competing with other gift categories across retail.\n The landscape, it's hard for us to judge midstream exactly. What we've been delivering is an aggressive promotional, but not wildly different than what we've done in the past. So we've seen consistency there. So far, we're really encouraged by what we're seeing, feeling like Ulta Beauty is well positioned and competing effectively, but we're also monitoring, tracking and ensuring that we close out this next, I guess, 24, 25 days with excellence as we complete the holiday and that's our focus going forward. Well, what I will say is, first on the third quarter, we saw a strong growth throughout the quarter, although October was modestly -- decelerated modestly, but still double-digit growth in each period of the quarter. As is suggested in our 6% to 8% guidance for the fourth quarter, we're anticipating deceleration from what we saw in the third quarter and really throughout the year. And we've been kind of anticipating this all year as we -- our comps are strong.\n And again, we're in a different type of period in holiday. We're not going to get into specific week-by-week replay yet. We'll -- as I said, we're right in the middle of it. We've got big weeks ahead of us. We'll obviously share, when we share our fourth quarter results, all the details. But what I will say is, again, reflected in the 6% to 8% is an anticipated healthy growth, but not to the level of what we saw in the third quarter, and we're encouraged by what we're seeing so far in the holiday period, knowing that there's a lot of ground still to cover as we complete holiday. And January is a big important period for us as well. So still a lot ahead of us, but encouraged by what we're seeing so far. And on your question about Canada and international, as you stated, we obviously stopped that early in the pandemic. Right now, we have no plans, consistent with what we shared at our Analyst Day. No plans to expand internationally at this time, although we are always looking for opportunities to find new growth potential. And so in our future at some point, that's possible, but nothing in our immediate plans for sure. Well, I'll start with saying, yes, we're really encouraged by what we saw in the third quarter. And really, we've seen this trend for the first 3 quarters, a strong growth across all categories, which is obviously a great place to be. The strength we're seeing in our business is not outweighted by one specific category. It's balanced across our portfolio. And it's because we've -- our team across both merchandising, marketing, our stores have done a great job engaging our guests in our entire assortment.\n And so we're excited and encouraged to see strength across -- double-digit growth across all key categories. Each one has unique stories, makeup driven by this increased engagement in social activities, plus strong product trends that are highlighted through social media and new product growth that a spectrum of newness that's really working. So a collection of activity that's coming together, both product newness, marketing newness and engagement opportunities. Skincare continued strength by both science-backed, clinically proven dermatologists recommended solutions. So that engagement that many people elevated through the pandemic has sustained.\n It's actually our fastest-growing category in the third quarter. Haircare, we've been driving that growth as a leader in haircare and strong trends, a healthy portfolio of newness that continues to drive great engagement. And then really all year, pleased with fragrance and bath.\n As I look in the innovation and engagement, I mentioned Gen Z being a part of that and really the whole portfolio working quite well across that important category. As we look in the fourth quarter, again, not getting in -- we won't get into any specifics right now. We're in the middle of holiday. And so there's a lot to cover. I wouldn't say there's anything jumping out uniquely for any category from a promotional standpoint. And we come in really with a focus in the fourth quarter of what we call gifting and glamming. And the gifting component is a mix of holiday-specific, but core items that serve all year long, and the team has done a nice job with a balance there.\n So we feel great about our assortment. It's -- again, we're encouraged by what we're seeing to this point in the holiday and confident that we'll be able to deliver a strong holiday across all of our categories. Yes. So just on the broader idea of newness, it's important to our business and the beauty category always. And as I mentioned in our remarks, typically 20% to 30% of sales are new items, and that's the range that we will land this year and anticipate we'll be able to continue to be in that range going forward. As I -- we did -- Scott mentioned, we had some really important new brands in 2022. But we're excited and encouraged by the outlook. This category, both big brands like some mentioned, but also new and emerging brands that take off and connect. I mentioned a couple of those like Good Molecules, among others.\n So we've got a portfolio of brands as we look forward into next year and confident about newness, both new brands and newness from our existing brands. That plays a big role. And as we work with all of them and see their pipeline, we're encouraged by what we're seeing. The trends are strong across each of the categories. And we're seeing healthy growth. And we think newness will play an important part in that going forward, knowing that we've got some of these big brands that Scott mentioned earlier to launch or to lap.\n As it relates to the mass and prestige, we did see mass growing somewhat faster than prestige. But both sides were strong and healthy. So I wouldn't say the strength in mass or the somewhat higher growth in mass as we look at it and do -- and analyze our members didn't come at the expense of prestige. It just a came because mass is strong and there's good newness brands like e.l.f., NYX, Ordinary, La Roche-Posay [indiscernible] strong newness and engagement. And so they're just capturing and growing. But prestige is doing really well, too. So I don't look at them being a little bit higher than prestige as coming at the expense of just their -- several of these brands and some of our bigger brands are hitting the mark and that's working.\n All of our analysis suggests that we have not seen clear\t signs of trade down. But I'd reinforce, if there is that, we are uniquely positioned to deliver and support our guests regardless of what choices they make from a price point. All right. With that, I'm going to wrap it up. And I want to first thank you. Thank you for your interest and engagement in Ulta Beauty. And I want to close by thanking our more than 40,000 Ulta Beauty associates for delivering another excellent quarter while also executing against our strategic priorities. Our teams have been working hard to get our stores, digital channels and DCs ready for this holiday season, and I sincerely appreciate their focus and commitment to delivering meaningful guest experiences across every single touch point.\n We hope you all have a happy and healthy holiday season, and we look forward to speaking to all of you again in early March when we report results for fiscal 2022 and share our plans for fiscal 2023. Have a great evening, everybody. Thanks again."

            "name": "Scott Settersten",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported results that were better than our initial expectations. Strong double-digit revenue growth resulted in record-setting third quarter operating margin performance. These excellent results reflect the continued focus and hard work of our store, DC and corporate teams. And I want to thank all of our Ulta Beauty associates for working together to deliver another outstanding quarter for our shareholders.\n Now to the financial results, starting with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter increased 17.2% driven by comp sales growth of 14.6% and strong new store performance. In addition, other revenue increased $20 million, primarily due to credit card income growth, higher loyalty point redemptions and an increase in royalty income from our partnership with Target.\n Breaking down the comp performance further, comp transactions for the quarter increased 10.7%, primarily driven by strong growth from in-store transactions. Average ticket increased 3.5% due to an increase in average selling price partially offset by slightly lower average units per transaction. The increase in average selling price primarily reflects the impact of retail price increases executed this year. We estimate that price increases contributed about 500 basis points to the overall comp increase. While average units per transaction was slightly lower than last year, the total number of units sold increased about 10% on a comp basis.\n During the quarter, we opened 18 new stores, relocated one store and remodeled 8 stores. For the quarter, gross margin increased 160 basis points to 41.2% of sales compared to 39.6% last year. The increase was primarily due to the leverage of store fixed costs, other revenue growth and higher merchandise margin partially offset by higher inventory shrink. Robust top line growth and benefits from our ongoing occupancy cost optimization efforts resulted in healthy leverage of store fixed costs.\n The improvement in merchandise margin was primarily due to benefits resulting from the timing of retail price changes partially offset by brand mix. As we have discussed, we have executed a number of price increases from our brand partners this year. Generally, when the new price is effective at the shelf, we are still selling the inventory purchased at the lower cost. As a result, there's a short-term benefit to cost of goods as we move through the lower cost inventory.\n As expected, our promotional activity increased from the second quarter, but the impact to margin was not meaningful compared to last year. SG&A increased 18.6% to $597.2 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 30 basis points to 25.5% compared to 25.2% last year, primarily due to increases in store payroll and benefits and corporate overhead partially offset by lower marketing expenses.\n Store payroll and benefits deleverage this quarter primarily due to increased labor hours to maintain service standards, higher average wage rates to support recruitment and retention and a timing shift of incentive compensation accruals.\n Corporate overhead expense deleveraged in the quarter, primarily reflecting investments related to our strategic priorities including Project SOAR and other IT capabilities, UB Media and Ulta Beauty at Target. These headwinds were partially offset by lower marketing expense. As we have discussed on previous calls, this year, we are offsetting the incremental marketing expense of digital campaigns we manage for our brand partners, with vendor income that is a direct reimbursement for these specific costs within total marketing expense.\n Similar to what we saw in the first half, this resulted in about 70 basis points of favorable impact to SG&A in the quarter. Operating income for the quarter increased 27.3% to $361.9 million. As a percentage of sales, operating margin increased 130 basis points to 15.5% of sales compared to 14.2% last year. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 35.5% to $5.34 per share, compared to $3.94 per share last year.\n Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total inventory increased 10.3%. In addition to the impact of 41 additional stores, the increase reflects purchases to support key brand launches and increases in inventory costs as well as ongoing efforts to maintain strong in-stock to support expected demand.\n Capital expenditures in the quarter were $83.5 million compared to $51.1 million last year. The increase was primarily related to investments in new remodeled and relocated stores, IT projects and merchandising improvements.\n Depreciation was $58.5 million compared to $65.2 million last year, primarily due to a shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense. We ended the quarter with $250.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the quarter, we repurchased 340,000 shares at a cost of $137.5 million. At the end of the third quarter, we had $1.4 billion remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization.\n Turning now to our outlook. We have raised our financial guidance for fiscal 2022 to reflect our strong third quarter performance and increased expectations for the fourth quarter. We now expect net sales for the year will be between $9.95 billion and $10 billion, with comp sales growth between 12.6% and 13.2%. This guidance reflects our expectation that fourth quarter comp growth will be between 6% and 8%, up from our previous expectation for low single-digit increase.\n Sales growth moderated in November as we lapped last year's strong performance, but we are pleased with the sales trends we saw through the Thanksgiving holiday shopping weekend, including Cyber Monday. We still have several important weeks left in the holiday season, and the operating environment continues to be dynamic. Our Q4 comp outlook, reflects both the expected resilience of the beauty category as well as potential risks from shifts in consumer spending, increased points of distribution for Prestige Beauty and higher promotional activity.\n For the year, we plan to open approximately 47 net new stores and remodel or relocate 33 stores. Our new store performance continues to be strong. But like many other major retailers, we are seeing project delays resulting from external real estate and construction issues as well as supply chain disruption for key equipment. These external factors have impacted our fiscal 2022 plans and will likely shift new stores originally planned for fiscal 2023 into 2024. We continue to expect to open about 100 stores over the next 2 years, but the timing of opening between fiscal 2023 and 2024 may shift as we navigate these external challenges.\n The operating environment is fluid, and we will provide specific targets for fiscal 2023 when we report in March. We now expect operating margins for the year will be between 15.5% and 15.6% of sales. We expect gross margin for the year will increase with leverage of fixed costs and growth in other revenue partially offset by lower merchandise margin, higher shrink and higher supply chain costs. We continue to expect SG&A expense for the year will increase between 15% and 16% or approximately flat as a percentage of sales, driven primarily by $60 million to $65 million of expenses related to our strategic priorities as well as higher wage rate growth across the enterprise, partially offset by lower marketing expense. Reflecting these assumptions, we now expect diluted earnings per share for the year will be between $22.60 and $22.90.\n One final update. We now expect to spend between $300 million and $350 million in CapEx in fiscal 2022, including approximately $160 million for supply chain and IT; $140 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures; and about $30 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be around $250 million.\n While we are not providing guidance for next year on this call, we want to share some high-level thoughts for your consideration as you model fiscal 2023. The beauty category has been stronger this year than expected. Barring a major economic event, we would expect category growth to continue in 2023, albeit at lower rates, reflecting strong consumer engagement with the category, and we remain confident we can deliver comp sales growth in fiscal 2023 within our longer-term targeted range of 3% to 5%.\n In this sales scenario, we would expect operating margin deleverage versus our fiscal 2022 guidance. In addition to inflationary pressures on wage rates and other operational expenses, we expect to increase investment spending related to our strategic priorities, reflecting timing shifts from fiscal 2022 and the planned ramp-up of key IT and supply chain investments.\n Finally, fiscal 2023 will be a 53-week year for Ulta Beauty. We are still finalizing our budget for fiscal 2023 and plan to provide specific financial guidance and update our longer-term growth targets, if appropriate, on our March earnings call.\n And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. Yes. Thanks, Ike. I think probably gets to a larger picture versus the AUR piece of your question there. So let me start it, because I know this is at the top of the list for all investors right now as we're thinking about next year. So let me start by saying we are very proud of what the Ulta Beauty team has been able to deliver over the last several years with respect to our operating margin profile overall.\n We continue to lead the beauty category, capture market share gains and deliver some of the strongest operating margins in all of retail, while also absorbing significant cost pressures driven by an e-commerce business that we doubled the size of since 2019, along with wage pressures, supply chain disruptions, fuel costs and other inflationary pressures across the business. And also continuing to make significant investments to innovate and build a healthy and vibrant business for the long term.\n Having said that, we've been very transparent with investors all year when discussing the continued beauty rebound in 2022, and that sales trends have been much stronger than what we expected back in the fall of 2021 when we provided our long-term financial outlook. And that sales performance is driving stronger-than-expected operating margins driven primarily by fixed cost leverage, price increase benefits and gross margin that are extraordinary this year and more moderate promotion levels and that the sales increases have been outpacing the inflationary cost pressures that we've seen in our business.\n So again, big picture, let me just lay out a couple of the bigger variables here as we're thinking about modeling for next year. So again, back to what we referenced in the script, we do expect we can grow sales next year in line with our longer-term 3% to 5% comp target.\n So on the top line, merchants have done an outstanding job. We feel good about the queue for newness next year. We've got some great things lined up. But we're going to be lapping over some extraordinary newness this year, right, with these leading brands in each of our key categories, Fenty in makeup, Drunk Elephant in skincare and OLAPLEX in haircare, all right?\n Price increase is another major lever. So we're kind of in uncharted territory right now, right? The percentage of our assortment where we've seen increases and the depth of those increases is something we've never experienced in all the years here at Ulta Beauty. So we're going to be cycling over some of that next year, and it's kind of yet to be seen how the consumer is going to react to that over the longer period of time.\n So elasticity and resilient, while it's been resilient so far, there's a question of how far we're able to push this without seeing some kind of impact.\n Lastly, on the top line, I'd say we're going to lean into our very powerful loyalty program, the benefits of our credit card. And of course, we're going to look to continue to see benefit from our Ulta Beauty at Target relationship next year.\n Thinking about the rest of the P&L then on the gross margin piece of it, promotion levels, we think, will likely be higher next year than they have been the last couple of years. Channel mix been kind of a benefit this year because stores, the big bounce back and traffic we've seen in stores has helped, right, some of the margin headwinds that we see from our digital business. Pricing benefits, we -- again, this gross margin benefit from the timing between price versus the inventory change has contributed meaningful benefits this year. And again, some of that will recur next year, but the question is to what significance?\n Wage pressure will continue. Fuel will probably moderate, right? We've seen that here more recently. Supply chain investments will ramp up next year. And of course, UB Media will accelerate, it will step up there. So ramp-up will contribute on the margin line, gross margin line.\n In SG&A, we got store payroll upward pressure on wages, which we expect to continue, maybe not to the same rate we've seen here this year, but certainly will continue upward. Variable cost, inflationary pressures, again, credit card fees, I mean we're seeing it in every part of our business right now. We've been able to mitigate a lot of that. And super high sales increases help camouflage that a bit as well.\n And then, of course, our strategic investments, as we mentioned in the script, we plan to ramp those up, and that's coming in 2023. So other digital investments UB Media and UB at Target as well.\n So we've got mitigating strategies in place, right? You've heard us talk about some of these over the years, and we've demonstrated the company we are able to deliver, we've delivered hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits from our EFG efforts, and we've got plenty of margin enhancement and cost optimization opportunities in front of us, and we're building out new continuous improvement capabilities, which, again, you've heard us talk about are building for the long-term cost optimization of the business.\n So I'll close it up by saying, even in what we see as a more uncertain environment, being with us here into next year, we are well positioned. We've got a strong business model. We are in a great category that's growing and we've got a very -- a business that delivers very healthy margins. And we expect to be able to grow the top line next year even off extraordinary performance in 2021 and '22. So we feel good about where we are. Yes. So I'll start. So the first part of your question, yes, it's an accounting recognition of how the debits and credits flow through the P&L, Adrienne. So there's really nothing related to the vendor choices or how we work or execute any of those kinds of things. It's just accounting convention, matching up expense with income when it's incremental expenses related to these marketing activities and then the rest of it kind of rolls through the gross margin through our inventory accounting. Is this the Michael Lasser that I know? I mean... I appreciate your question, Michael. Yes, and I understand. But we can't -- we're not going to piecemeal out the bits and pieces of the variables and the formula for our EBIT margin for next year. It's just -- it's too hard, and that's why we said we would -- we'll update in March if it's appropriate, okay? And we kind of see how 2022 shakes out here in totality. And then look at our '23 plan, which we're in the heat of battle on right now, finalizing here, which the final step of that is as we get finalized through the holiday season, so to see what the numbers look like.\n So we either -- as I've laid out for Ike here a little bit earlier in the call, all the different variables and of course, they're all on wide continuums, right? And so we're doing our best to assess each one of those. And coming up with our best idea of how we think it's going to shake out for next year. Again, we're very optimistic about the long-term options for our business. I mean we're in a great position. We've got lots of levers to push and pull, to deliver healthy operating margins over the long term. Yes, Michael. So working backwards. So the shrink part of your question, I mean, shrink when you think about our category, we are especially susceptible to some of the trends that you see across retail. But that's not new to us. We've been dealing with this since the very early days because of the category we operate in.\n So I want to make sure I say thank you to our teams, to our LP teams, our store operations teams and all the support personnel that have been working hard to try to mitigate the losses that we've seen step up here, accelerate over the last couple of years. Again, when times get tough, shrink goes up. We've seen that in retail over a long period of time.\n On the incentive compensation, I would say, we -- for the year, it's going to be flattish versus 2021. Again, our performance has been super strong this year. And then back to the operating margin question, which everyone has, again, we really can't provide any more quantitative detail at this point in time. I would just point back to the long laundry list of different variables that I described earlier in the call.\n And just that we're a pragmatic team. We're trying to optimize with all the things that we have, the challenges and the opportunities, we're going to do our best to lean in where we can and try to optimize and deliver the best overall financial performance that we're capable of, whether it's the fourth quarter or 2023. You can rely on us for that."

Now I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave? \nDavid Kimbell: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon. We appreciate your continued interest in Ulta Beauty. The Ulta Beauty team delivered outstanding performance again this quarter. For the second quarter, net sales increased 16.8% to $2.3 billion. Operating profit increased to 17% of sales and diluted EPS increased 25% to $5.70 per share.\n We continue to be very pleased with the broad-based strength of our business. For the quarter, all major categories exceeded our expectations, and we increased our market share in prestige beauty versus last year based on point-of-sale data from the NPD Group. Sales in stores and digital channels also increased -- exceeded our expectations with both channels delivering solid comp growth in the quarter. And we saw healthy sales gain from members across all income demographics.\n Consumer engagement with beauty remains strong, reflecting a deep emotional connection with the category as well as the continued importance of self-care and wellness. This healthy engagement paired with solid operational execution from our teams, fueled our results. Before we talk about the results, I want to recognize and thank our Ulta Beauty associates. Their collaborative commitment to serving our guests, caring for each other and executing our plans with absolute excellence has enabled us to continue navigating a dynamic environment and deliver outstanding results.\n The strength in our business, despite a turbulent environment reflects the power of our differentiated model and our ability to capitalize on the strength of the overall beauty category. Our unique enduring value proposition continues to drive our success and our strategic framework anchors our focus as we look forward.\n This afternoon, I want to share an update on our strategic progress. Our first strategic priority is to drive disruptive growth through an expanded definition of all things beauty. We engage into light beauty enthusiasts with a curated differentiated assortment focused on inclusivity and leading trends, and this approach continues to deliver results.\n From a category perspective, fragrance and bath, skincare, haircare and makeup all exceeded expectations, delivering double-digit comp growth against the second quarter last year. We are encouraged that the vast majority of our comparable sales growth was fueled by growth from both core and newness with a modest benefit from recently executed price increases.\n As we have discussed on previous calls, we have received a large number of price increases from our brand partners in the first half of this year. Given ongoing cost pressures facing our brand partners, we expect to receive additional increases as we move throughout the rest of the year.\n Turning to the performance of our core categories, starting with our largest category, makeup. Compared to the second quarter of 2021, both prestige and mass makeup delivered double-digit comp growth. As consumers participated in more in-person activities, traveled and increasingly used makeup as a form of self-expression. Guests continue to engage with new brands like Fenty Beauty, R.E.M. Beauty and recently launched About-Face by Halsey, while new products from established brands like Clinique, NYX, e.l.f. and ColourPop also contributed to the sales growth. In addition, the ongoing expansion of MAC and Chanel Beaut\u00e9 into more stores contributed to the strong prestige performance.\n Haircare, our second largest category, delivered another quarter of double-digit growth driven by newness and strong engagement in our semiannual Gorgeous Hair Event, a strategic event designed to acquire new guests, increase existing member spend and drive salon penetration. New brands like OLAPLEX as well as new product launches from [indiscernible] and Living Proof contributed to the category growth in the quarter and the initial launch of Dyson's latest Airwrap styling tool with new features and attachment sold out quickly.\n Guests continue to engage with core professional brands like Redken and Pureology and our salon [ Back Bird ] takeovers drove strong growth with Joico and recently launched Andrew Fitzsimons.\n Skin care was one of our best-performing categories this quarter with both prestige and mass delivering double-digit comp growth, driven by new brands and product innovation. Newness continued to appeal to guests with newer brands such as Drunk Elephant, Fresh, Supergoop! and recently launched Vacation as well as new products from Peach & Lily, OSEA and Hero cosmetics contributing to category growth during the quarter. And Skinfatuation, our monthly skincare program, which works to demystify skin care with educational content and focused themes delivered nice growth for established brands like Tula, Sun Bum, COOLA and Good Molecules.\n The fragrance category again delivered strong double-digit comp growth on top of extraordinary growth last year. Compelling newness and strong engagement with our Mother's Day and Father's Day events contributed to this performance. Recently launched Ulta Beauty exclusive Billie Eilish and Charli D'Amelio Born Dreamer as well as [indiscernible] from Gucci, YSL and Dior drove meaningful sales growth. While our monthly Fragrance Crush program drove greater engagement with established brands like Valentino and [ Armada ].\n In addition, in core category growth, we are investing in 3 cross-category platforms to increase guest engagement and expand our market share. We know consumers seek beauty brands that are good for the world and align with their values. And Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty continues to resonate with guests as it addresses these interests.\n At the end of the second quarter, 290 brands offered certified products in at least 1 Conscious Beauty pillar, including newly certified brands, Born Dreamer, About-Face, [indiscernible] and Good Light. To increase the visibility of Conscious Beauty and to make it easier for guests to identify products that align with what is important to them, this quarter we refreshed the landing page on ulta.com and added digital badging to all product pages. Now guests can quickly identify certified brands and products across our Conscious Beauty pillars, whether shopping in stores or on our digital channels.\n Moving to our efforts to expand and support our assortment of BIPOC brands, we are committed to diversifying our assortments, so all guests can see themselves reflected at Ulta Beauty. In addition to continuing to expand our portfolio of BIPOC brands and enhance our marketing support for these brands, we are focused on driving structural change within the beauty industry.\n As the leader in beauty, we believe we have a responsibility to take tangible steps to create foundational industry change through the investment of capital and resources. As such, next month, we will officially launch our MUSE Accelerator program focused on early-stage BIPOC brands. Through this program, we will provide 8 diverse leaders, founders and entrepreneurs with resources, mentorship and support to prepare them for retail readiness. I look forward to sharing more about our inaugural class on future calls.\n Finally, we continue to enhance our wellness shop to support guests as they prioritize self-care. This quarter, we expanded the shop to additional stores and now roughly 750 stores offer guests an elevated cohesive presentation of wellness products to help them easily navigate their personal journey. Today, we offer a curated omni assortment of more than 140 brands, including newly launched brands, Womeness and Olay and more than 700 SKUs to help our guests feel their best inside and out.\n Moving now to our ongoing efforts to evolve the omnichannel experience through a connected physical and digital ecosystem, all in your world. Store traffic trends were strong again this quarter as guests return to in-store shopping and services. While store traffic remained slightly below pre-pandemic levels, the trend continues to improve. Our services business delivered another quarter of double-digit comp growth, primarily due to increased capacity and new service offerings. In addition, we implemented modest price increases for core services in May.\n Notably, member engagement with services accelerated from the first quarter, reflecting our ongoing efforts to amplify our salon services and encourage first-time trial through our Member Love offers. As guests return to stores, they are also engaging in our digital channels. After lapping the tremendous digital acceleration prompted by COVID, our e-commerce channel returned to more normalized growth, delivering mid-single-digit comp growth for the quarter.\n We continue to incentivize guests to try alternative delivery options for e-commerce orders while also investing to improve the guest experience. During the quarter, BOPIS increased 32% to 25% of e-commerce sales compared to 20% last year. Importantly, we saw a significant improvement in guest satisfaction with the BOPIS experience, reflecting the engagement and focus of our store associates. While limited to 12 markets, guests are also increasing their use of our same-day delivery options, and we continue to be pleased with the AOV and profitability metrics of this fulfillment capability. Between BOPIS, same-day delivery and ship from store, more than 1/3 of our digital orders were fulfilled by stores.\n We continue to expand and enhance our guest experience across all channels. In our digital channels, our teams continue to deliver a more seamless experience through what we call our digital store of the future. This quarter, we introduced new, more engaging products on both ulta.com and our mobile app.\n We are also improving our physical store experience. Next month, we plan to introduce a new front of store presentation that will allow us to enhance our ability to support more editorial storytelling around newness, events and trends. And later this fall, we will introduce a new layout in select stores to elevate key growth categories, unify the presentation of skincare and makeup and enhance the store -- the services experience.\n Longer term, we are exploring innovative ways to connect our digital and physical stores and deliver forward-thinking guest experiences. This quarter, we officially launched Prisma Ventures, a $20 million fund focused on investing in early-stage start-ups and emerging tech entrepreneurs who will shape the future of retail and beauty.\n To date, the fund has partnered and invested in a variety of startups to enable greater personalization, including Haut.AI, Adeptmind, Revea and ReStyle. And we recently announced an investment in LUUM, a startup that provides robotic lash extensions, opening new intersections between beauty and robotics.\n Finally, we continue to enhance and expand our partnership with Target. During the second quarter, we opened 59 Ulta Beauty at Target shops, ending the quarter with 186 locations. During the quarter, we refreshed the assortment, expanding the fragrance offering, launched 2 Black-owned brands, Sunday to Sunday and Melanin Haircare and introduce newness from existing brand partners, including Benefit, Morphe and Tula.\n As we anniversary the initial launch of this innovative partnership and reflect on the progress made, we continue to be pleased with overall guest engagement and we are encouraged by the behavior of new members who enter our ecosystem through this new channel. The foundation of our partnership is strong, and we are focused on driving further loyalty conversion to unlock even greater value as we scale.\n Now let me give you an update on some of the steps we're taking to drive love, loyalty and emotional connection with Ulta Beauty. We have been on a multiyear journey to create a stronger, more emotional connection with our guests and bring our brand purpose to life. Beauty is inherently inclusive. Every individual is unique and beauty can help celebrate this uniqueness. As the leader in the category, we want to move beauty forward, making it a force for good for all and inspiring everyone to discover their own possibilities through the power of beauty.\n Building on our previous brand equity work, we are launching a new brand equity campaign, beauty and to celebrate the expansive nature of beauty and empower people to embrace their endless possibilities. The campaign will launch with content across paid, owned and earned media with unique elements that we believe will prompt new culturally relevant conversations about beauty and inspire greater inclusivity and positivity in our industry and the world. This campaign has performed extraordinarily well in consumer testing, and I'm proud of the efforts Ulta Beauty is making to change the way the world sees beauty.\n Turning to our loyalty program. We ended the quarter with 38.2 million active members in our Ultimate Rewards loyalty program, 10% above the second quarter last year. In addition to converting new members and reengaging lapsed members, we are maintaining healthy retention rates, especially among our Diamond and Platinum members. Overall spend per member increased again this quarter, driven by both increased trip frequency and higher average ticket. And our channel metrics remain steady with in-store-only members totaling 76% of members and omnichannel-only members totaling 17%.\n Over the last several years, we have expanded our CRM capabilities and developed stronger life cycle marketing strategies that will allow us to drive loyal shopping behaviors more precisely through promotional activity. Today, we are leveraging predictive decisioning to target strategic member segments with personalized communications and offers to increase frequency and drive higher lifetime value. We are seeing encouraging engagement in these offers, resulting in increases in spend per member. As promotional intensity increases in beauty and across retail, these capabilities enable us to rely less on mass market promotions and leverage more targeted and profitable offers.\n In May, we launched UB Media, our new retail media network and the response from brand partners has been tremendous. Our brand partners are excited about the opportunity to leverage the power of our exclusive first-party data to transform the way they connect with beauty enthusiasts. Our team is ramping up well, and we remain excited about the opportunity to unlock a new income stream and drive sales as we enable our brand partners to engage consumers more effectively.\n In closing, I am incredibly pleased with the strength we have seen across our business so far this year. Our operational and financial performance is a testament to the power of our values-based culture, our business model and the important role beauty plays in our customers' lives. We recognize beauty is not immune to macroeconomic challenges, but the category's deep emotional connection has historically resulted in stronger resilience compared to other discretionary categories. And as our results illustrate, we believe this is even more true today given the importance of self-care and wellness.\n As we look to the future, we know there will be challenges, particularly with the wide-ranging impact of rising inflation, both on our business and our guests. But we remain confident in the resilience of the beauty category and our ability to lead the beauty category and drive long-term profitable growth.\n And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? \nScott Settersten: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave indicated, our second quarter results were better than we expected. Strong sales growth due to several factors, including the resilience of the beauty category, stronger-than-expected sales growth from stores and the impact of new brands, drove better-than-expected performance in gross margin and SG&A leverage, resulting in an operating margin of 17%. These results reflect the hard work and commitment of our associates, and I want to thank all of our teams for staying focused on serving our guests and managing our business through this dynamic operating environment.\n Now to the financial results, starting with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter increased 16.8%, driven by 14.4% growth in comp sales, a $19 million increase in other revenue and strong new store performance. Transactions for the quarter increased 8.3%, primarily driven by growth from stores. Average ticket increased 5.6%, resulting primarily from an increase in average selling price. Average units per transaction were down slightly. The increase in average selling price primarily reflects the impact of product mix and retail price increases executed this year. We estimate that price increases contributed about 300 basis points to the overall comp.\n During the quarter, we opened 7 new stores and relocated 4 stores. For the quarter, gross margin decreased 20 basis points to 40.4% of sales compared to 40.6% last year. Although we had less total promotional activity during the quarter, overall merchandise margin was lower than last year, primarily due to the impact of brand mix and lapping benefits from favorable inventory reserve adjustments in the second quarter last year.\n Gross margin was also negatively impacted by higher inventory shrink primarily due to increased theft across the retail landscape, theft and organized retail crime are increasing, and we are seeing similar trends in our business. We are working diligently to keep our associates and guests safe and to reduce the risk of impact through investment in new fixtures, additional associate training, innovative technology solutions and increased staffing levels.\n We are also working with and supporting retail industry organizations and the Buy Safe Coalition to address opportunities at the legislative level. These gross margin headwinds were partially offset by leverage of fixed costs due to the strong top line growth and an increase in other revenue. Double-digit growth in supply chain costs persisted into the second quarter, driven by increased freight costs and higher wage rates in our distribution centers. Strong top line growth enabled us to mitigate the gross margin impact this quarter but as sales growth moderates, we continue to expect that higher supply chain costs, including fuel costs, which are expected to remain above last year, will be a larger headwind to gross margin in the second half of the year.\n SG&A increased 15.1% to $534.5 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased 30 basis points to 23.3% compared to 23.6% last year. Lower marketing expense and leverage of store payroll and benefits due to higher sales were partially offset by the leverage of corporate overhead primarily reflecting strategic investments as well as higher incentive compensation, reflecting our strong performance. Year-to-date through the second quarter, we have invested about 1/3 of our plan in support of our strategic initiatives.\n As we discussed last quarter, this year, we are offsetting the incremental marketing expense of the digital campaigns we manage for our brand partners with the vendor income that is a direct reimbursement for these specific costs within total marketing expense. Similar to the first quarter, this resulted in about 70 basis points of favorable impact to SG&A in the second quarter. Operating income increased 17.8% to $391.4 million compared to $332.3 million last year. As a percentage of sales, operating margin increased 10 basis points to 17% compared to 16.9% last year. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 25% to $5.70 per share compared to $4.56 per share last year.\n Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 15.4% to $1.67 billion compared to $1.44 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 29 additional stores, the increase reflects inventory purchases to support key brand launches and increases in inventory costs as well as ongoing efforts to maintain strong in-stocks of key items to support expected demand.\n Capital expenditures were $49.4 million for the quarter compared to $22.7 million last year. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily related to investments in new, remodeled and relocated stores, supply chain investments and merchandising improvements. Depreciation was $60.9 million compared to $69 million last year, primarily due to a shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense.\n We ended the quarter with $434.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the quarter, we repurchased 798,000 shares at a cost of $301.6 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had $1.6 billion remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization.\n Turning now to our outlook. Reflecting our second quarter performance and sales trends we've experienced so far in August, we are increasing our outlook for fiscal 2022. We now expect net sales to be between $9.65 billion and $9.75 billion, with comp sales growth between 9.5% and 10.5%. Our updated outlook reflects year-to-date trends while continuing to consider uncertainties that could impact the second half of the year, particularly during the holiday season.\n Embedded in our forecast is an expectation for mid-single-digit comp growth in the second half, reflecting the risk of potential shifts in consumer spending due to inflationary pressures, the impact of increased points of distribution for prestige beauty and the likelihood of a more promotional holiday season. We now expect operating margin for the year will be between 14.6% and 14.8% of sales. We expect operating margin will deleverage in the second half as sales growth moderates and cost pressures and planned investments have a greater impact. We expect gross margin expansion for the year with leverage of fixed costs and growth in other revenue, partially offset by lower merchandise margin, higher shrink and higher supply chain costs.\n We continue to expect SG&A expense will deleverage for the year, driven primarily by $60 million to $65 million of expenses related to our strategic priorities, as well as higher wage rate growth across the enterprise, partially offset by lower marketing expense. In addition, we expect inflationary pressure in operating expenses will continue. These assumptions result in updated full year guidance for diluted EPS growth between $20.70 and $21.20.\n One final update. We now expect to spend between $350 million and $400 million in CapEx in fiscal 2022, including approximately $195 million for supply chain and IT, $180 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, and about $20 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be around $250 million.\n In closing, we are very pleased with our performance year-to-date. While we continue to face uncertainties in the current macro environment, we are focused on delivering great guest experiences and driving sustained profitable growth. Longer term, we believe the beauty category will continue to be resilient, and we are confident that we are differentiated and proven model and growth strategy, combined with our outstanding associates will continue to position Ulta Beauty as the preferred beauty destination.\n And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: Also congrats on a really strong quarter. So I guess I start -- I want to start out with the consumer. So I was curious if you guys are seeing any behavior changes of note and whether you're seeing any side of the trade down or even resistance to price increases? And then just given some concerns out there about volatility and trends, I'm just curious if you're seeing more volatility in the business than what you've seen in the prior months. \nDavid Kimbell: Rupesh, thanks for the question. Yes, the short answer on trade down is no. We're not experiencing that or seeing that at this time, similar to what we talked about last quarter. We're seeing strong growth across all aspects of our business. As I mentioned, every category performed in double digits, strength across channels, stores, e-comm services. And as we look at income levels of our guests, we're seeing healthy growth at all income levels.\n So no real signs or signals of trade down within the marketplace yet. And again, I think that's a reflection of the importance that this category plays in our guest lives, the increasing connection that beauty has, wellness, the desire to express them -- our guests to express themselves to the world in this -- as the world reopens. So the importance of this category is demonstrating itself. And so, so far, we're not seeing it, but we're prepared as we look forward to continue to make any adjustments if and when that behavior starts to show up, as you know, within our model, we're uniquely prepared to adjust. If any of that does show up with our mass to prestige offering, all price points, all different categories. But as of now, we're seeing strong growth.\n As far as throughout the quarter, the quarter started very strong. We did see a slight moderation towards the end of June and early July as you may have seen with other retailers, but the trends picked up towards the end of the quarter, and we're pleased with what we're seeing so far this quarter. So no big concerns or down trends is across any part of our business right now. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. \nOmar Saad: So I just want to confirm, a lot of retailers are saying they thought some deceleration beginning around June. It doesn't sound like you guys are seeing that. And then also on the profitability of the business, gross margin sounds like there's a little bit of pressure there versus last year, but last year was so clean. It seems like it's still -- the promotional levels are still well below pre-COVID. Is that a sustainable phenomenon in your opinion? \nDavid Kimbell: Let me just -- I'll start with the deceleration and Scott can pick up on the gross margin and some of the things we're seeing there. So again, yes, we did -- our quarter in total was strong. We were pleased with the results throughout the quarter. There was a modest slowdown in the trends right at the end of June, early July as a number of things, both, I guess, within retail and in the world around us, we're showing up.\n But again, nothing alarming on our business. And we did see trends return to early in the quarter rates as we got to the end of July and then certainly, as I said, into this quarter. So a modest impact. But again, the category itself, the importance it plays in our guest lives, allowed us to kind of ride through any macro disruption and short-term impacts that we saw throughout the quarter. \nScott Settersten: And as far as gross margin is concerned, again, we're very happy with the results that the business is generating year-to-date. Our longer-term guidance assumes gross margin is going to moderate somewhat from what we saw last year, again, when we started out with our longer-term algorithm. And again, this year, the sales performance has just been extraordinary.\n So if you're looking at it year-over-year, I'd say product mix has something to do with the variability, UB Media mix and how we're accounting for that in the geography and the P&L has something to do with that. As we look out towards the remainder of 2022, we've been clear about we expect the promotional environment is probably going to get a little bit tougher, especially what we've seen here across the retail universe here most recently.\n So moderation as we look to the future. It's still a lot of great levers we have in the business. When we talk about Project SOAR delivering benefits over the longer term. Our continuous improvement in EFG efforts still with a lot of benefit to generate for the company over the long term.\n So I think operating margin, we feel good about opportunities to continue to leverage there, but we think gross margin will certainly moderate as we look ahead. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with the Telsey Advisory Group. \nDana Telsey: Congratulations on the nice performance. You had mentioned the services business and the improvement there. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there? What that impact could be? And last -- and then next, just on the price increases that you had put in place. Where are we in the scale of price increases by category? And how do you see it blending out for the year? \nKecia Steelman: Thanks, Dana. I'll start and then turn it over to Scott. Our salon team delivered strong quarter growth of double-digit comps during the quarter, and really what we saw with some strength in our hair coloring services. We have strength across all geographies and regions, which was great. And the sales were really fairly consistent throughout the quarter.\n What we like what we see is these partnerships with the [ Back Bird Saloon ] takeover event, as Dave was mentioning in his spoken notes that Joico, Andrew Fitzsimons [indiscernible] are examples of where you can have a salon expert and really engage with the consumer to try a new brand that they've never made tried before.\n We're also really driving trial through our personalized offers. So we're getting people to come in and try our services, which is really important. From a staffing perspective, we continue to really invest in our education, in our training for our stylists, particularly focusing on textured hair sales. And then from a pricing perspective, Dave was mentioning, that's not really playing into the comp. This is the first time that we've increased our price in the last 3 years. It was really modest. So really, it's through the growth of the core business and services that's driving that comparable off. So I'm really pleased with how the guest is refining coming out of COVID. Scott? \nScott Settersten: And price increases as far as product is concerned throughout the channels. Again, where a number of increases in the second quarter, slightly higher than what we saw in the first quarter. We estimate it's about 300 basis points to total comp for the second quarter.\n Again, the number of SKUs that have been impacted and the total all impact to our assortment is higher than we expected early in the year and we expect there to be in the back half of the year. We've already been alerted by some of our vendor partners that there's some in the queue now, and we expect there to be more as we get deeper into the year. So we'll continue to update quantitatively on how that impacts our business and how we're thinking about it maybe for 2023 when we get further down the road. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Baird. \nMark Altschwager: With respect to the recovery you're seeing in the makeup category, what are your current views on whether we're seeing with whether what we are seeing is pent-up replenishment post COVID versus perhaps the early innings of a new innovation-driven cycle that could have some legs to it? And then bigger picture, just based on the trends you're seeing in your business year-to-date and the projections for the year, calling for low teens sales growth at the high end, is the 5% to 7% 3-year CAGR still the right way to be thinking about the medium-term growth outlook? \nDavid Kimbell: Great, Mark. Yes, on makeup, yes, we're really, really pleased and encouraged with what we're seeing as I mentioned, double-digit growth across mass and prestige. And you know well. You've been following us for a while. That category has had its ups and downs and been struggling for a little bit. And so we're really pleased with the results and we think it's well rounded. There's no doubt there's some elements of maybe pent-up demand, although as we get further into the reopening, we think that's probably a smaller and smaller part of what's driving the business.\n What we do see happening is just strong innovation across  both mass and prestige, really good performance by new brands that we brought in, Fenty, R.E.M., new brand About-Face, great innovation. On the mass side with NYX and ColourPop and e.l.f. and others, but also on the prestige with Benefit, MAC, Clinique and many others. So we're seeing strong innovation that's really connecting.\n And it's being fueled by some core trends that we think are here to stay for a while that are driving engagement. And it's kind of an interesting time within makeup right now that we're seeing a combination of very bold, playful looks, kind of retro looks, euphoria type engagement driven engagement that are reminiscent of some of the things we saw back in 2016 that are encouraging. But at the same time, there's an equally strong trend around a clean look, glowy, glazed, that are driven by higher usage of foundation and highlighters, which are really important to the category and frankly, have been struggling for a little bit.\n So we are pleased with the innovation, the -- as people get out and want to express themselves to the world and there are more occasions that's driving more usage and there's some core underlying trends and innovation that are supporting the category. So we're optimistic about the path ahead, and we'll continue to be investing in our makeup business and partnering with our brands to drive this trend for the foreseeable future.\n As far as our long-term targets, no -- we're not updating or changing that. So yes, the outlook that we shared with you last fall is still on our horizon, and so I'd keep that as our long-term guidance. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank. \nKrisztina Katai: Congratulations on a very nice quarter. I just wanted to follow up on innovation, especially on the skin care and haircare side of the business, which has been really strong. Can you talk about some of the areas of the business that you are seeing this newness that is driving very strong sequential performance? How we should think about some of the product innovation and just potential launch time for any big launches that are coming up?\n And then secondly, if you could just touch on your expectations and member growth going forward. You're bringing back a lot of lab consumers, are they all back now? Is there still room there to get them back? And then maybe layer in the opportunity that you see from the target partnership? \nDavid Kimbell: Okay. There's a lot of great stuff to talk about in that. Let me just hit a few of that. First, on innovation. So yes, I talked about makeup, let's hit on skin care and haircare. And it's that kind of highlights one of the aspects of our business that we're really excited about right now is the strength we're seeing across all of our categories, double-digit growth in every category, which, again, I think is a reflection of the strength of our model and the power of beauty right now.\n Within skin care, we're seeing the strong growth that's driven by a combination of new behaviors that were strengthened or developed during COVID around skin health and skincare, new brands that we've launched that continue to drive our business, Drunk Elephant, Fresh, Supergoop!, Vacation, new innovation, great innovation across moisturizers, serums, eye creams, acne by brands like Peach & Lily, OSEA, Hero, so many others, Clinique across the entire assortment.\n The trends that we're seeing in skincare again, we think will help -- will sustain for a while. We continue to see skinification that consumers, including young Gen Z consumers seen the importance of skincare and how that lays the foundation for their overall skin health and their overall look. There is a growth in science or clinically backed or dermatological improvements. So savvy consumers are looking for these active ingredients, and that's been driving a lot of growth. And there's been a lot of innovation around just core hydration as a recognition that, that's healthy skin is driven by that. So many things coming together to drive that double-digit comp in both mass and prestige on skincare.\n Haircare, similarly strong growth we think, in strong engagement, both by newness but also the execution of our programs like Gorgeous Hair Events. We benefited from a number of new brands, including OLAPLEX. We're seeing strong innovation across a number of brands like [indiscernible] and Living Proof. I mentioned Dyson as being a key to our overall haircare and the innovation that they continue to bring. So in that area, it's hair health, much like skin health, continues to resonate and be important and take a priority. There's a growing trend around shine and the treatments and accessories that help drive that. And of course, texture has been a growing and increasingly important part of the category and Ulta Beauty's expression for the last couple of years, and that continues to be strong.\n So we're seeing strong growth, and we think innovation, consumer behaviors, the connection and the importance of these categories much like makeup will help sustain growth as we look into the future. On members, we're really pleased, 10% growth on members for the quarter, a new record high in our member performance driven by guest acquisition, reactivation, retention. Yes, we've reactivated a number of members, but there are more to get. And as high as retention is, there's always some guests that are dropping out for a number of reasons. So there's an always on activity to reactivate members, and we have quite a few a large pool to continue to activate.\n And there's quite a few beauty enthusiasts as big as we've grown, there's a huge pool of beauty enthusiasts that are not yet members of our program, and we think they should be and we're going after them. One of the ways to do that, Kecia through our target program and what we're doing, so do you want to talk a little bit about that? \nKecia Steelman: Yes, we're really pleased with how our partnership is progressing and the future opportunities that really provide our guests, brand partners Target in Ulta Beauty. We're leaning in. In fact, one of the nuances that we're introducing this next quarter is that we're creating a dedicated field team that as we scale this partnership, they're going to be really focused on training and education with an emphasis really on loyalty and unlocking that loyalty opportunity with not only our existing members, but with new members as they come into the Ulta Beauty at Target.\n So we're excited as we continue to expand and grow, and we feel Ulta Media and Target is another way to drive loyalty members into our ecosystem. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen. \nOliver Chen: Great quarter. As we think in terms of the guidance, what's embedded with respect to pricing? And how would you speak to that against the promotional needs that you'll have fourth quarter is always a very promotional time and you do a lot of great personalization to drive promotions as well?\n And a follow-up on the new layout. There can be disruption and customers don't necessarily like new layouts sometimes and your inventory needs to change. So I would love your thoughts on timing and execution risk and rationale. It sounds like it's a prudent move to focus on categories, but it comes with different risk factors. \nScott Settersten: Yes. So I'll start that one. So pricing, we said about 300 basis points of price increases reflected in our 2Q results. And all the price increases that we're aware of through our vendor partnerships are embedded in our guidance, right, for the back half of the year. So we feel like we have that framed up well.\n When we think about, again, the second quarter spectacular performance above our expectations. Our updated guidance includes, right, the beat on the second quarter and the trends we've seen so far, early stages of the third quarter.\n When I think about the top line trends, and again, back half of the year, we're going to be lapping some stronger performance last year. We've referenced the competitive environment. We expect that to be tougher as we get into the back half of the year, the promotional environment, again, you know this well, Oliver, in the fourth quarter holiday. We compete with all of retail for gift giving, right? So it's a whole totally different kind of game for a relatively short period of time. So we expect it to be more competitive, more promotional this year than it was a year ago. You've heard us talk about distribution points, additional points of distribution on prestige beauty coming as we get deeper into the year. That's another consideration.\n Then on the operating income side, we referenced the strategic initiative expenses kind of pushing back later into the year. Some of that's due to just shortages of manpower and delay sometimes in shifting some of the hardware that we need to get some of these projects finalized. So again, nothing to be overly concerned with, but there are some delays as there is in all parts of the world right now, it seems. So nothing unusual there. And then some of the costs, right, the increased cost, inflationary pressures we're seeing in the business. It's going to be heavier in the back half of the year than it was the first half of the year. So all in, we think we're in a good place, and it's reasonable -- it's a reasonable estimate of the guide and what we expect for the second half of the year. \nKecia Steelman: And for new store layouts, we're really focused on our new stores and our planned remodels going forward. While we're always making changes to improving the in-store guest experience, it's been a while since we've really made any significant changes to the store layout itself.\n Just as a point of reference, our -- today, our merchandise is organized by price point with prestige makeup and skin care in 1 side of the store and mass makeup and skin care on the other, with fragrance in the middle and haircare in the back and salon. Going forward, we really want to have a merchandise layout to magnify our differentiated assortment and really better reflect how a guest really shops with consolidated categories and intuitive adjacencies. So we're going to take mass and prestige makeup together in the front of the store with real clear brand delineation and then also reflect the growth of the category and that's important to the guests that moving skincare upfront.\n So the mass and prestige skincare are going to be all together, again with clear brand delineation. So you'll be able to tell the difference between mass and prestige, but it will be organized together the way the guest shops it. We're also going to elevate the front of the store to support more editorial storytelling and newness and events and recent trends. And then we're going to also create this new beauty bar at the center of the store that's really going to amplify the service experience and highlight the beauty attainment that is really happening on the sales floor. We're really excited to see this all come to life later yet this fall. \nOliver Chen: Great job on the BIPOC initiatives as well. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: As a follow-up question, maybe for Scott, could you talk about how your thoughts on the cadence of the back half changed? It seems like your -- you originally said low single digits for the back half, it seems like you're raising the third quarter comp, but keeping 4Q intact, 3Q gets more leverage. But at the same time, it sounds like you're adding a bit more promotion in the fourth quarter and maybe more investments potentially hitting that fourth quarter as well? \nScott Settersten: Chris, you don't need me to answer the question. You already figured it all out. So gold star for you today. So I mean, that's it in essence. I mean, again, we talk about guidance and estimates on every one of these calls, people have questions. I mean -- and we really do look at it right up to just before the call. And so what we've seen in the last couple of weeks with sales strength. Again, Dave mentioned this late July bounced back just like how it looked early parts of the quarter. And August, we've kind of continued on the same trend.\n So we're taken up the third quarter, in essence, for the strength there. And we're kind of being careful with the fourth quarter for the reasons we've already stated. We think promotional environment is going to be higher. And so just navigating that balance between the sales line and the margin investment it takes to close that. So that's exactly right. \nChristopher Horvers: Since I answered my own -- since I answered my own question maybe [indiscernible] one in here. I guess maybe can you talk about how the prestige category performed in 2Q versus '19? And was that acceleration relative to what you saw in the first quarter? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. The prestige category is up versus 2019. And so we're encouraged by that. You know that prestige has been -- we talked about this had been the laggard, prestige makeup in particular. And now we're seeing that performance come back.\n Compared to 2019, it would still be -- have the kind of the lowest, I guess, performance, incremental performance over that as these other categories have been strong, like hair care and skincare really throughout the last couple of years. But yes, we're pleased with the performance. We've been working on this for a while. As you know, the brands have continued to bring innovation and the combination of changing consumer behaviors, opening up engagement and the innovation that I talked about.\n And I think with -- specifically within Ulta Beauty, as we've -- our merchants have done just a tremendous job evolving our assortment to make sure we have the brands, the products, the innovation that allow us to gain share and lead in the category. So we're pleased with the overall performance and glad to see prestige performing at a high level. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. \nMark Astrachan: Just a brief question, I think. curious about the contribution to Ultimate Rewards members from the Target relationship at year-end. Target mentioned, I think it was about $1.5 million guest co-linking accounts from their loyalty program to yours. Are those incremental kind of any learnings that you've gotten as those folks have participated in your program as well? \nDavid Kimbell: We've mentioned in the past that there's been a large number that have linked their accounts, but we haven't shared specific details on number of new members and break out by that, and we're not planning on doing that now. But as Kecia mentioned, we're just -- we're really encouraged by what we're seeing. We're really pleased with the overall partnership. The execution has been strong. The consumer reaction has been very positive. And the engagement in Ulta Beauty has really been a positive aspect.\n So our focus going forward, as I mentioned in the remarks, is to continue to drive that loyalty. That's key to our success is to engage guests in a new way to touch Ulta Beauty and ultimately get them connected to all aspects. We're encouraged by what we're seeing, and we're focused on driving that well into the future. \nKiley Rawlins: John, I think we have time for one more question. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Kelly Crago with Citi. \nKelly Crago: I'm just curious, we did notice that you did sort of layer back in another sort of store-wide 20% off coupon promotion more recently. And I'm just trying to understand that. I know you pulled away from it during 2021 just because the business was so strong and promotions across the board are low. But I'm just curious some of the comments you're saying about back half of the year, whether or not you're sort of seeing that tick and that's a response to an uptick in promotions across beauty. So just curious any thoughts on that and if we should kind of expect that to be layered into your promotional strategy going forward?\n And then secondly, on the same line of thinking, just curious with the promotional environment in some apparel categories and some other categories out there, just wondering if in the past, you've had to sort of step up promotions even if the beauty category has been strong. Have you had to get more promotional during the holiday period in the past? Just curious on your thoughts there. \nDavid Kimbell: Great. I'm really glad you asked, Kelly. I do want to clarify, I know there's been some comments about a 20% off storewide customer base-wide. That is not -- we have not executed that. We haven't all year executed that.\n And that -- going back in history, we -- that was a trigger that we used frequently. And then pulling that out is core to our strategy of being more purposeful in how we're connecting with our guests. What you may have seen is more targeted. I mentioned how we've been -- you know we've been on this journey of investing in our personalization and our CRM capabilities. So we use a variety of offers, including 20% off but also points offers or newness offers or other broad communication to pinpoint and target subgroups within our typically smaller subgroups based on a specific behavior that we want to incentivize.\n One example might be if it's a Diamond member that hasn't shopped with us all year for several months, that guest may get a 20% off coupon, but it's only a small subset of groups. And we test and learn and we drive and we understand the profitability and return of doing that. So any 20% off has not been. There was an offer just -- if some of you saw this week that came out that was 20% off, that is a comp offer and is not storewide. It is -- we have a strategy within our mass side of the business that is -- as you know, mass tends to be a bit more promotional. So if any of you saw an offer this week that was 20% off, that was not storewide that was focused on our non-prestige side of our business, and we've been doing that particular offer for many years at this time of the year. So that's a comp event. So no incremental offers at this point.\n Now having said that to your second point about promotional intensity going forward. And holidays, Scott has mentioned this as well. We are seeing promotional intensity. That's obviously no surprise to any of you on the call, you're seeing it -- you mentioned Kelly apparel, it's happening just across retail right now. We continue to be focused. And in the second quarter, we're able to decrease our promotional intensity. We haven't layered in any big programs like I mentioned. But as we look forward, particularly going into the holiday, as Scott mentioned, the competitive set expands in gift giving to really all possible gifts, including apparel.\n So we're going to watch that. We are more promotional in the fourth quarter in the holiday historically. We -- and we see that as a strategic move to be competitive and to make sure we're delivering both on the gifting and the gaming side of our business. So we're watching that carefully. And Scott mentioned, that's kind of incorporated in our guidance going forward.\n Okay. So with that, a great question and thank you all again for your interest, and thank you for joining us today. I'll wrap up here. And I want to wrap up by again thanking the entire Ulta Beauty team for their passionate commitment to delivering on our mission, vision and values every day. Our strong performance is the direct result of our store, DC and corporate associates working together as 1 unified Ulta Beauty team to take care of our guests and to take care of each other while driving our business forward.\n So we look forward to speaking to all of you again in early December when we report our third quarter results. Thanks again for joining, and I hope you all have a great evening. \nOperator: Thank you, everyone. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Kimbell",
            "content": "Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon. We appreciate your continued interest in Ulta Beauty. The Ulta Beauty team delivered outstanding performance again this quarter. For the second quarter, net sales increased 16.8% to $2.3 billion. Operating profit increased to 17% of sales and diluted EPS increased 25% to $5.70 per share.\n We continue to be very pleased with the broad-based strength of our business. For the quarter, all major categories exceeded our expectations, and we increased our market share in prestige beauty versus last year based on point-of-sale data from the NPD Group. Sales in stores and digital channels also increased -- exceeded our expectations with both channels delivering solid comp growth in the quarter. And we saw healthy sales gain from members across all income demographics.\n Consumer engagement with beauty remains strong, reflecting a deep emotional connection with the category as well as the continued importance of self-care and wellness. This healthy engagement paired with solid operational execution from our teams, fueled our results. Before we talk about the results, I want to recognize and thank our Ulta Beauty associates. Their collaborative commitment to serving our guests, caring for each other and executing our plans with absolute excellence has enabled us to continue navigating a dynamic environment and deliver outstanding results.\n The strength in our business, despite a turbulent environment reflects the power of our differentiated model and our ability to capitalize on the strength of the overall beauty category. Our unique enduring value proposition continues to drive our success and our strategic framework anchors our focus as we look forward.\n This afternoon, I want to share an update on our strategic progress. Our first strategic priority is to drive disruptive growth through an expanded definition of all things beauty. We engage into light beauty enthusiasts with a curated differentiated assortment focused on inclusivity and leading trends, and this approach continues to deliver results.\n From a category perspective, fragrance and bath, skincare, haircare and makeup all exceeded expectations, delivering double-digit comp growth against the second quarter last year. We are encouraged that the vast majority of our comparable sales growth was fueled by growth from both core and newness with a modest benefit from recently executed price increases.\n As we have discussed on previous calls, we have received a large number of price increases from our brand partners in the first half of this year. Given ongoing cost pressures facing our brand partners, we expect to receive additional increases as we move throughout the rest of the year.\n Turning to the performance of our core categories, starting with our largest category, makeup. Compared to the second quarter of 2021, both prestige and mass makeup delivered double-digit comp growth. As consumers participated in more in-person activities, traveled and increasingly used makeup as a form of self-expression. Guests continue to engage with new brands like Fenty Beauty, R.E.M. Beauty and recently launched About-Face by Halsey, while new products from established brands like Clinique, NYX, e.l.f. and ColourPop also contributed to the sales growth. In addition, the ongoing expansion of MAC and Chanel Beaute\u0301 into more stores contributed to the strong prestige performance.\n Haircare, our second largest category, delivered another quarter of double-digit growth driven by newness and strong engagement in our semiannual Gorgeous Hair Event, a strategic event designed to acquire new guests, increase existing member spend and drive salon penetration. New brands like OLAPLEX as well as new product launches from [indiscernible] and Living Proof contributed to the category growth in the quarter and the initial launch of Dyson's latest Airwrap styling tool with new features and attachment sold out quickly.\n Guests continue to engage with core professional brands like Redken and Pureology and our salon [ Back Bird ] takeovers drove strong growth with Joico and recently launched Andrew Fitzsimons.\n Skin care was one of our best-performing categories this quarter with both prestige and mass delivering double-digit comp growth, driven by new brands and product innovation. Newness continued to appeal to guests with newer brands such as Drunk Elephant, Fresh, Supergoop! and recently launched Vacation as well as new products from Peach & Lily, OSEA and Hero cosmetics contributing to category growth during the quarter. And Skinfatuation, our monthly skincare program, which works to demystify skin care with educational content and focused themes delivered nice growth for established brands like Tula, Sun Bum, COOLA and Good Molecules.\n The fragrance category again delivered strong double-digit comp growth on top of extraordinary growth last year. Compelling newness and strong engagement with our Mother's Day and Father's Day events contributed to this performance. Recently launched Ulta Beauty exclusive Billie Eilish and Charli D'Amelio Born Dreamer as well as [indiscernible] from Gucci, YSL and Dior drove meaningful sales growth. While our monthly Fragrance Crush program drove greater engagement with established brands like Valentino and [ Armada ].\n In addition, in core category growth, we are investing in 3 cross-category platforms to increase guest engagement and expand our market share. We know consumers seek beauty brands that are good for the world and align with their values. And Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty continues to resonate with guests as it addresses these interests.\n At the end of the second quarter, 290 brands offered certified products in at least 1 Conscious Beauty pillar, including newly certified brands, Born Dreamer, About-Face, [indiscernible] and Good Light. To increase the visibility of Conscious Beauty and to make it easier for guests to identify products that align with what is important to them, this quarter we refreshed the landing page on ulta.com and added digital badging to all product pages. Now guests can quickly identify certified brands and products across our Conscious Beauty pillars, whether shopping in stores or on our digital channels.\n Moving to our efforts to expand and support our assortment of BIPOC brands, we are committed to diversifying our assortments, so all guests can see themselves reflected at Ulta Beauty. In addition to continuing to expand our portfolio of BIPOC brands and enhance our marketing support for these brands, we are focused on driving structural change within the beauty industry.\n As the leader in beauty, we believe we have a responsibility to take tangible steps to create foundational industry change through the investment of capital and resources. As such, next month, we will officially launch our MUSE Accelerator program focused on early-stage BIPOC brands. Through this program, we will provide 8 diverse leaders, founders and entrepreneurs with resources, mentorship and support to prepare them for retail readiness. I look forward to sharing more about our inaugural class on future calls.\n Finally, we continue to enhance our wellness shop to support guests as they prioritize self-care. This quarter, we expanded the shop to additional stores and now roughly 750 stores offer guests an elevated cohesive presentation of wellness products to help them easily navigate their personal journey. Today, we offer a curated omni assortment of more than 140 brands, including newly launched brands, Womeness and Olay and more than 700 SKUs to help our guests feel their best inside and out.\n Moving now to our ongoing efforts to evolve the omnichannel experience through a connected physical and digital ecosystem, all in your world. Store traffic trends were strong again this quarter as guests return to in-store shopping and services. While store traffic remained slightly below pre-pandemic levels, the trend continues to improve. Our services business delivered another quarter of double-digit comp growth, primarily due to increased capacity and new service offerings. In addition, we implemented modest price increases for core services in May.\n Notably, member engagement with services accelerated from the first quarter, reflecting our ongoing efforts to amplify our salon services and encourage first-time trial through our Member Love offers. As guests return to stores, they are also engaging in our digital channels. After lapping the tremendous digital acceleration prompted by COVID, our e-commerce channel returned to more normalized growth, delivering mid-single-digit comp growth for the quarter.\n We continue to incentivize guests to try alternative delivery options for e-commerce orders while also investing to improve the guest experience. During the quarter, BOPIS increased 32% to 25% of e-commerce sales compared to 20% last year. Importantly, we saw a significant improvement in guest satisfaction with the BOPIS experience, reflecting the engagement and focus of our store associates. While limited to 12 markets, guests are also increasing their use of our same-day delivery options, and we continue to be pleased with the AOV and profitability metrics of this fulfillment capability. Between BOPIS, same-day delivery and ship from store, more than 1/3 of our digital orders were fulfilled by stores.\n We continue to expand and enhance our guest experience across all channels. In our digital channels, our teams continue to deliver a more seamless experience through what we call our digital store of the future. This quarter, we introduced new, more engaging products on both ulta.com and our mobile app.\n We are also improving our physical store experience. Next month, we plan to introduce a new front of store presentation that will allow us to enhance our ability to support more editorial storytelling around newness, events and trends. And later this fall, we will introduce a new layout in select stores to elevate key growth categories, unify the presentation of skincare and makeup and enhance the store -- the services experience.\n Longer term, we are exploring innovative ways to connect our digital and physical stores and deliver forward-thinking guest experiences. This quarter, we officially launched Prisma Ventures, a $20 million fund focused on investing in early-stage start-ups and emerging tech entrepreneurs who will shape the future of retail and beauty.\n To date, the fund has partnered and invested in a variety of startups to enable greater personalization, including Haut.AI, Adeptmind, Revea and ReStyle. And we recently announced an investment in LUUM, a startup that provides robotic lash extensions, opening new intersections between beauty and robotics.\n Finally, we continue to enhance and expand our partnership with Target. During the second quarter, we opened 59 Ulta Beauty at Target shops, ending the quarter with 186 locations. During the quarter, we refreshed the assortment, expanding the fragrance offering, launched 2 Black-owned brands, Sunday to Sunday and Melanin Haircare and introduce newness from existing brand partners, including Benefit, Morphe and Tula.\n As we anniversary the initial launch of this innovative partnership and reflect on the progress made, we continue to be pleased with overall guest engagement and we are encouraged by the behavior of new members who enter our ecosystem through this new channel. The foundation of our partnership is strong, and we are focused on driving further loyalty conversion to unlock even greater value as we scale.\n Now let me give you an update on some of the steps we're taking to drive love, loyalty and emotional connection with Ulta Beauty. We have been on a multiyear journey to create a stronger, more emotional connection with our guests and bring our brand purpose to life. Beauty is inherently inclusive. Every individual is unique and beauty can help celebrate this uniqueness. As the leader in the category, we want to move beauty forward, making it a force for good for all and inspiring everyone to discover their own possibilities through the power of beauty.\n Building on our previous brand equity work, we are launching a new brand equity campaign, beauty and to celebrate the expansive nature of beauty and empower people to embrace their endless possibilities. The campaign will launch with content across paid, owned and earned media with unique elements that we believe will prompt new culturally relevant conversations about beauty and inspire greater inclusivity and positivity in our industry and the world. This campaign has performed extraordinarily well in consumer testing, and I'm proud of the efforts Ulta Beauty is making to change the way the world sees beauty.\n Turning to our loyalty program. We ended the quarter with 38.2 million active members in our Ultimate Rewards loyalty program, 10% above the second quarter last year. In addition to converting new members and reengaging lapsed members, we are maintaining healthy retention rates, especially among our Diamond and Platinum members. Overall spend per member increased again this quarter, driven by both increased trip frequency and higher average ticket. And our channel metrics remain steady with in-store-only members totaling 76% of members and omnichannel-only members totaling 17%.\n Over the last several years, we have expanded our CRM capabilities and developed stronger life cycle marketing strategies that will allow us to drive loyal shopping behaviors more precisely through promotional activity. Today, we are leveraging predictive decisioning to target strategic member segments with personalized communications and offers to increase frequency and drive higher lifetime value. We are seeing encouraging engagement in these offers, resulting in increases in spend per member. As promotional intensity increases in beauty and across retail, these capabilities enable us to rely less on mass market promotions and leverage more targeted and profitable offers.\n In May, we launched UB Media, our new retail media network and the response from brand partners has been tremendous. Our brand partners are excited about the opportunity to leverage the power of our exclusive first-party data to transform the way they connect with beauty enthusiasts. Our team is ramping up well, and we remain excited about the opportunity to unlock a new income stream and drive sales as we enable our brand partners to engage consumers more effectively.\n In closing, I am incredibly pleased with the strength we have seen across our business so far this year. Our operational and financial performance is a testament to the power of our values-based culture, our business model and the important role beauty plays in our customers' lives. We recognize beauty is not immune to macroeconomic challenges, but the category's deep emotional connection has historically resulted in stronger resilience compared to other discretionary categories. And as our results illustrate, we believe this is even more true today given the importance of self-care and wellness.\n As we look to the future, we know there will be challenges, particularly with the wide-ranging impact of rising inflation, both on our business and our guests. But we remain confident in the resilience of the beauty category and our ability to lead the beauty category and drive long-term profitable growth.\n And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? Rupesh, thanks for the question. Yes, the short answer on trade down is no. We're not experiencing that or seeing that at this time, similar to what we talked about last quarter. We're seeing strong growth across all aspects of our business. As I mentioned, every category performed in double digits, strength across channels, stores, e-comm services. And as we look at income levels of our guests, we're seeing healthy growth at all income levels.\n So no real signs or signals of trade down within the marketplace yet. And again, I think that's a reflection of the importance that this category plays in our guest lives, the increasing connection that beauty has, wellness, the desire to express them -- our guests to express themselves to the world in this -- as the world reopens. So the importance of this category is demonstrating itself. And so, so far, we're not seeing it, but we're prepared as we look forward to continue to make any adjustments if and when that behavior starts to show up, as you know, within our model, we're uniquely prepared to adjust. If any of that does show up with our mass to prestige offering, all price points, all different categories. But as of now, we're seeing strong growth.\n As far as throughout the quarter, the quarter started very strong. We did see a slight moderation towards the end of June and early July as you may have seen with other retailers, but the trends picked up towards the end of the quarter, and we're pleased with what we're seeing so far this quarter. So no big concerns or down trends is across any part of our business right now. Let me just -- I'll start with the deceleration and Scott can pick up on the gross margin and some of the things we're seeing there. So again, yes, we did -- our quarter in total was strong. We were pleased with the results throughout the quarter. There was a modest slowdown in the trends right at the end of June, early July as a number of things, both, I guess, within retail and in the world around us, we're showing up.\n But again, nothing alarming on our business. And we did see trends return to early in the quarter rates as we got to the end of July and then certainly, as I said, into this quarter. So a modest impact. But again, the category itself, the importance it plays in our guest lives, allowed us to kind of ride through any macro disruption and short-term impacts that we saw throughout the quarter. Great, Mark. Yes, on makeup, yes, we're really, really pleased and encouraged with what we're seeing as I mentioned, double-digit growth across mass and prestige. And you know well. You've been following us for a while. That category has had its ups and downs and been struggling for a little bit. And so we're really pleased with the results and we think it's well rounded. There's no doubt there's some elements of maybe pent-up demand, although as we get further into the reopening, we think that's probably a smaller and smaller part of what's driving the business.\n What we do see happening is just strong innovation across  both mass and prestige, really good performance by new brands that we brought in, Fenty, R.E.M., new brand About-Face, great innovation. On the mass side with NYX and ColourPop and e.l.f. and others, but also on the prestige with Benefit, MAC, Clinique and many others. So we're seeing strong innovation that's really connecting.\n And it's being fueled by some core trends that we think are here to stay for a while that are driving engagement. And it's kind of an interesting time within makeup right now that we're seeing a combination of very bold, playful looks, kind of retro looks, euphoria type engagement driven engagement that are reminiscent of some of the things we saw back in 2016 that are encouraging. But at the same time, there's an equally strong trend around a clean look, glowy, glazed, that are driven by higher usage of foundation and highlighters, which are really important to the category and frankly, have been struggling for a little bit.\n So we are pleased with the innovation, the -- as people get out and want to express themselves to the world and there are more occasions that's driving more usage and there's some core underlying trends and innovation that are supporting the category. So we're optimistic about the path ahead, and we'll continue to be investing in our makeup business and partnering with our brands to drive this trend for the foreseeable future.\n As far as our long-term targets, no -- we're not updating or changing that. So yes, the outlook that we shared with you last fall is still on our horizon, and so I'd keep that as our long-term guidance. Okay. There's a lot of great stuff to talk about in that. Let me just hit a few of that. First, on innovation. So yes, I talked about makeup, let's hit on skin care and haircare. And it's that kind of highlights one of the aspects of our business that we're really excited about right now is the strength we're seeing across all of our categories, double-digit growth in every category, which, again, I think is a reflection of the strength of our model and the power of beauty right now.\n Within skin care, we're seeing the strong growth that's driven by a combination of new behaviors that were strengthened or developed during COVID around skin health and skincare, new brands that we've launched that continue to drive our business, Drunk Elephant, Fresh, Supergoop!, Vacation, new innovation, great innovation across moisturizers, serums, eye creams, acne by brands like Peach & Lily, OSEA, Hero, so many others, Clinique across the entire assortment.\n The trends that we're seeing in skincare again, we think will help -- will sustain for a while. We continue to see skinification that consumers, including young Gen Z consumers seen the importance of skincare and how that lays the foundation for their overall skin health and their overall look. There is a growth in science or clinically backed or dermatological improvements. So savvy consumers are looking for these active ingredients, and that's been driving a lot of growth. And there's been a lot of innovation around just core hydration as a recognition that, that's healthy skin is driven by that. So many things coming together to drive that double-digit comp in both mass and prestige on skincare.\n Haircare, similarly strong growth we think, in strong engagement, both by newness but also the execution of our programs like Gorgeous Hair Events. We benefited from a number of new brands, including OLAPLEX. We're seeing strong innovation across a number of brands like [indiscernible] and Living Proof. I mentioned Dyson as being a key to our overall haircare and the innovation that they continue to bring. So in that area, it's hair health, much like skin health, continues to resonate and be important and take a priority. There's a growing trend around shine and the treatments and accessories that help drive that. And of course, texture has been a growing and increasingly important part of the category and Ulta Beauty's expression for the last couple of years, and that continues to be strong.\n So we're seeing strong growth, and we think innovation, consumer behaviors, the connection and the importance of these categories much like makeup will help sustain growth as we look into the future. On members, we're really pleased, 10% growth on members for the quarter, a new record high in our member performance driven by guest acquisition, reactivation, retention. Yes, we've reactivated a number of members, but there are more to get. And as high as retention is, there's always some guests that are dropping out for a number of reasons. So there's an always on activity to reactivate members, and we have quite a few a large pool to continue to activate.\n And there's quite a few beauty enthusiasts as big as we've grown, there's a huge pool of beauty enthusiasts that are not yet members of our program, and we think they should be and we're going after them. One of the ways to do that, Kecia through our target program and what we're doing, so do you want to talk a little bit about that? Yes. The prestige category is up versus 2019. And so we're encouraged by that. You know that prestige has been -- we talked about this had been the laggard, prestige makeup in particular. And now we're seeing that performance come back.\n Compared to 2019, it would still be -- have the kind of the lowest, I guess, performance, incremental performance over that as these other categories have been strong, like hair care and skincare really throughout the last couple of years. But yes, we're pleased with the performance. We've been working on this for a while. As you know, the brands have continued to bring innovation and the combination of changing consumer behaviors, opening up engagement and the innovation that I talked about.\n And I think with -- specifically within Ulta Beauty, as we've -- our merchants have done just a tremendous job evolving our assortment to make sure we have the brands, the products, the innovation that allow us to gain share and lead in the category. So we're pleased with the overall performance and glad to see prestige performing at a high level. We've mentioned in the past that there's been a large number that have linked their accounts, but we haven't shared specific details on number of new members and break out by that, and we're not planning on doing that now. But as Kecia mentioned, we're just -- we're really encouraged by what we're seeing. We're really pleased with the overall partnership. The execution has been strong. The consumer reaction has been very positive. And the engagement in Ulta Beauty has really been a positive aspect.\n So our focus going forward, as I mentioned in the remarks, is to continue to drive that loyalty. That's key to our success is to engage guests in a new way to touch Ulta Beauty and ultimately get them connected to all aspects. We're encouraged by what we're seeing, and we're focused on driving that well into the future. Great. I'm really glad you asked, Kelly. I do want to clarify, I know there's been some comments about a 20% off storewide customer base-wide. That is not -- we have not executed that. We haven't all year executed that.\n And that -- going back in history, we -- that was a trigger that we used frequently. And then pulling that out is core to our strategy of being more purposeful in how we're connecting with our guests. What you may have seen is more targeted. I mentioned how we've been -- you know we've been on this journey of investing in our personalization and our CRM capabilities. So we use a variety of offers, including 20% off but also points offers or newness offers or other broad communication to pinpoint and target subgroups within our typically smaller subgroups based on a specific behavior that we want to incentivize.\n One example might be if it's a Diamond member that hasn't shopped with us all year for several months, that guest may get a 20% off coupon, but it's only a small subset of groups. And we test and learn and we drive and we understand the profitability and return of doing that. So any 20% off has not been. There was an offer just -- if some of you saw this week that came out that was 20% off, that is a comp offer and is not storewide. It is -- we have a strategy within our mass side of the business that is -- as you know, mass tends to be a bit more promotional. So if any of you saw an offer this week that was 20% off, that was not storewide that was focused on our non-prestige side of our business, and we've been doing that particular offer for many years at this time of the year. So that's a comp event. So no incremental offers at this point.\n Now having said that to your second point about promotional intensity going forward. And holidays, Scott has mentioned this as well. We are seeing promotional intensity. That's obviously no surprise to any of you on the call, you're seeing it -- you mentioned Kelly apparel, it's happening just across retail right now. We continue to be focused. And in the second quarter, we're able to decrease our promotional intensity. We haven't layered in any big programs like I mentioned. But as we look forward, particularly going into the holiday, as Scott mentioned, the competitive set expands in gift giving to really all possible gifts, including apparel.\n So we're going to watch that. We are more promotional in the fourth quarter in the holiday historically. We -- and we see that as a strategic move to be competitive and to make sure we're delivering both on the gifting and the gaming side of our business. So we're watching that carefully. And Scott mentioned, that's kind of incorporated in our guidance going forward.\n Okay. So with that, a great question and thank you all again for your interest, and thank you for joining us today. I'll wrap up here. And I want to wrap up by again thanking the entire Ulta Beauty team for their passionate commitment to delivering on our mission, vision and values every day. Our strong performance is the direct result of our store, DC and corporate associates working together as 1 unified Ulta Beauty team to take care of our guests and to take care of each other while driving our business forward.\n So we look forward to speaking to all of you again in early December when we report our third quarter results. Thanks again for joining, and I hope you all have a great evening."

            "name": "Scott Settersten",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave indicated, our second quarter results were better than we expected. Strong sales growth due to several factors, including the resilience of the beauty category, stronger-than-expected sales growth from stores and the impact of new brands, drove better-than-expected performance in gross margin and SG&A leverage, resulting in an operating margin of 17%. These results reflect the hard work and commitment of our associates, and I want to thank all of our teams for staying focused on serving our guests and managing our business through this dynamic operating environment.\n Now to the financial results, starting with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter increased 16.8%, driven by 14.4% growth in comp sales, a $19 million increase in other revenue and strong new store performance. Transactions for the quarter increased 8.3%, primarily driven by growth from stores. Average ticket increased 5.6%, resulting primarily from an increase in average selling price. Average units per transaction were down slightly. The increase in average selling price primarily reflects the impact of product mix and retail price increases executed this year. We estimate that price increases contributed about 300 basis points to the overall comp.\n During the quarter, we opened 7 new stores and relocated 4 stores. For the quarter, gross margin decreased 20 basis points to 40.4% of sales compared to 40.6% last year. Although we had less total promotional activity during the quarter, overall merchandise margin was lower than last year, primarily due to the impact of brand mix and lapping benefits from favorable inventory reserve adjustments in the second quarter last year.\n Gross margin was also negatively impacted by higher inventory shrink primarily due to increased theft across the retail landscape, theft and organized retail crime are increasing, and we are seeing similar trends in our business. We are working diligently to keep our associates and guests safe and to reduce the risk of impact through investment in new fixtures, additional associate training, innovative technology solutions and increased staffing levels.\n We are also working with and supporting retail industry organizations and the Buy Safe Coalition to address opportunities at the legislative level. These gross margin headwinds were partially offset by leverage of fixed costs due to the strong top line growth and an increase in other revenue. Double-digit growth in supply chain costs persisted into the second quarter, driven by increased freight costs and higher wage rates in our distribution centers. Strong top line growth enabled us to mitigate the gross margin impact this quarter but as sales growth moderates, we continue to expect that higher supply chain costs, including fuel costs, which are expected to remain above last year, will be a larger headwind to gross margin in the second half of the year.\n SG&A increased 15.1% to $534.5 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased 30 basis points to 23.3% compared to 23.6% last year. Lower marketing expense and leverage of store payroll and benefits due to higher sales were partially offset by the leverage of corporate overhead primarily reflecting strategic investments as well as higher incentive compensation, reflecting our strong performance. Year-to-date through the second quarter, we have invested about 1/3 of our plan in support of our strategic initiatives.\n As we discussed last quarter, this year, we are offsetting the incremental marketing expense of the digital campaigns we manage for our brand partners with the vendor income that is a direct reimbursement for these specific costs within total marketing expense. Similar to the first quarter, this resulted in about 70 basis points of favorable impact to SG&A in the second quarter. Operating income increased 17.8% to $391.4 million compared to $332.3 million last year. As a percentage of sales, operating margin increased 10 basis points to 17% compared to 16.9% last year. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 25% to $5.70 per share compared to $4.56 per share last year.\n Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 15.4% to $1.67 billion compared to $1.44 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 29 additional stores, the increase reflects inventory purchases to support key brand launches and increases in inventory costs as well as ongoing efforts to maintain strong in-stocks of key items to support expected demand.\n Capital expenditures were $49.4 million for the quarter compared to $22.7 million last year. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily related to investments in new, remodeled and relocated stores, supply chain investments and merchandising improvements. Depreciation was $60.9 million compared to $69 million last year, primarily due to a shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense.\n We ended the quarter with $434.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the quarter, we repurchased 798,000 shares at a cost of $301.6 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had $1.6 billion remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization.\n Turning now to our outlook. Reflecting our second quarter performance and sales trends we've experienced so far in August, we are increasing our outlook for fiscal 2022. We now expect net sales to be between $9.65 billion and $9.75 billion, with comp sales growth between 9.5% and 10.5%. Our updated outlook reflects year-to-date trends while continuing to consider uncertainties that could impact the second half of the year, particularly during the holiday season.\n Embedded in our forecast is an expectation for mid-single-digit comp growth in the second half, reflecting the risk of potential shifts in consumer spending due to inflationary pressures, the impact of increased points of distribution for prestige beauty and the likelihood of a more promotional holiday season. We now expect operating margin for the year will be between 14.6% and 14.8% of sales. We expect operating margin will deleverage in the second half as sales growth moderates and cost pressures and planned investments have a greater impact. We expect gross margin expansion for the year with leverage of fixed costs and growth in other revenue, partially offset by lower merchandise margin, higher shrink and higher supply chain costs.\n We continue to expect SG&A expense will deleverage for the year, driven primarily by $60 million to $65 million of expenses related to our strategic priorities, as well as higher wage rate growth across the enterprise, partially offset by lower marketing expense. In addition, we expect inflationary pressure in operating expenses will continue. These assumptions result in updated full year guidance for diluted EPS growth between $20.70 and $21.20.\n One final update. We now expect to spend between $350 million and $400 million in CapEx in fiscal 2022, including approximately $195 million for supply chain and IT, $180 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, and about $20 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be around $250 million.\n In closing, we are very pleased with our performance year-to-date. While we continue to face uncertainties in the current macro environment, we are focused on delivering great guest experiences and driving sustained profitable growth. Longer term, we believe the beauty category will continue to be resilient, and we are confident that we are differentiated and proven model and growth strategy, combined with our outstanding associates will continue to position Ulta Beauty as the preferred beauty destination.\n And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. And as far as gross margin is concerned, again, we're very happy with the results that the business is generating year-to-date. Our longer-term guidance assumes gross margin is going to moderate somewhat from what we saw last year, again, when we started out with our longer-term algorithm. And again, this year, the sales performance has just been extraordinary.\n So if you're looking at it year-over-year, I'd say product mix has something to do with the variability, UB Media mix and how we're accounting for that in the geography and the P&L has something to do with that. As we look out towards the remainder of 2022, we've been clear about we expect the promotional environment is probably going to get a little bit tougher, especially what we've seen here across the retail universe here most recently.\n So moderation as we look to the future. It's still a lot of great levers we have in the business. When we talk about Project SOAR delivering benefits over the longer term. Our continuous improvement in EFG efforts still with a lot of benefit to generate for the company over the long term.\n So I think operating margin, we feel good about opportunities to continue to leverage there, but we think gross margin will certainly moderate as we look ahead. And price increases as far as product is concerned throughout the channels. Again, where a number of increases in the second quarter, slightly higher than what we saw in the first quarter. We estimate it's about 300 basis points to total comp for the second quarter.\n Again, the number of SKUs that have been impacted and the total all impact to our assortment is higher than we expected early in the year and we expect there to be in the back half of the year. We've already been alerted by some of our vendor partners that there's some in the queue now, and we expect there to be more as we get deeper into the year. So we'll continue to update quantitatively on how that impacts our business and how we're thinking about it maybe for 2023 when we get further down the road. Yes. So I'll start that one. So pricing, we said about 300 basis points of price increases reflected in our 2Q results. And all the price increases that we're aware of through our vendor partnerships are embedded in our guidance, right, for the back half of the year. So we feel like we have that framed up well.\n When we think about, again, the second quarter spectacular performance above our expectations. Our updated guidance includes, right, the beat on the second quarter and the trends we've seen so far, early stages of the third quarter.\n When I think about the top line trends, and again, back half of the year, we're going to be lapping some stronger performance last year. We've referenced the competitive environment. We expect that to be tougher as we get into the back half of the year, the promotional environment, again, you know this well, Oliver, in the fourth quarter holiday. We compete with all of retail for gift giving, right? So it's a whole totally different kind of game for a relatively short period of time. So we expect it to be more competitive, more promotional this year than it was a year ago. You've heard us talk about distribution points, additional points of distribution on prestige beauty coming as we get deeper into the year. That's another consideration.\n Then on the operating income side, we referenced the strategic initiative expenses kind of pushing back later into the year. Some of that's due to just shortages of manpower and delay sometimes in shifting some of the hardware that we need to get some of these projects finalized. So again, nothing to be overly concerned with, but there are some delays as there is in all parts of the world right now, it seems. So nothing unusual there. And then some of the costs, right, the increased cost, inflationary pressures we're seeing in the business. It's going to be heavier in the back half of the year than it was the first half of the year. So all in, we think we're in a good place, and it's reasonable -- it's a reasonable estimate of the guide and what we expect for the second half of the year. Chris, you don't need me to answer the question. You already figured it all out. So gold star for you today. So I mean, that's it in essence. I mean, again, we talk about guidance and estimates on every one of these calls, people have questions. I mean -- and we really do look at it right up to just before the call. And so what we've seen in the last couple of weeks with sales strength. Again, Dave mentioned this late July bounced back just like how it looked early parts of the quarter. And August, we've kind of continued on the same trend.\n So we're taken up the third quarter, in essence, for the strength there. And we're kind of being careful with the fourth quarter for the reasons we've already stated. We think promotional environment is going to be higher. And so just navigating that balance between the sales line and the margin investment it takes to close that. So that's exactly right."

            "content": "Thanks, Dana. I'll start and then turn it over to Scott. Our salon team delivered strong quarter growth of double-digit comps during the quarter, and really what we saw with some strength in our hair coloring services. We have strength across all geographies and regions, which was great. And the sales were really fairly consistent throughout the quarter.\n What we like what we see is these partnerships with the [ Back Bird Saloon ] takeover event, as Dave was mentioning in his spoken notes that Joico, Andrew Fitzsimons [indiscernible] are examples of where you can have a salon expert and really engage with the consumer to try a new brand that they've never made tried before.\n We're also really driving trial through our personalized offers. So we're getting people to come in and try our services, which is really important. From a staffing perspective, we continue to really invest in our education, in our training for our stylists, particularly focusing on textured hair sales. And then from a pricing perspective, Dave was mentioning, that's not really playing into the comp. This is the first time that we've increased our price in the last 3 years. It was really modest. So really, it's through the growth of the core business and services that's driving that comparable off. So I'm really pleased with how the guest is refining coming out of COVID. Scott? Yes, we're really pleased with how our partnership is progressing and the future opportunities that really provide our guests, brand partners Target in Ulta Beauty. We're leaning in. In fact, one of the nuances that we're introducing this next quarter is that we're creating a dedicated field team that as we scale this partnership, they're going to be really focused on training and education with an emphasis really on loyalty and unlocking that loyalty opportunity with not only our existing members, but with new members as they come into the Ulta Beauty at Target.\n So we're excited as we continue to expand and grow, and we feel Ulta Media and Target is another way to drive loyalty members into our ecosystem. And for new store layouts, we're really focused on our new stores and our planned remodels going forward. While we're always making changes to improving the in-store guest experience, it's been a while since we've really made any significant changes to the store layout itself.\n Just as a point of reference, our -- today, our merchandise is organized by price point with prestige makeup and skin care in 1 side of the store and mass makeup and skin care on the other, with fragrance in the middle and haircare in the back and salon. Going forward, we really want to have a merchandise layout to magnify our differentiated assortment and really better reflect how a guest really shops with consolidated categories and intuitive adjacencies. So we're going to take mass and prestige makeup together in the front of the store with real clear brand delineation and then also reflect the growth of the category and that's important to the guests that moving skincare upfront.\n So the mass and prestige skincare are going to be all together, again with clear brand delineation. So you'll be able to tell the difference between mass and prestige, but it will be organized together the way the guest shops it. We're also going to elevate the front of the store to support more editorial storytelling and newness and events and recent trends. And then we're going to also create this new beauty bar at the center of the store that's really going to amplify the service experience and highlight the beauty attainment that is really happening on the sales floor. We're really excited to see this all come to life later yet this fall."

Dave? \nDavid Kimbell: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon. Fiscal 2022 is off to an outstanding start with the Ulta Beauty team delivering another quarter of excellent performance on top of last year's record results.\n For the quarter, net sales increased 21% to $2.3 billion, comp sales increased 18%, operating profit increased to 18.7% of sales and diluted EPS increased 54% to $6.30 per share. During the quarter, all major categories exceeded our expectations, and we increased our market share in Prestige Beauty based on point-of-sale data from the NPD Group.\n We also increased the number of members in our Ultimate Rewards Loyalty Program, introduced innovative digital experiences for our guests and continued to execute major strategic projects, including investments in new stores, supply chain and technology infrastructure, all while successfully navigating supply chain challenges, a tight labor market and operating cost pressures.\n I want to express my sincere appreciation to all of our Ulta Beauty associates for their collaborative efforts to create great guest experiences, execute against our plans and deliver these outstanding results.\n Consumers continue to be highly engaged with the beauty category as they participate in more in-person activities, engage in more travel and lean into experiential spending. And while macroeconomic pressures, such as rising inflation are top of mind for consumers, their resilience and emotional connection to beauty continues to drive the recovery of the category. This consumer demand, paired with strong execution of our strategic priorities, fueled our exceptional results.\n Looking at our operational performance for the quarter, I will focus on the progress we are making with our consumer-facing priorities and then share an update on our optimization efforts. Let's start with our first strategic priority to drive disruptive growth through an expanded definition of All Things Beauty.\n From a category perspective, fragrance and bath, hair care, makeup and skin care all delivered double-digit comp growth against the first quarter last year. Importantly, sales of makeup exceeded pre-pandemic levels in both mass and prestige cosmetics. The makeup recovery is progressing faster than we expected coming into this year. Compared to the first quarter of 2021, prestige cosmetics outperformed mass cosmetics, driven by new and expanding brands and a strong 21 Days of Beauty event.\n From a trend standpoint, foundation, concealers, eyeliners, and lipstick continue to deliver strong comp growth. New brands like Fenty Beauty, r.e.m. Beauty by Ariana Grande and Tresl\u00face, a mass cosmetics brand founded by Latin Musician, Becky G, contributed to growth during the quarter. While new product launches from a wide range of brands, including Clinique, Lancome, NARS, e.l.f. and NYX also delivered strong sales growth.\n In addition, this quarter, we expanded MAC into 233 additional stores and introduced Chanel Beaut\u00e9 into 104 stores. Even as they increase makeup usage, beauty enthusiasts are maintaining their skincare routines. As a result, skin care delivered another quarter of strong double-digit sales comp on top of robust double-digit growth in the first quarter last year.\n Moisturizers, eye serums and acne treatments continue to drive category growth in the quarter. We also saw strong growth in sun protection and self-tanning that consumers increased travel and social activities. NEWNESS continued to appeal to guests with new brands, including Drunk Elephant, Fresh, Super Goop and Good Molecules, as well as new products from TULA, StriVectin and First Aid Beauty, contributing to the category growth during the quarter and established brands, including Peter Thomas Roth and La Roche-Posay continue to benefit from engaging social media content.\n Hair care delivered another quarter of double-digit growth, driven by strong guest engagement with NEWNESS and our core assortment as well as successful salon back bar takeover events. Trends focused on hair health like damage repair, color care and scalp treatments continue to resonate with guests and interest in hair styling aids increased with the rise of social occasions. New brands like OLAPLEX as well as new product launches from [ WEI ] and Briogeo, contributed to category growth in the quarter. And Dyson's Airwrap styling tool continue to be a member favorite. Guests continued to engage with core professional brands like Redken, Pureology and Biolage and our salon back bar takeovers drove strong growth for FEKKAI and IGK as our stylists engaged guests with these brands.\n Consumer strong engagement with the fragrance category continued, driving double-digit growth on top of a phenomenal results last year. Exciting newness, a strong Valentine's Day and strategic events, including 21 Days of Beauty and Spring Haul, contributed to this performance. The in-store launch of Ulta Beauty exclusive Billie Eilish as well as newness from Gucci and Carolina Herrera resonated with guests, and our monthly Fragrance Crush program drove growth for established brands like YSL and Valentino.\n In addition to driving core category growth, we are investing in key cross-category platforms to drive guest engagement and market share growth. Since launching Conscious Beauty in 2020, we have continued to expand brand participation, increase guest awareness and drive trial. At the end of the first quarter, more than 280 brands offered certified products in at least 1 pillar. And while we continue to certify existing brands and SKUs, many new brands are launching with certification in place. One such example is Andrew Fitzsimons, a hair care brand that offers proprietary bonding technology at accessible price points, which was certified across all 4 pillars when it launched in the first quarter.\n Another example is Sk*p, an Ulta Beauty exclusive hair and body care brand packaged in a fully recyclable, shower-friendly paper beauty carton, which also launched in the first quarter.\n Moving now to our efforts to continually expand and support our assortment of bipack brands, we launched 5 new bipack brands, BeautyStat, Rosen Skincare, Fenty Beauty, Tresl\u00face Beauty and Mielle Organics. We also expanded Black Girl sunscreen into all stores. To promote trial, we introduced a spotlight display in select stores to showcase our bipack founders. In recognition of Black History Month, we launched a compelling omnichannel campaign to recognize, celebrate and support the black community and black-owned brands. We feature black-owned brands in stores and across enhanced digital and print channels, and we offered compelling loyalty rewards on black-owned brand purchases to drive awareness.\n Finally, our wellness shop continues to resonate with guests as they prioritize self-care and wellness journeys. We recently expanded the shop to an additional 266 stores, now reaching about 55% of our fleet and refresh the digital landing page on ulta.com. With easy ways to explore our curated assortment and helpful tips about easy self-care routines, guests can now more readily incorporate wellness into their busy schedules.\n Turning now to our efforts to evolve the omnichannel experience through a connected physical and digital ecosystem, All In Your World. Store traffic trends were strong in the quarter as guests capitalized on their preference for in-store shopping with fewer COVID restrictions in place than last year and store capacity returned to normal levels.\n While store traffic is still below pre-pandemic levels, the trend is improving.\n As a core differentiator for Ulta Beauty, beauty services deepen engagement and loyalty through human connection. Consumers are resuming their beauty service routines as they participate in more in-person activities. In the first quarter, our beauty services delivered double-digit comp growth, primarily due to increased capacity and new offerings, including OLAPLEX Repair and PROTECT and express color by Redken.\n To meet growing guest interest and services and experiences, we continue to expand our in-store events and enhance our service offerings. In April, we relaunched makeup services in all stores, just in time to support special events such as proms, graduations and weddings. As guests are coming back to shop in stores, they are also maintaining their use of convenient engaging digital channels. Reflecting these trends, we continue to enhance our omnichannel offerings, including buy online, pickup in store and same-day delivery.\n During the quarter, BOPIS increased 26% to 21% of e-commerce sales compared to just 16% last year. While still limited, guests are increasing their use of our same-day delivery options. Based on engagement trends, we recently expanded same-day delivery to 5 new markets, including New York City. And today, about 30% of our stores offer guests this convenient option.\n During the first quarter, we continued to expand and enhance our digital experiences. As part of our Digital Store of the Future Journey, we introduced a new homepage for both ulta.com and our mobile app. We also launched 2 Virtual Try-On tools, each powered by technology developed by companies we have invested in through our digital innovation fund.\n First, we launched GLAMlab Skin Advisor 2.0, powered by global artificial intelligence startup, pot.ai. This best-in-class skin analysis technology enables us to provide guests with a more accurate skin diagnosis, which has resulted in stronger satisfaction with the tool.\n We also launched GLAMlab hairstyle try-on powered by [ RE/STYLE ], a beauty tech start-up that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to enable virtual try-on of more than 50 different hair styles, including options by gender and texture. We also introduced innovative AR and virtual reality experiences to support our launch of Fenty Beauty and r.e.m. Beauty. \n Finally, we continue to enhance and expand our partnership with Target. This leading partnership is part of our long-term strategy to build brand loyalty and engagement with Ulta Beauty. We are seeing existing ultimate reward members, take advantage of the convenience of shopping while earning points at Ulta Beauty at Target. And we are leveraging Target's strong traffic to introduce Ulta Beauty and Ultimate Rewards to new guests.\n During the first quarter, we opened 26 Ulta Beauty at Target shops, ending the quarter with 127 locations. One of our priorities in 2022 is to leverage marketing to build engagement as we scale. As an example, in support of our 21 Days of Beauty event, we co-created brand-relevant digital and in-store communications with Target to support this strategic Ulta Beauty event, which resulted in strong performance and guest engagement across both channels.\n Moving to our efforts to drive love, loyalty and emotional connection with Ulta Beauty by expanding and deepening our presence at the heart of the beauty community. During the first quarter, we continued to optimize our marketing mix to reach guests through the most relevant channels and platforms. We leveraged audience data to execute a targeted digital-first approach to 21 Days of Beauty and Spring haul driving greater awareness and increased sales. We launched content partnerships to engage new audiences and increase awareness of our cross-category platforms, and we created innovative marketing campaigns to support key brand launches.\n We ended the quarter with 37.7 million active members in our Ultimate Rewards Loyalty Program, 17% above the first quarter last year. This increase was primarily driven by continued member reactivation growth, new member acquisition and strong retention. Our strategy is to reengage lapsed members, many of whom dropped off during the pandemic are delivering results. Additionally, new member conversion remains strong in stores and online conversion rates are improving, as we increase the visibility and value of ultimate rewards throughout the guests online journey.\n I'm also excited to share that we launched UB Media, our retail media network. Through UB Media, we will harness the power of our exclusive first-party data to transform the way brands connect with beauty enthusiasts. Building on our successful digital marketing partner program, UB Media offers brand partners an enriched portfolio of advertising products and channels as well as enhanced measurements in reporting, including audience and creative insights.\n The media network offers advertising, access fee display, video, search, product listing ads, social and influencers on both open web platforms and Ulta Beauty-owned properties. In addition to unlocking a new income stream while helping brand partners build digital campaigns to effectively engage audiences, we expect to see sales benefits as campaigns lead consumers back to Ulta Beauty properties to transact.\n Underlying these customer-facing priorities is a focus on to drive operational excellence and optimization. Last fall, we shared our updated supply chain strategy, including our plan to build market fulfillment centers, or MFCs, to supplement our existing DC network capacity and provide greater speed to stores and e-commerce guests in specific markets. We recently broke ground on our first MFC in Greenville, South Carolina, and expect the facility will be fully operational in the third quarter next year.\n In addition, our planned retrofit of our full service distribution center in Greenwood, Indiana is on track to be complete in the second quarter of 2023. I am confident our infrastructure investments, including key supply chain and IT investments, will enable Ulta Beauty to continue to deliver strong results and capitalize on future growth opportunities.\n In closing, a few weeks ago, I had the privilege to welcome nearly 2,000 members of the Ulta Beauty team to our annual field leadership meeting, bringing together our general managers, district managers, field support teams and brand partners for several days of recognition, leadership development and product education. The excitement was palpable and the optimism about our future was truly inspiring. We celebrated everything we have accomplished throughout the last 2 challenging years and set the stage to deliver on the incredible opportunities ahead for Ulta Beauty. I left the event even more excited about all we can do together as 1 Ulta Beauty team to refine -- redefine how the world sees and expresses beauty.\n As we look forward, the world around us continues to be dynamic. Product prices and operating costs are rising and consumers are increasingly concerned about the impact of inflation. While it is difficult to forecast how inflation may impact consumer behavior going forward, we are monitoring guest engagement and remain encouraged by the underlying trends we see in our business and in the beauty category. I am confident our team will continue to navigate near-term pressures, and I remain excited about the long-term opportunity for Ulta Beauty to continue to deliver profitable growth.\n And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? \nScott Settersten: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to echo Dave's comments and thank our Ulta Beauty associates for delivering another outstanding quarter. Their collaborative efforts and commitment to serving our guests enabled this extraordinary performance.\n Our first quarter results were stronger than we planned. Robust top line growth due to several factors, including the continued resilience of the beauty category, stronger-than-expected store performance and the impact of new brand launches drove better-than-expected leverage in both gross margin and SG&A, resulted in record operating margin of 18.7%.\n Now let's dig into the details of our results. Starting with sales. Net sales for the quarter increased 21%, driven by 18% growth in comp sales, an increase in other revenue and strong new store performance. From a channel perspective, stores delivered strong double-digit comp growth, reflecting fewer COVID restrictions than last year, while e-commerce sales were flat, in line with our plan.\n Transactions for the quarter increased 10%, driven by double-digit growth in store transactions. Average ticket increased 7.3%, resulting primarily from an increase in average selling price. The increase in average selling price reflects the impact of product mix, retail price increases executed in the quarter and lower promotions.\n Other revenue increased $20.4 million, primarily due to growth in credit card income and higher loyalty point redemptions. The increase in credit card income was primarily due to stronger sales growth. The increase in loyalty point redemptions reflects the improving trend in store traffic and the impact of our proactive member engagement campaigns. \n During the quarter, we opened 10 new stores and relocated 6 stores. For the quarter, gross margin increased 120 basis points to 40.1% of sales compared to 38.9% last year. The increase was primarily due to leverage of fixed costs, the growth of other revenue and favorable channel mix, partially offset by lower merchandise margin. \n Robust top line growth and benefits from our occupancy cost optimization efforts resulted in meaningful leverage of store fixed costs. Despite experiencing double-digit growth in supply chain costs, primarily resulting from increases in wage rates, transportation costs and fuel surcharges, strong top line growth during the quarter enabled us to leverage supply chain costs. As sales growth moderates through the rest of the year, we expect higher supply chain costs to become more of a headwind.\n Reflecting strong sales performance of stores, channel mix was favorable this quarter. As a percentage of sales, e-commerce sales were about 400 basis points lower than the first quarter last year. Although the impact of lower promotions was favorable during the quarter, merchandise margin was lower than last year, primarily due to the impact of brand mix and lapping benefits from favorable inventory reserve adjustments last year.\n As planned, SG&A increased 12.9% to $501 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased 150 basis points to 21.4% compared to 22.9% last year. Lower marketing expenses and leverage of store payroll and benefits due to higher sales were partially offset by deleverage of corporate overhead, reflecting investments related to our strategic priorities.\n As Dave shared, we recently launched UB Media, a more sophisticated and expanded version of our digital marketing partner program. Reflecting the expected scaling of this platform, we are offsetting the incremental marketing expense of the digital campaigns we manage for our brand partners with the vendor income that is a direct reimbursement for these specific costs within total marketing expense. This resulted in about 70 basis points of favorable impact to SG&A in the quarter.\n Operating income increased 43.4% to $437.7 million compared to $305.3 million last year. As a percentage of sales, operating margin increased 290 basis points to 18.7% of sales compared to 15.8% last year. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 53.7% to $6.30 per share compared to $4.10 per share last year.\n Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 16% to $1.57 billion compared to $1.35 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 28 additional stores, the increase reflects inventory purchases to support key brand launches as well as continued efforts to maintain strong in-stock of key items to support expected demand and mitigate anticipated global supply chain disruptions.\n Capital expenditures were $71.1 million for the quarter compared to $34.6 million last year. The increase in capital expenditures reflects a more normalized investment cadence versus the last couple of years and includes investments in IT systems, merchandising improvements and store maintenance and other. Depreciation was $62.8 million compared to $70.6 million last year, primarily due to a shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense. We ended the quarter with $654.5 million in cash and cash equivalents.\n In the first quarter, we repurchased 332,000 shares at a cost of $132.8 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.87 billion remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization.\n Turning now to our outlook. Reflecting our strong first quarter performance and sales trends we've experienced so far in the second quarter, we are increasing our outlook for fiscal 2022. We now expect net sales to be between $9.35 billion and $9.55 billion with comp sales growth between 6% and 8%. Our updated outlook reflects trends year-to-date while continuing to consider uncertainties that could impact the second half of the year, including inflationary risk to consumer spending and the impact of increased points of distribution for Prestige Beauty. We anticipate comp growth will be in the low to mid-teens in the first half and then moderate to low single-digit growth in the second half. \n We now expect operating margin for the year to be between 14.1% and 14.4% of sales. We anticipate operating margin will leverage in the first half but deleverage in the second half, as sales growth moderates and cost pressures and planned investments have a greater impact.\n We continue to expect gross margin for the full year will be lower than fiscal 2021, driven primarily by lower merchandise margin resulting from the impact of brand mix, more normalized assortment management activity and a more normalized promotional environment. In addition, we believe fuel prices will continue to be volatile, resulting in higher supply chain costs than initially planned.\n We continue to expect SG&A expense will deleverage for the year, driven primarily by $70 million to $75 million of expenses related to our strategic priorities, including investments to support UB Media, Ulta Beauty at Target, Project SOAR and other IT capabilities as well as higher wage rate growth across the enterprise, partially offset by lower marketing expense and incentive compensation. \n In addition, we are seeing inflationary pressure on operating expenses like service provider fees, labor, supplies and travel, and we expect these trends to continue throughout fiscal 2022. These assumptions result in updated full year guidance for diluted EPS growth in the high single to low double-digit range. \n For modeling purposes, some expenses initially planned for Q2 are expected to shift into Q3, primarily reflecting availability of resources and equipment. As a result of these shifts and a stronger than initially planned sales trend, we now expect to deliver earnings growth in the second quarter.\n In closing, fiscal 2022 is off to a great start, but uncertainties remain. Our updated outlook reflects stronger top line performance and greater cost pressures as well as economic and global uncertainties that could adversely impact consumer spending later in the year.\n While our updated expectations for fiscal 2022 are above our longer-term targets for comp sales and operating margin, we are not changing our long-term financial targets at this time, given our limited visibility into the economic environment and expected cost pressures as we move through the rest of the year and into 2023.\n And now, I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with BMO Capital Markets. \nSimeon Siegel: Congrats on the great results. So great comp. Within the strong ticket growth, could you break out AUR from UPT? And then maybe more broadly, how you're thinking about average ticket going forward? And then just a follow-up, just given how well you guys do with that, any way to know within that 10% transaction growth, how much are the unique guest visits versus an uptick in guest visit frequency? \nScott Settersten: Yes. Simeon, thanks for the question. So even if I answer directly, the units per transaction were essentially flat year-over-year. So again, we're seeing a lot of the benefit from the continuation what I'd call a moderate promotional environment overall, coupled with the mix of brands we have that entered the assortment here over the course of the last year. So again, you know the names well. We've been talking about Fenty and OLAPLEX and some of the other big hitters here we've added recently. So again, the mix of those 2 are really doing -- making a big contribution to our gross margin here in recent quarters. \nSimeon Siegel: And then just within the transactions, frequency versus unique visits? \nScott Settersten: Yes. We don't really have anything in more detail to share with that at this point in time. Again, we are very happy to see the rebound in store traffic, right. And so a nice healthy transaction growth is always what we're striving for and planned for. And so we're super excited to see the bounce back of the consumer in the stores and making sure, again, that we deliver best-in-class specialty retail omnichannel experience. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Korinne Wolfmeyer with Piper Sandler. \nKorinne Wolfmeyer: Congrats on the quarter. So first of all, I'd like to just get your thoughts on the current inflation environment and how that's impacting consumers and maybe more so here in the early parts of Q2? Are you seeing any sort of shift in demand maybe from prestige to mass or vice versa? Or are you seeing mass be maybe more resilient than prestige or vice versa? Just any thoughts here would be helpful. \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. Great question. And yes, the inflationary environment, as we -- as both I and Scott said in the remarks, is certainly one that we're watching carefully, and we're staying close to our guests. So far, our guests are managing through it and we're not seeing huge impacts. In fact, as I mentioned in the script, Prestige makeup performed a bit higher than mass makeup. So we're seeing strong results across our portfolio. We haven't experienced meaningful trade down behavior that we can -- we could identify. And it's -- one of the unique things that we feel is core to our model is the breadth of our assortment, all price points, from mass to prestige, all categories, hair care and skin care, makeup and bath and fragrance. And so being able to adjust and adapt as consumers' needs evolve has been true to our model for a long time and allowed us to manage through any disruption in the marketplace. But right now, we're seeing strength across all aspects of our business, which we're obviously really pleased with. But we're also prepared to adjust and adapt if and when consumer behavior adjusts. \nKorinne Wolfmeyer: And then I'd just like to ask quickly on Target and the shop-in-shops in Target and how they're doing. Are you seeing any like big difference in traffic in the Target shop-in-shops versus Ulta shops? How is ticket value different between the two? And then also, are there any key brands you'd like to call out that are being particularly successful in Target versus Ulta? \nKecia Steelman: Yes, I'll take that one. What I will say is that we're really pleased with the overall partnership with Target. As Dave mentioned, we co-created from brand-relevant digital in-store campaign during our 21 Days of Beauty, and we're really pleased with that performance. I would just say that we will continue to share more as we grow more to scale right now. As of today, we've got 140 stores that are open as of today. We're on track to open 250 plus stores with them this year, but we like what we see. When we get a member engaged in our Ultimate Rewards Program, what we're seeing is that they're behaving very similar to our existing loyalty members.\n As far as brands go, Ulta Beauty works closely with the partners, with our brand partners on the assortment, et cetera, but Target really owns the sales. So we're not at liberty to comment on the sales-specific performance by brand at this time. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James. \nOlivia Tong Cheang: My first question is just around the makeup recovery and compare and contrast that to the emergence of Prestige hair care and your view in terms of the opportunity in front of you, obviously, makeup is significantly larger. The recovery accounted like, from your earlier comments, is progressing faster than you had anticipated. As you think about the second half of the year and continuing to drive acceleration, can you talk a little bit about the plans in place to keep that going? And then I have a follow-up. \nDavid Kimbell: Great. Well, thanks for the question, Olivia. Yes, makeup did recover faster than we had anticipated coming into the year. You all know that we've been working on makeup for a while. It was somewhat soft going into the pandemic and was arguably the hardest hit category of segment beauty during the pandemic. And we're -- so we're excited to see it recovering, and that's driven by an elevated overall engagement in the category in part by more opportunities to go out, more social occasions, more people going back to work in person and then just some of the things that we've been talking about, the engagement, the excitement, the enthusiasm for makeup has remained high as evidenced in social media, just the opportunities to where makeup haven't been as numerous. So we're -- as that opens up, as the world opens up, we're definitely say, more opportunity, a high level of engagement. There's new trends that are coming in to make up that we're excited about, definitely a push towards bold looks, bright, glam, glitter, people are ready to get out in the world and that's shown up in the looks.\n At the same time, some of the dynamics around a more natural look that requires makeup, same consumers are balancing both of those. We're seeing brow innovation, contouring is being discovered by younger consumers who missed it the first time around long lip wear -- long wear lip is a trend that's that started in the pandemic and is continuing. So we're excited about what we're seeing and then in the Total category. And then Ulta, through our assortment has really been performing quite well adding key brands like Fenty, r.e.m., Chanel, lots of innovation from both mass and prestige, MAC, Clinique, Lancome and NARS on the Prestige side, e.l.f. and NYX are 2 big highlights on the on the mass side. So we're getting a lot of innovation, lot of creativity, all the things that we have been working on and driving towards really came together in a nice way in the quarter.\n So as we look forward to the second half of the year, we're confident. It's hard to predict exactly how consumer behavior will go. But as more and more people are comfortable going out, more opportunities exist, more people going back to the work, coupled with the continued pipeline of strong innovation, we feel like makeup is on its way to a full recovery. And in fact, in Q1 was up over 2019 results, so pre-pandemic results for the first time in the pandemic. So excited about what we're seeing and looking to continue to drive that forward. \nOlivia Tong Cheang: And then on the gross margin, you said earlier that you're still expecting gross margin to be down. It was obviously a much better start to the year than we probably thought. But of course, costs are material as you progress through the year. But relative to your prior expectations, as you think about gross margin being down, is it the same level? And could you talk about like the puts and takes there, maybe a little bit of granularity in terms of your thought process on costs now versus mix improvement and obviously some leverage associated with an improved sales outlook? \nScott Settersten: Yes. So the great start we got in the first quarter is really kind of a background here driving some of the gross margin. So we still expect it to be down, as you said, but down less than what our initial plan was for the year. So we still have the same variables at play there. We talked about brand mix being a headwind this year. We think the promotional environment will normalize during the year. Again, we didn't see so much of that in the first quarter, but we are expecting more of that to come into play as we get deeper into the year and then supply chain costs. Again, we expected cost generally to be higher this year. We're seeing some costs, especially around fuel, higher than we expected. And we -- the back half of the year, there'll be more headwind from that piece of the equation as well. So overall, I feel like we're in a good place. And if sales stay strong and we're always focused on optimizing the business overall. So helping to deliver great results. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink with Jefferies. \nStephanie Schiller Wissink: I have a really quick question on inventory. I'm wondering if you can just talk a little bit about the complexion of the balance sheet inventory? And it feels strange to ask, but do you feel like you have enough to chase if the momentum persists in the business? And Scott, 1 question for you. This is a clarification. Could you just walk through the accounting on the UB Media? I'm not sure I tracked with you in your prepared remarks in terms of the offset to marketing fee, just talk a little bit about how those vendor agreements work, just to understand a bit how that affects the middle of the P&L? \nScott Settersten: That's 2 for me, Steph. That's not fair. Okay. So we'll go first up on the inventory. So again, it's up 16% year-over-year. We feel like we're in a good position. Again, it looks easy based on the results we're posting here, but our teams are doing an excellent job and working really hard with our vendor partners, the merchants, the inventory planning teams, the supply chain teams to make sure we get the right product in the right place. And so fill rates are good. We're feeling better. Things have kind of bounced back a little bit from what we saw mid- to late last year. So again, focused on high velocity SKUs, new brands to make sure we take advantage where we can there. We do expect that the growth rate, again, will moderate as we get further into the year this year and start anniversary-ing some of the steps we took last year to get more aggressive on inventory. So again, that's one place we always feel confident that we would make more investment if good judgment suggests that.\n And then on the accounting for the UB Media, so this one again for the accountants in the room. So last year, again, the vendor, the marketing partner program that we had in place, again, we've explained this. We've always been doing this in a smaller scale, I guess, I would say. And so historically, the accounting was all in the gross margin line by and large, okay, the vendor income piece of it. The cost -- the actual marketing cost within SG&A and all the benefits were flowing through the gross margin line kind of in line with all of our vendor money accounting so to speak. And this year, the difference is we're able to offset the incremental advertising costs in the SG&A line and the residual rolls through the gross margin line. I hope that helps. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: Just a quick one from us. Just you mentioned increasing points of sales Prestige, just how are you viewing the competitive environment in light of that? And how are you looking to further differentiate yourself as those points continue to roll out? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. We -- the beauty category is attractive and has been highly competitive for a long time. I've been here at Ulta for about 8.5 years now, and it's been hypercompetitive the whole time and for years before that. It's attractive. It's growing. It's engaging. So that's been part of the dynamic for a while. And certainly, it's true now. We're seeing new competitive locations, particularly on the prestige side, at the same time that we're opening up new stores of our own and in our partnership with Target. So there is some shift going on.\n What we're excited about and proud of is the fact that even in that environment, even in the first quarter with hundreds of new competitive locations, we continue to gain meaningful share in the Prestige category. And I think it's a reflection of the strength of our model. We have something that nobody else offers in the marketplace. The unique combination of an assortment that reflects the way consumers want to buy and shop beauty across price points, mass, prestige, across categories and then most importantly, in an experienced an environment that reflects the human connection that consumers are looking for in this highly emotional category. All of our research suggests that our experience is unique and special. What our team does every day to deliver a unique experience stands out in the marketplace, and that helps us drive our business and drive our market share.\n You add in loyalty and services and a great digital experience and add all the innovation that we continue to bring in all aspects of our business, we feel like we're doing -- we're playing offense. We're leading through what we know how to do best, which is drive engagement with beauty enthusiasts through all aspects of the beauty journey. And so we feel confident that if we continue to do that, it's going to continue to show up in our results. It's reflected in the strong results we had in the first quarter, the momentum we had coming out of fiscal '21 in our share results, in our loyalty, member growth, and we're -- that's our plan going forward. For us, we've always been focused on our strategy, executing our strategy with excellence. And when we do that, the results follow and that will be our plan going forward. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin with William Blair. \nDaniel Hofkin: Just a quick question regarding the Target partnership. I don't know if you commented specifically on this, but can you say whether it's having a measurable impact yet on your overall comp sales, obviously not at the Target stores themselves, but in the form of additional traffic to nearby Ulta stores or ulta.com and then kind of how you expect that contribution to evolve over the rest of this year and the next couple of years? \nKecia Steelman: Yes. Dan, what I would say is that any time, as Dave mentioned earlier, we have new points of distribution, there's natural cannibalization that happens. But it's not meaningful yet. We've got just about 140 stores, as I mentioned out of today that are open. We've factored this into our expectations. We do see that whenever we've opened or there's other points of distribution, including our own office Beauty stores, we do see an initial impact that, that dissipates over time, we expect a similar pattern to happen here with our Ulta Beauty and Target locations. So as we continue to roll out more stores, we'll see if that continues to hold true. But we -- what we've seen so far is that seems to be the case. \nDaniel Hofkin: And then just as you think about the, obviously, overall stellar results, any just differentiation among categories or regions or parts of the quarter that you might call out plus or minus? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. A few things that I might say. One, across categories, we're really pleased that we see strength in all of our major categories. I talked about makeup in detail already. And so that's an important improvement on our business. But at the same time, that improved. It was encouraging to see skincare deliver strong results, haircare continue through innovation and prestige, on tools to drive a lot of engagement and newness across haircare, continues to drive great results. Fragrance, which has been a shining star throughout the last 2 years continues to drive growth. I talked in the script about some of the drivers of that newness, brands, exclusive brands like Billie Eilish as well as innovation on our existing brands, that driving strong growth, sun care, expansion into wellness and driving incremental growth.\n So category performance was healthy across the board. Channel performance, again, strong results in both driven by our stores and traffic and engagement and the desire to get back and shopping in person, but to have our e-commerce business essentially flat after all the growth we've seen in that business over the last couple of years was in line with our expectation and salon coming back very strong. So our channels are performing well. Through the quarter itself, the first period, the first month or so of the quarter was the strongest as we kind of came out of the gates and then started lapping stimulus. But the other 2 months of the quarter were strong as well and well ahead of our expectations. So around a well-rounded delivery of results with all aspects of our business contributing to the performance that we have. \nDaniel Hofkin: And then anything you would call out either regionally or in terms of customer demographic differences? \nDavid Kimbell: No region. I mean 1 of the things that we really like about our model is our model works in all different types of geographies. Big cities from New York and L.A. to Chicago to smaller remote single-store markets, suburbs, urban, rural, and we saw strong performance across the board. So there was no real region or marketplace distinctions of note. And that to us is a reflection, this is working really well. And then when we look across economic, we saw growth across all income levels as well as we look at our consumer base. So strong growth from our highest income to more moderate income. So -- again, well-rounded growth. Consumers are engaged in the category. The category itself is, we think, more relevant, more important to our consumers, more connected to their overall sense of self-care and well-being. At the same time, there are so many more occasions to go out. We think the category is in great shape, and we're proud to be leading the category and driving these results through our strong execution. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Understanding you're looking to be conservative and mindful of the uncertain macro environment, you get to low single-digit comps in the back half. Again given the strength in the cosmetics category, it would imply that haircare and skincare probably turn negative, why would that be the case? \nScott Settersten: Yes. I guess I would just chalk it up like we indicated, Michael, being prudent all things considered, looking at the world and all the uncertainty and all the warning signs that seem to be flashing a bit right now. So again, there's no -- we took the benefit of what we've seen strong performance so far in the first half of the year, bake that into our full year outlook and didn't really modify the second half of the year based on what our initial plan was for 2022. And so you take that and then you adjust for some of the expense pressures that we're seeing across the business right now, and that's where we think is an appropriate place to land it for the time being. And then we'll continue to modify as we work our way through the rest of the year. \nMichael Lasser: My follow-up question is you're still -- you haven't seen it, but you're still expecting promotions to come back. What is going to be the catalyst to spark an increasing in promotions? And how much have you factored in for that rise in promotions in the back half of the year? \nDavid Kimbell: Well, we won't get specific on any like -- specific elements of what we factored in. What I'd say about promotion is the environment is dynamic, as we talked about, highly competitive, and there's uncertainty ahead from consumer behavior. We -- what we know is we've been able to continue to manage our promotions in a smart, strategic way. We've been on a journey for a while to reduce nonstrategic broad-scale discounts and promotions to focus our efforts on personalization, CRM-enabled, highly relevant, strategic efforts that drive not just short-term but long-term results through higher engagement, higher loyalty, higher connection to Ulta Beauty over time. And that's what we are able to do in the first quarter.\n But as we've said probably through many of these calls, we're well aware that this is a competitive environment. We've got lots of outstanding competitors that are also looking at ways to drive their business. We will not lose share. We'll respond appropriately. We have more tools than we've ever had through our personalization and CRM capabilities to ensure that we are leading the market. But with uncertainty around inflation, consumer behavior, competitive environment, we are prepared to react. We're not going to lead promotional intensity, but we're also going to make sure that we're appropriately engaging with our beauty enthusiasts to drive them to Ulta Beauty. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: I'm going to ask my question and follow-up. So Kiley -- coming back to the next call. My first question is on the merch margin. Given that haircare seems to be mixing up, shouldn't that have been a positive? And then when Scott, when you made the comment X reserve adjustments, does that mean the merch margin X reserve adjustments could have been up year-over-year? You're using that against the compare? And then the follow-up is what is just changing in the back half? It sounds like you're keeping sales the way you modeled it, if I'm interpreting it right, but what if anything else changed? \nScott Settersten: That sounds like 3 questions, Simeon, actually. But I'll give it out 3 here. So yes, haircare has been a real contributor here recently. Again, it kind of gets back to the brand mix overall for the business, I would say. So while haircare, generally speaking, is higher margin than the house, some of the mix that's been added here recently, doesn't necessarily follow the same metrics overall.\n When we're talking about inventory, so it was favorable adjustments last year that was driving the tougher compare this year. So again, last year, cleaner inventories, we were coming off what I'd call some housekeeping, probably late in 2020, right? We closed some stores. We exited some brands later in the year. So we got some book benefit from that last year, which makes it a tougher compare.\n As far as the guidance overall, what changed, again, the strong sales, the strong start. Obviously, it's helping drive a lot of fixed cost leverage here for the year. For the revenue, it was something that was unexpected, really wasn't in the plan to see those redemptions come back in our loyalty program that way and to see the credit card benefit pop here in the first quarter. So again, we're planning for more of that to continue throughout the year. We've got operating costs that are increasing across the business, specifically in supply chain, but we're seeing in other areas, too, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks. So that's been feathered in as we think about the second half of the year.\n So again, we feel like we're in a good position. We feel like we've got all the variables covered. Again, we think it's prudent to take a more thoughtful, careful approach and outlook as we're looking ahead to the second half of the year, considering all the uncertainties that are kind of floating out there right now. \nKiley Rawlins: John, I think we'll take 1 more question, please. \nOperator: Okay. And our final question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. \nMichael Binetti: Congrats on a great quarter, and thanks for all the detail here. A lot of our questions have been answered. But on the -- I guess as we think about SG&A versus gross margin, on the SG&A, if we look at it on a per store basis or some kind of leveling metric like that, it looks like it was up about 12% versus 2019. Comps up in the mid-20s. I just wonder if there's more noise in the SG&A line in 1Q than I appreciate it. I know you mentioned, Scott, that a few expenses move out of 2Q into 3Q, is there any onetime items to think about in 1Q that led to some underspend in SG&A?\n And I guess the follow-up is, if I look at some normal SG&A seasonality back pre-COVID it suggests gross profit margin could be down as much as a couple of hundred basis points in the guidance that you gave in 2Q through 4Q, is that the right magnitude of the puts and takes that you laid out for us earlier? Or would you direct me to... \nScott Settersten: So on the SG&A, there's really nothing. There's no onetime extraordinary items floating around in there. I would call, go back and look at our comments around the marketing expense and how that is being treated year-over-year because that is a rather significant change. Again, that comes from the UB Media change going from what I'd call a small scale kind of operation to a more formalized and larger scale process overall. So we did change the accounting there year-over-year, and that is providing a pretty significant benefit in the first quarter versus a year ago and that's going to continue for the rest of the year, obviously, that comparison.\n Then when we're talking about gross margin and some of the variability that you called out there in the second half, again, we think it's still in the same range that we guided to early in the year. Again, we -- I would point back to changing an expectation. So again, first quarter promotional environment was moderate to slightly better than what we saw a year ago, which was not our plan for the year, and we expect that to get more aggressive in the back half of the year. So that's baked in there, along with the brand mix. So again, brand mix kind of worked to our benefit in the first quarter. We think some of that will moderate as we get further into the year as well. \nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would now like to turn the call back over to Dave Kimbell for any closing remarks. \nDavid Kimbell: Okay. Great. Well, thank you all for joining us today. The year is off to a great start, and I want to thank the entire Ulta Beauty team for their collective efforts to support our guests and each other while moving our business forward. We look forward to speaking to you all again at the end of August when we report our second quarter results. I hope you all have a great evening. Thanks, again. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Kimbell",
            "content": "Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon. Fiscal 2022 is off to an outstanding start with the Ulta Beauty team delivering another quarter of excellent performance on top of last year's record results.\n For the quarter, net sales increased 21% to $2.3 billion, comp sales increased 18%, operating profit increased to 18.7% of sales and diluted EPS increased 54% to $6.30 per share. During the quarter, all major categories exceeded our expectations, and we increased our market share in Prestige Beauty based on point-of-sale data from the NPD Group.\n We also increased the number of members in our Ultimate Rewards Loyalty Program, introduced innovative digital experiences for our guests and continued to execute major strategic projects, including investments in new stores, supply chain and technology infrastructure, all while successfully navigating supply chain challenges, a tight labor market and operating cost pressures.\n I want to express my sincere appreciation to all of our Ulta Beauty associates for their collaborative efforts to create great guest experiences, execute against our plans and deliver these outstanding results.\n Consumers continue to be highly engaged with the beauty category as they participate in more in-person activities, engage in more travel and lean into experiential spending. And while macroeconomic pressures, such as rising inflation are top of mind for consumers, their resilience and emotional connection to beauty continues to drive the recovery of the category. This consumer demand, paired with strong execution of our strategic priorities, fueled our exceptional results.\n Looking at our operational performance for the quarter, I will focus on the progress we are making with our consumer-facing priorities and then share an update on our optimization efforts. Let's start with our first strategic priority to drive disruptive growth through an expanded definition of All Things Beauty.\n From a category perspective, fragrance and bath, hair care, makeup and skin care all delivered double-digit comp growth against the first quarter last year. Importantly, sales of makeup exceeded pre-pandemic levels in both mass and prestige cosmetics. The makeup recovery is progressing faster than we expected coming into this year. Compared to the first quarter of 2021, prestige cosmetics outperformed mass cosmetics, driven by new and expanding brands and a strong 21 Days of Beauty event.\n From a trend standpoint, foundation, concealers, eyeliners, and lipstick continue to deliver strong comp growth. New brands like Fenty Beauty, r.e.m. Beauty by Ariana Grande and Treslu\u0301ce, a mass cosmetics brand founded by Latin Musician, Becky G, contributed to growth during the quarter. While new product launches from a wide range of brands, including Clinique, Lancome, NARS, e.l.f. and NYX also delivered strong sales growth.\n In addition, this quarter, we expanded MAC into 233 additional stores and introduced Chanel Beaute\u0301 into 104 stores. Even as they increase makeup usage, beauty enthusiasts are maintaining their skincare routines. As a result, skin care delivered another quarter of strong double-digit sales comp on top of robust double-digit growth in the first quarter last year.\n Moisturizers, eye serums and acne treatments continue to drive category growth in the quarter. We also saw strong growth in sun protection and self-tanning that consumers increased travel and social activities. NEWNESS continued to appeal to guests with new brands, including Drunk Elephant, Fresh, Super Goop and Good Molecules, as well as new products from TULA, StriVectin and First Aid Beauty, contributing to the category growth during the quarter and established brands, including Peter Thomas Roth and La Roche-Posay continue to benefit from engaging social media content.\n Hair care delivered another quarter of double-digit growth, driven by strong guest engagement with NEWNESS and our core assortment as well as successful salon back bar takeover events. Trends focused on hair health like damage repair, color care and scalp treatments continue to resonate with guests and interest in hair styling aids increased with the rise of social occasions. New brands like OLAPLEX as well as new product launches from [ WEI ] and Briogeo, contributed to category growth in the quarter. And Dyson's Airwrap styling tool continue to be a member favorite. Guests continued to engage with core professional brands like Redken, Pureology and Biolage and our salon back bar takeovers drove strong growth for FEKKAI and IGK as our stylists engaged guests with these brands.\n Consumer strong engagement with the fragrance category continued, driving double-digit growth on top of a phenomenal results last year. Exciting newness, a strong Valentine's Day and strategic events, including 21 Days of Beauty and Spring Haul, contributed to this performance. The in-store launch of Ulta Beauty exclusive Billie Eilish as well as newness from Gucci and Carolina Herrera resonated with guests, and our monthly Fragrance Crush program drove growth for established brands like YSL and Valentino.\n In addition to driving core category growth, we are investing in key cross-category platforms to drive guest engagement and market share growth. Since launching Conscious Beauty in 2020, we have continued to expand brand participation, increase guest awareness and drive trial. At the end of the first quarter, more than 280 brands offered certified products in at least 1 pillar. And while we continue to certify existing brands and SKUs, many new brands are launching with certification in place. One such example is Andrew Fitzsimons, a hair care brand that offers proprietary bonding technology at accessible price points, which was certified across all 4 pillars when it launched in the first quarter.\n Another example is Sk*p, an Ulta Beauty exclusive hair and body care brand packaged in a fully recyclable, shower-friendly paper beauty carton, which also launched in the first quarter.\n Moving now to our efforts to continually expand and support our assortment of bipack brands, we launched 5 new bipack brands, BeautyStat, Rosen Skincare, Fenty Beauty, Treslu\u0301ce Beauty and Mielle Organics. We also expanded Black Girl sunscreen into all stores. To promote trial, we introduced a spotlight display in select stores to showcase our bipack founders. In recognition of Black History Month, we launched a compelling omnichannel campaign to recognize, celebrate and support the black community and black-owned brands. We feature black-owned brands in stores and across enhanced digital and print channels, and we offered compelling loyalty rewards on black-owned brand purchases to drive awareness.\n Finally, our wellness shop continues to resonate with guests as they prioritize self-care and wellness journeys. We recently expanded the shop to an additional 266 stores, now reaching about 55% of our fleet and refresh the digital landing page on ulta.com. With easy ways to explore our curated assortment and helpful tips about easy self-care routines, guests can now more readily incorporate wellness into their busy schedules.\n Turning now to our efforts to evolve the omnichannel experience through a connected physical and digital ecosystem, All In Your World. Store traffic trends were strong in the quarter as guests capitalized on their preference for in-store shopping with fewer COVID restrictions in place than last year and store capacity returned to normal levels.\n While store traffic is still below pre-pandemic levels, the trend is improving.\n As a core differentiator for Ulta Beauty, beauty services deepen engagement and loyalty through human connection. Consumers are resuming their beauty service routines as they participate in more in-person activities. In the first quarter, our beauty services delivered double-digit comp growth, primarily due to increased capacity and new offerings, including OLAPLEX Repair and PROTECT and express color by Redken.\n To meet growing guest interest and services and experiences, we continue to expand our in-store events and enhance our service offerings. In April, we relaunched makeup services in all stores, just in time to support special events such as proms, graduations and weddings. As guests are coming back to shop in stores, they are also maintaining their use of convenient engaging digital channels. Reflecting these trends, we continue to enhance our omnichannel offerings, including buy online, pickup in store and same-day delivery.\n During the quarter, BOPIS increased 26% to 21% of e-commerce sales compared to just 16% last year. While still limited, guests are increasing their use of our same-day delivery options. Based on engagement trends, we recently expanded same-day delivery to 5 new markets, including New York City. And today, about 30% of our stores offer guests this convenient option.\n During the first quarter, we continued to expand and enhance our digital experiences. As part of our Digital Store of the Future Journey, we introduced a new homepage for both ulta.com and our mobile app. We also launched 2 Virtual Try-On tools, each powered by technology developed by companies we have invested in through our digital innovation fund.\n First, we launched GLAMlab Skin Advisor 2.0, powered by global artificial intelligence startup, pot.ai. This best-in-class skin analysis technology enables us to provide guests with a more accurate skin diagnosis, which has resulted in stronger satisfaction with the tool.\n We also launched GLAMlab hairstyle try-on powered by [ RE/STYLE ], a beauty tech start-up that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to enable virtual try-on of more than 50 different hair styles, including options by gender and texture. We also introduced innovative AR and virtual reality experiences to support our launch of Fenty Beauty and r.e.m. Beauty. \n Finally, we continue to enhance and expand our partnership with Target. This leading partnership is part of our long-term strategy to build brand loyalty and engagement with Ulta Beauty. We are seeing existing ultimate reward members, take advantage of the convenience of shopping while earning points at Ulta Beauty at Target. And we are leveraging Target's strong traffic to introduce Ulta Beauty and Ultimate Rewards to new guests.\n During the first quarter, we opened 26 Ulta Beauty at Target shops, ending the quarter with 127 locations. One of our priorities in 2022 is to leverage marketing to build engagement as we scale. As an example, in support of our 21 Days of Beauty event, we co-created brand-relevant digital and in-store communications with Target to support this strategic Ulta Beauty event, which resulted in strong performance and guest engagement across both channels.\n Moving to our efforts to drive love, loyalty and emotional connection with Ulta Beauty by expanding and deepening our presence at the heart of the beauty community. During the first quarter, we continued to optimize our marketing mix to reach guests through the most relevant channels and platforms. We leveraged audience data to execute a targeted digital-first approach to 21 Days of Beauty and Spring haul driving greater awareness and increased sales. We launched content partnerships to engage new audiences and increase awareness of our cross-category platforms, and we created innovative marketing campaigns to support key brand launches.\n We ended the quarter with 37.7 million active members in our Ultimate Rewards Loyalty Program, 17% above the first quarter last year. This increase was primarily driven by continued member reactivation growth, new member acquisition and strong retention. Our strategy is to reengage lapsed members, many of whom dropped off during the pandemic are delivering results. Additionally, new member conversion remains strong in stores and online conversion rates are improving, as we increase the visibility and value of ultimate rewards throughout the guests online journey.\n I'm also excited to share that we launched UB Media, our retail media network. Through UB Media, we will harness the power of our exclusive first-party data to transform the way brands connect with beauty enthusiasts. Building on our successful digital marketing partner program, UB Media offers brand partners an enriched portfolio of advertising products and channels as well as enhanced measurements in reporting, including audience and creative insights.\n The media network offers advertising, access fee display, video, search, product listing ads, social and influencers on both open web platforms and Ulta Beauty-owned properties. In addition to unlocking a new income stream while helping brand partners build digital campaigns to effectively engage audiences, we expect to see sales benefits as campaigns lead consumers back to Ulta Beauty properties to transact.\n Underlying these customer-facing priorities is a focus on to drive operational excellence and optimization. Last fall, we shared our updated supply chain strategy, including our plan to build market fulfillment centers, or MFCs, to supplement our existing DC network capacity and provide greater speed to stores and e-commerce guests in specific markets. We recently broke ground on our first MFC in Greenville, South Carolina, and expect the facility will be fully operational in the third quarter next year.\n In addition, our planned retrofit of our full service distribution center in Greenwood, Indiana is on track to be complete in the second quarter of 2023. I am confident our infrastructure investments, including key supply chain and IT investments, will enable Ulta Beauty to continue to deliver strong results and capitalize on future growth opportunities.\n In closing, a few weeks ago, I had the privilege to welcome nearly 2,000 members of the Ulta Beauty team to our annual field leadership meeting, bringing together our general managers, district managers, field support teams and brand partners for several days of recognition, leadership development and product education. The excitement was palpable and the optimism about our future was truly inspiring. We celebrated everything we have accomplished throughout the last 2 challenging years and set the stage to deliver on the incredible opportunities ahead for Ulta Beauty. I left the event even more excited about all we can do together as 1 Ulta Beauty team to refine -- redefine how the world sees and expresses beauty.\n As we look forward, the world around us continues to be dynamic. Product prices and operating costs are rising and consumers are increasingly concerned about the impact of inflation. While it is difficult to forecast how inflation may impact consumer behavior going forward, we are monitoring guest engagement and remain encouraged by the underlying trends we see in our business and in the beauty category. I am confident our team will continue to navigate near-term pressures, and I remain excited about the long-term opportunity for Ulta Beauty to continue to deliver profitable growth.\n And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? Yes. Great question. And yes, the inflationary environment, as we -- as both I and Scott said in the remarks, is certainly one that we're watching carefully, and we're staying close to our guests. So far, our guests are managing through it and we're not seeing huge impacts. In fact, as I mentioned in the script, Prestige makeup performed a bit higher than mass makeup. So we're seeing strong results across our portfolio. We haven't experienced meaningful trade down behavior that we can -- we could identify. And it's -- one of the unique things that we feel is core to our model is the breadth of our assortment, all price points, from mass to prestige, all categories, hair care and skin care, makeup and bath and fragrance. And so being able to adjust and adapt as consumers' needs evolve has been true to our model for a long time and allowed us to manage through any disruption in the marketplace. But right now, we're seeing strength across all aspects of our business, which we're obviously really pleased with. But we're also prepared to adjust and adapt if and when consumer behavior adjusts. Great. Well, thanks for the question, Olivia. Yes, makeup did recover faster than we had anticipated coming into the year. You all know that we've been working on makeup for a while. It was somewhat soft going into the pandemic and was arguably the hardest hit category of segment beauty during the pandemic. And we're -- so we're excited to see it recovering, and that's driven by an elevated overall engagement in the category in part by more opportunities to go out, more social occasions, more people going back to work in person and then just some of the things that we've been talking about, the engagement, the excitement, the enthusiasm for makeup has remained high as evidenced in social media, just the opportunities to where makeup haven't been as numerous. So we're -- as that opens up, as the world opens up, we're definitely say, more opportunity, a high level of engagement. There's new trends that are coming in to make up that we're excited about, definitely a push towards bold looks, bright, glam, glitter, people are ready to get out in the world and that's shown up in the looks.\n At the same time, some of the dynamics around a more natural look that requires makeup, same consumers are balancing both of those. We're seeing brow innovation, contouring is being discovered by younger consumers who missed it the first time around long lip wear -- long wear lip is a trend that's that started in the pandemic and is continuing. So we're excited about what we're seeing and then in the Total category. And then Ulta, through our assortment has really been performing quite well adding key brands like Fenty, r.e.m., Chanel, lots of innovation from both mass and prestige, MAC, Clinique, Lancome and NARS on the Prestige side, e.l.f. and NYX are 2 big highlights on the on the mass side. So we're getting a lot of innovation, lot of creativity, all the things that we have been working on and driving towards really came together in a nice way in the quarter.\n So as we look forward to the second half of the year, we're confident. It's hard to predict exactly how consumer behavior will go. But as more and more people are comfortable going out, more opportunities exist, more people going back to the work, coupled with the continued pipeline of strong innovation, we feel like makeup is on its way to a full recovery. And in fact, in Q1 was up over 2019 results, so pre-pandemic results for the first time in the pandemic. So excited about what we're seeing and looking to continue to drive that forward. Yes. We -- the beauty category is attractive and has been highly competitive for a long time. I've been here at Ulta for about 8.5 years now, and it's been hypercompetitive the whole time and for years before that. It's attractive. It's growing. It's engaging. So that's been part of the dynamic for a while. And certainly, it's true now. We're seeing new competitive locations, particularly on the prestige side, at the same time that we're opening up new stores of our own and in our partnership with Target. So there is some shift going on.\n What we're excited about and proud of is the fact that even in that environment, even in the first quarter with hundreds of new competitive locations, we continue to gain meaningful share in the Prestige category. And I think it's a reflection of the strength of our model. We have something that nobody else offers in the marketplace. The unique combination of an assortment that reflects the way consumers want to buy and shop beauty across price points, mass, prestige, across categories and then most importantly, in an experienced an environment that reflects the human connection that consumers are looking for in this highly emotional category. All of our research suggests that our experience is unique and special. What our team does every day to deliver a unique experience stands out in the marketplace, and that helps us drive our business and drive our market share.\n You add in loyalty and services and a great digital experience and add all the innovation that we continue to bring in all aspects of our business, we feel like we're doing -- we're playing offense. We're leading through what we know how to do best, which is drive engagement with beauty enthusiasts through all aspects of the beauty journey. And so we feel confident that if we continue to do that, it's going to continue to show up in our results. It's reflected in the strong results we had in the first quarter, the momentum we had coming out of fiscal '21 in our share results, in our loyalty, member growth, and we're -- that's our plan going forward. For us, we've always been focused on our strategy, executing our strategy with excellence. And when we do that, the results follow and that will be our plan going forward. Yes. A few things that I might say. One, across categories, we're really pleased that we see strength in all of our major categories. I talked about makeup in detail already. And so that's an important improvement on our business. But at the same time, that improved. It was encouraging to see skincare deliver strong results, haircare continue through innovation and prestige, on tools to drive a lot of engagement and newness across haircare, continues to drive great results. Fragrance, which has been a shining star throughout the last 2 years continues to drive growth. I talked in the script about some of the drivers of that newness, brands, exclusive brands like Billie Eilish as well as innovation on our existing brands, that driving strong growth, sun care, expansion into wellness and driving incremental growth.\n So category performance was healthy across the board. Channel performance, again, strong results in both driven by our stores and traffic and engagement and the desire to get back and shopping in person, but to have our e-commerce business essentially flat after all the growth we've seen in that business over the last couple of years was in line with our expectation and salon coming back very strong. So our channels are performing well. Through the quarter itself, the first period, the first month or so of the quarter was the strongest as we kind of came out of the gates and then started lapping stimulus. But the other 2 months of the quarter were strong as well and well ahead of our expectations. So around a well-rounded delivery of results with all aspects of our business contributing to the performance that we have. No region. I mean 1 of the things that we really like about our model is our model works in all different types of geographies. Big cities from New York and L.A. to Chicago to smaller remote single-store markets, suburbs, urban, rural, and we saw strong performance across the board. So there was no real region or marketplace distinctions of note. And that to us is a reflection, this is working really well. And then when we look across economic, we saw growth across all income levels as well as we look at our consumer base. So strong growth from our highest income to more moderate income. So -- again, well-rounded growth. Consumers are engaged in the category. The category itself is, we think, more relevant, more important to our consumers, more connected to their overall sense of self-care and well-being. At the same time, there are so many more occasions to go out. We think the category is in great shape, and we're proud to be leading the category and driving these results through our strong execution. Well, we won't get specific on any like -- specific elements of what we factored in. What I'd say about promotion is the environment is dynamic, as we talked about, highly competitive, and there's uncertainty ahead from consumer behavior. We -- what we know is we've been able to continue to manage our promotions in a smart, strategic way. We've been on a journey for a while to reduce nonstrategic broad-scale discounts and promotions to focus our efforts on personalization, CRM-enabled, highly relevant, strategic efforts that drive not just short-term but long-term results through higher engagement, higher loyalty, higher connection to Ulta Beauty over time. And that's what we are able to do in the first quarter.\n But as we've said probably through many of these calls, we're well aware that this is a competitive environment. We've got lots of outstanding competitors that are also looking at ways to drive their business. We will not lose share. We'll respond appropriately. We have more tools than we've ever had through our personalization and CRM capabilities to ensure that we are leading the market. But with uncertainty around inflation, consumer behavior, competitive environment, we are prepared to react. We're not going to lead promotional intensity, but we're also going to make sure that we're appropriately engaging with our beauty enthusiasts to drive them to Ulta Beauty. Okay. Great. Well, thank you all for joining us today. The year is off to a great start, and I want to thank the entire Ulta Beauty team for their collective efforts to support our guests and each other while moving our business forward. We look forward to speaking to you all again at the end of August when we report our second quarter results. I hope you all have a great evening. Thanks, again."

            "name": "Scott Settersten",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to echo Dave's comments and thank our Ulta Beauty associates for delivering another outstanding quarter. Their collaborative efforts and commitment to serving our guests enabled this extraordinary performance.\n Our first quarter results were stronger than we planned. Robust top line growth due to several factors, including the continued resilience of the beauty category, stronger-than-expected store performance and the impact of new brand launches drove better-than-expected leverage in both gross margin and SG&A, resulted in record operating margin of 18.7%.\n Now let's dig into the details of our results. Starting with sales. Net sales for the quarter increased 21%, driven by 18% growth in comp sales, an increase in other revenue and strong new store performance. From a channel perspective, stores delivered strong double-digit comp growth, reflecting fewer COVID restrictions than last year, while e-commerce sales were flat, in line with our plan.\n Transactions for the quarter increased 10%, driven by double-digit growth in store transactions. Average ticket increased 7.3%, resulting primarily from an increase in average selling price. The increase in average selling price reflects the impact of product mix, retail price increases executed in the quarter and lower promotions.\n Other revenue increased $20.4 million, primarily due to growth in credit card income and higher loyalty point redemptions. The increase in credit card income was primarily due to stronger sales growth. The increase in loyalty point redemptions reflects the improving trend in store traffic and the impact of our proactive member engagement campaigns. \n During the quarter, we opened 10 new stores and relocated 6 stores. For the quarter, gross margin increased 120 basis points to 40.1% of sales compared to 38.9% last year. The increase was primarily due to leverage of fixed costs, the growth of other revenue and favorable channel mix, partially offset by lower merchandise margin. \n Robust top line growth and benefits from our occupancy cost optimization efforts resulted in meaningful leverage of store fixed costs. Despite experiencing double-digit growth in supply chain costs, primarily resulting from increases in wage rates, transportation costs and fuel surcharges, strong top line growth during the quarter enabled us to leverage supply chain costs. As sales growth moderates through the rest of the year, we expect higher supply chain costs to become more of a headwind.\n Reflecting strong sales performance of stores, channel mix was favorable this quarter. As a percentage of sales, e-commerce sales were about 400 basis points lower than the first quarter last year. Although the impact of lower promotions was favorable during the quarter, merchandise margin was lower than last year, primarily due to the impact of brand mix and lapping benefits from favorable inventory reserve adjustments last year.\n As planned, SG&A increased 12.9% to $501 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased 150 basis points to 21.4% compared to 22.9% last year. Lower marketing expenses and leverage of store payroll and benefits due to higher sales were partially offset by deleverage of corporate overhead, reflecting investments related to our strategic priorities.\n As Dave shared, we recently launched UB Media, a more sophisticated and expanded version of our digital marketing partner program. Reflecting the expected scaling of this platform, we are offsetting the incremental marketing expense of the digital campaigns we manage for our brand partners with the vendor income that is a direct reimbursement for these specific costs within total marketing expense. This resulted in about 70 basis points of favorable impact to SG&A in the quarter.\n Operating income increased 43.4% to $437.7 million compared to $305.3 million last year. As a percentage of sales, operating margin increased 290 basis points to 18.7% of sales compared to 15.8% last year. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 53.7% to $6.30 per share compared to $4.10 per share last year.\n Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 16% to $1.57 billion compared to $1.35 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 28 additional stores, the increase reflects inventory purchases to support key brand launches as well as continued efforts to maintain strong in-stock of key items to support expected demand and mitigate anticipated global supply chain disruptions.\n Capital expenditures were $71.1 million for the quarter compared to $34.6 million last year. The increase in capital expenditures reflects a more normalized investment cadence versus the last couple of years and includes investments in IT systems, merchandising improvements and store maintenance and other. Depreciation was $62.8 million compared to $70.6 million last year, primarily due to a shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense. We ended the quarter with $654.5 million in cash and cash equivalents.\n In the first quarter, we repurchased 332,000 shares at a cost of $132.8 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.87 billion remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization.\n Turning now to our outlook. Reflecting our strong first quarter performance and sales trends we've experienced so far in the second quarter, we are increasing our outlook for fiscal 2022. We now expect net sales to be between $9.35 billion and $9.55 billion with comp sales growth between 6% and 8%. Our updated outlook reflects trends year-to-date while continuing to consider uncertainties that could impact the second half of the year, including inflationary risk to consumer spending and the impact of increased points of distribution for Prestige Beauty. We anticipate comp growth will be in the low to mid-teens in the first half and then moderate to low single-digit growth in the second half. \n We now expect operating margin for the year to be between 14.1% and 14.4% of sales. We anticipate operating margin will leverage in the first half but deleverage in the second half, as sales growth moderates and cost pressures and planned investments have a greater impact.\n We continue to expect gross margin for the full year will be lower than fiscal 2021, driven primarily by lower merchandise margin resulting from the impact of brand mix, more normalized assortment management activity and a more normalized promotional environment. In addition, we believe fuel prices will continue to be volatile, resulting in higher supply chain costs than initially planned.\n We continue to expect SG&A expense will deleverage for the year, driven primarily by $70 million to $75 million of expenses related to our strategic priorities, including investments to support UB Media, Ulta Beauty at Target, Project SOAR and other IT capabilities as well as higher wage rate growth across the enterprise, partially offset by lower marketing expense and incentive compensation. \n In addition, we are seeing inflationary pressure on operating expenses like service provider fees, labor, supplies and travel, and we expect these trends to continue throughout fiscal 2022. These assumptions result in updated full year guidance for diluted EPS growth in the high single to low double-digit range. \n For modeling purposes, some expenses initially planned for Q2 are expected to shift into Q3, primarily reflecting availability of resources and equipment. As a result of these shifts and a stronger than initially planned sales trend, we now expect to deliver earnings growth in the second quarter.\n In closing, fiscal 2022 is off to a great start, but uncertainties remain. Our updated outlook reflects stronger top line performance and greater cost pressures as well as economic and global uncertainties that could adversely impact consumer spending later in the year.\n While our updated expectations for fiscal 2022 are above our longer-term targets for comp sales and operating margin, we are not changing our long-term financial targets at this time, given our limited visibility into the economic environment and expected cost pressures as we move through the rest of the year and into 2023.\n And now, I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. Yes. Simeon, thanks for the question. So even if I answer directly, the units per transaction were essentially flat year-over-year. So again, we're seeing a lot of the benefit from the continuation what I'd call a moderate promotional environment overall, coupled with the mix of brands we have that entered the assortment here over the course of the last year. So again, you know the names well. We've been talking about Fenty and OLAPLEX and some of the other big hitters here we've added recently. So again, the mix of those 2 are really doing -- making a big contribution to our gross margin here in recent quarters. Yes. We don't really have anything in more detail to share with that at this point in time. Again, we are very happy to see the rebound in store traffic, right. And so a nice healthy transaction growth is always what we're striving for and planned for. And so we're super excited to see the bounce back of the consumer in the stores and making sure, again, that we deliver best-in-class specialty retail omnichannel experience. Yes. So the great start we got in the first quarter is really kind of a background here driving some of the gross margin. So we still expect it to be down, as you said, but down less than what our initial plan was for the year. So we still have the same variables at play there. We talked about brand mix being a headwind this year. We think the promotional environment will normalize during the year. Again, we didn't see so much of that in the first quarter, but we are expecting more of that to come into play as we get deeper into the year and then supply chain costs. Again, we expected cost generally to be higher this year. We're seeing some costs, especially around fuel, higher than we expected. And we -- the back half of the year, there'll be more headwind from that piece of the equation as well. So overall, I feel like we're in a good place. And if sales stay strong and we're always focused on optimizing the business overall. So helping to deliver great results. That's 2 for me, Steph. That's not fair. Okay. So we'll go first up on the inventory. So again, it's up 16% year-over-year. We feel like we're in a good position. Again, it looks easy based on the results we're posting here, but our teams are doing an excellent job and working really hard with our vendor partners, the merchants, the inventory planning teams, the supply chain teams to make sure we get the right product in the right place. And so fill rates are good. We're feeling better. Things have kind of bounced back a little bit from what we saw mid- to late last year. So again, focused on high velocity SKUs, new brands to make sure we take advantage where we can there. We do expect that the growth rate, again, will moderate as we get further into the year this year and start anniversary-ing some of the steps we took last year to get more aggressive on inventory. So again, that's one place we always feel confident that we would make more investment if good judgment suggests that.\n And then on the accounting for the UB Media, so this one again for the accountants in the room. So last year, again, the vendor, the marketing partner program that we had in place, again, we've explained this. We've always been doing this in a smaller scale, I guess, I would say. And so historically, the accounting was all in the gross margin line by and large, okay, the vendor income piece of it. The cost -- the actual marketing cost within SG&A and all the benefits were flowing through the gross margin line kind of in line with all of our vendor money accounting so to speak. And this year, the difference is we're able to offset the incremental advertising costs in the SG&A line and the residual rolls through the gross margin line. I hope that helps. Yes. I guess I would just chalk it up like we indicated, Michael, being prudent all things considered, looking at the world and all the uncertainty and all the warning signs that seem to be flashing a bit right now. So again, there's no -- we took the benefit of what we've seen strong performance so far in the first half of the year, bake that into our full year outlook and didn't really modify the second half of the year based on what our initial plan was for 2022. And so you take that and then you adjust for some of the expense pressures that we're seeing across the business right now, and that's where we think is an appropriate place to land it for the time being. And then we'll continue to modify as we work our way through the rest of the year. That sounds like 3 questions, Simeon, actually. But I'll give it out 3 here. So yes, haircare has been a real contributor here recently. Again, it kind of gets back to the brand mix overall for the business, I would say. So while haircare, generally speaking, is higher margin than the house, some of the mix that's been added here recently, doesn't necessarily follow the same metrics overall.\n When we're talking about inventory, so it was favorable adjustments last year that was driving the tougher compare this year. So again, last year, cleaner inventories, we were coming off what I'd call some housekeeping, probably late in 2020, right? We closed some stores. We exited some brands later in the year. So we got some book benefit from that last year, which makes it a tougher compare.\n As far as the guidance overall, what changed, again, the strong sales, the strong start. Obviously, it's helping drive a lot of fixed cost leverage here for the year. For the revenue, it was something that was unexpected, really wasn't in the plan to see those redemptions come back in our loyalty program that way and to see the credit card benefit pop here in the first quarter. So again, we're planning for more of that to continue throughout the year. We've got operating costs that are increasing across the business, specifically in supply chain, but we're seeing in other areas, too, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks. So that's been feathered in as we think about the second half of the year.\n So again, we feel like we're in a good position. We feel like we've got all the variables covered. Again, we think it's prudent to take a more thoughtful, careful approach and outlook as we're looking ahead to the second half of the year, considering all the uncertainties that are kind of floating out there right now. So on the SG&A, there's really nothing. There's no onetime extraordinary items floating around in there. I would call, go back and look at our comments around the marketing expense and how that is being treated year-over-year because that is a rather significant change. Again, that comes from the UB Media change going from what I'd call a small scale kind of operation to a more formalized and larger scale process overall. So we did change the accounting there year-over-year, and that is providing a pretty significant benefit in the first quarter versus a year ago and that's going to continue for the rest of the year, obviously, that comparison.\n Then when we're talking about gross margin and some of the variability that you called out there in the second half, again, we think it's still in the same range that we guided to early in the year. Again, we -- I would point back to changing an expectation. So again, first quarter promotional environment was moderate to slightly better than what we saw a year ago, which was not our plan for the year, and we expect that to get more aggressive in the back half of the year. So that's baked in there, along with the brand mix. So again, brand mix kind of worked to our benefit in the first quarter. We think some of that will moderate as we get further into the year as well."

            "content": "Yes, I'll take that one. What I will say is that we're really pleased with the overall partnership with Target. As Dave mentioned, we co-created from brand-relevant digital in-store campaign during our 21 Days of Beauty, and we're really pleased with that performance. I would just say that we will continue to share more as we grow more to scale right now. As of today, we've got 140 stores that are open as of today. We're on track to open 250 plus stores with them this year, but we like what we see. When we get a member engaged in our Ultimate Rewards Program, what we're seeing is that they're behaving very similar to our existing loyalty members.\n As far as brands go, Ulta Beauty works closely with the partners, with our brand partners on the assortment, et cetera, but Target really owns the sales. So we're not at liberty to comment on the sales-specific performance by brand at this time. Yes. Dan, what I would say is that any time, as Dave mentioned earlier, we have new points of distribution, there's natural cannibalization that happens. But it's not meaningful yet. We've got just about 140 stores, as I mentioned out of today that are open. We've factored this into our expectations. We do see that whenever we've opened or there's other points of distribution, including our own office Beauty stores, we do see an initial impact that, that dissipates over time, we expect a similar pattern to happen here with our Ulta Beauty and Target locations. So as we continue to roll out more stores, we'll see if that continues to hold true. But we -- what we've seen so far is that seems to be the case."

Dave? \nDavid Kimbell: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. The Ulta Beauty team delivered strong performance again this quarter with sales, operating margin and EPS all exceeding our internal expectations. Our traffic trends remained healthy. Our brand awareness reached all-time highs, and we drove strong member growth and retention. \n For the quarter, net sales increased 10.2% to $3.6 billion. Operating profit was 14.5% of sales, and diluted EPS was $8.08 per share. Comparable sales increased 2.5%, driven by high single-digit growth from digital channels. Store comp sales increased slightly as we lapped high-teen growth last year. \n A thoughtfully curated assortment, engaging marketing strategies and new fulfillment and technology capabilities, enabled our teams to deliver mid-single-digit comp growth for the holiday period. Our holiday campaign this year centered around the gift is just the beginning, which underscored our belief in the power of beauty and Ulta Beauty. To support the campaign, we created relevant storytelling, which inspired authentic connection, leading to record breaking impressions, significant growth in share of voice and strong social engagement. \n These successful marketing efforts complemented our engaging in-store messaging and events, which focused on bringing beautytainment to guests and building the basket. Compelling content, combined with successful promotional strategies, drove strong new member acquisition and reactivation while increasing shopper -- shopping frequency and retention. \n From a market share perspective, we continue to outpace the growth of the mass market for the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2024, according to Circana data. Our marketing share -- our market share of prestige beauty was more challenged as we lapped strong share growth in 2022 and continue to face pressure from the expansion of beauty -- distribution points in prestige. While competitive intensity has increased, we remain confident our differentiated model and sales-driving strategies will support our ability to capture additional market share over the long term. \n Turning to performance by category. Skincare was our fastest-growing category, delivering double-digit comp growth. Brands leading into relevant trends like BIOMA, Bubble and Good Molecules, which is exclusive to Ulta Beauty, delivered strong growth. Dermatologist-recommended brands also continue to appeal to consumers looking for efficacious products from trusted brands, fueling growth for La Roche-Posay, Dermalogica and Cetaphil. \n The fragrance and bath category also delivered low double-digit comp growth again this quarter. Newness from Valentino, Burberry and Tree Hut and holiday gift sets from consumer favorites, YSL, Gucci and Billie Eilish contributed to strong performance. In addition, in January, we welcomed Sol de Janeiro, a Brazilian-inspired body care brand, to the Ulta Beauty family. Available in 700 stores and online, Sol de Janeiro has quickly become a guest favorite, driving growth in the category. \n Comp sales for the makeup category decreased in the low single-digit range. Softness in prestige cosmetics was partially offset by growth in mass makeup. Lip layering and blush proliferation continue to resonate with beauty enthusiasts. And brands leaning into these trends, including e.l.f., NYX and exclusive brand Juvia's Place, delivered strong growth. While prestige makeup was challenged in totality as we lapped strong growth last year, luxury brands, Dior, NATASHA DENONA and Pat McGrath continue to engage guests. And HOURGLASS, Tarte and Lanc\u00f4me saw success with compelling holiday offerings. \n Finally, comp sales for the hair care category decreased in the mid-single-digit range, primarily due to a decline in hair tools and the lapping of strong brand launches in 2022. Products focused on silane and foundational routines drove growth for professional brands Redken, Kenra and Biolage, and interest in hair health and treatments drove increased guest engagement with OUAI, Mielle and Divi. Newer brands, including Shark Beauty and LolaVie also resonated with guests. \n Our services businesses delivered high single-digit growth for this quarter, driven by an increase in transactions. In addition to core styling services, specialty offerings, including extensions, hair treatments, texture services and ear piercing, drove strong engagement with guests. \n Turning now to the full year. Net sales for the year increased 9.8% to $11.2 billion. Comp sales increased 5.7%. Operating profit was 15% of sales. And diluted EPS increased 8.4% to a record $26.03 per share. \n In addition to delivering strong financial results, we also made meaningful progress against our strategic priorities. Let me share highlights of advances made this year. Reflecting our efforts to drive growth through all things beauty, we strengthened our assortment with compelling newness and the expansion of strategic cross-category platforms. Using the consumer lens of how guests experience Ulta Beauty through all of our touch points, we estimate we maintained our share of the total U.S. beauty product industry. \n We launched customer favorite brands, including Dior, Beautycounter and Sol de Janeiro, and introduced emerging and exclusive brands, including Half Magic and Polite Society. We launched Luxury at Ulta Beauty, a strategically curated luxury beauty experience, and we expanded our cross-category platforms. We ended the year with more than half of our brand portfolio certified in at least one Conscious Beauty pillar and continue to drive greater awareness and discovery through unique sample kits and greater marketing support. \n We expanded our Black-owned or founded brands to 50 brands, and welcomed to the second cohort of BIPOC brands to our MUSE Accelerator program, a program designed to help early-stage BIPOC brands prepare for retail readiness. Additionally, we expanded the wellness shop to nearly all stores and refreshed the presentation to inspire and educate guests how to integrate wellness into their everyday lives. \n Turning to our second strategic pillar, All In Your World, we improved the guest experience across all of our touch points. We enhanced our physical footprint, opening 33 new stores and renovating or relocating 25 stores. Our services business delivered double-digit comp growth for the year, increasing frequency with members who already engaged in services while also introducing new members to our offering. And we drove greater experiential shopping through more in-store events focused on engaging and educating the guest about new products, new techniques and the latest beauty trends. \n We also delivered significant improvements in our digital store experience. We successfully transitioned key guest-facing and commerce elements to a new modern architecture, delivering a fresh guest experience across both ulta.com and our app and providing our teams with new tools to optimize the guest experience. These enhancements, combined with our efforts to drive omnichannel member penetration, resulted in high single-digit growth in e-commerce sales and a 30% increase in member utilization of our app. \n To support stronger omnichannel experiences, we continue to improve our buy anywhere fill anywhere capabilities. We expanded same-day delivery to all stores and increased our ship-from-store capabilities to 450 stores. Between BOPIS, same-day delivery and ship-from-store, 37% of our digital orders this year were fulfilled by stores, up from 31% last year. \n Finally, we strengthened our partnership with Target with the introduction of new brands and the opening of 155 additional Ulta Beauty at Target locations, ending the year with 510 shops. And we deepened guest engagement as reflected in growth of new member conversions, reengagement of labs guests and greater loyalty account linkage as well as increased bounce back to Ulta Beauty stores. \n Moving to our third strategic pillar, expanding and deepening guest engagement and loyalty by operating at the heart of the beauty community. Our marketing strategies, media investments and brand-building efforts resulted in record level unaided awareness, brand love and loyalty. To drive awareness and spark deeper connection engagement, we launched the Joy Project, a multiyear brand equity initiative to make beauty and the world a more joyful place. \n We expanded our social media engagement across multiple platforms with new trendsetting series and compelling content, which drove strong engagement, positive social sentiment and share of voice. And we achieved an important milestone. In December, we surpassed 1 million followers on TikTok, reinforcing our position as a social brand leader in beauty. \n With improved member retention, strong new member acquisition and healthy reactivation of lapsed members, we expanded our loyalty program by 8%, ending the year with 43.3 million loyalty members who shopped more frequently and spent more with us on average. Leading into the power of our best-in-class loyalty program in January, we rebranded the program to Ulta Beauty Rewards, featuring a stronger birthday experience and a refreshed look in stores and online and across social to drive greater awareness and deepen connection with our members. We are excited to reward our members with even more of what they love and showcase how much we appreciate them. \n Finally, UB Media, our retail media network, continued to deliver value. This year, we expanded the team, introduced new on-site products and launched an innovative omnichannel solution, which supports the measurement of campaigns across both digital and physical stores. \n Our fourth strategic pillar is to drive operational excellence and optimization to enable us to capture additional market share, fund guest experience enhancements and deliver future profitable growth. \n I am very proud of what our teams accomplished in fiscal 2023, which was an ambitious year of foundational transformation for Ulta Beauty. We completed the retrofit of our Greenwood distribution center, began the retrofit of our Dallas distribution center, opened our Greer market fulfillment center and began work on our Bolingbrook market fulfillment center. We successfully transitioned our Jacksonville, Greer and Chambersburg distribution facilities and key merchandising processes to our new enterprise resource planning platform. And we converted key merchandising and commerce elements of our digital store to a new architecture while maintaining digital operations. \n We built a new enterprise data platform on Google Cloud infrastructure, establishing a modern ecosystem for future analytics and data-driven decision capabilities. And we completed our rollout of new POS systems, including mobile checkout in all stores. \n Our teams enable our success, and we continue to invest and protect and cultivate our world-class culture and talent. This year, we introduced a new leadership competency model, redesigned our succession planning and talent review processes, expanded our associate development offering and completed enterprise-wide training to reinforce inclusivity and address unconscious bias. Associate retention improved across stores, distribution centers and our corporate team. And our 2023 culture survey results reinforce that our overall associate engagement remains strong. \n Finally, we made progress against our sixth strategic pillar to expand our environmental and social impact. We continue to improve the energy efficiency of stores through LED lighting retrofits, HVAC retrofits and energy management system upgrades and established 2030 emissions reduction goals approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. \n I am incredibly proud of what our teams accomplished in 2023. Our teams worked through unexpected challenges with agility and grace, and I'm grateful for their steadfast commitment to deliver value for all stakeholders while also enabling new capabilities for future growth. \n As we look forward, we remain optimistic about the strength and resiliency of the beauty category. Over the last 3 years, the beauty category has experienced unprecedented growth. In 2024, we expect the category will remain healthy, but the growth will moderate to the mid-single-digit range, barring a major economic event. \n Beauty is an attractive category, and competitive intensity continues to increase as channels blur and distribution expands. To protect and expand our leadership position, this year, we expect to advance our transformational agenda with the completion of key projects while also investing in core traffic and experienced drivers to strengthen engagement and enhance the guest experience. \n Starting with our go-to-market strategic pillars, we will innovate, evolve and expand All Things Beauty to excite and engage the beauty enthusiast. To strengthen our differentiated position, we will continue to expand our assortment with compelling and relevant brand launches like Sol de Janeiro and Charlotte Tilbury while also building exclusive emerging brands in our pipeline yet to be announced. \n In addition, this year, we will refresh Ulta Beauty Collection and position the brand as the cornerstone of our conscious beauty platform. And we will continue to enhance and amplify Luxury at Ulta Beauty and across category platforms. \n Reflecting the importance of omnichannel engagement, we will invest in the guest experience across all of our touch points. We will further expand and enhance our physical footprint through additional new stores, remodels and relocations. In all stores, we will focus on enhancing the guest experience through friendly and helpful associates, fast and frictionless fulfillment and engaging services and events while also improving operational excellence through simplification, prioritization and optimizing our store teams. \n We also plan to drive growth across digital platforms as we leverage new capabilities to amplify brand launches and events, drive greater digital discovery and conversion and expand personalization across our digital platforms. And we will expand and enhance our partnership with Target as we support new Ulta Beauty at Target shops, evolve the assortment and deepen member engagement through targeted loyalty strategies. \n Operating at the heart of the beauty community, we intend to expand and deepen guest loyalty and engagement. To support long-term brand equity and drive deeper emotional connection with consumers, we will amplify the Joy Project with a continuous rhythm of engaging activations and drive community through an expanded creator network and affiliate program. We will support brand activations and events to drive new member acquisition while also leveraging our unique data insights to expand our targeting and member engagement. We will evolve our strategic promotional events to inspire and engage our beauty community, drive trips and encourage omnichannel engagement. And we plan to expand the impact and value of UB Media. \n Turning now to our operational excellence and optimization efforts. In fiscal 2024, we plan to complete many of the foundational elements of our transformational agenda, including Project SOAR, Digital Store and the upgrade of our data management capabilities. We also plan to invest in a new martech stack to support our personalization, retail media and overall e-commerce efforts. \n Our supply chain optimization journey will continue as our Bolingbrook market fulfillment center is completed, we continue to retrofit our Dallas distribution center, and we began the retrofit of our remaining full-service DCs in Chambersburg and Fresno. In addition, we intend to leverage our established continuous improvement capabilities to drive additional cost efficiencies with a priority on improving processes to reduce shrink. \n To protect our culture and cultivate our talent while also enabling future business performance, we will continue to invest in our associates and team. We intend to focus on enrichments to the frontline associate experience, enhanced associate learning and development and deepen our DEI impact. \n Turning to our final strategic pillar. We intend to stay focused on our environmental and social impact. Building on progress made in 2023, we plan to implement our road map to achieve our emission reduction goals. \n Finally, I want to share an update on how we are approaching expansion opportunities outside the U.S. International expansion represents an incremental long-term opportunity for Ulta Beauty to extend our reach and leverage our differentiated value proposition. Today, we are excited to announce our planned market entry into Mexico. \n The Mexican beauty market is sizable, growing and has significant beauty opportunity. Our research suggests there is a healthy awareness of the Ulta Beauty brand with local beauty enthusiasts, and we also see strong engagement in stores located in geographically adjacent markets. After extensive evaluation, we prioritized an asset-light partnership approach to enable us to move quickly. And I am excited to announce we have formed a joint venture with Axo, a highly experienced operator of global brands, to launch and operate Ulta Beauty in Mexico in 2025. \n As a result of this partnership approach, we do not expect this venture to be material to our financials in fiscal 2024. For competitive reasons, we're not sharing more details today, but we'll provide updates as appropriate. \n In closing, the Ulta Beauty team delivered strong financial performance in fiscal 2023 while also achieving meaningful progress against our strategic priorities. As we look to 2024, I remain excited about the opportunity to enhance our market leadership and drive profitable growth. We operate in a growing category with strong consumer engagement, and I am confident that our proven differentiated business model, strategic priorities and outstanding, passionate team will enable us to move beauty forward in ways that create values for our shareholders and have a positive impact on our guests, associates and the communities we serve. \n Now as many of you know, this will be Scott's last earnings call. And I want to recognize and thank Scott for his many contributions to Ulta Beauty. He has been an exceptional partner to me and an inspirational leader for our entire team. \n Now today, you will also hear from Paula Oyibo, who will become our CFO on April 1. Paula joined Ulta Beauty in 2019 and is a dynamic finance executive with broad industry experience. She understands our business and our guests, and I know she will have a strong impact on our business going forward. \n And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of our financial results. Scott? \nScott Settersten: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. I will review our fourth quarter financial results before turning it over to Paula Oyibo, who will walk through the outlook for fiscal 2024. \n Financial results for the fourth quarter came in ahead of our expectations across the top and bottom line, reflecting strong holiday performance, growth in other revenue and healthy traffic trends as well as strong execution and focused expense management. Net sales for the quarter increased 10.2%, driven by 2.5% growth in comp sales, strong new store performance, a $25 million increase in other revenue as well as the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2023. Net sales for the 53rd week were $181.9 million. The growth in comp sales was driven by a 4.5% increase in transactions. \n Average ticket declined 1.9%, driven by lower units per transaction, which were partially offset by higher average selling price. Reflecting a more normalized pricing environment, we estimate that product price increases contributed about 100 basis points to the overall comp increase. \n Looking at the cadence of sales through the quarter, comp sales were solid in November and December, reflecting strong holiday performance. As expected, sales were more challenged in January as we lap the exceptional results from our strongest month in fiscal 2022. \n During the quarter, we opened 13 new stores, relocated 2, remodeled 2 stores and closed 2 stores. For the quarter, gross margin increased 10 basis points to 37.7% of sales. The increase was driven by strong growth in other revenue, lower shipping rates and leverage of supply chain costs, which were largely offset by lower merchandise margin. Our efforts to grow other revenue continue to yield benefits with performance driven by increased credit card income, greater loyalty point redemptions and royalties earned through our Target partnership. \n At the same time, we realized benefits from our supply chain optimization efforts as our carrier diversification strategy drove improved profitability. As anticipated, merchandise margin was pressured during the quarter, reflecting the lapping of benefits from price increases, increased promotionality as well as the impact from brand mix. These pressures were partially offset by ongoing category management efforts. The impact of promotional activity was above last year but continues to be well below 2019 levels. \n Notably, shrink was flat during the quarter, slightly better than our expectations, reflecting the impact of our investments this year in training, labor and new fragrance fixtures. For the full year, shrink as a percentage of sales increased 40 basis points. \n Moving to expenses. SG&A increased 7.6% to $820 million. Overall, SG&A spend was better than planned due to focused expense management and a shift in timing of certain strategic investments. As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased 50 basis points to 23.1% compared to 23.6% last year, primarily due to lower incentive compensation and leverage of marketing expenses and store payroll and benefits, which was partially offset by deleverage of corporate overhead and store expenses. \n Incentive compensation drove 40 basis points of leverage in the quarter, reflecting operational performance that was more in line with our internal targets compared to last year's significant outperformance. In addition to the impact of higher sales, marketing expense leverage was driven by the timing of advertising expenses, while store payroll and benefits leverage reflected fewer payroll hours per store, which more than offset ongoing wage rate pressures. \n Offsetting these benefits, corporate overhead expense deleveraged during the quarter, primarily reflecting investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, Digital Store and other IT capabilities and UB Media. For the full year, we invested $62 million of incremental spend to support our strategic initiatives, which was at the lower end of our expectations, reflecting the shift in timing of certain projects into 2024. \n Finally, store expenses also deleveraged, driven by investments to support merchandising initiatives as well as ongoing inflationary pressures across the business. Operating margin was 14.5% of sales compared to 13.9% last year. The company's tax rate decreased to 24.2% compared to 24.6% in the fourth quarter last year. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to benefits from a decrease in state income taxes. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 21% to $8.08 compared to $6.68 last year. The EPS impact of the 53rd week was $0.46. \n To recap the full year, net sales increased 9.8% to $11.2 billion. Comp sales increased 5.7%, driven by a 7.4% increase in transactions and a 1.5% decrease in average ticket. We estimate that product price increases contributed about 200 basis points to the overall comp increase for the year. Operating profit was 15% of sales, with deleverage coming evenly from gross margin and SG&A. And diluted EPS increased 8.4% to a record $26.03 per share. \n Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 8.6% to $1.7 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 30 net new stores, the increase reflects inventory to support new brand launches, the new market fulfillment center in Greer, South Carolina as well as the impact of product cost increases. \n Our well-established business model continues to generate significant cash from operations, including nearly $1.5 billion in fiscal 2023. Our capital allocation approach remains consistent. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business to drive future growth, followed by returning excess cash to our shareholders. \n In fiscal 2023, we invested $435 million in capital expenditures, including approximately $178 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures; $124 million for IT; $73 million for supply chain; and $60 million for store maintenance and other. Depreciation for the year was $244 million compared to $241 million last year and primarily reflects the ongoing shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense. \n During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 352,000 shares at a cost of $159 million, bringing total share repurchase to 1 billion for the full year. Since launching our stock buyback program in 2014, we've purchased more than 18 million shares at a weighted average price of $313, effectively returning $5.8 billion to shareholders while continuing to invest in strategic growth drivers. \n Before I turn the call over to Paula, I want to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to our teams for delivering these strong results for our shareholders this year and throughout my tenure with Ulta Beauty. It has been an honor to serve as the company's CFO and a privilege to lead and serve alongside such talented associates. I'm excited to pass the baton to Paula, who I know will be an excellent leader and steward of Ulta Beauty's business going forward. \nPaula Oyibo: Thank you, Scott. I am honored and humbled to be assuming the position of Chief Financial Officer at Ulta Beauty, and I am excited to lead our talented finance organization and to drive Ulta Beauty's next phase of growth. I want to thank Scott for his mentorship over the years and wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement. I look forward to working with those on the call today and meeting those of you I have not yet met. \n Before we talk about our expectations for fiscal 2024, I want to share 2 capital allocation update. First, yesterday, we amended our revolver agreement to $800 million and extended the term to 2029. Reflecting the current rate environment, we reduced the size of the revolver to lower the impact of higher fees but retain flexibility to upsize the capacity if needed. Second, having essentially completed the authorization announced in March 2022, today, we announced a new share repurchase authorization for $2 billion. \n Now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2024. We expect net sales will be in the range of $11.7 billion to $11.8 billion with comp sales growth expected to be between 4% and 5%. We anticipate comp growth will be in the low single-digit range in the first half and then increase to mid-single-digit growth in the second half of the year. We expect operating margin will be between 14% and 14.3% of sales, primarily driven by SG&A deleverage as we complete many of the foundational elements of our transformational agenda and move to investments to enable growth, operationalize the investments made in 2023, manage ongoing wage pressures and support core traffic and experienced drivers. \n In total, we expect SG&A growth for the year will moderate into the high single-digit range from 12.5% growth in fiscal 2023. We expect SG&A growth in the first half will be in the low double-digit range as we annualize investment spend in 2023 and complete key milestones of our transformational agenda and then slow to mid-single-digit growth in the second half. We expect gross margin for the year will be down modestly as lower merchandise margin and deleverage of supply chain costs are partially offset by other revenue. \n Our assumptions result in a diluted earnings guidance in the range of $26.20 to $27 per share. We are planning EPS to decline in the first half and then accelerate to high single-digit growth in the second half of the year. For modeling purposes, we expect operating margin to be the most challenged in the first quarter with meaningful deleverage across SG&A and gross margins. \n Finally, we plan to spend between $415 million and $490 million in CapEx, including approximately $270 million to $282 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures; $120 million to $155 million for supply chain and IT; and $45 million to $53 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be between $275 million and $280 million. \n We believe the outlook for the beauty category is bright, and we are confident our strategic framework and strong financial foundation will enable us to drive long-term growth and shareholder returns. \n Before we take your questions, I want to announce that we plan to host an investor event here in Chicago this fall to share our longer-term plans and outlook. We will share more of the logistical details later this summer. \n And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: Also, Scott, best wishes on retirement. So I wanted to start out just with the prestige cosmetics category. As you look towards this fiscal year, we're seeing a lot of newness in stores. You're moving past, I think, pretty difficult comparisons. So just curious if you guys expect to return to share gains within the prestige cosmetics category. \nDavid Kimbell: Rupesh, thanks for your question, and thanks for calling out, Scott, well deserved. Yes. I'll say on makeup, and I'll even speak a little bit more broadly across all our categories, we are focused on driving growth in every part of our business. Our makeup business in 2023, particularly in the second half, we saw healthy growth on the mass side and more challenges on the prestige side. So we have a strategy to drive performance within all parts of our makeup business. It is our largest segment and obviously important in the beauty category. \n Our efforts are holistic. We've got a number of new brands that we believe will either already are or will add value to the category, including the launch of Charlotte Tilbury, which just rolled out recently, also exclusive brands like Half Magic and Polite Society, Rabanne, innovation from our existing big brands that we'll continue to see that have been so important to our business like Tarte and Benefit and Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me on the prestige side. \n Our luxury proposition really launched last year to -- with a lot of success. And as we continue to grow and build our presence in that space, we see that as a contributor. And then through our holistic efforts, we're going to try to find ways to lean into the important trends. Makeup is -- of course, has a key trend component. So whether it's blush, shade, proliferation, lip layering, matte makeup, nail is an important opportunity, we're going to continue to drive that. \n And the last thing I'd say is we continue to revamp and elevate our events that play an important role in mass migration, the number of mass consumers that we've acquired over the years, continuing to introduce them to prestige for the first time. So we're focused on driving that business. We are confident over time that we'll be able to deliver the growth that we expect, and we're working hard to deliver across all parts of that business. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Korinne Wolfmeyer with Piper Sandler. \nKorinne Wolfmeyer: Congrats on the quarter. I'd like to touch a little bit on the decision to enter into Mexico. I mean previously, we've been talking about potentially going into Canada. Just would like to understand your thought process of going or doing Mexico versus Canada. And what kind of opportunity do you really see there over the longer term? \nDavid Kimbell: I'm just going to say we're really excited about this announcement and really, as I said in the prepared remarks, see Mexico as a great opportunity that's tailor-made for the Ulta Beauty experience. Kecia is leading this effort among many things that she does. So I'm going to ask Kecia to give some more color on it. \nKecia Steelman: Yes, absolutely. Well, after careful evaluation of many market opportunities, we really felt like the Mexican market is the next step for Ulta Beauty for us to have this partnership with Axo. And we're really excited about this. I know that the future is going to be really bright in this partnership. We've spent a lot of time with their teams from a cultural perspective, also just even from the best-in-class performance with global partners that they've brought to the Mexico consumer -- the Mexican consumer. \n Our border stores are performing really, really well. And I just think it's the next natural step for us as we continue to expand internationally. So we are really excited about this. Again, we are planning to be operational in 2025. The cost of this is built into the guidance in '24. So we don't feel like it's very material. But we're super excited and feel that Axo is the right partner for us to launch in this next new territory for us. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. \nJuliana Duque: This is Juliana on for Ike. I just wanted to ask in regards to thoughts on the beauty categories moving forward, particularly the balance of prestige and mass, and maybe in addition, how we can see that driving merchandise margin given the benefit that we've seen. \nDavid Kimbell: Well, for the overall category, as I mentioned in the remarks, we're fortunate to be in a category that continues to be healthy, that is highly connected to our consumers, a high level of engagement, that there's an emotional connection that's driving the category and has been for a very long time, and then certainly coming out of COVID, has been exceptionally strong. \n All indicators, as we look at the consumer landscape, is a continued level of engagement. When we look into this year, though, of course, we are evaluating and anticipating and preparing for consumer behavior to continue to evolve. We know there's external pressures on the consumer. We know we're entering into a dynamic time with an election year. \n And what we've seen in this category is strong growth, but as expected, some moderation in that growth. Still above historical trends but some moderation. Simply put, we think consumers, highly engaged in the category but still -- and still passionate about the category but will continue to be thoughtful in all of their spending. But fortunately, we know that beauty is an important one. \n And as a reminder, Ulta Beauty is well positioned to manage through really any kind of economic disruption or challenge given our unique portfolio, all price points, all categories that allow us to meet our consumers' needs if there is a time that they feel more pressure or have other changes. But overall, category healthy. Paula, as it relates to any potential margin changes? \nPaula Oyibo: Yes. What I would say is our merchandise margin, I would remind, we are meaningfully higher and better, our merchandise margin since 2019. And really that has a lot to do with we are a much healthier business now, and we have -- our mix in our business between our categories as well as prestige and mass through category performance efforts over the years has really helped us be able to be flexible as the consumer shifts between various categories as well as between mass and prestige. And so we believe that our -- we're able to manage that dynamic. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson with Canaccord Genuity. \nSusan Anderson: I wanted to maybe ask about the store expansion. It looks like it picks up this year. I guess how should we think about timing throughout the year? And then also, should we expect these to be the full-size stores? Or are you going to roll out any of the smaller test stores that you've been looking at? And then also, just how do you think this helps to maybe win back some of the share from other competition? \nPaula Oyibo: Thanks, Susan. We are planning to open between 60 and 65 net new stores in fiscal 2024. That puts our growth between the 2-year period at 90 to 95, which is generally in line with the 100 that we had communicated. And so our thinking hasn't materially changed there. \n We remain confident in our ability to open and operate between 1,500 and 1,700 traditional Ulta Beauty freestanding locations in the U.S. And we're optimistic the small format store prototype could give us an opportunity for additional growth, as does the partnership with Target and then similarly as we're excited about the additional opportunity with our international expansion into Mexico. Related to the small geographies, we are planning to open 10 small store formats in 2024. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashley Helgans with Jefferies. \nAshley Helgans: So we just wanted to ask for an update on UB Media. Anything you can share about the number of brands that are currently on the platform, maybe demand for the platform? And then any color to help us model as UB starts to scale? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. We're really pleased with the progress that we've made. As a reminder for those on the call, this really does represent a way for us to generate positive impact on our business by leveraging the first-party data and insights that we have in partnering with our brands. We're not sharing, we haven't shared and we don't plan to share specific on a number of brands or even specific financial impact at this time. \n But what I will say is we're really pleased with the progress that we've made in 2023 and are confident that we'll continue to grow this part of the business. The network that we have offers advertising access via off-site display, video, social influencers as well as on-site sponsored products. Our on-site display inventory is one of the actually new core offerings that we activated just in 2023. \n So we've got a full suite of ad inventory experiences, value-added services. And as I said, we're confident in its impact going forward. And the support, engagement, reaction from brands has been very positive. As you know, the advertising world continues to evolve. So the value that we can bring through first-party data with 43 million beauty enthusiasts is very meaningful. And we continue to work with our brand partners, and they have demonstrated to us that they see a positive return. And we're continuing to grow that business. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James. \nOlivia Tong Cheang: Congrats, Scott, and looking forward to working with you, Paula. I wanted to ask you a little bit about your thoughts on new product contribution this year because it does seem like certainly starting off with the momentum with Charlotte Tilbury and Sol de Janeiro. We did some store tours in New York recently, and the team is very energized around these brands. So was wondering if you could talk about contribution this year versus previous years and then helping us understand sort of -- I think you mentioned Sol de Janeiro that -- a portion of the doors. Maybe can you give the same statistics for Charlotte Tilbury? \n And then on the margin, I would just love a little bit more detail in terms of what's driving the margin outlook to the 14% to 14.3% end of the longer-term range, whether there's anything, sort of higher investment or what have you that's sort of dragging that to that end of the range? \nDavid Kimbell: Okay. Thanks, Olivia. Yes, I'll talk about new product at our newness pipeline, and then Paula can pick up on your question around margins. So we're -- well, first, I'll say newness is always a critical part of our business and historically has been between 20% to 30% of our sales. And that's an important part of the category and one of the best things about the category. There is a large desire from our beauty enthusiast guests from our members to discover what's new and exciting across all of our categories. \n And so we do have what I believe is a well-balanced portfolio of new brands between big, recognized brands like Charlotte Tilbury as well as a steady stream of emerging brands that are unique or exciting within the Ulta Beauty environment. And so we don't -- we're not going to give any specific numbers about newness this year versus last year. But I will give you a couple of highlights. \n First, you mentioned Charlotte Tilbury. And just to reiterate, that is in 600 stores and online, and we're excited about that. It was one of the top requested brands from our members, and we're pleased to be partnering with them to bring a unique and powerful experience to life. Sol de Janeiro is in 700 stores and also online and also was highly requested and brings just a terrific experience in-store and online and has been very well received since we launched that in January. \n But there's a whole range of products that we're going to continue to launch and bring to life. We do focus, as I said, on emerging brands. And while I'm not going to, for competitive reasons, share some in the pipeline that are ahead of us, I'd highlight some of the brands that we launched last year like LolaVie, Polite Society, Half Magic, a brand like Live Tinted, which has been with us for a little bit, important brands playing an exciting role in driving growth in various categories that we're excited about. And our luxury business that I talked about, we continue to add brands to that throughout the year and see growth. \n So newness is important. We see -- we like the balance that we have. We're excited about the brands that we've launched so far, and I look forward to rolling out more partnerships and bringing newness across our portfolio throughout 2024. Paula, on the margin question? \nPaula Oyibo: Yes. So from an operating margin perspective, we shared 14% to 14.3% of sales. And that is mostly deleverage coming from SG&A as we complete many of our foundational elements of our transformation agenda and move to investments to enable growth as well as we operationalize the investments that we made to date and those go into one state. We also are managing ongoing wage pressures, which is assumed in the guidance. And we also will continue to support core traffic and experienced drivers. \n And so as you think about SG&A growth for the year, it will moderate into the high single-digit range from the 12.5% growth we saw in fiscal 2023. And then we do expect gross margin to be down modestly as lower merchandise margin and deleverage from supply chain costs are partially offset by the growth we see and expect in other revenue. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson. \nMichael Baker: Really just a follow-up on what you just said. The -- can you tell us where you are in this investment -- these foundational investments? I think you said $62 million in 2023, which was below plan, and shift some into 2024. So what should it be in 2024? And even working backwards, can you remind us what it was in '21 and 2022? It was sort of supposed to have a 3-year investment plan that is rolling off. It sounds like it's still rolling off and -- although there will be some lingering costs in 2024. So just trying to conceptualize what 2024 investments will look like versus 2023. \nPaula Oyibo: Yes, Michael, I'll start with some of the numbers and then turn it over to Kecia so she can give a little bit more flavor for where we are. So we had an incremental $55 million in 2022 related to our transformational strategic investments. We communicated $62 million incremental in 2023. As you think about 2024, we expect limited incremental investment as we complete the foundational elements of our transformational agenda. Think about Project SOAR, Digital Store and other IT projects. \n But as I communicated, once we complete those particular systems, these upgraded systems roll into our core operations and become a part of our base, and there's run costs associated to that. So there is run cost associated with those foundational investments. We will continue to invest to enable growth as well as the other items that I mentioned regarding wage pressures and investing in traffic and experienced drivers. Kecia? \nKecia Steelman: Yes. So in regards to like where we are on the investments and where we are in the projects for our ERP upgrade or what we're internally calling as Project SOAR, just this week, we completed our Dallas DC. And we have plans to wrap up Greenwood and Fresno and open up our new MFC in Bolingbrook, which is a relocation of the existing FFC in Romeoville before peak this year. Part of the ERP upgrade, we're also transitioning our store systems and our merchandising systems. And we have those plans to be completed before the second half, again prior to peak. \n For supply chain in '24, we are continuing to invest in our automation capabilities. And I mentioned already the MFC in Bolingbrook hits on our supply chain lines and then also finishing out that retrofit in Dallas -- the Dallas DC. And then for the Digital Store of the Future, so our Digital Store platform, we expect that to be completed in the first half of 2024. And we're wrapping up all of our upgrades around our analytical tools and reporting capabilities. So bottom line, we continue to be on track and on our budget, and we are all in on wrapping these foundational enabling systems up this year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets. \nAnthony Chukumba: Let me add my congratulations to Scott as well. It's been a pleasure working with you all these years. So my question was on the luxury brands. I guess just 2 parts to the same question, both pretty quick. First off, how did they perform relative to your expectations in 2024? And what are your expectations in terms of additional brand rollouts -- luxury brand rollouts in 20 -- sorry, in 2023? And then what are your expectations for additional luxury brand rollouts in 2024? \nDavid Kimbell: Great. Well, thanks for the question. And yes, luxury, as I said, was one of our -- one of many initiatives last year to drive engagement. And we're really pleased with establishing that more firmly with some of our existing partners, including Chanel, but Dior, NATASHA DENONA, Pat McGrath. And so we see strong performance, and we're really pleased with how our guests are engaging in that part of the business. \n We had a lot of confidence going in because of existing relationships with brands like Chanel. And then by elevating and expanding it, it has really, we believe, met our guests' needs. And they're excited about it. And it further demonstrates our ability to deliver all things beauty from all price points, including luxury. \n We're not sharing any specific launches of anything beyond what I've already shared today. More broadly, as I said, with newness, we have a steady stream of newness throughout the year, and we'll continue to innovate. Specifically within luxury, our focus is continuing to grow in partnership with the brands that we've launched and find new ways to expand those businesses and delight our guests with them. And we're really pleased and proud to have that experience in our stores. \nKiley Rawlins: Operator, can we have the last question, please? \nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Scott, congratulations. It's been great, and thanks for all the help over the years. This question is maybe for Dave or Kecia. Can you talk about the promotional environment that your guidance is under for 2024? Is it expected to sort of remain in maybe the first half and then abate or kind of preexist all year long and whether it was more from prestige? Are you concerned that there perhaps is a longer-term shift to mass or masstige from younger or more price-sensitive consumers? \n And then Scott and Paula, just a quick one. In your 4% to 5% comp, what are you expecting in terms of any ASP increases this year? And what's the rationale behind the low single-digit to mid-single-digit comp in the back half? What's going to drive the acceleration? \nDavid Kimbell: So yes, just on the promotional environment, what -- I probably won't answer every one of your detailed questions because we're not going to break it out that way exactly. What I'll say more broadly is we're not expecting that the promotional environment is going to significantly intensify or become irrational. We are in a competitive environment. That's for sure. And we are focused on ensuring that we're delivering on our leadership position. \n So as we look forward, we would anticipate and we have in our plans the ability to drive our business, which includes marketing, store labor, digital experiences and promotional activity as appropriate. But not an expectation more broadly for a significant step. And we do anticipate, as we saw in 2023, that it will still remain well below 2019 levels. \n The mass to mass prestige question, we see opportunity across both parts of the business. Yes, consumers are engaged, and young consumers are engaged in mass, but they're also engaged in prestige. They're loving our luxury experience. So it's really not so much about price or promotion necessarily as what brand is really delivering great innovation, great marketing, engaging with them in social media. Those brands will win and -- regardless of the price points. Paula, do you want to give a little color on some of the 4% to 5%? \nPaula Oyibo: Sure. Adrienne, on your question with regards to expectation around ASP, what I would share is that we are planning for a more normalized pricing environment in 2024. \nDavid Kimbell: Great. Thank you, and thanks, everyone, for joining today. I'd like to close by thanking our 55,000 associates for delivering a strong 2023. Together, I know we will continue to unleash the unique power of beauty and keep moving our business forward in exciting ways. I'm optimistic about the future of Ulta Beauty and confident we will continue to create significant shareholder value. \n I do want to take 1 second to thank Scott again. Scott, as I said, has been an amazing partner to all of us, and I so appreciate his impact and his leadership. And I want to thank those on the call that have the chance to thank him yourself. I know he loved spending time in all of our meetings and all of our earnings calls. It was -- I know he appreciated partnership with all of you, and I do want to thank Scott for everything you've done for our company. Thank you, Scott. \n We look forward to speaking to all of you again when we report results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 on May 30. Thank you again, and have a great night. \nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Kimbell",
            "content": "Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. The Ulta Beauty team delivered strong performance again this quarter with sales, operating margin and EPS all exceeding our internal expectations. Our traffic trends remained healthy. Our brand awareness reached all-time highs, and we drove strong member growth and retention. \n For the quarter, net sales increased 10.2% to $3.6 billion. Operating profit was 14.5% of sales, and diluted EPS was $8.08 per share. Comparable sales increased 2.5%, driven by high single-digit growth from digital channels. Store comp sales increased slightly as we lapped high-teen growth last year. \n A thoughtfully curated assortment, engaging marketing strategies and new fulfillment and technology capabilities, enabled our teams to deliver mid-single-digit comp growth for the holiday period. Our holiday campaign this year centered around the gift is just the beginning, which underscored our belief in the power of beauty and Ulta Beauty. To support the campaign, we created relevant storytelling, which inspired authentic connection, leading to record breaking impressions, significant growth in share of voice and strong social engagement. \n These successful marketing efforts complemented our engaging in-store messaging and events, which focused on bringing beautytainment to guests and building the basket. Compelling content, combined with successful promotional strategies, drove strong new member acquisition and reactivation while increasing shopper -- shopping frequency and retention. \n From a market share perspective, we continue to outpace the growth of the mass market for the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2024, according to Circana data. Our marketing share -- our market share of prestige beauty was more challenged as we lapped strong share growth in 2022 and continue to face pressure from the expansion of beauty -- distribution points in prestige. While competitive intensity has increased, we remain confident our differentiated model and sales-driving strategies will support our ability to capture additional market share over the long term. \n Turning to performance by category. Skincare was our fastest-growing category, delivering double-digit comp growth. Brands leading into relevant trends like BIOMA, Bubble and Good Molecules, which is exclusive to Ulta Beauty, delivered strong growth. Dermatologist-recommended brands also continue to appeal to consumers looking for efficacious products from trusted brands, fueling growth for La Roche-Posay, Dermalogica and Cetaphil. \n The fragrance and bath category also delivered low double-digit comp growth again this quarter. Newness from Valentino, Burberry and Tree Hut and holiday gift sets from consumer favorites, YSL, Gucci and Billie Eilish contributed to strong performance. In addition, in January, we welcomed Sol de Janeiro, a Brazilian-inspired body care brand, to the Ulta Beauty family. Available in 700 stores and online, Sol de Janeiro has quickly become a guest favorite, driving growth in the category. \n Comp sales for the makeup category decreased in the low single-digit range. Softness in prestige cosmetics was partially offset by growth in mass makeup. Lip layering and blush proliferation continue to resonate with beauty enthusiasts. And brands leaning into these trends, including e.l.f., NYX and exclusive brand Juvia's Place, delivered strong growth. While prestige makeup was challenged in totality as we lapped strong growth last year, luxury brands, Dior, NATASHA DENONA and Pat McGrath continue to engage guests. And HOURGLASS, Tarte and Lanco\u0302me saw success with compelling holiday offerings. \n Finally, comp sales for the hair care category decreased in the mid-single-digit range, primarily due to a decline in hair tools and the lapping of strong brand launches in 2022. Products focused on silane and foundational routines drove growth for professional brands Redken, Kenra and Biolage, and interest in hair health and treatments drove increased guest engagement with OUAI, Mielle and Divi. Newer brands, including Shark Beauty and LolaVie also resonated with guests. \n Our services businesses delivered high single-digit growth for this quarter, driven by an increase in transactions. In addition to core styling services, specialty offerings, including extensions, hair treatments, texture services and ear piercing, drove strong engagement with guests. \n Turning now to the full year. Net sales for the year increased 9.8% to $11.2 billion. Comp sales increased 5.7%. Operating profit was 15% of sales. And diluted EPS increased 8.4% to a record $26.03 per share. \n In addition to delivering strong financial results, we also made meaningful progress against our strategic priorities. Let me share highlights of advances made this year. Reflecting our efforts to drive growth through all things beauty, we strengthened our assortment with compelling newness and the expansion of strategic cross-category platforms. Using the consumer lens of how guests experience Ulta Beauty through all of our touch points, we estimate we maintained our share of the total U.S. beauty product industry. \n We launched customer favorite brands, including Dior, Beautycounter and Sol de Janeiro, and introduced emerging and exclusive brands, including Half Magic and Polite Society. We launched Luxury at Ulta Beauty, a strategically curated luxury beauty experience, and we expanded our cross-category platforms. We ended the year with more than half of our brand portfolio certified in at least one Conscious Beauty pillar and continue to drive greater awareness and discovery through unique sample kits and greater marketing support. \n We expanded our Black-owned or founded brands to 50 brands, and welcomed to the second cohort of BIPOC brands to our MUSE Accelerator program, a program designed to help early-stage BIPOC brands prepare for retail readiness. Additionally, we expanded the wellness shop to nearly all stores and refreshed the presentation to inspire and educate guests how to integrate wellness into their everyday lives. \n Turning to our second strategic pillar, All In Your World, we improved the guest experience across all of our touch points. We enhanced our physical footprint, opening 33 new stores and renovating or relocating 25 stores. Our services business delivered double-digit comp growth for the year, increasing frequency with members who already engaged in services while also introducing new members to our offering. And we drove greater experiential shopping through more in-store events focused on engaging and educating the guest about new products, new techniques and the latest beauty trends. \n We also delivered significant improvements in our digital store experience. We successfully transitioned key guest-facing and commerce elements to a new modern architecture, delivering a fresh guest experience across both ulta.com and our app and providing our teams with new tools to optimize the guest experience. These enhancements, combined with our efforts to drive omnichannel member penetration, resulted in high single-digit growth in e-commerce sales and a 30% increase in member utilization of our app. \n To support stronger omnichannel experiences, we continue to improve our buy anywhere fill anywhere capabilities. We expanded same-day delivery to all stores and increased our ship-from-store capabilities to 450 stores. Between BOPIS, same-day delivery and ship-from-store, 37% of our digital orders this year were fulfilled by stores, up from 31% last year. \n Finally, we strengthened our partnership with Target with the introduction of new brands and the opening of 155 additional Ulta Beauty at Target locations, ending the year with 510 shops. And we deepened guest engagement as reflected in growth of new member conversions, reengagement of labs guests and greater loyalty account linkage as well as increased bounce back to Ulta Beauty stores. \n Moving to our third strategic pillar, expanding and deepening guest engagement and loyalty by operating at the heart of the beauty community. Our marketing strategies, media investments and brand-building efforts resulted in record level unaided awareness, brand love and loyalty. To drive awareness and spark deeper connection engagement, we launched the Joy Project, a multiyear brand equity initiative to make beauty and the world a more joyful place. \n We expanded our social media engagement across multiple platforms with new trendsetting series and compelling content, which drove strong engagement, positive social sentiment and share of voice. And we achieved an important milestone. In December, we surpassed 1 million followers on TikTok, reinforcing our position as a social brand leader in beauty. \n With improved member retention, strong new member acquisition and healthy reactivation of lapsed members, we expanded our loyalty program by 8%, ending the year with 43.3 million loyalty members who shopped more frequently and spent more with us on average. Leading into the power of our best-in-class loyalty program in January, we rebranded the program to Ulta Beauty Rewards, featuring a stronger birthday experience and a refreshed look in stores and online and across social to drive greater awareness and deepen connection with our members. We are excited to reward our members with even more of what they love and showcase how much we appreciate them. \n Finally, UB Media, our retail media network, continued to deliver value. This year, we expanded the team, introduced new on-site products and launched an innovative omnichannel solution, which supports the measurement of campaigns across both digital and physical stores. \n Our fourth strategic pillar is to drive operational excellence and optimization to enable us to capture additional market share, fund guest experience enhancements and deliver future profitable growth. \n I am very proud of what our teams accomplished in fiscal 2023, which was an ambitious year of foundational transformation for Ulta Beauty. We completed the retrofit of our Greenwood distribution center, began the retrofit of our Dallas distribution center, opened our Greer market fulfillment center and began work on our Bolingbrook market fulfillment center. We successfully transitioned our Jacksonville, Greer and Chambersburg distribution facilities and key merchandising processes to our new enterprise resource planning platform. And we converted key merchandising and commerce elements of our digital store to a new architecture while maintaining digital operations. \n We built a new enterprise data platform on Google Cloud infrastructure, establishing a modern ecosystem for future analytics and data-driven decision capabilities. And we completed our rollout of new POS systems, including mobile checkout in all stores. \n Our teams enable our success, and we continue to invest and protect and cultivate our world-class culture and talent. This year, we introduced a new leadership competency model, redesigned our succession planning and talent review processes, expanded our associate development offering and completed enterprise-wide training to reinforce inclusivity and address unconscious bias. Associate retention improved across stores, distribution centers and our corporate team. And our 2023 culture survey results reinforce that our overall associate engagement remains strong. \n Finally, we made progress against our sixth strategic pillar to expand our environmental and social impact. We continue to improve the energy efficiency of stores through LED lighting retrofits, HVAC retrofits and energy management system upgrades and established 2030 emissions reduction goals approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. \n I am incredibly proud of what our teams accomplished in 2023. Our teams worked through unexpected challenges with agility and grace, and I'm grateful for their steadfast commitment to deliver value for all stakeholders while also enabling new capabilities for future growth. \n As we look forward, we remain optimistic about the strength and resiliency of the beauty category. Over the last 3 years, the beauty category has experienced unprecedented growth. In 2024, we expect the category will remain healthy, but the growth will moderate to the mid-single-digit range, barring a major economic event. \n Beauty is an attractive category, and competitive intensity continues to increase as channels blur and distribution expands. To protect and expand our leadership position, this year, we expect to advance our transformational agenda with the completion of key projects while also investing in core traffic and experienced drivers to strengthen engagement and enhance the guest experience. \n Starting with our go-to-market strategic pillars, we will innovate, evolve and expand All Things Beauty to excite and engage the beauty enthusiast. To strengthen our differentiated position, we will continue to expand our assortment with compelling and relevant brand launches like Sol de Janeiro and Charlotte Tilbury while also building exclusive emerging brands in our pipeline yet to be announced. \n In addition, this year, we will refresh Ulta Beauty Collection and position the brand as the cornerstone of our conscious beauty platform. And we will continue to enhance and amplify Luxury at Ulta Beauty and across category platforms. \n Reflecting the importance of omnichannel engagement, we will invest in the guest experience across all of our touch points. We will further expand and enhance our physical footprint through additional new stores, remodels and relocations. In all stores, we will focus on enhancing the guest experience through friendly and helpful associates, fast and frictionless fulfillment and engaging services and events while also improving operational excellence through simplification, prioritization and optimizing our store teams. \n We also plan to drive growth across digital platforms as we leverage new capabilities to amplify brand launches and events, drive greater digital discovery and conversion and expand personalization across our digital platforms. And we will expand and enhance our partnership with Target as we support new Ulta Beauty at Target shops, evolve the assortment and deepen member engagement through targeted loyalty strategies. \n Operating at the heart of the beauty community, we intend to expand and deepen guest loyalty and engagement. To support long-term brand equity and drive deeper emotional connection with consumers, we will amplify the Joy Project with a continuous rhythm of engaging activations and drive community through an expanded creator network and affiliate program. We will support brand activations and events to drive new member acquisition while also leveraging our unique data insights to expand our targeting and member engagement. We will evolve our strategic promotional events to inspire and engage our beauty community, drive trips and encourage omnichannel engagement. And we plan to expand the impact and value of UB Media. \n Turning now to our operational excellence and optimization efforts. In fiscal 2024, we plan to complete many of the foundational elements of our transformational agenda, including Project SOAR, Digital Store and the upgrade of our data management capabilities. We also plan to invest in a new martech stack to support our personalization, retail media and overall e-commerce efforts. \n Our supply chain optimization journey will continue as our Bolingbrook market fulfillment center is completed, we continue to retrofit our Dallas distribution center, and we began the retrofit of our remaining full-service DCs in Chambersburg and Fresno. In addition, we intend to leverage our established continuous improvement capabilities to drive additional cost efficiencies with a priority on improving processes to reduce shrink. \n To protect our culture and cultivate our talent while also enabling future business performance, we will continue to invest in our associates and team. We intend to focus on enrichments to the frontline associate experience, enhanced associate learning and development and deepen our DEI impact. \n Turning to our final strategic pillar. We intend to stay focused on our environmental and social impact. Building on progress made in 2023, we plan to implement our road map to achieve our emission reduction goals. \n Finally, I want to share an update on how we are approaching expansion opportunities outside the U.S. International expansion represents an incremental long-term opportunity for Ulta Beauty to extend our reach and leverage our differentiated value proposition. Today, we are excited to announce our planned market entry into Mexico. \n The Mexican beauty market is sizable, growing and has significant beauty opportunity. Our research suggests there is a healthy awareness of the Ulta Beauty brand with local beauty enthusiasts, and we also see strong engagement in stores located in geographically adjacent markets. After extensive evaluation, we prioritized an asset-light partnership approach to enable us to move quickly. And I am excited to announce we have formed a joint venture with Axo, a highly experienced operator of global brands, to launch and operate Ulta Beauty in Mexico in 2025. \n As a result of this partnership approach, we do not expect this venture to be material to our financials in fiscal 2024. For competitive reasons, we're not sharing more details today, but we'll provide updates as appropriate. \n In closing, the Ulta Beauty team delivered strong financial performance in fiscal 2023 while also achieving meaningful progress against our strategic priorities. As we look to 2024, I remain excited about the opportunity to enhance our market leadership and drive profitable growth. We operate in a growing category with strong consumer engagement, and I am confident that our proven differentiated business model, strategic priorities and outstanding, passionate team will enable us to move beauty forward in ways that create values for our shareholders and have a positive impact on our guests, associates and the communities we serve. \n Now as many of you know, this will be Scott's last earnings call. And I want to recognize and thank Scott for his many contributions to Ulta Beauty. He has been an exceptional partner to me and an inspirational leader for our entire team. \n Now today, you will also hear from Paula Oyibo, who will become our CFO on April 1. Paula joined Ulta Beauty in 2019 and is a dynamic finance executive with broad industry experience. She understands our business and our guests, and I know she will have a strong impact on our business going forward. \n And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of our financial results. Scott? Rupesh, thanks for your question, and thanks for calling out, Scott, well deserved. Yes. I'll say on makeup, and I'll even speak a little bit more broadly across all our categories, we are focused on driving growth in every part of our business. Our makeup business in 2023, particularly in the second half, we saw healthy growth on the mass side and more challenges on the prestige side. So we have a strategy to drive performance within all parts of our makeup business. It is our largest segment and obviously important in the beauty category. \n Our efforts are holistic. We've got a number of new brands that we believe will either already are or will add value to the category, including the launch of Charlotte Tilbury, which just rolled out recently, also exclusive brands like Half Magic and Polite Society, Rabanne, innovation from our existing big brands that we'll continue to see that have been so important to our business like Tarte and Benefit and Clinique and Lanco\u0302me on the prestige side. \n Our luxury proposition really launched last year to -- with a lot of success. And as we continue to grow and build our presence in that space, we see that as a contributor. And then through our holistic efforts, we're going to try to find ways to lean into the important trends. Makeup is -- of course, has a key trend component. So whether it's blush, shade, proliferation, lip layering, matte makeup, nail is an important opportunity, we're going to continue to drive that. \n And the last thing I'd say is we continue to revamp and elevate our events that play an important role in mass migration, the number of mass consumers that we've acquired over the years, continuing to introduce them to prestige for the first time. So we're focused on driving that business. We are confident over time that we'll be able to deliver the growth that we expect, and we're working hard to deliver across all parts of that business. I'm just going to say we're really excited about this announcement and really, as I said in the prepared remarks, see Mexico as a great opportunity that's tailor-made for the Ulta Beauty experience. Kecia is leading this effort among many things that she does. So I'm going to ask Kecia to give some more color on it. Well, for the overall category, as I mentioned in the remarks, we're fortunate to be in a category that continues to be healthy, that is highly connected to our consumers, a high level of engagement, that there's an emotional connection that's driving the category and has been for a very long time, and then certainly coming out of COVID, has been exceptionally strong. \n All indicators, as we look at the consumer landscape, is a continued level of engagement. When we look into this year, though, of course, we are evaluating and anticipating and preparing for consumer behavior to continue to evolve. We know there's external pressures on the consumer. We know we're entering into a dynamic time with an election year. \n And what we've seen in this category is strong growth, but as expected, some moderation in that growth. Still above historical trends but some moderation. Simply put, we think consumers, highly engaged in the category but still -- and still passionate about the category but will continue to be thoughtful in all of their spending. But fortunately, we know that beauty is an important one. \n And as a reminder, Ulta Beauty is well positioned to manage through really any kind of economic disruption or challenge given our unique portfolio, all price points, all categories that allow us to meet our consumers' needs if there is a time that they feel more pressure or have other changes. But overall, category healthy. Paula, as it relates to any potential margin changes? Yes. We're really pleased with the progress that we've made. As a reminder for those on the call, this really does represent a way for us to generate positive impact on our business by leveraging the first-party data and insights that we have in partnering with our brands. We're not sharing, we haven't shared and we don't plan to share specific on a number of brands or even specific financial impact at this time. \n But what I will say is we're really pleased with the progress that we've made in 2023 and are confident that we'll continue to grow this part of the business. The network that we have offers advertising access via off-site display, video, social influencers as well as on-site sponsored products. Our on-site display inventory is one of the actually new core offerings that we activated just in 2023. \n So we've got a full suite of ad inventory experiences, value-added services. And as I said, we're confident in its impact going forward. And the support, engagement, reaction from brands has been very positive. As you know, the advertising world continues to evolve. So the value that we can bring through first-party data with 43 million beauty enthusiasts is very meaningful. And we continue to work with our brand partners, and they have demonstrated to us that they see a positive return. And we're continuing to grow that business. Okay. Thanks, Olivia. Yes, I'll talk about new product at our newness pipeline, and then Paula can pick up on your question around margins. So we're -- well, first, I'll say newness is always a critical part of our business and historically has been between 20% to 30% of our sales. And that's an important part of the category and one of the best things about the category. There is a large desire from our beauty enthusiast guests from our members to discover what's new and exciting across all of our categories. \n And so we do have what I believe is a well-balanced portfolio of new brands between big, recognized brands like Charlotte Tilbury as well as a steady stream of emerging brands that are unique or exciting within the Ulta Beauty environment. And so we don't -- we're not going to give any specific numbers about newness this year versus last year. But I will give you a couple of highlights. \n First, you mentioned Charlotte Tilbury. And just to reiterate, that is in 600 stores and online, and we're excited about that. It was one of the top requested brands from our members, and we're pleased to be partnering with them to bring a unique and powerful experience to life. Sol de Janeiro is in 700 stores and also online and also was highly requested and brings just a terrific experience in-store and online and has been very well received since we launched that in January. \n But there's a whole range of products that we're going to continue to launch and bring to life. We do focus, as I said, on emerging brands. And while I'm not going to, for competitive reasons, share some in the pipeline that are ahead of us, I'd highlight some of the brands that we launched last year like LolaVie, Polite Society, Half Magic, a brand like Live Tinted, which has been with us for a little bit, important brands playing an exciting role in driving growth in various categories that we're excited about. And our luxury business that I talked about, we continue to add brands to that throughout the year and see growth. \n So newness is important. We see -- we like the balance that we have. We're excited about the brands that we've launched so far, and I look forward to rolling out more partnerships and bringing newness across our portfolio throughout 2024. Paula, on the margin question? Great. Well, thanks for the question. And yes, luxury, as I said, was one of our -- one of many initiatives last year to drive engagement. And we're really pleased with establishing that more firmly with some of our existing partners, including Chanel, but Dior, NATASHA DENONA, Pat McGrath. And so we see strong performance, and we're really pleased with how our guests are engaging in that part of the business. \n We had a lot of confidence going in because of existing relationships with brands like Chanel. And then by elevating and expanding it, it has really, we believe, met our guests' needs. And they're excited about it. And it further demonstrates our ability to deliver all things beauty from all price points, including luxury. \n We're not sharing any specific launches of anything beyond what I've already shared today. More broadly, as I said, with newness, we have a steady stream of newness throughout the year, and we'll continue to innovate. Specifically within luxury, our focus is continuing to grow in partnership with the brands that we've launched and find new ways to expand those businesses and delight our guests with them. And we're really pleased and proud to have that experience in our stores. So yes, just on the promotional environment, what -- I probably won't answer every one of your detailed questions because we're not going to break it out that way exactly. What I'll say more broadly is we're not expecting that the promotional environment is going to significantly intensify or become irrational. We are in a competitive environment. That's for sure. And we are focused on ensuring that we're delivering on our leadership position. \n So as we look forward, we would anticipate and we have in our plans the ability to drive our business, which includes marketing, store labor, digital experiences and promotional activity as appropriate. But not an expectation more broadly for a significant step. And we do anticipate, as we saw in 2023, that it will still remain well below 2019 levels. \n The mass to mass prestige question, we see opportunity across both parts of the business. Yes, consumers are engaged, and young consumers are engaged in mass, but they're also engaged in prestige. They're loving our luxury experience. So it's really not so much about price or promotion necessarily as what brand is really delivering great innovation, great marketing, engaging with them in social media. Those brands will win and -- regardless of the price points. Paula, do you want to give a little color on some of the 4% to 5%? Great. Thank you, and thanks, everyone, for joining today. I'd like to close by thanking our 55,000 associates for delivering a strong 2023. Together, I know we will continue to unleash the unique power of beauty and keep moving our business forward in exciting ways. I'm optimistic about the future of Ulta Beauty and confident we will continue to create significant shareholder value. \n I do want to take 1 second to thank Scott again. Scott, as I said, has been an amazing partner to all of us, and I so appreciate his impact and his leadership. And I want to thank those on the call that have the chance to thank him yourself. I know he loved spending time in all of our meetings and all of our earnings calls. It was -- I know he appreciated partnership with all of you, and I do want to thank Scott for everything you've done for our company. Thank you, Scott. \n We look forward to speaking to all of you again when we report results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 on May 30. Thank you again, and have a great night."

            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. I will review our fourth quarter financial results before turning it over to Paula Oyibo, who will walk through the outlook for fiscal 2024. \n Financial results for the fourth quarter came in ahead of our expectations across the top and bottom line, reflecting strong holiday performance, growth in other revenue and healthy traffic trends as well as strong execution and focused expense management. Net sales for the quarter increased 10.2%, driven by 2.5% growth in comp sales, strong new store performance, a $25 million increase in other revenue as well as the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2023. Net sales for the 53rd week were $181.9 million. The growth in comp sales was driven by a 4.5% increase in transactions. \n Average ticket declined 1.9%, driven by lower units per transaction, which were partially offset by higher average selling price. Reflecting a more normalized pricing environment, we estimate that product price increases contributed about 100 basis points to the overall comp increase. \n Looking at the cadence of sales through the quarter, comp sales were solid in November and December, reflecting strong holiday performance. As expected, sales were more challenged in January as we lap the exceptional results from our strongest month in fiscal 2022. \n During the quarter, we opened 13 new stores, relocated 2, remodeled 2 stores and closed 2 stores. For the quarter, gross margin increased 10 basis points to 37.7% of sales. The increase was driven by strong growth in other revenue, lower shipping rates and leverage of supply chain costs, which were largely offset by lower merchandise margin. Our efforts to grow other revenue continue to yield benefits with performance driven by increased credit card income, greater loyalty point redemptions and royalties earned through our Target partnership. \n At the same time, we realized benefits from our supply chain optimization efforts as our carrier diversification strategy drove improved profitability. As anticipated, merchandise margin was pressured during the quarter, reflecting the lapping of benefits from price increases, increased promotionality as well as the impact from brand mix. These pressures were partially offset by ongoing category management efforts. The impact of promotional activity was above last year but continues to be well below 2019 levels. \n Notably, shrink was flat during the quarter, slightly better than our expectations, reflecting the impact of our investments this year in training, labor and new fragrance fixtures. For the full year, shrink as a percentage of sales increased 40 basis points. \n Moving to expenses. SG&A increased 7.6% to $820 million. Overall, SG&A spend was better than planned due to focused expense management and a shift in timing of certain strategic investments. As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased 50 basis points to 23.1% compared to 23.6% last year, primarily due to lower incentive compensation and leverage of marketing expenses and store payroll and benefits, which was partially offset by deleverage of corporate overhead and store expenses. \n Incentive compensation drove 40 basis points of leverage in the quarter, reflecting operational performance that was more in line with our internal targets compared to last year's significant outperformance. In addition to the impact of higher sales, marketing expense leverage was driven by the timing of advertising expenses, while store payroll and benefits leverage reflected fewer payroll hours per store, which more than offset ongoing wage rate pressures. \n Offsetting these benefits, corporate overhead expense deleveraged during the quarter, primarily reflecting investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, Digital Store and other IT capabilities and UB Media. For the full year, we invested $62 million of incremental spend to support our strategic initiatives, which was at the lower end of our expectations, reflecting the shift in timing of certain projects into 2024. \n Finally, store expenses also deleveraged, driven by investments to support merchandising initiatives as well as ongoing inflationary pressures across the business. Operating margin was 14.5% of sales compared to 13.9% last year. The company's tax rate decreased to 24.2% compared to 24.6% in the fourth quarter last year. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to benefits from a decrease in state income taxes. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 21% to $8.08 compared to $6.68 last year. The EPS impact of the 53rd week was $0.46. \n To recap the full year, net sales increased 9.8% to $11.2 billion. Comp sales increased 5.7%, driven by a 7.4% increase in transactions and a 1.5% decrease in average ticket. We estimate that product price increases contributed about 200 basis points to the overall comp increase for the year. Operating profit was 15% of sales, with deleverage coming evenly from gross margin and SG&A. And diluted EPS increased 8.4% to a record $26.03 per share. \n Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 8.6% to $1.7 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 30 net new stores, the increase reflects inventory to support new brand launches, the new market fulfillment center in Greer, South Carolina as well as the impact of product cost increases. \n Our well-established business model continues to generate significant cash from operations, including nearly $1.5 billion in fiscal 2023. Our capital allocation approach remains consistent. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business to drive future growth, followed by returning excess cash to our shareholders. \n In fiscal 2023, we invested $435 million in capital expenditures, including approximately $178 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures; $124 million for IT; $73 million for supply chain; and $60 million for store maintenance and other. Depreciation for the year was $244 million compared to $241 million last year and primarily reflects the ongoing shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense. \n During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 352,000 shares at a cost of $159 million, bringing total share repurchase to 1 billion for the full year. Since launching our stock buyback program in 2014, we've purchased more than 18 million shares at a weighted average price of $313, effectively returning $5.8 billion to shareholders while continuing to invest in strategic growth drivers. \n Before I turn the call over to Paula, I want to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to our teams for delivering these strong results for our shareholders this year and throughout my tenure with Ulta Beauty. It has been an honor to serve as the company's CFO and a privilege to lead and serve alongside such talented associates. I'm excited to pass the baton to Paula, who I know will be an excellent leader and steward of Ulta Beauty's business going forward."

            "name": "Kecia Steelman",
            "content": "Yes, absolutely. Well, after careful evaluation of many market opportunities, we really felt like the Mexican market is the next step for Ulta Beauty for us to have this partnership with Axo. And we're really excited about this. I know that the future is going to be really bright in this partnership. We've spent a lot of time with their teams from a cultural perspective, also just even from the best-in-class performance with global partners that they've brought to the Mexico consumer -- the Mexican consumer. \n Our border stores are performing really, really well. And I just think it's the next natural step for us as we continue to expand internationally. So we are really excited about this. Again, we are planning to be operational in 2025. The cost of this is built into the guidance in '24. So we don't feel like it's very material. But we're super excited and feel that Axo is the right partner for us to launch in this next new territory for us. Yes. So in regards to like where we are on the investments and where we are in the projects for our ERP upgrade or what we're internally calling as Project SOAR, just this week, we completed our Dallas DC. And we have plans to wrap up Greenwood and Fresno and open up our new MFC in Bolingbrook, which is a relocation of the existing FFC in Romeoville before peak this year. Part of the ERP upgrade, we're also transitioning our store systems and our merchandising systems. And we have those plans to be completed before the second half, again prior to peak. \n For supply chain in '24, we are continuing to invest in our automation capabilities. And I mentioned already the MFC in Bolingbrook hits on our supply chain lines and then also finishing out that retrofit in Dallas -- the Dallas DC. And then for the Digital Store of the Future, so our Digital Store platform, we expect that to be completed in the first half of 2024. And we're wrapping up all of our upgrades around our analytical tools and reporting capabilities. So bottom line, we continue to be on track and on our budget, and we are all in on wrapping these foundational enabling systems up this year."

            "name": "Paula Oyibo",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott. I am honored and humbled to be assuming the position of Chief Financial Officer at Ulta Beauty, and I am excited to lead our talented finance organization and to drive Ulta Beauty's next phase of growth. I want to thank Scott for his mentorship over the years and wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement. I look forward to working with those on the call today and meeting those of you I have not yet met. \n Before we talk about our expectations for fiscal 2024, I want to share 2 capital allocation update. First, yesterday, we amended our revolver agreement to $800 million and extended the term to 2029. Reflecting the current rate environment, we reduced the size of the revolver to lower the impact of higher fees but retain flexibility to upsize the capacity if needed. Second, having essentially completed the authorization announced in March 2022, today, we announced a new share repurchase authorization for $2 billion. \n Now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2024. We expect net sales will be in the range of $11.7 billion to $11.8 billion with comp sales growth expected to be between 4% and 5%. We anticipate comp growth will be in the low single-digit range in the first half and then increase to mid-single-digit growth in the second half of the year. We expect operating margin will be between 14% and 14.3% of sales, primarily driven by SG&A deleverage as we complete many of the foundational elements of our transformational agenda and move to investments to enable growth, operationalize the investments made in 2023, manage ongoing wage pressures and support core traffic and experienced drivers. \n In total, we expect SG&A growth for the year will moderate into the high single-digit range from 12.5% growth in fiscal 2023. We expect SG&A growth in the first half will be in the low double-digit range as we annualize investment spend in 2023 and complete key milestones of our transformational agenda and then slow to mid-single-digit growth in the second half. We expect gross margin for the year will be down modestly as lower merchandise margin and deleverage of supply chain costs are partially offset by other revenue. \n Our assumptions result in a diluted earnings guidance in the range of $26.20 to $27 per share. We are planning EPS to decline in the first half and then accelerate to high single-digit growth in the second half of the year. For modeling purposes, we expect operating margin to be the most challenged in the first quarter with meaningful deleverage across SG&A and gross margins. \n Finally, we plan to spend between $415 million and $490 million in CapEx, including approximately $270 million to $282 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures; $120 million to $155 million for supply chain and IT; and $45 million to $53 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be between $275 million and $280 million. \n We believe the outlook for the beauty category is bright, and we are confident our strategic framework and strong financial foundation will enable us to drive long-term growth and shareholder returns. \n Before we take your questions, I want to announce that we plan to host an investor event here in Chicago this fall to share our longer-term plans and outlook. We will share more of the logistical details later this summer. \n And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A. Yes. What I would say is our merchandise margin, I would remind, we are meaningfully higher and better, our merchandise margin since 2019. And really that has a lot to do with we are a much healthier business now, and we have -- our mix in our business between our categories as well as prestige and mass through category performance efforts over the years has really helped us be able to be flexible as the consumer shifts between various categories as well as between mass and prestige. And so we believe that our -- we're able to manage that dynamic. Thanks, Susan. We are planning to open between 60 and 65 net new stores in fiscal 2024. That puts our growth between the 2-year period at 90 to 95, which is generally in line with the 100 that we had communicated. And so our thinking hasn't materially changed there. \n We remain confident in our ability to open and operate between 1,500 and 1,700 traditional Ulta Beauty freestanding locations in the U.S. And we're optimistic the small format store prototype could give us an opportunity for additional growth, as does the partnership with Target and then similarly as we're excited about the additional opportunity with our international expansion into Mexico. Related to the small geographies, we are planning to open 10 small store formats in 2024. Yes. So from an operating margin perspective, we shared 14% to 14.3% of sales. And that is mostly deleverage coming from SG&A as we complete many of our foundational elements of our transformation agenda and move to investments to enable growth as well as we operationalize the investments that we made to date and those go into one state. We also are managing ongoing wage pressures, which is assumed in the guidance. And we also will continue to support core traffic and experienced drivers. \n And so as you think about SG&A growth for the year, it will moderate into the high single-digit range from the 12.5% growth we saw in fiscal 2023. And then we do expect gross margin to be down modestly as lower merchandise margin and deleverage from supply chain costs are partially offset by the growth we see and expect in other revenue. Yes, Michael, I'll start with some of the numbers and then turn it over to Kecia so she can give a little bit more flavor for where we are. So we had an incremental $55 million in 2022 related to our transformational strategic investments. We communicated $62 million incremental in 2023. As you think about 2024, we expect limited incremental investment as we complete the foundational elements of our transformational agenda. Think about Project SOAR, Digital Store and other IT projects. \n But as I communicated, once we complete those particular systems, these upgraded systems roll into our core operations and become a part of our base, and there's run costs associated to that. So there is run cost associated with those foundational investments. We will continue to invest to enable growth as well as the other items that I mentioned regarding wage pressures and investing in traffic and experienced drivers. Kecia? Sure. Adrienne, on your question with regards to expectation around ASP, what I would share is that we are planning for a more normalized pricing environment in 2024."

Dave? \nDavid Kimbell: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. I'll start today with comments about our CFO transition plans and then discuss our third quarter performance. Then Scott will review the financial results and our outlook. \n Starting with the succession plans we announced this afternoon. After nearly 20 years with Ulta Beauty and more than a decade as CFO, Scott Settersten has shared with us his decision to retire, effective April 1, 2024. From his early days helping take Ulta Beauty public and throughout the last 10 years as CFO, Scott's impact on Ulta Beauty has been tremendous. He's been a passionate steward of our business, and the strong and constant shareholder returns achieved during his tenure are a testament to his leadership and disciplined approach to driving profitable growth. \n I want to express my sincere gratitude to Scott for his partnership and his remarkable contributions to our business. He has been an exceptional partner to me and an inspirational leader for our team across the company. \n With Scott's retirement, I'm very pleased to announce that Paula Oyibo will be our next Chief Financial Officer. Paula is a dynamic finance executive with broad industry experience, and I am confident she is the right leader for this next chapter of Ulta Beauty's growth. Since joining the company in 2019, she has established herself as a trusted partner and visionary leader. Her deep understanding of our business, experience leading large finance organizations and strong commitment to nurturing talent with an inclusive culture make her the ideal person to serve as Ulta Beauty's next CFO. Paula will be a great addition to our dynamic executive team, and I look forward to partnering with her as we continue our growth journey. \n This announcement represents another great succession story for Ulta Beauty. I am grateful to Scott for being intentional and thoughtful in ensuring we have a seamless plan for this critical leadership role. And I am excited that Paula will bring her business-first mindset, influence and energy to the executive team. \n Okay. Now let's talk about our third quarter performance. The Ulta Beauty team delivered strong performance again this quarter, with sales, gross profit and EPS all exceeding our internal expectations. Our traffic trends remain healthy. Our brand awareness and loyalty program reached all-time highs, and our transformational initiatives are on track. I want to thank all Ulta Beauty associates for maintaining their focus on creating great guest experiences and delivering these results while executing against our transformational agenda. \n For the quarter, net sales increased 6.4% to $2.5 billion. Operating profit was 13.1% of sales and diluted EPS was $5.07 per share. Comparable sales increased 4.5%. \n As discussed on prior calls, we expected the sales growth to moderate from the first half as we lapped 2 years of strong double-digit comp growth. Comp sales growth for the quarter was driven by approximately 10% growth from our digital channels. Stores delivered low single-digit comps as we lapped high-teen growth last year. Store traffic remained healthy, increasing in the high single-digit range. \n Turning to performance by category. Skincare was again our fastest-growing category, driven by double-digit growth in mass and prestige segments. Beauty enthusiasts have maintained their skincare routines while also experimenting with new regimens. Consumer interest in moisturizers, serums and cleansers is driving growth, and brands leaning into these trends like Drunk Elephant, Good Molecules and COSRX contributed to our strong results. Dermatologist-recommended brands also continued to resonate, driving growth for brands like La Roche-Posay, Cetaphil and Dermalogica.\n The fragrance and bath category delivered low double-digit growth. Newness from Ariana Grande, Burberry and YSL contributed to the category's performance. Prestige brands Valentino and Carolina Herrera, and luxury brands CHANEL and Dior also drove meaningful growth.  \n Sales in the makeup category were flat, with mid-single-digit growth in mass makeup offsetting a modest decline in prestige makeup. New brands like Dior and Natasha Denona and Beautycounter, and existing brands with compelling newness and innovation, including e.l.f., Juvia's Place, MAC and OPI, all delivered growth during the quarter. While many mass brands continue to benefit from engaging newness and social engagement, our prestige makeup business was more challenged as we continue to lap the strong impact of last year's Fenty launch. \n Finally, comp sales for the hair care category decreased in the low single-digit range, primarily driven by a decline in hair tools. Newer brands, including exclusive brand LolaVie and Shark Beauty and Donna's Recipe as well as newness from Not Your Mother's and [ Way ] delivered growth for the category. Trend-relevant products from Redken and Biolage resonated strongly with guests while social virality drove growth for IGK and Mielle. \n Comparing to mass beauty dollar sales for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023, we continued to outpace the growth of the mass market according to Circana data. In prestige beauty, our share gains in skin care and fragrance were offset by softness in makeup and hair according to Circana. \n From a channel perspective, we gained prestige beauty share across digital channels, but were more challenged in brick-and-mortar channels, reflecting the impact of increased distribution for prestige beauty. While these dynamics increased competitive intensity in the short term, we are confident our sales-driving strategies will support our ability to capture more market share over the long term.\n Our services business delivered high single-digit comp growth, primarily driven by engagement in core services, including haircuts, blowouts and makeup services. Ear piercing, one of our newer services, also performed well, and salon backbar takeovers, which give our stylists an opportunity to introduce brands to guests, continued to drive product attachment and new guest acquisition for participating brands. \n Unlike other discretionary retail categories, the U.S. beauty category has consistently driven growth over time. Based on data from Euromonitor, in the 15 years prior to the pandemic, the U.S. beauty category grew in the low to mid-single-digit range every year except during the Great Recession, when the category experienced low single-digit declines, and in 2020, when the category declined 6%. In 2021 and 2022, the category experienced unprecedented double-digit growth as consumers recovered from the pandemic. And as we lap the strong growth this year, consumer spend has remained healthy. While we expect growth will continue to normalize to historic ranges, we remain confident the category will continue to grow, barring a macroeconomic event. \n In addition to factors that have driven the category historically, including a strong emotional connection with consumers, newness and innovation, and societal changes, today, consumers are thinking differently about the role beauty can play in their wellness routine, which we believe will drive increased usage for the category. \n As we think about the opportunity to expand our market leadership and drive long-term profitable growth, our strategic framework guides our priorities and focus. Let me share some highlights on the progress made this quarter. \n Starting with our efforts to drive growth with an expanded definition of All Things Beauty. During the quarter, we enhanced our assortment with trend relevant brands in every category. In makeup, we introduced a luxury brand, Pat McGrath Labs, expanded our presence with MAC to nearly all stores, launched several exclusive and innovative brands, including Half Magic, Polite Society and Rabanne.\n In skin care, we launched PanOxyl, a dermatologist-recommended brand popular with Gen Z. In haircare, we launched Shark Beauty, an innovative brand of hair styling tools at accessible price points. And in fragrance, we launched Snif, an emerging brand offering gender-neutral scents available only at Ulta Beauty.\n Building on our long-term partnership with CHANEL and other luxury fragrance brands, we see an opportunity to expand our luxury offering into makeup and skincare. In Q1, we launched luxury at Ulta Beauty, and our member analytics confirms that our new luxury assortment is driving incrementality and increased spend per member. \n In addition to strengthening our core assortment, we are leaning into broader trends in beauty through our cross-category platforms. We continue to expand our Conscious Beauty platform. At the end of the quarter, more than half of our brand portfolio was certified in at least one pillar, with 260 brands certified in more than one pillar. Newly-certified brands include COSRX, Loving Tan and Polite Society. \n We also increased our portfolio of BIPOC brands, welcoming Pat McGrath Labs, CurlMix, Better World Fragrance House by Drake and Pound Cake to the portfolio. And we expanded our wellness assortment with the launch of at-home spa tools from LUV SCRUB, Solawave and Skin Gym. \n In addition, we expanded the wellness shop to an additional 500 stores and refreshed the presentation with elevated aesthetics, improved navigation and more storytelling graphics to inspire and educate our guests how to connect to wellness in their everyday lives. Guests are moving effortlessly between physical and digital channels, and we are investing to enhance the guest experience across all touch points. \n We have been on a multiyear digital transformation journey to upgrade our infrastructure and deliver a more engaging and seamless digital guest experience while also positioning future growth. In August, we completed a significant step in this process with the transition of our digital commerce experience, including cart [ emotions ], checkout and member account data to our new architecture.\n Overall, our team successfully executed these changes, and I am pleased to report our new digital experience performed very well over the high demand Thanksgiving weekend, including Cyber Monday. The modernization of our digital technology ecosystem is nearly complete, enabling us to elevate and optimize our existing guest experience while driving digital innovation, utilizing a modern, agile approach. \n In addition to our digital platforms, we are also enhancing our in-store experiences. Our member data demonstrates that an excellent guest experience drives spend, increased frequency and creates lasting loyalty. This quarter, we launched a refreshed guest engagement model, which elevates the guest experience through authentic engagement, helpful experiences and friendly interactions to create a genuine human connection. While still early, we are encouraged by the improving trends in guest satisfaction scores.\n We continue to expand and enhance the Ulta Beauty at Target experience. We opened 89 Ulta Beauty at Target shops during the quarter, ending the quarter with 510 shops. This quarter, we were excited to launch Fenty Beauty, delighting our guests with a new way to shop this fan favorite brand.  Created exclusively for Ulta Beauty at Target, the Fenty Snackz assortment features a curated lineup of best-selling must-haves, minis, and unique sets. And just in time for holiday, we launched a curated assortment of Dyson hair tools in select stores and exclusive holiday sampler kits in all Ulta Beauty at Target shops. \n Beauty is an emotionally-driven category, and we are investing to drive greater love, loyalty and connection with Ulta Beauty. We continue to strengthen the Ulta Beauty brand. Unaided brand awareness increased to a record level this quarter, with meaningful gains among Gen Z and millennial beauty consumers. We also expanded the connection guest field for Ulta Beauty as measured by significant growth in brand love. These gains reflect the impact of our strategic brand building efforts as well as our marketing actions to support key promotional events and brand launches. \n At Ulta Beauty, our mission is to use the power of beauty to bring to light the possibilities that lie within each of us. Building on our commitment to make beauty a force for good, we've created The Joy Project, a multiyear initiative to make beauty and the world a more joyful place. We launched The Joy Project in September with an integrated campaign across national TV, PR, social media and our owned channels.  In addition, we created a training curriculum for transforming the way our associates think about self-confidence, and to give them tools to empower our guests to do the same. \n In October, we expanded The Joy Project while reinforcing our role at the intersection of beauty and culture as the exclusive beauty partner for TikTok's first ever beauty month. Grounded in TikTok's theme of reclaimed joy, this month-long activation leveraged creator content and events, premium platform advertising placements and custom filters that allowed users to see their inner joy. \n We continue to adjust our promotional strategies as the category normalizes and consumers navigate rising cost pressures. Responding to consumer needs and competitive shifts, we continue to evolve our key tentpole events like 21 Days of Beauty, while also deploying new offers with more relevant storytelling to drive sales and traffic. While our promotional activity increased this quarter, our targeting capabilities and promo optimization efforts enabled us to manage the financial impact. Notably, overall promotional levels remained meaningfully below 2019 levels. \n Turning to our loyalty program. We ended the quarter with 42.2 million active members, 8% higher than last year, driven primarily by improving member retention and new member acquisition. Spend per member remains healthy, driven by greater shopper frequency. As we engage members with exclusive promotions, point accelerators and personalized content and recommendations, we are driving engagement spend and frequency. These targeted efforts are also enabling us to elevate more members to our Platinum and Diamond tiers. Compared to last year, the number of Platinum and Diamond members has increased more than 20%. \n Turning now to our efforts to drive operational excellence and optimization. We are executing a multiyear transformation agenda intended to unlock new capabilities and efficiencies to fuel our growth. In addition to the digital store progress achieved this quarter, we continued to advance our road map in other key areas. We completed the retrofit of our Greenwood distribution center, began shipping to stores and fulfilling e-commerce orders from our new Greer market fulfillment center, and transitioned our Chambersburg distribution center to our new ERP platform.\n Our teams have delivered several major milestones this year, and we are on track to complete many of our transformational projects next year. We plan to complete the transition of our digital store in the first half of 2024, and we expect to complete the upgrade of our ERP platform and the expansion of our data management systems in the second half of 2024. \n We will advance our supply chain optimization efforts next year with the continuation of our Dallas DC retrofit, as well as the conversion of our Romeoville, Illinois fast fulfillment center to a new market fulfillment center. \n Finally, as the nation's leading specialty beauty retailer, we strive to be good stewards of our environment. Reflecting our commitment to leave a positive legacy, I am excited to share we have established emission reduction goals approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. Details of our commitments are available in the ESG section of our investor website. \n Shifting now to our plans and expectations for holiday. The holiday is off to a good start, but we know the biggest selling weeks are still ahead of us. Our insights suggest that consumers are ready to celebrate even as they navigate in an uncertain economic environment. With our diverse assortments and convenient omnichannel touch points, we are well positioned to help our guests celebrate this season. \n Our holiday campaign this year is \"The gift is just the beginning,\" which underscores our belief in the power of beauty and Ulta Beauty. While a gift can be a signature fragrance or an innovative hair tool, beauty can also be the gift of self-care, fun and joy. Through this campaign, we're celebrating the moments that make the holiday special: family, friends, connections, joy and pairing them with the perfect gifts.\n Our merchants have thoughtfully created a holiday assortment of exclusive first-to-market items along with iconic classics. With products across mass, prestige and luxury, we offer guests both value-first and splurge-worthy items to help them find perfect budget-friendly gifts for others or themselves. \n Our store teams are ready to bring the holiday to life for our guests. Our new POS system enables associates to easily order items not currently available in their store, and our new mobile POS tools provide guests with an elevated and faster checkout process. And with BOPIS and same-day delivery options in every store, it's never been easier or more convenient to shop at Ulta Beauty. Our teams have been working hard all year to ensure Ulta Beauty is ready to bring joy to our guests this holiday season, and I am proud of how well they are executing for our guests. \n While the beauty category will likely be a bit more promotional this holiday season, I'm confident our marketing and assortment strategies combined with new capabilities will position us to deliver another successful holiday.\n In closing, the beauty category remains healthy and consumer engagement remains high. We remain confident in the resilience and power of beauty and in our ability to drive market share and profitable growth. \n And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? \nScott Settersten: Thanks, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone. I want to echo Dave's sentiments and thank the Ulta Beauty team for delivering third quarter financial results that were ahead of our internal expectations. \n Solid sales growth supported by strong guest traffic and new store sales performance helped to mitigate some of the unique margin pressures we faced in the third quarter and enabled us to deliver gross margin modestly ahead of plan. SG&A spend was in line with expectations, resulting in operating margin of 13.1%. \n Turning to the P&L. Net sales for the quarter increased 6.4%, driven by 4.5% growth in comp sales, strong new store performance and solid growth in other revenue. Transactions for the quarter increased 5.9%, driven by healthy traffic across both channels. Average ticket decreased 1.4% as the decline in average units per transaction more than offset the impact of a higher average selling price. \n While retail price increases remain a benefit to our comp performance, the overall environment continues to normalize, and we are seeing the extraordinary pricing benefits from last year continue to roll off. We estimate price increases contributed less than 200 basis points to the overall comp in the third quarter. \n During the quarter, we opened 12 new stores and relocated 2 stores. In addition, we remodeled 11 stores. \n Q3 gross margin decreased 130 basis points to 39.9% compared to 41.2% last year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower merchandise margin, higher inventory shrink and higher supply chain costs, which were partially offset by strong growth in other revenue. Overall merchandise margin was lower, primarily due to lapping the timing benefit of retail price changes last year as well as increased promotional activity this year. While promotional activity continues to normalize, the overall financial impact remains meaningfully below 2019 levels.\n Inventory shrink continued to be a headwind. Our efforts to address shrink appear to be stabilizing the impact, but the overall environment remains challenging. In addition to new fragrance fixtures, which have been installed in nearly 3/4 of the store fleet, we continue to invest in associate training, staffing and operational improvements to mitigate the impact of shrink. And we continue to work with our retail industry partners to influence macro changes aimed at improving the overall environment. \n Supply chain costs were higher during the quarter, reflecting depreciation related to investments in our supply chain transformation, as well as the recent opening of our new market fulfillment center in South Carolina. These gross margin pressures were partially offset by strong growth in other revenue, primarily due to growth in both credit card income and royalty income from our Target partnership. \n SG&A increased 10.8% to $661.4 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 110 basis points to 26.6% compared to 25.5% last year, primarily due to higher corporate overhead, greater store expenses, investments in store payroll and benefits as well as higher marketing expense, which more than offset lower incentive compensation. Corporate overhead expenses were higher in the quarter primarily due to investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, Digital Store, other IT capabilities and UB Media. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we have invested about 75% of our planned $60 million to $70 million of incremental spend to support our strategic initiatives. \n Store expenses were higher in the quarter, reflecting ongoing inflationary pressures across the business. The increase in store payroll and benefits was primarily due to the impact of planned investments in average wage rates. Higher marketing expenses in the quarter were largely driven by increased investments to drive member acquisition, loyalty and brand awareness across key channels, including social, video and streaming. \n Lower incentive compensation was a benefit in the quarter, reflecting operational performance that is more in line with our internal targets compared to last year's significant outperformance. Operating income for the quarter declined 9.6% to $327.2 million. As a percentage of sales, operating margin decreased 240 basis points to 13.1% compared to 15.5% last year. Diluted earnings per share decreased 5.1% to $5.07 per share compared to $5.34 per share last year. \n Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. Total inventory increased 9.8% to $2.3 billion, compared to $2.1 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 31 additional stores, the increase reflects inventory to support higher demand and the stocking of our new market fulfillment center in South Carolina, as well as new brand launches and product cost increases. \n Capital expenditures were $106 million for the quarter, reflecting investments in new and existing stores as well as supply chain and IT investments to support our transformational agenda. Depreciation was $61.4 million in the quarter compared to $58.5 million last year. We repurchased approximately 687,000 shares at a cost of $281.5 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 1.8 million shares at a cost of $840.5 million. \n During the quarter, we drew on our revolving credit facility to support our ongoing capital allocation priorities, including share repurchases and capital expenditures during a period in the year when our working capital needs peak as we build inventory for holiday. I would note our recent activity does not reflect a change in our capital allocation philosophy, rather a lever to short -- support short-term cash needs. We ended the quarter with $195.4 million in short-term debt and $121.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. \n Moving to our outlook. We are narrowing our sales and EPS guidance for fiscal 2023 to reflect our actual performance through the first 3 quarters of the year and our expectations for Q4. We expect net sales for the year will be between $11.1 billion and $11.15 billion, with comp sales growth between 5% and 5.5%. For the year, we continue to plan to open approximately 25 to 30 net new stores and remodel or relocate 20 to 30 stores. Our expectations for operating margin for the year remains unchanged at between 14.6% and 14.8% of sales, with deleverage to come from both gross margin and SG&A, with slightly more deleverage coming from SG&A. Reflecting these assumptions, we now expect diluted EPS for the year will be between $25.20 and $25.60. \n We have refined our expectations for Q4 to reflect the expected resilience of the beauty category as well as potential risks from cautious consumer spending, increased points of distribution for prestige beauty and higher promotional activity. We continue to expect comp sales will be flat to up modestly for the fourth quarter. We still have several important weeks left in the holiday season and the operating environment continues to be dynamic. \n In addition, we are lapping the exceptional results last year, including an incredibly strong January, which was our strongest monthly comp sales performance of fiscal 2022. For modeling purposes, we now expect gross margin to deleverage modestly and operating margin to be flat to down compared to last year. \n One final update. We now expect to spend between $400 million and $425 million in CapEx in fiscal 2023, including approximately $180 million for supply chain and IT, $170 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, and about $60 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be around $245 million. We now expect share repurchases to be approximately $950 million.\n Our teams delivered another solid quarter amidst a dynamic operating environment. As we look ahead, we are focused on delivering our plans for the holiday season and finalizing our plans for next year. We will share more about our expectations for fiscal 2024 when we report our year-end results. But we remain confident. We are well positioned to deliver performance in line with our financial targets of 3% to 5% comp sales growth and 14% to 15% operating margin, with EPS growth next year reflecting the lapping of an extra week in fiscal 2023. \n Before I turn it over to our operator to moderate the Q&A, I want to take a moment to say thank you. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve as CFO for this special company for more than a decade. I look forward to passing the baton to Paula Oyibo, who I've worked with closely over the last several years. We will continue to work together over the coming months to ensure a smooth transition. Thank you again. \n And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. \nDana Telsey: Congratulations on the nice results. And Scott, congratulations on such a wonderful tenure at Ulta, and looking forward to your next chapter. And Paula, congratulations on the new role.\n As all of you think about the beauty category, which obviously has such resiliency and your sales up around 6%, how do you feel on the category trends with makeup and what we see there as that evolves going into next year, product newness, pricing? How do you parse it together?\n And looking at the gross margin and SG&A levers, the lower merchandise margin that you had and the higher shrink, how do you see that evolving going forward? And what's changing in the promotional and pricing area? \nDavid Kimbell: Great. Well, thanks for those nice comments about Scott and Paula, and I appreciate that. And I'll start with some thoughts about the beauty category and makeup specifically, to answer your question there, and then maybe Scott can pick up on the gross margin. \n As I mentioned in my comments, we remain very confident about the long-term future of the beauty category for all the reasons I highlighted, a steady stream of compelling newness, high level of engagement, emotional connection. The connection between wellness and beauty that's stronger than ever coming out of the pandemic give us confidence more broadly in beauty.\n And then makeup specifically is an important part of that. And while the makeup category for us was essentially flat for the quarter, we are confident in the future of that important part of our business. We see strong positive trends, a high level of engagement across all demographic groups. And as we get into both completing this fourth quarter and moving into next year, we're confident in what we'll drive driving our makeup business. \n Some of the actions that we've taken specifically in make up to drive this business forward, continuing to launch several new exclusive makeup brands, brands like Half Magic, which was created by the Euphoria makeup artist; Polite Society, a prestige brand, exclusive again to Ulta, from the creators of Too Faced; Rabanne, which is a contemporary Spanish fashion brand, launching into cosmetics exclusively at Ulta. We're just getting started with those 3 exclusive brands at Ulta Beauty. We continue to see strength with MAC, and we've expanded that into nearly all doors. Strong growth on key mass brands like e.l.f. and with great compelling innovation within that segment of the makeup business.\n I talked in my remarks about luxury and we're -- while we've expanded that throughout the year, we feel like we're just getting started there. We launched -- expanded CHANEL, launched Dior and Natasha Denona this year, and then added Pat McGrath in the third quarter. \n In new items with existing brands continue to make a difference in the category, and we're confident in what's ahead. A couple of recent examples: Tarte's Shape Tape Radiant Concealer, exclusive at Ulta Beauty; Juvia's Place blush liquid -- blushes, exclusive at Ulta; and newness from other existing brands like Clinique, Benefit, Anastasia, NYX, Maybelline, go down the list. \n So we're confident. We're lapping the biggest launch we had, with Fenty from 2022. But as we look forward, we see as both the items that we've launched and more newness coming as we enter into 2024, we're confident and optimistic both in the consumer engagement in makeup and beauty in general and our specific strategies to drive growth. \n Scott, do you want to talk about margins? \nScott Settersten: Sure. Thanks, Dana. So I'll give you a little bit more maybe than you were thinking about when you initially put this question together because I'm sure it's on other investors' minds as well. \n So thinking about '24 and beyond. And again, this is directional, in no particular order, but I kind of start with the headwinds. So supply chain transformation will continue to be a tougher compare for us as we think about next year as we continue to build out in and work through our distribution centers across the country.\n E-commerce mix, we've talked about. Again, it's been a bit of a benefit for us the last couple of years. We expect e-commerce to grow at a higher rate than brick-and-mortar next year and the years to come, and so that will be a headwind for us in gross margin. Again, we've got ways to mitigate that now that we didn't have back in 2019, namely BOPIS, ship from store and same-day delivery. \n So those would be the headwinds. I'd say promotionality is something I call kind of a TBD. So again, 2023 has been a bit of a deleverage point for us because we're getting back into a more normal environment. It's yet to be seen on how 2024 will shake out. So that's something we'll have to navigate. \n On the plus side, you mentioned a couple. Well, other revenue, #1 again. 2023, it's been a big tailwind for us. We would expect that to continue, although moderating a bit in '24. Cycling over price increases this year has been a major headwind to the business in the gross margin line. That will moderate as we get into -- deeper into 2024 and cycle through some of that.\n Shrink, we called out third quarter. We're gaining on it a little bit. Again, it's not mission accomplished by any stretch of the imagination, but we do feel like we've got tactics in place now that will help us get that better managed. UB Media, [ it's and ] as that business continues to scale up, we expect that to be a margin benefit for us. And then, of course, fixed cost, again, in the third quarter a bit of an anomaly with some of the repair and maintenance expenses that we absorb, but over the long term, we expect to be able to kind of leverage fixed store cost on a 3% to 5% comp. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. \nLorraine Maikis: You mentioned some brick-and-mortar share loss in prestige in the quarter. Can you talk about strategies, brand launches, marketing that you're working on to defend the share and return to growth? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Lorraine. Yes, yes, we -- it is our objective to gain share across all parts of our business, and we did -- we feel positive about that in many parts, including our mass business, our prestige skin care, our prestige fragrance business, our prestige e-commerce business. But brick-and-mortar was pressured, and we think that's largely due to expanded points of distribution. There are hundreds more brick-and-mortar locations in the market now than there were even just a couple of years ago. \n And -- but what we see is more of a short-term impact from this competitive -- kind of the competitive pressure. Historically, as we've seen new locations open near our existing locations, there's a short-term modest impact. But relatively quickly, our stores are able to rebound and recover and to drive growth, share growth over time. \n So largely, what we're seeing, and we're confident in the path ahead that our strategies, our holistic strategies and everything that we're doing across our assortment, across our brand engagement, our loyalty program, and then certainly, the human experience that we uniquely deliver in our stores give us a lot of confidence that while there's some short-term pressure year-over-year, we're still stronger in share than we were pre-pandemic, and we're confident in growth behind our strategies going forward. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Baird. \nMark Altschwager: Scott and Paula, congratulations to each of you. So for the Q4, you mentioned that you refined your outlook given some of the risk to consumer spending and endpoints of distribution. I guess but overall, you are raising the low end of your guide Q3 a bit better than your internal expectations. So maybe just give us a little bit more detail on how your views on category spending and the promotional backdrop have changed versus 3 months ago? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. I would -- yes, so I'll start and let Scott give a little insight here. When we look at the promotional environment, maybe I'll start there, Mark. The -- as we highlighted in the third quarter, the promotional environment was higher in Q3 than a year ago, but still meaningfully below 2019 levels. So while we're seeing some increase, it's -- we don't see an irrational promotional market. We're definitely not back to 2019 levels. And we've been able to leverage our capabilities behind CRM and overall personalization to manage more effectively within our promotional intensity. \n So with that backdrop, as we look into the fourth quarter, again, we're not expecting anything radically different than what we saw, a bit more promotional, not irrational to what we've essentially seen so far, not back to 2019 levels. \n And when we look at our outlook, and I'll let Scott give a little bit more color, we really haven't changed our fourth quarter comp sales. As we've been talking for a while, we've seen -- we expected in the second half of this year for comp to moderate to low single digits. We were a bit ahead of that in the third quarter, and we're still confident in our outlook for the fourth quarter, and that gave us -- really our third quarter performance gave us the confidence to move up the bottom end of that range. \n So as we look out, we're not anticipating any major disruptions from promotion. But Scott mentioned the biggest weeks of holiday are still ahead. So we're staying close to that. The consumer engagement, we're positive about, and that's reflected in our updated refined outlook going forward. \nScott Settersten: And I would just reiterate what Dave said, our fourth quarter comp sales expectations have not changed, all right? We are giving ourselves a little bit wider range, I would say, on operating margin than you would probably expect to see at this stage of the year. But it is $1 billion above the last couple of quarters. So small changes in consumer reaction could have a bigger impact on our business. \n So we're just being prudent, giving ourselves room to maneuver, I guess I would say, thinking about how we deliver overall great experience for the guests, both in the store and online. And again, we feel like we're really well positioned. We're off to a good start, but there's still a long way to go. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Evercore ISI. \nMichael Binetti: Scott, may I add my congrats. It's been great, the conversations over the years has been wonderful, and Paula, cannot wait to work with you.\n Dave, you reminded us how resilient the category is in the low to mid-single-digit growth over time. The comp [ you have ] for the fourth quarter allows comps to go as low as flat, so below the algo, below the industry rate. I know there's some unique hurdles that you pointed to. Is that really the only impediment to a normal return to normal comp? Is the hurdles a January effect that you pointed to?\n And then I'm also curious with SG&A growing double digits this quarter, Scott, you mentioned algo comp next year. Can you just kind of walk us through how to get to leverage on SG&A given the recent growth rate in the SG&A line? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes, I'll start with comp. But yes, I think you've said it well. We're again, when we look long term, very confident in the total growth of the category and our ability to gain share. That's certainly our objective all the time. As we look in the fourth quarter, it's a -- we are lapping a very strong fourth quarter last year. We anticipated this. We've been talking about a moderation in our comp trends all year long. And so far, it's played out essentially as we thought with some modest improvement, a little bit ahead of that, but that's how we anticipated.\n So when we look into the fourth quarter, what's reflected in our outlook is continued strong engagement, a successful holiday and healthy comps certainly on a 2-, 3-year basis, but we're lapping some strong performance last year as we get through this fourth quarter. \nScott Settersten: And Michael, we're in the midst of a multiyear transformation on many fronts across the business that, again, we expect to deliver significant efficiencies and optimization opportunities for our business for many years to come. And so 2023 is an extraordinary investment year. A lot of it is coming through the SG&A line, again, the $60 million to $70 million on top of $50 million last year, again, we believe we're at or near the peak of that. Third quarter bore a large brunt of the burden for 2023. So we would expect SG&A growth to moderate in '24 and beyond.\n And -- but I would remind folks, again, when you're just calling out the SG&A line, we have said consistently we're willing to invest in SG&A as long as we can deliver operating margin leverage. So again, UB Media is a good example of that. It costs money, people cost, tool cost and things to ramp up there over time, but we get back in the gross margin line over the long term. So we're well positioned for the future and believe we're on the right track. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. \nOliver Chen: David, Paula and Scott, it's been awesome to work with you. Congrats on everything you've done and the years ahead.\n As you think about stores and the store maximum potential, you've had really nice new store productivity and also pretty extraordinary e-commerce growth. What are you thinking about for smaller format and also as you continue to modernize the experience, how the stores should be laid out?\n And then second, on UB Media, a big part of the future is digital advertising. What's the path there in terms of what you're doing? It feels -- we believe that a lot of the brands do appreciate the data that you have and the cross-section you can offer them as well. \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. Thanks, Oliver. I'll start with stores. We continue to reiterate our outlook of 1,500 to 1,700 stores, and towards -- and we've said that we believe we'll be towards the high end of that range. That hasn't changed and we're confident in that. And that does not include our expansion in partnership with Target. And as I mentioned in the call, we're up to 510 of those locations.\n Our store-level earnings, our store profitability remains very healthy. We're very positive about the new store opening performance, and we're confident in the opportunity to continue to expand our presence.\n We have a couple of things that you highlighted. We've been testing and I'd say, expanding really a smaller format, which is a 5,000 square foot store that's really targeted towards smaller markets, more remote markets, and we're having good success there. We've updated our full store layout that we've expanded into -- I think it's maybe 80 stores now or so that all new stores and some remodels that have a new format that makes it more intuitive to shop the whole store. The categories are bundled together. The services are highlighted more. The brands are easier to engage in. And so we continue to invest in the experience and elevate how we're engaging with our guests. And we're very bullish on the stores, the performance and the outlook.\n On UB Media, we're pleased with our advancements. We've invested in that this year. We've had hundreds of brands participate, thousands of campaigns over the course of the year. We've expanded our team. And it's exactly what you said, the power of our data, the unique insights that we can bring because we have 42 million members and we have an assortment that spans all price points in all categories and all geographies and demographics, we've got a really powerful tool with our brands. We can bring value to our brands through that.\n And so I'd say we'll continue to see good results from that. And -- but I'd also say we're just getting started with a lot of opportunity, more to come as we look into the future. So we're putting -- we're accelerating that effort as well. \nOliver Chen: Okay, David. Last on AI. You have QM Scientific and creative deals you've done, and you've also been active in augmented reality. Are there any highlights about how you see AI impacting the pre- and post-shopping experience and/or how you're utilizing it across the organization? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. You're sneaking another question in, Oliver. On Scott's announcement day, too, right? So -- but yes, AI is an important part of our business. You mentioned QM Scientific, which we bought a few years ago, really is one step among many to increase the power of advanced analytics to more personalize our guest experience.\n And I'd say across the board, we're bringing that to life, more opportunity to go for sure, but with an ultimate objective of being able to better anticipate and understand our guest needs and desires and behaviors so we can better service them in store, online and through all of our touch points.\n And then we're using generative AI, we're really just getting started, but we see opportunities within Gen AI to streamline, accelerate and advance some of the experiences, things like our product descriptions, to automate some of that to make it more real time to speed up our innovation to leverage some of our creative processes. And behind the scenes with some data management and supply chain and other places. So we're excited about both what it's contributed so far, and it's a big focus for our organization to take full advantage and be a leader in that space as well. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank. \nKrisztina Katai: I'll add my congratulations to both Scott and Paula. But my question is to you, Dave. I was wondering if you could talk about member engagement. You said that Diamond and Platinum members increased 20%. So what are you seeing with some of these newer members versus your more mature cohorts? And what are some of the early reads that you can share from a personalization effort perspective, how those are helping the maturation of wallet share or member spending that essentially gives you confidence that you can continue to deliver on your compound goals? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. Great question, Krisztina, because our loyalty program is so key to our business and to our success. And I tell you, I can't -- couldn't be more pleased and proud of the team's efforts to evolve and advance this program. \n And what I say internally to our 53,000 associates is, every single one of us own and contribute to loyalty, both the acquisition of new members, but importantly, the engagement and delighting our members every single day, in-store, online and our guest services through our assortment, our advertising, our social media, every touch point we have. And so it is an always-on activity for us, it's top of mind every day for us to make sure that we are delighting our guests because we know that's the secret to our success and our long-term future.\n The big picture result of 8% growth of our loyalty program is evidence that that's working because the things that come together to drive that type of growth on a big number, a big number to start with is, first and foremost, retention. We wouldn't be growing it if we weren't retaining at a very high, very healthy, we believe, industry-leading level, and we continue to work to improve that every day with every member through our personalization.\n So the personalization efforts, I'd say, first and foremost, are ultimately about retention because if I can use personalization to provide more value to our guests, then they will be more likely to stay with us, to buy more with us and to be a long-term guest and move up into the Platinum and Diamond levels and all of that.\n We also saw nice results in new member, have never been a member of Ulta Beauty, and we continue to expand that, and that's through our new stores, our advertising, our partnership with Target, our digital presence, our social media. And we feel like while we've had a lot of scale, there are tens of millions of beauty enthusiasts that are not currently part of our program.\n And the third area is reactivation, where while we have very strong, healthy retention, we don't retain everybody. So there is a pool of guests that -- most of the time, it isn't because they had a bad experience. They just fell out of the habit of shopping at Ulta. And so we have a very personalized direct program to reengage and reactivate those lost guests, and that's been contributing to our growth.\n So across the board, we're pleased with the engagement. We're pleased with the spend per member. All metrics in that program continue to be encouraging to us and we see a long runway, and we're focused on it every day through innovation, hard work and just a commitment to guest experience to drive that for the long term. \nKiley Rawlins: Operator, I think we have time for one more question. \nOperator: Sure. Our last question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Best wishes to Scott and Paula. My question is, how long are you willing to absorb market share losses in the prestige beauty category before responding with an increase in promotional activity? And if we assume that those market share losses extend into 2024, how is that going to impact Ulta Beauty's ability to achieve its earnings algorithm next year? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes, Michael, I'd say that, first, I'd start by answering that question is, yes, our goal and our long-term history is to gain share. And our entire strategy across our assortment, our marketing, the loyalty program, our stores, our e-com, our digital tools, everything we do is designed to be a leader and to gain share and to drive our business forward. And in many parts of our business, we have been and continue to be doing that.\n Our prestige makeup and hair business have been more challenged. And that's really a reflection of expanded points of distribution, which I talked about hundreds of points of distribution in -- largely in those that are impacting disproportionately those categories and some other competitive pressures.\n In mass makeup, in mass skincare, in mass hair care, in prestige skincare, prestige fragrance, we are gaining share and have continued to do so. So our focus is to continue to do that, to take the healthy, strong share growing parts of our business and accelerate that, and to return the ones that have been a bit more challenged to growth, and we have got plans to do that. \n I talked about makeup on an earlier question. And we, both through the newness that we've launched and more to come as we turn the calendar to 2024, the execution that we have in store, our focus online, we're confident that we will be able to drive that back. Same holds true in hair care. \n Specifically around promo, honestly, we see it, Michael, as a balance. Where we feel good about our overall position, our overall growth, as I said, we're gaining share in many parts of our business, and so we're pinpointed in how we want to leverage our promotional intensity. We don't want to wildly swing back when we have confidence that it's not just promo that will return to share growth, it's the collective strategies and actions, the long-term efforts around assortment and execution that will drive share growth over time.\n And so we'll leverage promo in the short term. We have been, but as we've said earlier, we in no way have turned back to 2019, which is one indicator. We're not just going to swing wildly. We'll be thoughtful, strategic, and have clear actions and long-term actions that get us to sustained share growth. And I say that from a position of confidence given our track record of gaining share consistently for many years, and we're confident we'll be able to do that well into the future.\n All right. So thank you for that question, Michael, and thanks for all of you for your engagement. I want to close by thanking our more than 53,000 Ulta Beauty associates for delivering another strong quarter for our shareholders while also successfully executing against our strategic priority.\n And once again, I want to thank Scott for his partnership and tremendous impact on Ulta Beauty, and I want to congratulate Paula as I know she is going to be an outstanding CFO for our company.\n We wish you all a happy and healthy holiday season. I hope you get out and shop at Ulta Beauty often. And we look forward to speaking to you again when we report results for fiscal 2023 on March 14. Hope you have a good evening. \nOperator: And this concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "David Kimbell",
            "content": "Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. I'll start today with comments about our CFO transition plans and then discuss our third quarter performance. Then Scott will review the financial results and our outlook. \n Starting with the succession plans we announced this afternoon. After nearly 20 years with Ulta Beauty and more than a decade as CFO, Scott Settersten has shared with us his decision to retire, effective April 1, 2024. From his early days helping take Ulta Beauty public and throughout the last 10 years as CFO, Scott's impact on Ulta Beauty has been tremendous. He's been a passionate steward of our business, and the strong and constant shareholder returns achieved during his tenure are a testament to his leadership and disciplined approach to driving profitable growth. \n I want to express my sincere gratitude to Scott for his partnership and his remarkable contributions to our business. He has been an exceptional partner to me and an inspirational leader for our team across the company. \n With Scott's retirement, I'm very pleased to announce that Paula Oyibo will be our next Chief Financial Officer. Paula is a dynamic finance executive with broad industry experience, and I am confident she is the right leader for this next chapter of Ulta Beauty's growth. Since joining the company in 2019, she has established herself as a trusted partner and visionary leader. Her deep understanding of our business, experience leading large finance organizations and strong commitment to nurturing talent with an inclusive culture make her the ideal person to serve as Ulta Beauty's next CFO. Paula will be a great addition to our dynamic executive team, and I look forward to partnering with her as we continue our growth journey. \n This announcement represents another great succession story for Ulta Beauty. I am grateful to Scott for being intentional and thoughtful in ensuring we have a seamless plan for this critical leadership role. And I am excited that Paula will bring her business-first mindset, influence and energy to the executive team. \n Okay. Now let's talk about our third quarter performance. The Ulta Beauty team delivered strong performance again this quarter, with sales, gross profit and EPS all exceeding our internal expectations. Our traffic trends remain healthy. Our brand awareness and loyalty program reached all-time highs, and our transformational initiatives are on track. I want to thank all Ulta Beauty associates for maintaining their focus on creating great guest experiences and delivering these results while executing against our transformational agenda. \n For the quarter, net sales increased 6.4% to $2.5 billion. Operating profit was 13.1% of sales and diluted EPS was $5.07 per share. Comparable sales increased 4.5%. \n As discussed on prior calls, we expected the sales growth to moderate from the first half as we lapped 2 years of strong double-digit comp growth. Comp sales growth for the quarter was driven by approximately 10% growth from our digital channels. Stores delivered low single-digit comps as we lapped high-teen growth last year. Store traffic remained healthy, increasing in the high single-digit range. \n Turning to performance by category. Skincare was again our fastest-growing category, driven by double-digit growth in mass and prestige segments. Beauty enthusiasts have maintained their skincare routines while also experimenting with new regimens. Consumer interest in moisturizers, serums and cleansers is driving growth, and brands leaning into these trends like Drunk Elephant, Good Molecules and COSRX contributed to our strong results. Dermatologist-recommended brands also continued to resonate, driving growth for brands like La Roche-Posay, Cetaphil and Dermalogica.\n The fragrance and bath category delivered low double-digit growth. Newness from Ariana Grande, Burberry and YSL contributed to the category's performance. Prestige brands Valentino and Carolina Herrera, and luxury brands CHANEL and Dior also drove meaningful growth.  \n Sales in the makeup category were flat, with mid-single-digit growth in mass makeup offsetting a modest decline in prestige makeup. New brands like Dior and Natasha Denona and Beautycounter, and existing brands with compelling newness and innovation, including e.l.f., Juvia's Place, MAC and OPI, all delivered growth during the quarter. While many mass brands continue to benefit from engaging newness and social engagement, our prestige makeup business was more challenged as we continue to lap the strong impact of last year's Fenty launch. \n Finally, comp sales for the hair care category decreased in the low single-digit range, primarily driven by a decline in hair tools. Newer brands, including exclusive brand LolaVie and Shark Beauty and Donna's Recipe as well as newness from Not Your Mother's and [ Way ] delivered growth for the category. Trend-relevant products from Redken and Biolage resonated strongly with guests while social virality drove growth for IGK and Mielle. \n Comparing to mass beauty dollar sales for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023, we continued to outpace the growth of the mass market according to Circana data. In prestige beauty, our share gains in skin care and fragrance were offset by softness in makeup and hair according to Circana. \n From a channel perspective, we gained prestige beauty share across digital channels, but were more challenged in brick-and-mortar channels, reflecting the impact of increased distribution for prestige beauty. While these dynamics increased competitive intensity in the short term, we are confident our sales-driving strategies will support our ability to capture more market share over the long term.\n Our services business delivered high single-digit comp growth, primarily driven by engagement in core services, including haircuts, blowouts and makeup services. Ear piercing, one of our newer services, also performed well, and salon backbar takeovers, which give our stylists an opportunity to introduce brands to guests, continued to drive product attachment and new guest acquisition for participating brands. \n Unlike other discretionary retail categories, the U.S. beauty category has consistently driven growth over time. Based on data from Euromonitor, in the 15 years prior to the pandemic, the U.S. beauty category grew in the low to mid-single-digit range every year except during the Great Recession, when the category experienced low single-digit declines, and in 2020, when the category declined 6%. In 2021 and 2022, the category experienced unprecedented double-digit growth as consumers recovered from the pandemic. And as we lap the strong growth this year, consumer spend has remained healthy. While we expect growth will continue to normalize to historic ranges, we remain confident the category will continue to grow, barring a macroeconomic event. \n In addition to factors that have driven the category historically, including a strong emotional connection with consumers, newness and innovation, and societal changes, today, consumers are thinking differently about the role beauty can play in their wellness routine, which we believe will drive increased usage for the category. \n As we think about the opportunity to expand our market leadership and drive long-term profitable growth, our strategic framework guides our priorities and focus. Let me share some highlights on the progress made this quarter. \n Starting with our efforts to drive growth with an expanded definition of All Things Beauty. During the quarter, we enhanced our assortment with trend relevant brands in every category. In makeup, we introduced a luxury brand, Pat McGrath Labs, expanded our presence with MAC to nearly all stores, launched several exclusive and innovative brands, including Half Magic, Polite Society and Rabanne.\n In skin care, we launched PanOxyl, a dermatologist-recommended brand popular with Gen Z. In haircare, we launched Shark Beauty, an innovative brand of hair styling tools at accessible price points. And in fragrance, we launched Snif, an emerging brand offering gender-neutral scents available only at Ulta Beauty.\n Building on our long-term partnership with CHANEL and other luxury fragrance brands, we see an opportunity to expand our luxury offering into makeup and skincare. In Q1, we launched luxury at Ulta Beauty, and our member analytics confirms that our new luxury assortment is driving incrementality and increased spend per member. \n In addition to strengthening our core assortment, we are leaning into broader trends in beauty through our cross-category platforms. We continue to expand our Conscious Beauty platform. At the end of the quarter, more than half of our brand portfolio was certified in at least one pillar, with 260 brands certified in more than one pillar. Newly-certified brands include COSRX, Loving Tan and Polite Society. \n We also increased our portfolio of BIPOC brands, welcoming Pat McGrath Labs, CurlMix, Better World Fragrance House by Drake and Pound Cake to the portfolio. And we expanded our wellness assortment with the launch of at-home spa tools from LUV SCRUB, Solawave and Skin Gym. \n In addition, we expanded the wellness shop to an additional 500 stores and refreshed the presentation with elevated aesthetics, improved navigation and more storytelling graphics to inspire and educate our guests how to connect to wellness in their everyday lives. Guests are moving effortlessly between physical and digital channels, and we are investing to enhance the guest experience across all touch points. \n We have been on a multiyear digital transformation journey to upgrade our infrastructure and deliver a more engaging and seamless digital guest experience while also positioning future growth. In August, we completed a significant step in this process with the transition of our digital commerce experience, including cart [ emotions ], checkout and member account data to our new architecture.\n Overall, our team successfully executed these changes, and I am pleased to report our new digital experience performed very well over the high demand Thanksgiving weekend, including Cyber Monday. The modernization of our digital technology ecosystem is nearly complete, enabling us to elevate and optimize our existing guest experience while driving digital innovation, utilizing a modern, agile approach. \n In addition to our digital platforms, we are also enhancing our in-store experiences. Our member data demonstrates that an excellent guest experience drives spend, increased frequency and creates lasting loyalty. This quarter, we launched a refreshed guest engagement model, which elevates the guest experience through authentic engagement, helpful experiences and friendly interactions to create a genuine human connection. While still early, we are encouraged by the improving trends in guest satisfaction scores.\n We continue to expand and enhance the Ulta Beauty at Target experience. We opened 89 Ulta Beauty at Target shops during the quarter, ending the quarter with 510 shops. This quarter, we were excited to launch Fenty Beauty, delighting our guests with a new way to shop this fan favorite brand.  Created exclusively for Ulta Beauty at Target, the Fenty Snackz assortment features a curated lineup of best-selling must-haves, minis, and unique sets. And just in time for holiday, we launched a curated assortment of Dyson hair tools in select stores and exclusive holiday sampler kits in all Ulta Beauty at Target shops. \n Beauty is an emotionally-driven category, and we are investing to drive greater love, loyalty and connection with Ulta Beauty. We continue to strengthen the Ulta Beauty brand. Unaided brand awareness increased to a record level this quarter, with meaningful gains among Gen Z and millennial beauty consumers. We also expanded the connection guest field for Ulta Beauty as measured by significant growth in brand love. These gains reflect the impact of our strategic brand building efforts as well as our marketing actions to support key promotional events and brand launches. \n At Ulta Beauty, our mission is to use the power of beauty to bring to light the possibilities that lie within each of us. Building on our commitment to make beauty a force for good, we've created The Joy Project, a multiyear initiative to make beauty and the world a more joyful place. We launched The Joy Project in September with an integrated campaign across national TV, PR, social media and our owned channels.  In addition, we created a training curriculum for transforming the way our associates think about self-confidence, and to give them tools to empower our guests to do the same. \n In October, we expanded The Joy Project while reinforcing our role at the intersection of beauty and culture as the exclusive beauty partner for TikTok's first ever beauty month. Grounded in TikTok's theme of reclaimed joy, this month-long activation leveraged creator content and events, premium platform advertising placements and custom filters that allowed users to see their inner joy. \n We continue to adjust our promotional strategies as the category normalizes and consumers navigate rising cost pressures. Responding to consumer needs and competitive shifts, we continue to evolve our key tentpole events like 21 Days of Beauty, while also deploying new offers with more relevant storytelling to drive sales and traffic. While our promotional activity increased this quarter, our targeting capabilities and promo optimization efforts enabled us to manage the financial impact. Notably, overall promotional levels remained meaningfully below 2019 levels. \n Turning to our loyalty program. We ended the quarter with 42.2 million active members, 8% higher than last year, driven primarily by improving member retention and new member acquisition. Spend per member remains healthy, driven by greater shopper frequency. As we engage members with exclusive promotions, point accelerators and personalized content and recommendations, we are driving engagement spend and frequency. These targeted efforts are also enabling us to elevate more members to our Platinum and Diamond tiers. Compared to last year, the number of Platinum and Diamond members has increased more than 20%. \n Turning now to our efforts to drive operational excellence and optimization. We are executing a multiyear transformation agenda intended to unlock new capabilities and efficiencies to fuel our growth. In addition to the digital store progress achieved this quarter, we continued to advance our road map in other key areas. We completed the retrofit of our Greenwood distribution center, began shipping to stores and fulfilling e-commerce orders from our new Greer market fulfillment center, and transitioned our Chambersburg distribution center to our new ERP platform.\n Our teams have delivered several major milestones this year, and we are on track to complete many of our transformational projects next year. We plan to complete the transition of our digital store in the first half of 2024, and we expect to complete the upgrade of our ERP platform and the expansion of our data management systems in the second half of 2024. \n We will advance our supply chain optimization efforts next year with the continuation of our Dallas DC retrofit, as well as the conversion of our Romeoville, Illinois fast fulfillment center to a new market fulfillment center. \n Finally, as the nation's leading specialty beauty retailer, we strive to be good stewards of our environment. Reflecting our commitment to leave a positive legacy, I am excited to share we have established emission reduction goals approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. Details of our commitments are available in the ESG section of our investor website. \n Shifting now to our plans and expectations for holiday. The holiday is off to a good start, but we know the biggest selling weeks are still ahead of us. Our insights suggest that consumers are ready to celebrate even as they navigate in an uncertain economic environment. With our diverse assortments and convenient omnichannel touch points, we are well positioned to help our guests celebrate this season. \n Our holiday campaign this year is \"The gift is just the beginning,\" which underscores our belief in the power of beauty and Ulta Beauty. While a gift can be a signature fragrance or an innovative hair tool, beauty can also be the gift of self-care, fun and joy. Through this campaign, we're celebrating the moments that make the holiday special: family, friends, connections, joy and pairing them with the perfect gifts.\n Our merchants have thoughtfully created a holiday assortment of exclusive first-to-market items along with iconic classics. With products across mass, prestige and luxury, we offer guests both value-first and splurge-worthy items to help them find perfect budget-friendly gifts for others or themselves. \n Our store teams are ready to bring the holiday to life for our guests. Our new POS system enables associates to easily order items not currently available in their store, and our new mobile POS tools provide guests with an elevated and faster checkout process. And with BOPIS and same-day delivery options in every store, it's never been easier or more convenient to shop at Ulta Beauty. Our teams have been working hard all year to ensure Ulta Beauty is ready to bring joy to our guests this holiday season, and I am proud of how well they are executing for our guests. \n While the beauty category will likely be a bit more promotional this holiday season, I'm confident our marketing and assortment strategies combined with new capabilities will position us to deliver another successful holiday.\n In closing, the beauty category remains healthy and consumer engagement remains high. We remain confident in the resilience and power of beauty and in our ability to drive market share and profitable growth. \n And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? Great. Well, thanks for those nice comments about Scott and Paula, and I appreciate that. And I'll start with some thoughts about the beauty category and makeup specifically, to answer your question there, and then maybe Scott can pick up on the gross margin. \n As I mentioned in my comments, we remain very confident about the long-term future of the beauty category for all the reasons I highlighted, a steady stream of compelling newness, high level of engagement, emotional connection. The connection between wellness and beauty that's stronger than ever coming out of the pandemic give us confidence more broadly in beauty.\n And then makeup specifically is an important part of that. And while the makeup category for us was essentially flat for the quarter, we are confident in the future of that important part of our business. We see strong positive trends, a high level of engagement across all demographic groups. And as we get into both completing this fourth quarter and moving into next year, we're confident in what we'll drive driving our makeup business. \n Some of the actions that we've taken specifically in make up to drive this business forward, continuing to launch several new exclusive makeup brands, brands like Half Magic, which was created by the Euphoria makeup artist; Polite Society, a prestige brand, exclusive again to Ulta, from the creators of Too Faced; Rabanne, which is a contemporary Spanish fashion brand, launching into cosmetics exclusively at Ulta. We're just getting started with those 3 exclusive brands at Ulta Beauty. We continue to see strength with MAC, and we've expanded that into nearly all doors. Strong growth on key mass brands like e.l.f. and with great compelling innovation within that segment of the makeup business.\n I talked in my remarks about luxury and we're -- while we've expanded that throughout the year, we feel like we're just getting started there. We launched -- expanded CHANEL, launched Dior and Natasha Denona this year, and then added Pat McGrath in the third quarter. \n In new items with existing brands continue to make a difference in the category, and we're confident in what's ahead. A couple of recent examples: Tarte's Shape Tape Radiant Concealer, exclusive at Ulta Beauty; Juvia's Place blush liquid -- blushes, exclusive at Ulta; and newness from other existing brands like Clinique, Benefit, Anastasia, NYX, Maybelline, go down the list. \n So we're confident. We're lapping the biggest launch we had, with Fenty from 2022. But as we look forward, we see as both the items that we've launched and more newness coming as we enter into 2024, we're confident and optimistic both in the consumer engagement in makeup and beauty in general and our specific strategies to drive growth. \n Scott, do you want to talk about margins? Yes. Thanks for the question, Lorraine. Yes, yes, we -- it is our objective to gain share across all parts of our business, and we did -- we feel positive about that in many parts, including our mass business, our prestige skin care, our prestige fragrance business, our prestige e-commerce business. But brick-and-mortar was pressured, and we think that's largely due to expanded points of distribution. There are hundreds more brick-and-mortar locations in the market now than there were even just a couple of years ago. \n And -- but what we see is more of a short-term impact from this competitive -- kind of the competitive pressure. Historically, as we've seen new locations open near our existing locations, there's a short-term modest impact. But relatively quickly, our stores are able to rebound and recover and to drive growth, share growth over time. \n So largely, what we're seeing, and we're confident in the path ahead that our strategies, our holistic strategies and everything that we're doing across our assortment, across our brand engagement, our loyalty program, and then certainly, the human experience that we uniquely deliver in our stores give us a lot of confidence that while there's some short-term pressure year-over-year, we're still stronger in share than we were pre-pandemic, and we're confident in growth behind our strategies going forward. Yes. I would -- yes, so I'll start and let Scott give a little insight here. When we look at the promotional environment, maybe I'll start there, Mark. The -- as we highlighted in the third quarter, the promotional environment was higher in Q3 than a year ago, but still meaningfully below 2019 levels. So while we're seeing some increase, it's -- we don't see an irrational promotional market. We're definitely not back to 2019 levels. And we've been able to leverage our capabilities behind CRM and overall personalization to manage more effectively within our promotional intensity. \n So with that backdrop, as we look into the fourth quarter, again, we're not expecting anything radically different than what we saw, a bit more promotional, not irrational to what we've essentially seen so far, not back to 2019 levels. \n And when we look at our outlook, and I'll let Scott give a little bit more color, we really haven't changed our fourth quarter comp sales. As we've been talking for a while, we've seen -- we expected in the second half of this year for comp to moderate to low single digits. We were a bit ahead of that in the third quarter, and we're still confident in our outlook for the fourth quarter, and that gave us -- really our third quarter performance gave us the confidence to move up the bottom end of that range. \n So as we look out, we're not anticipating any major disruptions from promotion. But Scott mentioned the biggest weeks of holiday are still ahead. So we're staying close to that. The consumer engagement, we're positive about, and that's reflected in our updated refined outlook going forward. Yes, I'll start with comp. But yes, I think you've said it well. We're again, when we look long term, very confident in the total growth of the category and our ability to gain share. That's certainly our objective all the time. As we look in the fourth quarter, it's a -- we are lapping a very strong fourth quarter last year. We anticipated this. We've been talking about a moderation in our comp trends all year long. And so far, it's played out essentially as we thought with some modest improvement, a little bit ahead of that, but that's how we anticipated.\n So when we look into the fourth quarter, what's reflected in our outlook is continued strong engagement, a successful holiday and healthy comps certainly on a 2-, 3-year basis, but we're lapping some strong performance last year as we get through this fourth quarter. Yes. Thanks, Oliver. I'll start with stores. We continue to reiterate our outlook of 1,500 to 1,700 stores, and towards -- and we've said that we believe we'll be towards the high end of that range. That hasn't changed and we're confident in that. And that does not include our expansion in partnership with Target. And as I mentioned in the call, we're up to 510 of those locations.\n Our store-level earnings, our store profitability remains very healthy. We're very positive about the new store opening performance, and we're confident in the opportunity to continue to expand our presence.\n We have a couple of things that you highlighted. We've been testing and I'd say, expanding really a smaller format, which is a 5,000 square foot store that's really targeted towards smaller markets, more remote markets, and we're having good success there. We've updated our full store layout that we've expanded into -- I think it's maybe 80 stores now or so that all new stores and some remodels that have a new format that makes it more intuitive to shop the whole store. The categories are bundled together. The services are highlighted more. The brands are easier to engage in. And so we continue to invest in the experience and elevate how we're engaging with our guests. And we're very bullish on the stores, the performance and the outlook.\n On UB Media, we're pleased with our advancements. We've invested in that this year. We've had hundreds of brands participate, thousands of campaigns over the course of the year. We've expanded our team. And it's exactly what you said, the power of our data, the unique insights that we can bring because we have 42 million members and we have an assortment that spans all price points in all categories and all geographies and demographics, we've got a really powerful tool with our brands. We can bring value to our brands through that.\n And so I'd say we'll continue to see good results from that. And -- but I'd also say we're just getting started with a lot of opportunity, more to come as we look into the future. So we're putting -- we're accelerating that effort as well. Yes. You're sneaking another question in, Oliver. On Scott's announcement day, too, right? So -- but yes, AI is an important part of our business. You mentioned QM Scientific, which we bought a few years ago, really is one step among many to increase the power of advanced analytics to more personalize our guest experience.\n And I'd say across the board, we're bringing that to life, more opportunity to go for sure, but with an ultimate objective of being able to better anticipate and understand our guest needs and desires and behaviors so we can better service them in store, online and through all of our touch points.\n And then we're using generative AI, we're really just getting started, but we see opportunities within Gen AI to streamline, accelerate and advance some of the experiences, things like our product descriptions, to automate some of that to make it more real time to speed up our innovation to leverage some of our creative processes. And behind the scenes with some data management and supply chain and other places. So we're excited about both what it's contributed so far, and it's a big focus for our organization to take full advantage and be a leader in that space as well. Yes. Great question, Krisztina, because our loyalty program is so key to our business and to our success. And I tell you, I can't -- couldn't be more pleased and proud of the team's efforts to evolve and advance this program. \n And what I say internally to our 53,000 associates is, every single one of us own and contribute to loyalty, both the acquisition of new members, but importantly, the engagement and delighting our members every single day, in-store, online and our guest services through our assortment, our advertising, our social media, every touch point we have. And so it is an always-on activity for us, it's top of mind every day for us to make sure that we are delighting our guests because we know that's the secret to our success and our long-term future.\n The big picture result of 8% growth of our loyalty program is evidence that that's working because the things that come together to drive that type of growth on a big number, a big number to start with is, first and foremost, retention. We wouldn't be growing it if we weren't retaining at a very high, very healthy, we believe, industry-leading level, and we continue to work to improve that every day with every member through our personalization.\n So the personalization efforts, I'd say, first and foremost, are ultimately about retention because if I can use personalization to provide more value to our guests, then they will be more likely to stay with us, to buy more with us and to be a long-term guest and move up into the Platinum and Diamond levels and all of that.\n We also saw nice results in new member, have never been a member of Ulta Beauty, and we continue to expand that, and that's through our new stores, our advertising, our partnership with Target, our digital presence, our social media. And we feel like while we've had a lot of scale, there are tens of millions of beauty enthusiasts that are not currently part of our program.\n And the third area is reactivation, where while we have very strong, healthy retention, we don't retain everybody. So there is a pool of guests that -- most of the time, it isn't because they had a bad experience. They just fell out of the habit of shopping at Ulta. And so we have a very personalized direct program to reengage and reactivate those lost guests, and that's been contributing to our growth.\n So across the board, we're pleased with the engagement. We're pleased with the spend per member. All metrics in that program continue to be encouraging to us and we see a long runway, and we're focused on it every day through innovation, hard work and just a commitment to guest experience to drive that for the long term. Yes, Michael, I'd say that, first, I'd start by answering that question is, yes, our goal and our long-term history is to gain share. And our entire strategy across our assortment, our marketing, the loyalty program, our stores, our e-com, our digital tools, everything we do is designed to be a leader and to gain share and to drive our business forward. And in many parts of our business, we have been and continue to be doing that.\n Our prestige makeup and hair business have been more challenged. And that's really a reflection of expanded points of distribution, which I talked about hundreds of points of distribution in -- largely in those that are impacting disproportionately those categories and some other competitive pressures.\n In mass makeup, in mass skincare, in mass hair care, in prestige skincare, prestige fragrance, we are gaining share and have continued to do so. So our focus is to continue to do that, to take the healthy, strong share growing parts of our business and accelerate that, and to return the ones that have been a bit more challenged to growth, and we have got plans to do that. \n I talked about makeup on an earlier question. And we, both through the newness that we've launched and more to come as we turn the calendar to 2024, the execution that we have in store, our focus online, we're confident that we will be able to drive that back. Same holds true in hair care. \n Specifically around promo, honestly, we see it, Michael, as a balance. Where we feel good about our overall position, our overall growth, as I said, we're gaining share in many parts of our business, and so we're pinpointed in how we want to leverage our promotional intensity. We don't want to wildly swing back when we have confidence that it's not just promo that will return to share growth, it's the collective strategies and actions, the long-term efforts around assortment and execution that will drive share growth over time.\n And so we'll leverage promo in the short term. We have been, but as we've said earlier, we in no way have turned back to 2019, which is one indicator. We're not just going to swing wildly. We'll be thoughtful, strategic, and have clear actions and long-term actions that get us to sustained share growth. And I say that from a position of confidence given our track record of gaining share consistently for many years, and we're confident we'll be able to do that well into the future.\n All right. So thank you for that question, Michael, and thanks for all of you for your engagement. I want to close by thanking our more than 53,000 Ulta Beauty associates for delivering another strong quarter for our shareholders while also successfully executing against our strategic priority.\n And once again, I want to thank Scott for his partnership and tremendous impact on Ulta Beauty, and I want to congratulate Paula as I know she is going to be an outstanding CFO for our company.\n We wish you all a happy and healthy holiday season. I hope you get out and shop at Ulta Beauty often. And we look forward to speaking to you again when we report results for fiscal 2023 on March 14. Hope you have a good evening."

            "content": "Thanks, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone. I want to echo Dave's sentiments and thank the Ulta Beauty team for delivering third quarter financial results that were ahead of our internal expectations. \n Solid sales growth supported by strong guest traffic and new store sales performance helped to mitigate some of the unique margin pressures we faced in the third quarter and enabled us to deliver gross margin modestly ahead of plan. SG&A spend was in line with expectations, resulting in operating margin of 13.1%. \n Turning to the P&L. Net sales for the quarter increased 6.4%, driven by 4.5% growth in comp sales, strong new store performance and solid growth in other revenue. Transactions for the quarter increased 5.9%, driven by healthy traffic across both channels. Average ticket decreased 1.4% as the decline in average units per transaction more than offset the impact of a higher average selling price. \n While retail price increases remain a benefit to our comp performance, the overall environment continues to normalize, and we are seeing the extraordinary pricing benefits from last year continue to roll off. We estimate price increases contributed less than 200 basis points to the overall comp in the third quarter. \n During the quarter, we opened 12 new stores and relocated 2 stores. In addition, we remodeled 11 stores. \n Q3 gross margin decreased 130 basis points to 39.9% compared to 41.2% last year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower merchandise margin, higher inventory shrink and higher supply chain costs, which were partially offset by strong growth in other revenue. Overall merchandise margin was lower, primarily due to lapping the timing benefit of retail price changes last year as well as increased promotional activity this year. While promotional activity continues to normalize, the overall financial impact remains meaningfully below 2019 levels.\n Inventory shrink continued to be a headwind. Our efforts to address shrink appear to be stabilizing the impact, but the overall environment remains challenging. In addition to new fragrance fixtures, which have been installed in nearly 3/4 of the store fleet, we continue to invest in associate training, staffing and operational improvements to mitigate the impact of shrink. And we continue to work with our retail industry partners to influence macro changes aimed at improving the overall environment. \n Supply chain costs were higher during the quarter, reflecting depreciation related to investments in our supply chain transformation, as well as the recent opening of our new market fulfillment center in South Carolina. These gross margin pressures were partially offset by strong growth in other revenue, primarily due to growth in both credit card income and royalty income from our Target partnership. \n SG&A increased 10.8% to $661.4 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 110 basis points to 26.6% compared to 25.5% last year, primarily due to higher corporate overhead, greater store expenses, investments in store payroll and benefits as well as higher marketing expense, which more than offset lower incentive compensation. Corporate overhead expenses were higher in the quarter primarily due to investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, Digital Store, other IT capabilities and UB Media. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we have invested about 75% of our planned $60 million to $70 million of incremental spend to support our strategic initiatives. \n Store expenses were higher in the quarter, reflecting ongoing inflationary pressures across the business. The increase in store payroll and benefits was primarily due to the impact of planned investments in average wage rates. Higher marketing expenses in the quarter were largely driven by increased investments to drive member acquisition, loyalty and brand awareness across key channels, including social, video and streaming. \n Lower incentive compensation was a benefit in the quarter, reflecting operational performance that is more in line with our internal targets compared to last year's significant outperformance. Operating income for the quarter declined 9.6% to $327.2 million. As a percentage of sales, operating margin decreased 240 basis points to 13.1% compared to 15.5% last year. Diluted earnings per share decreased 5.1% to $5.07 per share compared to $5.34 per share last year. \n Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. Total inventory increased 9.8% to $2.3 billion, compared to $2.1 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 31 additional stores, the increase reflects inventory to support higher demand and the stocking of our new market fulfillment center in South Carolina, as well as new brand launches and product cost increases. \n Capital expenditures were $106 million for the quarter, reflecting investments in new and existing stores as well as supply chain and IT investments to support our transformational agenda. Depreciation was $61.4 million in the quarter compared to $58.5 million last year. We repurchased approximately 687,000 shares at a cost of $281.5 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 1.8 million shares at a cost of $840.5 million. \n During the quarter, we drew on our revolving credit facility to support our ongoing capital allocation priorities, including share repurchases and capital expenditures during a period in the year when our working capital needs peak as we build inventory for holiday. I would note our recent activity does not reflect a change in our capital allocation philosophy, rather a lever to short -- support short-term cash needs. We ended the quarter with $195.4 million in short-term debt and $121.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. \n Moving to our outlook. We are narrowing our sales and EPS guidance for fiscal 2023 to reflect our actual performance through the first 3 quarters of the year and our expectations for Q4. We expect net sales for the year will be between $11.1 billion and $11.15 billion, with comp sales growth between 5% and 5.5%. For the year, we continue to plan to open approximately 25 to 30 net new stores and remodel or relocate 20 to 30 stores. Our expectations for operating margin for the year remains unchanged at between 14.6% and 14.8% of sales, with deleverage to come from both gross margin and SG&A, with slightly more deleverage coming from SG&A. Reflecting these assumptions, we now expect diluted EPS for the year will be between $25.20 and $25.60. \n We have refined our expectations for Q4 to reflect the expected resilience of the beauty category as well as potential risks from cautious consumer spending, increased points of distribution for prestige beauty and higher promotional activity. We continue to expect comp sales will be flat to up modestly for the fourth quarter. We still have several important weeks left in the holiday season and the operating environment continues to be dynamic. \n In addition, we are lapping the exceptional results last year, including an incredibly strong January, which was our strongest monthly comp sales performance of fiscal 2022. For modeling purposes, we now expect gross margin to deleverage modestly and operating margin to be flat to down compared to last year. \n One final update. We now expect to spend between $400 million and $425 million in CapEx in fiscal 2023, including approximately $180 million for supply chain and IT, $170 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, and about $60 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be around $245 million. We now expect share repurchases to be approximately $950 million.\n Our teams delivered another solid quarter amidst a dynamic operating environment. As we look ahead, we are focused on delivering our plans for the holiday season and finalizing our plans for next year. We will share more about our expectations for fiscal 2024 when we report our year-end results. But we remain confident. We are well positioned to deliver performance in line with our financial targets of 3% to 5% comp sales growth and 14% to 15% operating margin, with EPS growth next year reflecting the lapping of an extra week in fiscal 2023. \n Before I turn it over to our operator to moderate the Q&A, I want to take a moment to say thank you. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve as CFO for this special company for more than a decade. I look forward to passing the baton to Paula Oyibo, who I've worked with closely over the last several years. We will continue to work together over the coming months to ensure a smooth transition. Thank you again. \n And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. Sure. Thanks, Dana. So I'll give you a little bit more maybe than you were thinking about when you initially put this question together because I'm sure it's on other investors' minds as well. \n So thinking about '24 and beyond. And again, this is directional, in no particular order, but I kind of start with the headwinds. So supply chain transformation will continue to be a tougher compare for us as we think about next year as we continue to build out in and work through our distribution centers across the country.\n E-commerce mix, we've talked about. Again, it's been a bit of a benefit for us the last couple of years. We expect e-commerce to grow at a higher rate than brick-and-mortar next year and the years to come, and so that will be a headwind for us in gross margin. Again, we've got ways to mitigate that now that we didn't have back in 2019, namely BOPIS, ship from store and same-day delivery. \n So those would be the headwinds. I'd say promotionality is something I call kind of a TBD. So again, 2023 has been a bit of a deleverage point for us because we're getting back into a more normal environment. It's yet to be seen on how 2024 will shake out. So that's something we'll have to navigate. \n On the plus side, you mentioned a couple. Well, other revenue, #1 again. 2023, it's been a big tailwind for us. We would expect that to continue, although moderating a bit in '24. Cycling over price increases this year has been a major headwind to the business in the gross margin line. That will moderate as we get into -- deeper into 2024 and cycle through some of that.\n Shrink, we called out third quarter. We're gaining on it a little bit. Again, it's not mission accomplished by any stretch of the imagination, but we do feel like we've got tactics in place now that will help us get that better managed. UB Media, [ it's and ] as that business continues to scale up, we expect that to be a margin benefit for us. And then, of course, fixed cost, again, in the third quarter a bit of an anomaly with some of the repair and maintenance expenses that we absorb, but over the long term, we expect to be able to kind of leverage fixed store cost on a 3% to 5% comp. And I would just reiterate what Dave said, our fourth quarter comp sales expectations have not changed, all right? We are giving ourselves a little bit wider range, I would say, on operating margin than you would probably expect to see at this stage of the year. But it is $1 billion above the last couple of quarters. So small changes in consumer reaction could have a bigger impact on our business. \n So we're just being prudent, giving ourselves room to maneuver, I guess I would say, thinking about how we deliver overall great experience for the guests, both in the store and online. And again, we feel like we're really well positioned. We're off to a good start, but there's still a long way to go. And Michael, we're in the midst of a multiyear transformation on many fronts across the business that, again, we expect to deliver significant efficiencies and optimization opportunities for our business for many years to come. And so 2023 is an extraordinary investment year. A lot of it is coming through the SG&A line, again, the $60 million to $70 million on top of $50 million last year, again, we believe we're at or near the peak of that. Third quarter bore a large brunt of the burden for 2023. So we would expect SG&A growth to moderate in '24 and beyond.\n And -- but I would remind folks, again, when you're just calling out the SG&A line, we have said consistently we're willing to invest in SG&A as long as we can deliver operating margin leverage. So again, UB Media is a good example of that. It costs money, people cost, tool cost and things to ramp up there over time, but we get back in the gross margin line over the long term. So we're well positioned for the future and believe we're on the right track."

Dave? \nDavid Kimbell: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. The Ulta Beauty team delivered strong performance again this quarter with sales, gross profit and SG&A expenses all better than planned.\n Net sales increased 10.1% to $2.5 billion, and comparable sales increased 8%. Operating profit was 15.5% of sales and diluted EPS increased 5.6% to $6.02 per share. In  addition to delivering great financial results, our teams executed against our operational priorities. During the quarter, we drove growth across all major categories, increased the number of loyalty program members, strengthened our brand engagement and achieved important milestones within our multiyear transformation initiatives.\n Through the first half, our financial results are ahead of our internal expectations, and I remain confident we can deliver against our updated guidance for fiscal 2023. I want to express my sincere appreciation to all Ulta Beauty associates for their continued commitment to delivering great guest experiences while working collaboratively to execute our ambitious transformational agenda.\n Starting with the discussion of our operational results, we saw strong sales -- solid sales performance across both our store and digital channels, driven by double-digit traffic growth. All major categories delivered comp growth for the quarter, supported by strong engagement with the overall beauty category, compelling product newness and innovation and successful execution of cross-category promotional events, including our reimagined Big Summer Beauty Sale.\n Building on last year's promotional events, we consolidated key summer events like our popular Jumbo Love and Mix & Match Minis into a broader, more cohesive event with holistic storytelling and impactful messaging. The 3-week long Big Summer Beauty Sale drove market disruption, member conversion and strong sales across our hair care, makeup and skin care categories.\n Turning to performance by category. Skin care continues to be 1 of our strongest categories, even as we lap unprecedented growth during the pandemic. For the quarter, both Prestige and mass skin care delivered double-digit growth. Newer brands, including Bubble, BIOMA and Beautycounter and innovation from existing brands like The Ordinary, Drunk Elephant and Supergoop! contributed to the strong sales results. Reflecting consumer interest in dermatologist recommended brands, La Roche-Posay and CeraVe continued to perform well, and brands like Good Molecules, Hero Cosmetics and Peach Slices continue to benefit from social virality.\n The fragrance and bath category delivered double-digit comp growth again this quarter. Layering and wardrobing scents as a form of self-expression, especially among Gen Z consumers, continues to drive category engagement. Newness from Ariana Grande, Valentino and Burberry contributed to the category's performance, and key gift-giving events like Mother's Day and Father's Day drove growth for luxury brands like Carolina Herrera, Chanel and YSL.\n The hair care category delivered mid-single-digit comp growth driven by newness and guest engagement with our strategic events. Hair care focused on bonding, scalp treatments and other repair solutions as well as products that offer healthy heat styling options continue to drive consumer engagement. Trend-relevant products from professional brands, Redken, Biolage and Matrix as well as newness from prestige brands, [indiscernible] and IGK resonated strongly. New brands, including exclusive brands LolaVie, created by Jennifer Anderson, and Donna's Recipe also contributed to growth this quarter. While still challenged as we lap several years of strong growth, sales trends in hair tools improved from the first quarter, driven by compelling newness from Dyson and innovation from Bio Ionic.\n Finally, makeup delivered low single-digit comp growth, driven by strong performance in mass cosmetics. New brands like Dior, NATASHA DENONA and Beautycounter drove growth during the quarter, while new and exclusive products from a wide range of brands, including e.l.f, NYX and OPI also contributed positively. Compelling events, including our Big Summer Beauty Sale, National Lipstick Week and our foundation event as well as successful Barbie and Little Mermaid collaborations drove guest engagement. While the performance of mass cosmetics benefited from engaging newness in social content, our prestige makeup business was challenged as we lapped the significant impact of the Fenty launch last year.\n Our services business delivered double-digit comp growth again this quarter, primarily driven by increased appointments. Guests are engaging in core cut, color and blowout services as well as newer services, including extensions and scalp and hair treatments. We continue to enhance our service offering, and this quarter, we launched ear piercings chain-wide and introduced a new Keratin Express treatment.\n The beauty category growth remains healthy across both prestige and mass price tiers as consumers maintain their post-pandemic routines and expand their definition of beauty. When we look at the total beauty market, our analysis demonstrates we continue to gain market share. In mass beauty, we gained share this quarter across all major categories. In prestige, we continue to drive solid gains in skin and fragrance but saw pressure in makeup and hair based on Circana's beauty sales data.\n Our proprietary insights suggest consumers are becoming less focused on product pricing tiers and are trading around, choosing to engage with brands that offer on-trend newness and compelling social media content. As the only beauty retailer to offer a curated assortment of products from entry-level mass to luxury and everything in between, we are uniquely positioned to capture share of the total beauty market as consumers shift. We remain confident in the resilience of beauty. Our strategic framework guides our priorities and positions us to expand our market leadership and drive long-term profitable growth.\n Let me share some highlights of the progress we made against this framework in the second quarter. Starting with our efforts to drive growth with an expanded definition of All Things Beauty. Newness and innovation are critical growth drivers for beauty. Newness comes to life in the form of new brands, products and product lines, shade extensions and reformulations, and fuels discovery and drive trips and engagement. As we seek to continuously delight guests with all Things Beauty, we continue to expand our assortment and innovate -- with innovative and emerging brands.\n Building on newness introduced in the first half, we have several exciting launches planned for the third quarter, including Half Magic, a vegan and cruelty-free makeup brand created by Euphoria makeup artist Donni Davy, exclusive to Ulta Beauty. Polite Society, a prestige makeup brand exclusive to Ulta Beauty curated -- created by the founders of Too Faced Cosmetics. Rabanne, a contemporary and relevant Spanish fashion brand launching cosmetics exclusively at Ulta Beauty. Hair styling tools at accessible price points from Shark Beauty; PanOxyl, a dermatologist recommended brand popular with Gen Z; and Sniff, an emerging fragrance band offering gender neutral sense available only at Ulta Beauty.\n Reflecting the growth and popularity of luxury products with younger generations, last quarter, we launched Luxury at Ulta Beauty in 200 stores and on ulta.com. The program has exceeded our expectations, and we continue to see strong guest engagement with our offerings across all categories. Building on this success, we are excited to launch Pat McGrath Labs, a BIPOC luxe artistry makeup brand. Pat McGrath is a trusted expert who has shaped and disrupted the cosmetic category.\n Now, let me share an update on our key cross-category platforms, which lean into broader emerging trends in beauty, products that are good for the world, inclusivity and wellness. As we seek to provide guests with a diverse assortment that reflects their personal values and individual needs, we continue to expand our assortment of brands featuring clean, cruelty-free and vegan ingredients, leveraging sustainable packaging and driving positive impact through our Conscious Beauty platform.\n At the end of the quarter, 314 brands were certified in at least 1 pillar, with more than 270 brands certified in multiple pillars. To ensure all guests feel connected and reflected at Ulta Beauty, we continue our important efforts to drive inclusivity. In addition to amplifying our portfolio of BIPOC brands through informative marketing and in-store presentations, this quarter, we hosted a summit for our BIPOC brands, providing them with opportunities to network with peers while learning more about the beauty industry and operational best practices.\n Lastly, as the importance of beauty as a form of self-care and wellness continues to build, we enhanced the wellness shop assortment with the launch of 2 exciting supplements: Lemme Gummies created by Kourtney Kardashian, and the introduction of Big Brain Probiotics from Love Wellness.\n Turning now to our second strategic pillar, All In Your World, we are enhancing guest experiences across all of our touch points. Guests continue to shift effortlessly between physical and digital channels, depending on their individual needs, and we are committed to meeting them wherever they are in their beauty journey. Reflecting our efforts to enhance our buy anywhere fill anywhere capabilities, we have expanded our same-day delivery option to essentially every store and improved our store fulfillment process to drive greater efficiency and speed.\n Between BOPIS, same-day delivery and ship from store capabilities, 31% of our e-commerce sales and 39% of our digital orders were fulfilled by our store teams this quarter. Our consumer insights and member data confirm the importance of physical shopping in beauty. More than 75% of our members choose to transact with us only in stores, and yet we know many of these members use our digital platforms for discovery, try-on and inspiration. Converting these members to omnichannel members is a meaningful opportunity to increase engagement and spend per member as omnichannel shoppers spend 2.5x to 3x more than single channel shoppers.\n Importantly, the increase in spend is largely incremental.\n Expanded engagement with our mobile app is 1 way we are driving omnichannel conversion. Through our digital store refresh, we enhanced the user search and discovery experience, seamlessly blending commerce and content for a more personalized experience. We also continue to expand and enhance our digital try-on capabilities. This quarter, we launched a virtual try-on tool that enables guests to try multiple nail looks simultaneously, and we upgraded our virtual hair try-on experience with expanded color options and enhanced transfer quality and speed. These enhancements, combined with awareness campaigns, unique offers to drive utilization and increased associate education have delivered meaningful growth.\n Over the last 12 months, 9 million active members have engaged with our mobile app, double the number of members who engaged with the app before the pandemic. And we're seeing stronger engagement, with more than 55% of e-commerce sales coming through our mobile app.\n Turning to our partnership with Target. We opened 62 Ulta Beauty at Target shops during the quarter, ending the quarter with 421 shops. Our marketing teams work closely with our target partners to build awareness for newer brands, including Billie Eilish and Ariana Grande Fragrances, Glamnetic, and Living Proof, while also amplifying Summer prestige Must-Haves and minis. As the partnership scales, we are learning more about the Ulta Beauty at Target guests and the role this touchpoint plays in their beauty journey, and we will continue to leverage our expertise to develop unique assortments that reflect the preferences of the Ulta Beauty at Target guests.\n Moving to our third strategic pillar, operating at the Heart of the Beauty community, we are focused on driving greater love, loyalty and emotional connection with Ulta Beauty. We began this quarter with a Mother's Day campaign that highlighted exclusive cross-category gifts, including our luxury assortment and hero fragrances. Moving into June, we positioned Ulta Beauty as the destination for Summer Beauty, driving top-of-mind awareness and traffic with compelling points offers and special deals across the assortment to celebrate our members.\n Finally, we closed the quarter with our Big Summer Beauty Sale, a bold and disruptive event that offered opportunities to save on fan favorite beauty items across all categories and price points from a variety of established and emerging brands. These key events, paired with our culturally-relevant content amplifications drove record-level highs in unaided awareness with our greatest gains among Gen Z consumers.\n Turning to our loyalty program. We ended the quarter with 41.7 million active members, 9% higher than last year, driven by strong member acquisition and reactivation, combined with healthy retention of existing members. Spend per member also increased, driven by greater shopper frequency. The strength of our loyalty program continues to be a powerful and differentiated strategic asset for Ulta Beauty, and we are pleased with its elevated growth and performance.\n Our continued efforts to nurture the member life cycle is driving results. We accelerated new member acquisition and continue to engage and retain members with meaningful events, compelling points offers, personalized content and special guests. These strategies also delivered growth in our Diamond and Platinum tiers, which increased nearly 30% compared to the same period last year, reflecting strong loyalty and engagement with all Ulta Beauty offers.\n Turning now to our efforts to drive operational excellence and optimization. We are executing an ambitious multiyear road map of transformation initiatives intended to unlock new capabilities and efficiencies to fuel our future growth. As we have discussed on previous calls, we are expanding and optimizing our supply chain, upgrading our enterprise resource planning platform, transitioning our digital store to a new platform, enhancing our data management systems and upgrading store POS systems.\n I am pleased to share that our teams have delivered several key milestones. Our new Greer, South Carolina market fulfillment center began receiving inventory last month, and we expect to start shipping to stores next week. We completed the installation of a new automated storage and retrieval system in our Greenwood distribution center, which will increase capacity and enable greater productivity. We expanded our ship from store capabilities to an additional 276 stores. Today, we fulfill e-commerce orders from 400 strategically-located stores, enabling faster, more cost-effective delivery to the guest. We successfully transitioned 2 distribution centers, Jacksonville and Greer, to our new ERP platform.\n As part of our digital store transformation, we successfully completed a large-scale upgrade of our end-to-end e-commerce platform and migrated to a new modernized platform that includes a new promotion engine, guest account, cart and checkout. This is a significant milestone in our multiyear effort to elevate our digital experience in a way that positions us for long-term growth in this critical channel.\n Finally, we completed the POS upgrade in all stores. While our transformation agenda is not finished, we have made significant progress, and I am proud of how our teams have worked to execute our plans while limiting disruption to guests and associates.\n Looking forward, we continue to operate in a dynamic environment. While consumer confidence has strengthened, there are signs pointing to moderating growth going forward. Many consumers have begun to reduce overall spending, credit card debt remains high and the restart of student loan repayments is approaching. It is unclear how these factors will impact consumer behavior in the near term, but despite these factors, beauty has remained a bright spot.  \n Based on Circana beauty sales data, total U.S. beauty sales for the first half of 2023 increased double digits compared to the same period last year, with prestige beauty channels delivering higher growth than mass beauty channels. Looking to the rest of the year, we believe growth for the U.S. beauty market will remain healthy but normalize into the mid-single digits as we lap 2 years of strong growth, experienced less impact from pricing and face more economic uncertainty.\n As category growth normalizes, we continue to expect promotional activity within the category will also normalize. Over the last 2 years, unprecedented category growth and strong demand limited promotional activity. As a result, the promotional environment in 2021 and 2022 was unsustainably low. Reflecting these factors, we planned for higher promotional activity this year but continue to expect promotions will remain well below 2019 levels.\n In closing, we operate in an attractive and growing category. We have a strong, proven business model and a winning culture and outstanding teams. Through the first half of fiscal 2023, we have exceeded our internal financial expectations, and we remain confident we can deliver our updated expectations for the rest of the year.\n And now, I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? \nScott Settersten: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave shared, we delivered second quarter financial results that were ahead of our expectations. Strong sales growth supported by healthy guest engagement and strong in-store sales performance drove better-than-expected gross margin. SG&A spend was also lower than planned, resulting in an operating margin of 15.5%. \n Turning to the P&L. Net sales for the quarter increased 10.1%, driven by 8% growth in comp sales, strong new store performance and solid growth in other revenues. Transactions for the quarter increased 9%, primarily, driven by healthy traffic on both channels. Average ticket decreased 1% as the decline in average units per transaction more than offset the impact of higher average selling price. The increase in average selling price was primarily driven by the impact of retail price increases, many of which were executed last year. We estimate price increases contributed about 300 basis points to the overall comp.\n During the quarter, we opened 3 new stores and relocated 2 stores. In addition, we remodeled 3 stores. Second quarter gross margin decreased 110 basis points to 39.3% compared to 40.4% last year. The decrease was driven by lower merchandise margin, an increase in inventory shrink and higher supply chain costs. Overall merchandise margin was lower due primarily to increased promotional activity, unfavorable category mix and less benefit from the timing of retail price changes. While promotional activity continues to normalize, it is important to note that overall promotions remain well below 2019 levels.\n Inventory shrink continued to be a headwind this quarter. Our efforts to address shrink are having an impact, but the overall environment remains challenging. Today, we have the new fragrance fixtures in more than 50% of our stores and expect to have these installed in 70% of the fleet by year-end. We remain focused on taking action in areas we can control, including continued investment in fixtures, associate training, staffing as well as operational improvements, and leveraging our influence to enact broader changes that will disincentivize unlawful behavior.\n Supply chain costs were higher, primarily driven by ongoing investments in our supply chain transformation as we made progress on the retrofit of our Dallas and Greenwood distribution centers and prepared to open our new market fulfillment center in Greer, South Carolina. These gross margin pressures were partially offset by strong growth in other revenue and leverage of store fixed costs due to top line sales growth.\n SG&A increased 12.4% to $600.7 million. SG&A increased 40 basis points to 23.7% compared to 23.3% last year. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales was driven by deleverage of corporate overhead due to strategic investments, planned increases in store payroll and benefits and higher store expenses, which more than offset lower incentive compensation. Corporate overhead expense deleveraged in the quarter primarily due to investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, other IT capabilities and UB Media.\n Year-to-date through the second quarter, we have invested a little less than half of our planned $60 million to $70 million of incremental spend to support our strategic initiatives. The increase in store payroll and benefits was primarily due to the impact of planned growth in average wage rates and increased staffing levels compared to the same period last year. Incentive compensation was a tailwind in the quarter, reflecting operational performance that is more in line with our internal targets compared to last year's significant outperformance.\n Operating income for the quarter was $391.6 million, flat to last year. As a percentage of sales, operating margin decreased 150 basis points to 15.5% compared to 17% last year. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 5.6% to $6.02 per share compared to $5.70 per share last year.\n Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 9% to $1.82 billion compared to $1.67 billion last year, in addition to the impact of 37 additional stores, the increase reflects inventory to support higher demand, increases in product costs and new brand launches.\n Capital expenditures were $95 million for the quarter compared to $49.4 million last year. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily related to investments in IT and supply chain to support our transformational agenda as well as merchandising investments to support the rollout of our luxury assortment and brand expansions.\n Depreciation was $61.9 million in the quarter compared to $60.9 million last year. We ended the quarter with $388.6 million in cash and cash equivalents.\n During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 594,000 shares at a cost of $275.5 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 1.1 million shares at a cost of $559 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had $541 million remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization.\n Moving to our outlook. We are updating our guidance for fiscal 2023 to reflect our better-than-expected second quarter performance. We have raised our top line expectations and now project net sales will be between $11.05 million and $11.15 billion, with comp sales growth between 4.5% and 5.5%. \n Our updated outlook reflects our strong first half performance while continuing to consider risks and uncertainties that could impact demand in the second half of the year, including rising consumer debt levels and the expected resumption of student loan repayments. We continue to expect comps will moderate to the low single digits in the second half of the year, and we remain on track to open 25 to 30 new stores and renovate or relocate 20 to 30 stores this year.\n Reflecting our year-to-date performance, we've raised the low end of the range of operating margin and now expect operating margins for the year will be between 14.6% and 14.8% of sales, with deleverage to come fairly evenly from both gross margin and SG&A. Our expectations reflect the continuation of the trends we experienced through the first half of the year around shrink, promotional activity and supply chain costs as well as greater headwind from lapping the merchandise margin benefits from the timing of retail price increases last year.\n For modeling purposes, we expect third quarter operating margin will be meaningfully more pressured than what we saw in the second quarter as we lap greater pricing benefits in the third quarter last year as well as a shift of investment spending from Q2 to Q3. As a result, we expect earnings per share for the third quarter will be lower than last year.\n Reflecting these updated assumptions, we now expect diluted earnings per share for the year will be between $25.10 and $25.60. As a reminder, fiscal 2023 is a 53-week year. We anticipate the additional week will add between $165 million to $175 million in sales and approximately $0.40 of earnings per share. In closing, our results through the first 6 months of fiscal 2023 highlights the ongoing power and resilience of our business model.\n I'd like to thank our associates for their dedication and commitment to keeping our guests at the center of all we do and giving them more reasons to shop Ulta Beauty. As we look to the future, we are focused on capitalizing on the growth opportunities in the beauty category and executing our strategic framework to deliver long-term sustainable growth for all our stakeholders.\n And now, I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ashley Helgans with Jefferies. \nAshley Helgans: To start, maybe any details you can share on how traffic progressed throughout the quarter and what you're seeing now in August? And then also on the fragrances being locked up, have you seen any adverse effects on sales? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. Ashley, for the quarter, we saw strong traffic throughout the quarter with double-digit traffic. And we continue to be pleased with the engagement that we're seeing, and we saw actual comp performance sequentially accelerate through the quarter as well. And all of those trends are reflected into our updated and elevated guidance for the full year. \n On fragrance, the -- I'll let Kecia kind of discuss what we're doing in fragrance and how that's impacting our business. \nKecia Steelman: Yes. Actually, we've locked up about 50% of our stores right now. And what we're seeing is in the initial stores that we rolled out the locked fragrance cases for, we actually saw sales improvement because we were in stock with the product and we had it available to the guests. So we're staying very close to that. We're also investing in labor because we don't want to be sales preventative from the guests being able to purchase. So that's a little bit of the investment in labor that you heard earlier from Scott, is that in these stores, we are upping our labor a bit because we want to make sure that we're able to take care of the guests. \n So we're staying close to it. The bottom line is that we're pleased that we're able to maintain our in-stock for our guests, and quite frankly, keep the bad actors [ out ] from coming into our stores. \nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson. \nMichael Baker: I'm just curious, you said you expect the beauty industry to grow mid-single digits, yet you're only expecting comps to be up low single digits. And even if you add in store growth, you're still expecting to grow maybe up, but seemingly below the industry. I don't suppose you guys think you're losing share, so I'm just wondering if you can help flesh that out a little bit? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes, I'd say, yes, we do anticipate continuing to gain share. We've done so through the first half of the year, and that is our outlook. The commentary is really as we look into the second half of the year, we see some strength. Engagement continues to be high. Certainly, our business is performing very well. We're attracting new members. We're growing across all key categories, both -- and then in both e-com and stores. But we also see some uncertainty as we get in later into the year.\n So while we're confident in the category, we're just incorporating into our outlook some full -- some of that. And for the full year, we're looking at revenue in the plus 8% to 9% range, so we anticipate gaining share for the year being ahead of the total category growth. That's -- that will be our plan. \nOperator: Our next question is from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. \nOlivia Tong Cheang: My first question is around prestige versus mass breakout, because you mentioned in skin that you're still seeing strong growth in both prestige and mass. But only in mass for makeup, but you mentioned that the launch of Fenty a year ago was a big contributor. So if you exclude that, are you seeing anything different there? And then going forward, as you think about your expectations on growth in mass versus prestige, what implications may that have on comp, in your view? \nDavid Kimbell: What was the last part of that question? What was -- could you repeat the last... \nOlivia Tong Cheang: Yes. Just the implication on comp, if -- what you're thinking in terms of growth of mass versus prestige across  your stores? And what implications that might have in terms of comp if mass becomes a bigger piece of the driver of growth? \nDavid Kimbell: Well, yes, we -- as I discussed, we've seen strong performance really across our entire assortment as we look at it, but mass has been a bit stronger for a couple of quarters now in -- across our business. And that's driven largely by strong consumer engagement across some key brands in makeup, health, NYX and some others are really hitting the market with great innovation, great marketing, great consumer engagement. And the fact that we offer the full assortment from mass to prestige is a real benefit. We're able to capitalize on strong trends and strong engagements across all aspects of that. \n In skin care, we're seeing brands, particularly in the dermatologist recommended area driving strong growth, and that's great, we -- strong player for us. As we look forward, it's always our intent to continue to adapt and adjust and lean into the areas that are driving growth, find ways to strengthen those that may be more challenged, but we're confident in the outlook going forward. And the fact that we have both is unique. Of course you know that, but the fact that we're the only ones that offer mass, masstige, prestige and a growing, established now, business in luxury.\n We're seeing strong points across all. We'll continue to flex and adapt and incorporate it into our comp guidance is our ability to continue to drive growth. But through the first half of the year, we're really pleased with the Mass performance and several brands driving strong growth, and continue to lean in and bring innovation into the prestige side of the business. And collectively, it's working to allow us to gain share across Ulta Beauty. \nOperator: Our next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.\n Kate is your line on mute?\n Our next question is from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets. \nAnthony Chukumba: Congrats on the solid results. So just a real quick one. You mentioned luxury, and in fact, it's exceeding your expectations. You mentioned launching Pat McGrath Labs. Just -- it's all one related question in just 2 parts. \n First off, what -- is luxury -- what percentage of your assortment, I guess, is luxury in the stores that it's in? And is it big enough at this point to be a comp driver? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. Won't break out exact percentages. Again, to reiterate, it's in 200 stores. We're really pleased with it, a strong assortment across a number of the very best brands in luxury. Chanel, Dior, NATASHA DENONA, HOURGLASS, an extension of Chanel with Chanel N\u00famero Uno, Lanc\u00f4me, Absolute, now Pat McGrath. A luxury fragrance business with brands like YSL and TOM FORD and Viktor&Rolf.\n So we won't get into exact percentages, but it is an important part of our overall strategy. We know there's growth in the luxury side of the business. We've been in luxury for a while, but now with this expanded presence, it is a contributor to our total comp. We're excited about the addition of Pat McGrath, and we'll continue to innovate and evolve and find ways to drive further growth down the road. \n So yes, we think it's -- we know it's contributing to our growth, and we're excited about our guest response to an expanded luxury experience. \nOperator: Our next question is from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: Layered gross margin question. So how did shrink in the promotional environment play out in the second quarter relative to your expectations? Have you changed any of your expectations around those line items in the back half? And do you expect any improvement perhaps in the shrink line?\n And then Scott, could you remind us of the price cost headwind that we faced in the third quarter? Because I know that was pretty significant last year. \nScott Settersten: Sure, Chris. So yes, versus -- we did say, again, versus our expectations for the quarter, we're very happy with the overall financial results we were able to deliver. So breaking it down a little bit more, I'd say merchandise margin was better than what we expected, and so that speaks partially to the promotional lever that people are focused on here. So again, generally better than what we expected, so we can lean in and lean out. That's 1 of the great strengths of our business, being able to have real-time information and be able to take quick action and be agile.\n I'd say shrink generally directionally about the same as what we saw in the first quarter. As we look out to the rest of the year, we don't really -- we're not anticipating a significant turn and expectations there. We expect it to be tough the rest of the way. And we'll say maybe the fourth quarter may be slightly less negative than it was early part of the year because remember, last year in the fourth quarter was the first time we really called out and quantified what the shrink impact was, so we did have a little bit of a catch-up there. Over -- and then fixed -- store fixed costs we talked about, that was stronger than what we -- going in expectation because sales were a bit stronger than what we thought. And then channel mix overall helped us as well. \n As we look to think about gross margin the second half of the year, I'd say the drivers, the headwinds are consistent with what we've seen in the first half of 2023. Again, we're taking a prudent approach as we always do with our guidance, and we'll work hard to do better than that. \nChristopher Horvers: And then the price cost in 3Q? \nScott Settersten: Yes. So there was -- we -- third quarter last year is where we saw a significant step-up in the pricing increases across the portfolio, and really, the margin benefit started really rolling through in the second quarter and into the back half of the year. So this is really the toughest anniversary point in the year is ahead of us right now, and that's why we're calling out third quarter. Third quarter is kind of peak on a number of different fronts. Again, every year is a little unique, but the third quarter now, we've got a little bit of delays in some of our project work, which is shifting back some of our IT expense into the third quarter. And a lot of that flows through SG&A.\n So we'll see more pressure there than we saw earlier in the year, and then likewise, with gross margin. And a little -- and more moderate sales growth expectations, coupled with cycling over the margin benefits last year from the price increases step up in the back half of the year, putting more pressure on third quarter than maybe some would expect. But again, by the time we get in the fourth quarter and get back to focusing on sales in the holiday, we expect that to bounce back in a healthy manner. \nOperator: Our next question is from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Scott, I'm going to stay on that topic with the third quarter. If I'm not mistaken, it seems like about $10 million to $12 million of the SG&A spend perhaps is moving into the third quarter. And if we have a little bit more gross margin pressure, does that imply that EPS could be down sort of high single-digit range? Just wondering if I'm in the right ballpark. \nScott Settersten: Yes. We don't want to get into quantifying it specifically, Adrienne. But I'd say directionally, you're in the right zip code. So yes, on the SG&A side, that's roughly kind of the shift back into the third quarter on some of the IT spend. And yes, operating margin is going to be down meaningfully versus what we saw earlier this year, and that's going to result in negative EPS growth year-over-year for the third quarter. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Super helpful. And then to just follow through with the SG&A. So can you help us walk through the phases? I know there's 4 phases of Project SOAR and all of the other investments. It seems like you're running sort of dual structures perhaps on some of the DCs and then the website or, let's call it, 1/3 or half of the year. How should we think about that rolling off? Because a lot of this kind of redundancy will go away next year. I know you're not giving guidance, but just to help us shape sort of what SG&A growth looks like last -- next year? Because it seems like it comes down a lot on the consensus. I just want to make sure we have that correct in our mind. \nKecia Steelman: Adrienne, I'll start, and then I'll kick it over to Scott. So yes, we're in the middle of an ambitious transformational agenda. That's for sure. And part of this is really positioning all parts of the organization for our future efforts, and overall we're really pleased with how our progress is working. But anyone who's taken on this large scale of a project, we definitely have timing shifts that happen because we want to make sure that while we're staying forward, progressing and moving, we are really limited in our distraction and our disruption for our guests and also for our associates. \n So we've adopted a few of our time lines and have shifted a couple of the projects from Q2 into Q3, and we might even see some shifting from Q3 into Q4, but we're still on track to spend the $60 million to $70 million incremental to the prior year. And while we've got some of those shifts, we still are very confident that we're going to stay with our overall time line and how things wrapped up by the right time line for next year, which is more mid-2024. \n I'll turn it over to Scott. \nScott Settersten: Yes, and you're exactly right. We're not providing guidance for 2024 here today, but yes, investors should expect that we will cultivate, recoup benefits from the significant investments that we're making in our core systems year 20 -- '22 into '23 and that we're going to see benefits materialized in 2024 and beyond. Again, you've heard us talk about, these are major initiatives here that we expect to see dividends for a number of years into the future, but I would also caution investors just to be prepared. I mean there's -- we are in the business of growing Ulta Beauty for the long term, and so there's plenty of other great growth initiatives out there that we've got in the queue that we're ready to go tackle. As soon as we get through some of more of this, I'd call core transformation work here in '23 and early 2024. \nOperator: Our next question is from Kelly Crago with Citi. \nKelly Crago: I just have a couple of quick ones on categories. Just on makeup, it looks like makeup's growth decelerated from high singles in 1Q to mid-single to 2Q. Was that driven by a slowdown -- a subsequent slowdown in prestige? Did both decelerate? And how should we think about makeup growing in 2H? \n And then just secondly on skin, we've heard from some of the brands that maybe there's slowing growth in that category, but you do under index versus the category overall. So just curious whether that dynamic can help offset maybe some weaknesses that we're seeing or starting to see in skin? And any thoughts on the growth there would be great. \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. I'd say on makeup, the main driver is while our -- we're bringing a lot of innovation and newness across that prestige portfolio, lapping -- really, one of the biggest launches in the history of Ulta Beauty with Fenty, lapping that fully in the second quarter is probably the biggest driver. We're excited though as we look forward. I mentioned a few launches that we that we have coming out, Rabanne, Pat McGrath, Polite Society, among others that many of which are exclusive to Ulta Beauty and are coming into our business in the second half of the year.\n But we anticipate as we lap that launch. We'll continue to see pressure on prestige. Mass continues to drive growth behind great innovation, great engagement. And so we're pleased with the total makeup side of the business even as we address some of the pressure in lapping previous launches.\n In the skin care side, yes, we are -- we have somewhat lower share than we do in makeup, but our -- we have established over time a meaningful share position and the fact that we're able to continue to drive growth is, again, a testament to our model, our ability, the strength we have across price points. We're seeing strong healthy growth in both mass and prestige, really leaning into dermatologist recommended space, and believe that we can continue to drive growth going forward and continue to drive share.\n The category, we think, is healthy. As I said, with the total beauty category, we do anticipate some moderation. It's unlikely to see double-digit growth forever, but we're leaning in. We've got a great skin business. Our merchants continue to bring strong innovation. Our store teams are doing a great job educating our guests, and we're delivering a lot of growth and we see more coming. \nOperator: Our next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: Thanks for giving me another chance here to ask our question. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the strategy behind combining your promotional events like you did this past quarter? And did you see a bigger lift as a result of that change versus last year? And will there be any similar approaches to some of your promotional events being taken in the second half? \nDavid Kimbell: Great. Yes, I almost used your silence to answer any question that I wanted to [indiscernible] the earlier Kate, but glad you got back in the queue. We're excited. We -- I think what we did in the second quarter, what our teams did, our merchant marketing, digital, store teams, our go-to-market teams, really, we -- they are continually evaluating how we can get better and how we can elevate the impact, and the summer sale is an example of that. We had strong events, solid events that were delivering for years, but the team, through great consumer insights, continued understanding of guest behavior and full understanding of what unique strengths we bring to the table, reevaluated that.\n And we're pleased with the results of that event, the Big Summer Sale as well as, really, our entire promotional strategy. It was not a huge acceleration in promotional intensity as much as a smarter strategy, and it worked. Our guests engaged, we attracted new members, it delivered strong comp growth. We saw strength in both stores and on our e-commerce business traffic was healthy. So it's -- frankly, didn't surprise me because I know how the team continues to look for ways to elevate, and it's another example of great strategy leading to a strong execution. \n As we look into the second half of the year, we're evaluating, as we always do, every aspect of our go-to-market strategy. We continue to evolve our efforts. We'll adapt competitive changes, consumer insights and make sure we're delivering at a high level. Sunday, Kate, starts 21 Days of Beauty, 1 of our biggest events of the year. And I think you'll see as that rolls out, a program that's been around for a while, continued innovation and ways to engage our guests in new ways, so we're excited to get that going. \nOperator: Our next question is from Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. \nUnknown Analyst: This is [ Neil ] here on for Oliver. I would love to hear more about your thoughts on the broader beauty consumer. Someone made a comment about consumers are being less focused on pricing and kind of trading around different price points, so just curious how that behavior holds against the different macro headwinds you mentioned, particularly student loans? What's your exposure to that? Or how do you quantify that impact as we get closer to the October time frame when that becomes more material? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. Well, I'd say first of all, we're just pleased overall with the continued engagement that beauty enthusiasts are showing for this category. Coming out of the pandemic for these last a couple of years now, just a high level of engagement. You know how over the long term, last 50 years, this has been a strong growth -- consistently growing category because of the emotional connection that it plays in our guest lives, the importance it has and how they express themselves to the world, and that is more true now than ever. And some of the behaviors and engagement tools that emerge coming out of the pandemic continue to fuel the category. Strong innovation, strong connection through marketing and consumer tools and an increased understanding of the role of beauty to wellness and self-care. \n So when we look at the consumer going forward, we remain confident in the long-term outlook for this category and the strength of the beauty enthusiast to fuel it going forward. As I mentioned in the -- in my comments, there's a lot of uncertainty, and there has been, frankly, for the last couple of years. But we look into the remainder of this year, we know we're lapping. We continue to lap strong growth. We've been on this strong category growth for a while now. We have more changes coming, including student loans. So we're cautious and certainly watching carefully how that evolves.\n Historically, it's been difficult to tease out any kind of economic or stimulus shift and how directly that impacts the category or our business, and our business and the category itself has been largely resilient. Not immune, but largely resilient. So when we look out, I guess I'd say we're optimistic but watching closely and carefully. Staying really close to our guests, understanding what's happening in their lives and what's influencing their decisions and making sure we're adapting. \n Last thing I'd say, and I know I've said this many times, but our position, our unique model of having all price points and a really accessible experience, both in-store and online positions us well. So even if there's shifts, even if there are pressures on consumers, history says we are able to adapt, and I know that's the strategy that we're implementing to make sure we're here for our guests to deliver regardless of what goes on in the broader environment around them. \nKiley Rawlins: Paul, I think we have time for maybe one more question. \nOperator: Our final question is from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. \nSteven Forbes: Dave, Scott, you both mentioned in your prepared remarks the expectation for promotions to remain well below 2019 levels. And I was hoping you could just maybe clarify that statement? Is it isolated in 2023? Or is it meant to be a longer-term comment? And as we think about merchandise margin risk in the model, any way to frame what the sort of structural change in promotional activity in the category means for the margin profile in and of itself? \nScott Settersten: Yes. So when we're talking -- again, this has been an evergreen topic, I think, with investors now for quite a while, pointing back to 2019. So the business is in a much different position today than it was back in 2019. Again, for those that have been following 2019, we had some major disruption in the middle of the year in the makeup category, unexpected deceleration there. There were channel mix headwinds that we were dealing with as a business. There was some investment in some international expansion that was causing some significant deleverage on the business. And so during the course of the pandemic some initiatives that have been started pre-pandemic but during the pandemic, we were able to take advantage of making sure that we fully leverage some of our cost optimization initiatives by way of EFG, and now continuous improvement initiatives layered on top of that.\n I would say the scale of the business, much larger today than it was back in 2019. So we're going to get the benefit of the fixed store cost leverage in the base business far and above what we were looking at pre-pandemic. Things around our capabilities like ship from store and BOPIS capabilities that really did not exist in any meaningful way back in 2019 that now you heard us say again today. 30% of those digital sales are being serviced out of our store fleet, so a much more efficient delivery to the consumer and a much better overall margin profile of those sales. Things like our credit card program, our Ulta Beauty and Target relationship, UB Media, new business for us, just really out of the starting gate here over the course of the last year, puts us in a much better position overall than we were back in those days. \n So again, that's not promotion directly, but those -- all those elements play a role in gross margin and operating margin and expanding that over the course of time. So we feel confident that the promotion levels, again, they are going to moderate. We've been talking over the last couple of years that extraordinary environment that we saw in '21 and '22 was not sustainable for the long term. And that -- as people got back in the business and people were back in malls and other retail outlets that the promotion level was probably going to come back to us a little bit, and that's kind of how -- what we're seeing play out today. \n So again, there's nothing unexpected here. It was in our forecast, our plans for the year. We're moderating and navigating our way through that in an effective manner, and again, nothing -- I don't think anything that should be overly concerning to investors. Again, we're confident that we're going to be able to manage our way through that with new capabilities, new lines of business, our loyalty program and CRM capabilities being much more mature today than they were back in the pre-pandemic days.\n So we're confident, we're going to be able to deliver healthy operating margins in that 14% to 15% range and a very moderate growth expectation of 3% to 5%. So feeling good about our position and where we're headed for the future. \nDavid Kimbell: Great. Well, thank you all for joining us today. I appreciate your interest and engagement in Ulta Beauty. I want to close by thanking all of our Ulta Beauty associates for their continued care for our guests while delivering another quarter of strong financial results. We look forward to speaking to all of you again when we report results for the third quarter on November 30. \n Thanks again, and have a good evening. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Kimbell",
            "content": "Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. The Ulta Beauty team delivered strong performance again this quarter with sales, gross profit and SG&A expenses all better than planned.\n Net sales increased 10.1% to $2.5 billion, and comparable sales increased 8%. Operating profit was 15.5% of sales and diluted EPS increased 5.6% to $6.02 per share. In  addition to delivering great financial results, our teams executed against our operational priorities. During the quarter, we drove growth across all major categories, increased the number of loyalty program members, strengthened our brand engagement and achieved important milestones within our multiyear transformation initiatives.\n Through the first half, our financial results are ahead of our internal expectations, and I remain confident we can deliver against our updated guidance for fiscal 2023. I want to express my sincere appreciation to all Ulta Beauty associates for their continued commitment to delivering great guest experiences while working collaboratively to execute our ambitious transformational agenda.\n Starting with the discussion of our operational results, we saw strong sales -- solid sales performance across both our store and digital channels, driven by double-digit traffic growth. All major categories delivered comp growth for the quarter, supported by strong engagement with the overall beauty category, compelling product newness and innovation and successful execution of cross-category promotional events, including our reimagined Big Summer Beauty Sale.\n Building on last year's promotional events, we consolidated key summer events like our popular Jumbo Love and Mix & Match Minis into a broader, more cohesive event with holistic storytelling and impactful messaging. The 3-week long Big Summer Beauty Sale drove market disruption, member conversion and strong sales across our hair care, makeup and skin care categories.\n Turning to performance by category. Skin care continues to be 1 of our strongest categories, even as we lap unprecedented growth during the pandemic. For the quarter, both Prestige and mass skin care delivered double-digit growth. Newer brands, including Bubble, BIOMA and Beautycounter and innovation from existing brands like The Ordinary, Drunk Elephant and Supergoop! contributed to the strong sales results. Reflecting consumer interest in dermatologist recommended brands, La Roche-Posay and CeraVe continued to perform well, and brands like Good Molecules, Hero Cosmetics and Peach Slices continue to benefit from social virality.\n The fragrance and bath category delivered double-digit comp growth again this quarter. Layering and wardrobing scents as a form of self-expression, especially among Gen Z consumers, continues to drive category engagement. Newness from Ariana Grande, Valentino and Burberry contributed to the category's performance, and key gift-giving events like Mother's Day and Father's Day drove growth for luxury brands like Carolina Herrera, Chanel and YSL.\n The hair care category delivered mid-single-digit comp growth driven by newness and guest engagement with our strategic events. Hair care focused on bonding, scalp treatments and other repair solutions as well as products that offer healthy heat styling options continue to drive consumer engagement. Trend-relevant products from professional brands, Redken, Biolage and Matrix as well as newness from prestige brands, [indiscernible] and IGK resonated strongly. New brands, including exclusive brands LolaVie, created by Jennifer Anderson, and Donna's Recipe also contributed to growth this quarter. While still challenged as we lap several years of strong growth, sales trends in hair tools improved from the first quarter, driven by compelling newness from Dyson and innovation from Bio Ionic.\n Finally, makeup delivered low single-digit comp growth, driven by strong performance in mass cosmetics. New brands like Dior, NATASHA DENONA and Beautycounter drove growth during the quarter, while new and exclusive products from a wide range of brands, including e.l.f, NYX and OPI also contributed positively. Compelling events, including our Big Summer Beauty Sale, National Lipstick Week and our foundation event as well as successful Barbie and Little Mermaid collaborations drove guest engagement. While the performance of mass cosmetics benefited from engaging newness in social content, our prestige makeup business was challenged as we lapped the significant impact of the Fenty launch last year.\n Our services business delivered double-digit comp growth again this quarter, primarily driven by increased appointments. Guests are engaging in core cut, color and blowout services as well as newer services, including extensions and scalp and hair treatments. We continue to enhance our service offering, and this quarter, we launched ear piercings chain-wide and introduced a new Keratin Express treatment.\n The beauty category growth remains healthy across both prestige and mass price tiers as consumers maintain their post-pandemic routines and expand their definition of beauty. When we look at the total beauty market, our analysis demonstrates we continue to gain market share. In mass beauty, we gained share this quarter across all major categories. In prestige, we continue to drive solid gains in skin and fragrance but saw pressure in makeup and hair based on Circana's beauty sales data.\n Our proprietary insights suggest consumers are becoming less focused on product pricing tiers and are trading around, choosing to engage with brands that offer on-trend newness and compelling social media content. As the only beauty retailer to offer a curated assortment of products from entry-level mass to luxury and everything in between, we are uniquely positioned to capture share of the total beauty market as consumers shift. We remain confident in the resilience of beauty. Our strategic framework guides our priorities and positions us to expand our market leadership and drive long-term profitable growth.\n Let me share some highlights of the progress we made against this framework in the second quarter. Starting with our efforts to drive growth with an expanded definition of All Things Beauty. Newness and innovation are critical growth drivers for beauty. Newness comes to life in the form of new brands, products and product lines, shade extensions and reformulations, and fuels discovery and drive trips and engagement. As we seek to continuously delight guests with all Things Beauty, we continue to expand our assortment and innovate -- with innovative and emerging brands.\n Building on newness introduced in the first half, we have several exciting launches planned for the third quarter, including Half Magic, a vegan and cruelty-free makeup brand created by Euphoria makeup artist Donni Davy, exclusive to Ulta Beauty. Polite Society, a prestige makeup brand exclusive to Ulta Beauty curated -- created by the founders of Too Faced Cosmetics. Rabanne, a contemporary and relevant Spanish fashion brand launching cosmetics exclusively at Ulta Beauty. Hair styling tools at accessible price points from Shark Beauty; PanOxyl, a dermatologist recommended brand popular with Gen Z; and Sniff, an emerging fragrance band offering gender neutral sense available only at Ulta Beauty.\n Reflecting the growth and popularity of luxury products with younger generations, last quarter, we launched Luxury at Ulta Beauty in 200 stores and on ulta.com. The program has exceeded our expectations, and we continue to see strong guest engagement with our offerings across all categories. Building on this success, we are excited to launch Pat McGrath Labs, a BIPOC luxe artistry makeup brand. Pat McGrath is a trusted expert who has shaped and disrupted the cosmetic category.\n Now, let me share an update on our key cross-category platforms, which lean into broader emerging trends in beauty, products that are good for the world, inclusivity and wellness. As we seek to provide guests with a diverse assortment that reflects their personal values and individual needs, we continue to expand our assortment of brands featuring clean, cruelty-free and vegan ingredients, leveraging sustainable packaging and driving positive impact through our Conscious Beauty platform.\n At the end of the quarter, 314 brands were certified in at least 1 pillar, with more than 270 brands certified in multiple pillars. To ensure all guests feel connected and reflected at Ulta Beauty, we continue our important efforts to drive inclusivity. In addition to amplifying our portfolio of BIPOC brands through informative marketing and in-store presentations, this quarter, we hosted a summit for our BIPOC brands, providing them with opportunities to network with peers while learning more about the beauty industry and operational best practices.\n Lastly, as the importance of beauty as a form of self-care and wellness continues to build, we enhanced the wellness shop assortment with the launch of 2 exciting supplements: Lemme Gummies created by Kourtney Kardashian, and the introduction of Big Brain Probiotics from Love Wellness.\n Turning now to our second strategic pillar, All In Your World, we are enhancing guest experiences across all of our touch points. Guests continue to shift effortlessly between physical and digital channels, depending on their individual needs, and we are committed to meeting them wherever they are in their beauty journey. Reflecting our efforts to enhance our buy anywhere fill anywhere capabilities, we have expanded our same-day delivery option to essentially every store and improved our store fulfillment process to drive greater efficiency and speed.\n Between BOPIS, same-day delivery and ship from store capabilities, 31% of our e-commerce sales and 39% of our digital orders were fulfilled by our store teams this quarter. Our consumer insights and member data confirm the importance of physical shopping in beauty. More than 75% of our members choose to transact with us only in stores, and yet we know many of these members use our digital platforms for discovery, try-on and inspiration. Converting these members to omnichannel members is a meaningful opportunity to increase engagement and spend per member as omnichannel shoppers spend 2.5x to 3x more than single channel shoppers.\n Importantly, the increase in spend is largely incremental.\n Expanded engagement with our mobile app is 1 way we are driving omnichannel conversion. Through our digital store refresh, we enhanced the user search and discovery experience, seamlessly blending commerce and content for a more personalized experience. We also continue to expand and enhance our digital try-on capabilities. This quarter, we launched a virtual try-on tool that enables guests to try multiple nail looks simultaneously, and we upgraded our virtual hair try-on experience with expanded color options and enhanced transfer quality and speed. These enhancements, combined with awareness campaigns, unique offers to drive utilization and increased associate education have delivered meaningful growth.\n Over the last 12 months, 9 million active members have engaged with our mobile app, double the number of members who engaged with the app before the pandemic. And we're seeing stronger engagement, with more than 55% of e-commerce sales coming through our mobile app.\n Turning to our partnership with Target. We opened 62 Ulta Beauty at Target shops during the quarter, ending the quarter with 421 shops. Our marketing teams work closely with our target partners to build awareness for newer brands, including Billie Eilish and Ariana Grande Fragrances, Glamnetic, and Living Proof, while also amplifying Summer prestige Must-Haves and minis. As the partnership scales, we are learning more about the Ulta Beauty at Target guests and the role this touchpoint plays in their beauty journey, and we will continue to leverage our expertise to develop unique assortments that reflect the preferences of the Ulta Beauty at Target guests.\n Moving to our third strategic pillar, operating at the Heart of the Beauty community, we are focused on driving greater love, loyalty and emotional connection with Ulta Beauty. We began this quarter with a Mother's Day campaign that highlighted exclusive cross-category gifts, including our luxury assortment and hero fragrances. Moving into June, we positioned Ulta Beauty as the destination for Summer Beauty, driving top-of-mind awareness and traffic with compelling points offers and special deals across the assortment to celebrate our members.\n Finally, we closed the quarter with our Big Summer Beauty Sale, a bold and disruptive event that offered opportunities to save on fan favorite beauty items across all categories and price points from a variety of established and emerging brands. These key events, paired with our culturally-relevant content amplifications drove record-level highs in unaided awareness with our greatest gains among Gen Z consumers.\n Turning to our loyalty program. We ended the quarter with 41.7 million active members, 9% higher than last year, driven by strong member acquisition and reactivation, combined with healthy retention of existing members. Spend per member also increased, driven by greater shopper frequency. The strength of our loyalty program continues to be a powerful and differentiated strategic asset for Ulta Beauty, and we are pleased with its elevated growth and performance.\n Our continued efforts to nurture the member life cycle is driving results. We accelerated new member acquisition and continue to engage and retain members with meaningful events, compelling points offers, personalized content and special guests. These strategies also delivered growth in our Diamond and Platinum tiers, which increased nearly 30% compared to the same period last year, reflecting strong loyalty and engagement with all Ulta Beauty offers.\n Turning now to our efforts to drive operational excellence and optimization. We are executing an ambitious multiyear road map of transformation initiatives intended to unlock new capabilities and efficiencies to fuel our future growth. As we have discussed on previous calls, we are expanding and optimizing our supply chain, upgrading our enterprise resource planning platform, transitioning our digital store to a new platform, enhancing our data management systems and upgrading store POS systems.\n I am pleased to share that our teams have delivered several key milestones. Our new Greer, South Carolina market fulfillment center began receiving inventory last month, and we expect to start shipping to stores next week. We completed the installation of a new automated storage and retrieval system in our Greenwood distribution center, which will increase capacity and enable greater productivity. We expanded our ship from store capabilities to an additional 276 stores. Today, we fulfill e-commerce orders from 400 strategically-located stores, enabling faster, more cost-effective delivery to the guest. We successfully transitioned 2 distribution centers, Jacksonville and Greer, to our new ERP platform.\n As part of our digital store transformation, we successfully completed a large-scale upgrade of our end-to-end e-commerce platform and migrated to a new modernized platform that includes a new promotion engine, guest account, cart and checkout. This is a significant milestone in our multiyear effort to elevate our digital experience in a way that positions us for long-term growth in this critical channel.\n Finally, we completed the POS upgrade in all stores. While our transformation agenda is not finished, we have made significant progress, and I am proud of how our teams have worked to execute our plans while limiting disruption to guests and associates.\n Looking forward, we continue to operate in a dynamic environment. While consumer confidence has strengthened, there are signs pointing to moderating growth going forward. Many consumers have begun to reduce overall spending, credit card debt remains high and the restart of student loan repayments is approaching. It is unclear how these factors will impact consumer behavior in the near term, but despite these factors, beauty has remained a bright spot.  \n Based on Circana beauty sales data, total U.S. beauty sales for the first half of 2023 increased double digits compared to the same period last year, with prestige beauty channels delivering higher growth than mass beauty channels. Looking to the rest of the year, we believe growth for the U.S. beauty market will remain healthy but normalize into the mid-single digits as we lap 2 years of strong growth, experienced less impact from pricing and face more economic uncertainty.\n As category growth normalizes, we continue to expect promotional activity within the category will also normalize. Over the last 2 years, unprecedented category growth and strong demand limited promotional activity. As a result, the promotional environment in 2021 and 2022 was unsustainably low. Reflecting these factors, we planned for higher promotional activity this year but continue to expect promotions will remain well below 2019 levels.\n In closing, we operate in an attractive and growing category. We have a strong, proven business model and a winning culture and outstanding teams. Through the first half of fiscal 2023, we have exceeded our internal financial expectations, and we remain confident we can deliver our updated expectations for the rest of the year.\n And now, I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? Yes. Ashley, for the quarter, we saw strong traffic throughout the quarter with double-digit traffic. And we continue to be pleased with the engagement that we're seeing, and we saw actual comp performance sequentially accelerate through the quarter as well. And all of those trends are reflected into our updated and elevated guidance for the full year. \n On fragrance, the -- I'll let Kecia kind of discuss what we're doing in fragrance and how that's impacting our business. Yes, I'd say, yes, we do anticipate continuing to gain share. We've done so through the first half of the year, and that is our outlook. The commentary is really as we look into the second half of the year, we see some strength. Engagement continues to be high. Certainly, our business is performing very well. We're attracting new members. We're growing across all key categories, both -- and then in both e-com and stores. But we also see some uncertainty as we get in later into the year.\n So while we're confident in the category, we're just incorporating into our outlook some full -- some of that. And for the full year, we're looking at revenue in the plus 8% to 9% range, so we anticipate gaining share for the year being ahead of the total category growth. That's -- that will be our plan. What was the last part of that question? What was -- could you repeat the last... Well, yes, we -- as I discussed, we've seen strong performance really across our entire assortment as we look at it, but mass has been a bit stronger for a couple of quarters now in -- across our business. And that's driven largely by strong consumer engagement across some key brands in makeup, health, NYX and some others are really hitting the market with great innovation, great marketing, great consumer engagement. And the fact that we offer the full assortment from mass to prestige is a real benefit. We're able to capitalize on strong trends and strong engagements across all aspects of that. \n In skin care, we're seeing brands, particularly in the dermatologist recommended area driving strong growth, and that's great, we -- strong player for us. As we look forward, it's always our intent to continue to adapt and adjust and lean into the areas that are driving growth, find ways to strengthen those that may be more challenged, but we're confident in the outlook going forward. And the fact that we have both is unique. Of course you know that, but the fact that we're the only ones that offer mass, masstige, prestige and a growing, established now, business in luxury.\n We're seeing strong points across all. We'll continue to flex and adapt and incorporate it into our comp guidance is our ability to continue to drive growth. But through the first half of the year, we're really pleased with the Mass performance and several brands driving strong growth, and continue to lean in and bring innovation into the prestige side of the business. And collectively, it's working to allow us to gain share across Ulta Beauty. Yes. Won't break out exact percentages. Again, to reiterate, it's in 200 stores. We're really pleased with it, a strong assortment across a number of the very best brands in luxury. Chanel, Dior, NATASHA DENONA, HOURGLASS, an extension of Chanel with Chanel Nu\u0301mero Uno, Lanco\u0302me, Absolute, now Pat McGrath. A luxury fragrance business with brands like YSL and TOM FORD and Viktor&Rolf.\n So we won't get into exact percentages, but it is an important part of our overall strategy. We know there's growth in the luxury side of the business. We've been in luxury for a while, but now with this expanded presence, it is a contributor to our total comp. We're excited about the addition of Pat McGrath, and we'll continue to innovate and evolve and find ways to drive further growth down the road. \n So yes, we think it's -- we know it's contributing to our growth, and we're excited about our guest response to an expanded luxury experience. Yes. I'd say on makeup, the main driver is while our -- we're bringing a lot of innovation and newness across that prestige portfolio, lapping -- really, one of the biggest launches in the history of Ulta Beauty with Fenty, lapping that fully in the second quarter is probably the biggest driver. We're excited though as we look forward. I mentioned a few launches that we that we have coming out, Rabanne, Pat McGrath, Polite Society, among others that many of which are exclusive to Ulta Beauty and are coming into our business in the second half of the year.\n But we anticipate as we lap that launch. We'll continue to see pressure on prestige. Mass continues to drive growth behind great innovation, great engagement. And so we're pleased with the total makeup side of the business even as we address some of the pressure in lapping previous launches.\n In the skin care side, yes, we are -- we have somewhat lower share than we do in makeup, but our -- we have established over time a meaningful share position and the fact that we're able to continue to drive growth is, again, a testament to our model, our ability, the strength we have across price points. We're seeing strong healthy growth in both mass and prestige, really leaning into dermatologist recommended space, and believe that we can continue to drive growth going forward and continue to drive share.\n The category, we think, is healthy. As I said, with the total beauty category, we do anticipate some moderation. It's unlikely to see double-digit growth forever, but we're leaning in. We've got a great skin business. Our merchants continue to bring strong innovation. Our store teams are doing a great job educating our guests, and we're delivering a lot of growth and we see more coming. Great. Yes, I almost used your silence to answer any question that I wanted to [indiscernible] the earlier Kate, but glad you got back in the queue. We're excited. We -- I think what we did in the second quarter, what our teams did, our merchant marketing, digital, store teams, our go-to-market teams, really, we -- they are continually evaluating how we can get better and how we can elevate the impact, and the summer sale is an example of that. We had strong events, solid events that were delivering for years, but the team, through great consumer insights, continued understanding of guest behavior and full understanding of what unique strengths we bring to the table, reevaluated that.\n And we're pleased with the results of that event, the Big Summer Sale as well as, really, our entire promotional strategy. It was not a huge acceleration in promotional intensity as much as a smarter strategy, and it worked. Our guests engaged, we attracted new members, it delivered strong comp growth. We saw strength in both stores and on our e-commerce business traffic was healthy. So it's -- frankly, didn't surprise me because I know how the team continues to look for ways to elevate, and it's another example of great strategy leading to a strong execution. \n As we look into the second half of the year, we're evaluating, as we always do, every aspect of our go-to-market strategy. We continue to evolve our efforts. We'll adapt competitive changes, consumer insights and make sure we're delivering at a high level. Sunday, Kate, starts 21 Days of Beauty, 1 of our biggest events of the year. And I think you'll see as that rolls out, a program that's been around for a while, continued innovation and ways to engage our guests in new ways, so we're excited to get that going. Yes. Well, I'd say first of all, we're just pleased overall with the continued engagement that beauty enthusiasts are showing for this category. Coming out of the pandemic for these last a couple of years now, just a high level of engagement. You know how over the long term, last 50 years, this has been a strong growth -- consistently growing category because of the emotional connection that it plays in our guest lives, the importance it has and how they express themselves to the world, and that is more true now than ever. And some of the behaviors and engagement tools that emerge coming out of the pandemic continue to fuel the category. Strong innovation, strong connection through marketing and consumer tools and an increased understanding of the role of beauty to wellness and self-care. \n So when we look at the consumer going forward, we remain confident in the long-term outlook for this category and the strength of the beauty enthusiast to fuel it going forward. As I mentioned in the -- in my comments, there's a lot of uncertainty, and there has been, frankly, for the last couple of years. But we look into the remainder of this year, we know we're lapping. We continue to lap strong growth. We've been on this strong category growth for a while now. We have more changes coming, including student loans. So we're cautious and certainly watching carefully how that evolves.\n Historically, it's been difficult to tease out any kind of economic or stimulus shift and how directly that impacts the category or our business, and our business and the category itself has been largely resilient. Not immune, but largely resilient. So when we look out, I guess I'd say we're optimistic but watching closely and carefully. Staying really close to our guests, understanding what's happening in their lives and what's influencing their decisions and making sure we're adapting. \n Last thing I'd say, and I know I've said this many times, but our position, our unique model of having all price points and a really accessible experience, both in-store and online positions us well. So even if there's shifts, even if there are pressures on consumers, history says we are able to adapt, and I know that's the strategy that we're implementing to make sure we're here for our guests to deliver regardless of what goes on in the broader environment around them. Great. Well, thank you all for joining us today. I appreciate your interest and engagement in Ulta Beauty. I want to close by thanking all of our Ulta Beauty associates for their continued care for our guests while delivering another quarter of strong financial results. We look forward to speaking to all of you again when we report results for the third quarter on November 30. \n Thanks again, and have a good evening."

            "name": "Scott Settersten",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave shared, we delivered second quarter financial results that were ahead of our expectations. Strong sales growth supported by healthy guest engagement and strong in-store sales performance drove better-than-expected gross margin. SG&A spend was also lower than planned, resulting in an operating margin of 15.5%. \n Turning to the P&L. Net sales for the quarter increased 10.1%, driven by 8% growth in comp sales, strong new store performance and solid growth in other revenues. Transactions for the quarter increased 9%, primarily, driven by healthy traffic on both channels. Average ticket decreased 1% as the decline in average units per transaction more than offset the impact of higher average selling price. The increase in average selling price was primarily driven by the impact of retail price increases, many of which were executed last year. We estimate price increases contributed about 300 basis points to the overall comp.\n During the quarter, we opened 3 new stores and relocated 2 stores. In addition, we remodeled 3 stores. Second quarter gross margin decreased 110 basis points to 39.3% compared to 40.4% last year. The decrease was driven by lower merchandise margin, an increase in inventory shrink and higher supply chain costs. Overall merchandise margin was lower due primarily to increased promotional activity, unfavorable category mix and less benefit from the timing of retail price changes. While promotional activity continues to normalize, it is important to note that overall promotions remain well below 2019 levels.\n Inventory shrink continued to be a headwind this quarter. Our efforts to address shrink are having an impact, but the overall environment remains challenging. Today, we have the new fragrance fixtures in more than 50% of our stores and expect to have these installed in 70% of the fleet by year-end. We remain focused on taking action in areas we can control, including continued investment in fixtures, associate training, staffing as well as operational improvements, and leveraging our influence to enact broader changes that will disincentivize unlawful behavior.\n Supply chain costs were higher, primarily driven by ongoing investments in our supply chain transformation as we made progress on the retrofit of our Dallas and Greenwood distribution centers and prepared to open our new market fulfillment center in Greer, South Carolina. These gross margin pressures were partially offset by strong growth in other revenue and leverage of store fixed costs due to top line sales growth.\n SG&A increased 12.4% to $600.7 million. SG&A increased 40 basis points to 23.7% compared to 23.3% last year. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales was driven by deleverage of corporate overhead due to strategic investments, planned increases in store payroll and benefits and higher store expenses, which more than offset lower incentive compensation. Corporate overhead expense deleveraged in the quarter primarily due to investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, other IT capabilities and UB Media.\n Year-to-date through the second quarter, we have invested a little less than half of our planned $60 million to $70 million of incremental spend to support our strategic initiatives. The increase in store payroll and benefits was primarily due to the impact of planned growth in average wage rates and increased staffing levels compared to the same period last year. Incentive compensation was a tailwind in the quarter, reflecting operational performance that is more in line with our internal targets compared to last year's significant outperformance.\n Operating income for the quarter was $391.6 million, flat to last year. As a percentage of sales, operating margin decreased 150 basis points to 15.5% compared to 17% last year. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 5.6% to $6.02 per share compared to $5.70 per share last year.\n Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 9% to $1.82 billion compared to $1.67 billion last year, in addition to the impact of 37 additional stores, the increase reflects inventory to support higher demand, increases in product costs and new brand launches.\n Capital expenditures were $95 million for the quarter compared to $49.4 million last year. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily related to investments in IT and supply chain to support our transformational agenda as well as merchandising investments to support the rollout of our luxury assortment and brand expansions.\n Depreciation was $61.9 million in the quarter compared to $60.9 million last year. We ended the quarter with $388.6 million in cash and cash equivalents.\n During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 594,000 shares at a cost of $275.5 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 1.1 million shares at a cost of $559 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had $541 million remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization.\n Moving to our outlook. We are updating our guidance for fiscal 2023 to reflect our better-than-expected second quarter performance. We have raised our top line expectations and now project net sales will be between $11.05 million and $11.15 billion, with comp sales growth between 4.5% and 5.5%. \n Our updated outlook reflects our strong first half performance while continuing to consider risks and uncertainties that could impact demand in the second half of the year, including rising consumer debt levels and the expected resumption of student loan repayments. We continue to expect comps will moderate to the low single digits in the second half of the year, and we remain on track to open 25 to 30 new stores and renovate or relocate 20 to 30 stores this year.\n Reflecting our year-to-date performance, we've raised the low end of the range of operating margin and now expect operating margins for the year will be between 14.6% and 14.8% of sales, with deleverage to come fairly evenly from both gross margin and SG&A. Our expectations reflect the continuation of the trends we experienced through the first half of the year around shrink, promotional activity and supply chain costs as well as greater headwind from lapping the merchandise margin benefits from the timing of retail price increases last year.\n For modeling purposes, we expect third quarter operating margin will be meaningfully more pressured than what we saw in the second quarter as we lap greater pricing benefits in the third quarter last year as well as a shift of investment spending from Q2 to Q3. As a result, we expect earnings per share for the third quarter will be lower than last year.\n Reflecting these updated assumptions, we now expect diluted earnings per share for the year will be between $25.10 and $25.60. As a reminder, fiscal 2023 is a 53-week year. We anticipate the additional week will add between $165 million to $175 million in sales and approximately $0.40 of earnings per share. In closing, our results through the first 6 months of fiscal 2023 highlights the ongoing power and resilience of our business model.\n I'd like to thank our associates for their dedication and commitment to keeping our guests at the center of all we do and giving them more reasons to shop Ulta Beauty. As we look to the future, we are focused on capitalizing on the growth opportunities in the beauty category and executing our strategic framework to deliver long-term sustainable growth for all our stakeholders.\n And now, I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. Sure, Chris. So yes, versus -- we did say, again, versus our expectations for the quarter, we're very happy with the overall financial results we were able to deliver. So breaking it down a little bit more, I'd say merchandise margin was better than what we expected, and so that speaks partially to the promotional lever that people are focused on here. So again, generally better than what we expected, so we can lean in and lean out. That's 1 of the great strengths of our business, being able to have real-time information and be able to take quick action and be agile.\n I'd say shrink generally directionally about the same as what we saw in the first quarter. As we look out to the rest of the year, we don't really -- we're not anticipating a significant turn and expectations there. We expect it to be tough the rest of the way. And we'll say maybe the fourth quarter may be slightly less negative than it was early part of the year because remember, last year in the fourth quarter was the first time we really called out and quantified what the shrink impact was, so we did have a little bit of a catch-up there. Over -- and then fixed -- store fixed costs we talked about, that was stronger than what we -- going in expectation because sales were a bit stronger than what we thought. And then channel mix overall helped us as well. \n As we look to think about gross margin the second half of the year, I'd say the drivers, the headwinds are consistent with what we've seen in the first half of 2023. Again, we're taking a prudent approach as we always do with our guidance, and we'll work hard to do better than that. Yes. So there was -- we -- third quarter last year is where we saw a significant step-up in the pricing increases across the portfolio, and really, the margin benefit started really rolling through in the second quarter and into the back half of the year. So this is really the toughest anniversary point in the year is ahead of us right now, and that's why we're calling out third quarter. Third quarter is kind of peak on a number of different fronts. Again, every year is a little unique, but the third quarter now, we've got a little bit of delays in some of our project work, which is shifting back some of our IT expense into the third quarter. And a lot of that flows through SG&A.\n So we'll see more pressure there than we saw earlier in the year, and then likewise, with gross margin. And a little -- and more moderate sales growth expectations, coupled with cycling over the margin benefits last year from the price increases step up in the back half of the year, putting more pressure on third quarter than maybe some would expect. But again, by the time we get in the fourth quarter and get back to focusing on sales in the holiday, we expect that to bounce back in a healthy manner. Yes. We don't want to get into quantifying it specifically, Adrienne. But I'd say directionally, you're in the right zip code. So yes, on the SG&A side, that's roughly kind of the shift back into the third quarter on some of the IT spend. And yes, operating margin is going to be down meaningfully versus what we saw earlier this year, and that's going to result in negative EPS growth year-over-year for the third quarter. Yes, and you're exactly right. We're not providing guidance for 2024 here today, but yes, investors should expect that we will cultivate, recoup benefits from the significant investments that we're making in our core systems year 20 -- '22 into '23 and that we're going to see benefits materialized in 2024 and beyond. Again, you've heard us talk about, these are major initiatives here that we expect to see dividends for a number of years into the future, but I would also caution investors just to be prepared. I mean there's -- we are in the business of growing Ulta Beauty for the long term, and so there's plenty of other great growth initiatives out there that we've got in the queue that we're ready to go tackle. As soon as we get through some of more of this, I'd call core transformation work here in '23 and early 2024. Yes. So when we're talking -- again, this has been an evergreen topic, I think, with investors now for quite a while, pointing back to 2019. So the business is in a much different position today than it was back in 2019. Again, for those that have been following 2019, we had some major disruption in the middle of the year in the makeup category, unexpected deceleration there. There were channel mix headwinds that we were dealing with as a business. There was some investment in some international expansion that was causing some significant deleverage on the business. And so during the course of the pandemic some initiatives that have been started pre-pandemic but during the pandemic, we were able to take advantage of making sure that we fully leverage some of our cost optimization initiatives by way of EFG, and now continuous improvement initiatives layered on top of that.\n I would say the scale of the business, much larger today than it was back in 2019. So we're going to get the benefit of the fixed store cost leverage in the base business far and above what we were looking at pre-pandemic. Things around our capabilities like ship from store and BOPIS capabilities that really did not exist in any meaningful way back in 2019 that now you heard us say again today. 30% of those digital sales are being serviced out of our store fleet, so a much more efficient delivery to the consumer and a much better overall margin profile of those sales. Things like our credit card program, our Ulta Beauty and Target relationship, UB Media, new business for us, just really out of the starting gate here over the course of the last year, puts us in a much better position overall than we were back in those days. \n So again, that's not promotion directly, but those -- all those elements play a role in gross margin and operating margin and expanding that over the course of time. So we feel confident that the promotion levels, again, they are going to moderate. We've been talking over the last couple of years that extraordinary environment that we saw in '21 and '22 was not sustainable for the long term. And that -- as people got back in the business and people were back in malls and other retail outlets that the promotion level was probably going to come back to us a little bit, and that's kind of how -- what we're seeing play out today. \n So again, there's nothing unexpected here. It was in our forecast, our plans for the year. We're moderating and navigating our way through that in an effective manner, and again, nothing -- I don't think anything that should be overly concerning to investors. Again, we're confident that we're going to be able to manage our way through that with new capabilities, new lines of business, our loyalty program and CRM capabilities being much more mature today than they were back in the pre-pandemic days.\n So we're confident, we're going to be able to deliver healthy operating margins in that 14% to 15% range and a very moderate growth expectation of 3% to 5%. So feeling good about our position and where we're headed for the future."

            "content": "Yes. Actually, we've locked up about 50% of our stores right now. And what we're seeing is in the initial stores that we rolled out the locked fragrance cases for, we actually saw sales improvement because we were in stock with the product and we had it available to the guests. So we're staying very close to that. We're also investing in labor because we don't want to be sales preventative from the guests being able to purchase. So that's a little bit of the investment in labor that you heard earlier from Scott, is that in these stores, we are upping our labor a bit because we want to make sure that we're able to take care of the guests. \n So we're staying close to it. The bottom line is that we're pleased that we're able to maintain our in-stock for our guests, and quite frankly, keep the bad actors [ out ] from coming into our stores. Adrienne, I'll start, and then I'll kick it over to Scott. So yes, we're in the middle of an ambitious transformational agenda. That's for sure. And part of this is really positioning all parts of the organization for our future efforts, and overall we're really pleased with how our progress is working. But anyone who's taken on this large scale of a project, we definitely have timing shifts that happen because we want to make sure that while we're staying forward, progressing and moving, we are really limited in our distraction and our disruption for our guests and also for our associates. \n So we've adopted a few of our time lines and have shifted a couple of the projects from Q2 into Q3, and we might even see some shifting from Q3 into Q4, but we're still on track to spend the $60 million to $70 million incremental to the prior year. And while we've got some of those shifts, we still are very confident that we're going to stay with our overall time line and how things wrapped up by the right time line for next year, which is more mid-2024. \n I'll turn it over to Scott."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. \n It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President of Investor Relations.

Dave? \nDavid Kimbell: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. Fiscal 2023 is off to a good start. For the first quarter, we delivered net sales, operating margin and diluted EPS that were consistent with our internal expectations.\n Net sales increased 12.3% to $2.6 billion, and comparable sales increased 9.3%. Operating margin was 16.8% of sales and diluted EPS increased 9.2% to $6.88 per share. Our store traffic remained healthy and member growth continued to be strong. We delivered growth across key categories, and we strengthened engagement with the Ulta Beauty brand. I want to thank our Ulta Beauty associates for their focus on creating great guest experiences while continuing to adapt to a dynamic environment and executing our transformational agenda. \n The operating environment continues to evolve and consumers are exploring how best to navigate the economic uncertainty. Inflation concerns remain high and consumers are spending more selectively while also showing a continued willingness to splurge and treat themselves. Engagement with beauty remains strong, reflecting the prioritization of self-care. Category growth is healthy but moderating as we lap 2 years of unprecedented growth. And as category growth normalizes, promotional activity is increasing. While we do not intend to lead promotional intensity, we will respond as appropriate to protect and expand our share using a variety of tools we have developed and invested in over the last several years. \n Using the consumer lens of how guests experience Ulta Beauty through our multiple touch points to include our physical stores, our e-commerce business and Ulta Beauty at Target, the Ulta Beauty experience is resonating with our guests and gaining share. As we have seen in previous quarters, sales in our mass category grew faster than prestige categories. It is difficult to know with certainty if the robust growth of mass products is due to strong engagement with innovative mass brands such as e.l.f. and La Roche-Posay or due to increased consumer price sensitivity. Importantly, Ulta Beauty is the only beauty retailer that offers a wide variety of price points, from entry level mass to luxury and everything in between. And as such, we are uniquely positioned to capture any consumer shifts within price points in the beauty category. \n Skincare was our best performing category again this quarter with both prestige and mass delivering double-digit comp growth, driven primarily by newness, engaging social media content and strong performance through 21 Days of Beauty and Spring Hall. Newness from innovative brands like The Ordinary, Drunk Elephant and Hero Cosmetics, as well as new brands, including Bubble, Beautycounter and BYOMA, contributed to growth during the quarter. In addition, social media platforms continue driving content category engagement, resulting in robust growth for dermatologist-recommended brands like La Roche-Posay and trend forward brands like COSRX. \n The fragrance and bath categories delivered low double-digit percent growth this quarter, lapping 2 consecutive years of strong double-digit growth. Newness from Ariana Grande, Carolina Herrera and Valentino contributed meaningfully, and our monthly Fragrance Crush program fueled strong engagement with newer brand Billie Eilish as well as established brands Lancome and Dior. In addition, Valentine's stay gift-giving was healthy across both men's and women's fragrances. \n Makeup delivered high single-digit growth for the quarter, driven by newness and guest engagement with 21 Days of Beauty and Spring Hall. Soft bronzing, glossy lips and expressive eyes and nails are trends driving growth for the category. New brands like Dior, about-face and NATASHA DENONA drove sales during the quarter, while new products from a wide range of brands including e.l.f., Fenty and NYX also contributed to growth. In addition, the expansion of MAC into more stores, combined with compelling newness, continued to drive sales. \n Finally, the hair category was flat for the quarter, with growth in hair care products and color offset by lower demand for tools as we lapped strong newness last year. Products focused on hair health, including bonding, scalp treatments and hydration, as well as those focused on styling, are resonating strongly. Newer brands like Donna's Recipe, Odele and Divi as well as new products from masstige brands Eva Nyc, Batiste and Andrew Fitzsimons were notable drivers for the category. Trend-relevant products from OUIA, Redken and Kenra resonated with guests, while engaging social media content drove healthy growth for Mielle and IGK. \n Our services business delivered double-digit comp growth again this quarter, driven by growth in cut and style, blowout and makeup services. As we have expanded our service offerings and enhanced our stylist talent, more members are using services. And our Salon Backbar Takeovers, which give our stylists a unique opportunity to introduce new brands and products to guests, drove sales growth and new member acquisition for participating brands. \n Now similar to what other retailers have shared, we continue to see pressure from inventory shrink this quarter and we have updated our full year guidance to reflect the persistence of this trend. While shrink is the result of various factors, theft, specifically organized retail crime, or ORC, is an increasingly concerning challenge, especially as we've seen a rise in violence and aggression during these incidents. \n Our first priority is the safety and well-being of our associates and our guests. We are committed to ensuring a safe work environment and are investing in fixtures, training, support structures and increased staffing and security to aggressively address this concerning trend. ORC impacts all of our stakeholders, guests, associates, brand partners, investors and communities, and it will not be solved by retailers alone. Given the complexity, it will take collaboration across retail, manufacturing, law enforcement and legislative levels to solve these problems. Now working together, I am optimistic we can create meaningful impact and bring forward creative, sustainable solutions to restore safe shopping experiences for everyone. \n As we have previously discussed, beauty is not immune to macroeconomic challenges, but has historically been more resilient compared to other discretionary categories due to its deep emotional connection with consumers. We believe this connection is even greater today given the importance of beauty as a form of self-care and wellness. As we navigate this dynamic operating environment, our strategic framework guides our priorities and positions us to build on our market leadership and drive long-term profitable growth. \n Let me give you an update on the progress we've made against this framework in the first quarter. Starting with our efforts to drive growth with an expanded definition of All Things Beauty, our strategy is to delight beauty enthusiasts with our thoughtfully curated assortment focused on inclusivity and leading trends. During the first quarter, we further enhanced our assortment with the launch of several exciting brands, including: NATASHA DENONA, a luxury artistry brand known for high-quality makeup pallets across eye, face and cheek; Beautycounter, a clean beauty pioneer, offering high-performing skincare and makeup with unmatched ingredient safety standards; and Odele, a haircare brand focused on clean, accessible products for the whole family. To drive engagement and capture additional market share this quarter, we launched Luxury at Ulta Beauty in 200 stores and on ulta.com. Driven by social platforms and strong Gen Z interest, luxury brands are fueling beauty category growth. \n Our vision for Luxury at Ulta Beauty is to provide guests with a uniquely modern luxury beauty experience, strategically curated to reflect what guests are engaging most in, including iconic luxury with brands like Dior and Lancome Absolue; clean luxury with brands like Hourglass CHANEL N\u00b01; and luxe artistry brands like NATASHA DENONA. In addition to strengthening our core assortment, we continue to expand, evolve and amplify our cross-category platforms. \n Let me share some first quarter highlights. We ended the quarter with 306 brands certified and at least one conscious beauty pillar, including newly certified brands Nutritious Estee Lauder, Winky Lux and Mielle. In celebration of Earth Day, to promote sustainability and to drive discovery, we launched a collectible Ulta Beauty reusable tote and a Conscious Beauty essential sample kit with Hero products from 14 certified brands, including boscia, Beekman 1802 and ACURE. We continue to support black-owned and founded brands with the launch of new brands, hanahana beauty and GOLDE. We created a black-owned and founded brands discovery kit featuring 11 brands, and 100% of the purchase price of this kit was donated to Big Brothers Big Sisters of America. \n In recognition of Black History Month, we celebrated and supported the Black community through [ rich ] Ode to Black Beauty storytelling and used our digital and social platforms to highlight innovative brands like Nude Sugar, Beauty Bakerie and Sunday II Sunday. \n As we meet beauty enthusiasts wherever they are on their beauty journey, all in your world, we are investing to enhance guest experiences across all of our touch points. This quarter, we completed the 2-year phased rollout of the guest-facing element of our digital store, delivering a fresh, innovative front-end guest experience across both ulta.com and our app. Today, guests enjoy more seamless navigation and checkout experiences; can discover and browse new experiences, including buy more save more, Luxury at Ulta Beauty and our new foundation finder; and also benefit from enhanced search and recommendation capabilities. \n Later this year, we will finish the transition by converting our back-end infrastructure to support enhanced checkout, order and inventory management and pricing and promotion capabilities. The completion of the front end of our digital store is a major milestone in our journey to enhance our omnichannel experiences. And it is worth noting, our teams executed these changes while maintaining an active digital platform and delivering our e-commerce growth goals. \n While we experienced some minor disruption during the transition, I am proud of how our digital, IT and guest services teams have worked together while minimizing the guest impact. To support omnichannel guest experience is -- we continued to expand our buy anywhere fill anywhere capabilities. This quarter, we introduced same-day delivery in 6 new markets, bringing the number of stores with this convenient option to 540 stores across 18 markets. In addition, we're making it easier for store associates to assist guests in ordering products online when not available in store through our upgraded POS system. We have refreshed store POS systems in 1,100 stores and are on track to complete this transition before holiday. \n Turning to our partnership with Target. We opened 4 Ulta Beauty shops in the quarter, ending with 359 locations. This touch point introduces new guests to Ulta Beauty and enables reengagement of lapsed guests, and we are leveraging our CRM capabilities to ensure bounce back to Ulta Beauty. Our dedicated field team continues to support this important partnership with training and field engagement, and we are working together with our Target partners to deliver an outstanding guest experience. \n Beauty is a personal emotionally connected category. To increase consideration, loyalty and engagement, we are creating authentic connections with our guests with work that sits at the heart of the beauty community. In the first quarter, we executed impactful activations around key cultural moments, including Black History Month, prom and Earth Day, and delivered improved brand health metrics with significant increases in awareness across Gen Z, Black and Hispanic consumers. These trends confirm that the Ulta Beauty brand is continually becoming stronger, more relevant and more meaningful to guests. We ended the first quarter with 41 million active members, 9% higher than the first quarter last year, driven by new member acquisition, lapsed member reactivation and healthy retention rates. Spend per member also increased, driven primarily by trip frequency and growth of Elite members. Increased visibility, personalized reminders and incentives are driving growth of Diamond and Platinum members. \n At the end of the first quarter, the number of members in these higher tiers increased more than 30% compared to the same period last year, which is a strong indicator of high loyalty and elevated engagement in all that Ulta Beauty has to offer. Our multifaceted go-to-market plan to drive member growth and nurture the member lifecycle is delivering results. \n To drive new member acquisition and reactivate lapsed members, we refreshed store associate training and created new tools to help associates communicate the program's benefits. We enhanced the integration of our loyalty program across our refreshed digital experiences and introduced guest-facing signage in stores to drive awareness. And we executed targeted reactivation campaigns and tested new personalized digital communications to improve retention and contactability. \n Turning to UB Media, our retail media network, we are harnessing the power of our exclusive first-party data to transform the way our brands connect with beauty enthusiasts. With dedicated resources and new tools in place, this quarter, we engaged with more brands, managed more digital campaigns and expanded our product portfolio to include advertising opportunities on Ulta-owned digital properties. As UB Media continues to scale, we are confident it will add meaningful value to our company over time. \n Reflecting our priority to drive operational excellence and optimization, we are executing an ambitious multiyear road map of transformation initiatives, which will unlock new capabilities and operation -- operating efficiencies to fuel our future growth. We are upgrading our enterprise resource planning platform, expanding and optimizing our supply chain with new facilities, systems and processes; transitioning our digital store to modern technology and architecture while upgrading our order management system; expanding our data management systems to enable further analytical capabilities; and upgrading POS systems in all stores. \n We have made good progress against our road map and expect to deliver major milestones over the next several months. While change of this magnitude can be disruptive, our teams have consistently moved quickly and collaboratively to limit impact to guests and associates. Our success is enabled by our people and we are investing purposely in our teams to protect and cultivate our world-class culture and talent. \n In the first quarter, we launched a refreshed and modernized Ulta Beauty competency model across the enterprise to drive further consistency in talent management processes, establish clear measures of success and enhance culture with common language. We also launched a new service award recognition program to elevate the associate experience and reward associates in meaningful ways. And we hosted our annual field leadership meeting, bringing together our general managers, district managers, field support teams and brand partners for several days of recognition, leadership development and product education. I walked away from this event inspired by our talented associates and their passion for serving our guests and driving Ulta Beauty's growth. \n Finally, we continue to expand our environmental and social impact. This quarter, we partnered with Pact Collective to test the packaging recycling program in select locations with the goal of collecting the beauty industry's hard to recycle packaging so that it is diverted from landfills and put to its highest and best use. We also published our 2022 ESG report, which describes our approach to priorities in these areas and provide key updates on our ESG initiatives, their connectedness to our business and the positive impact of beauty as a force for good. \n In closing, fiscal 2023 is off to a good start. Our teams are executing well against an ambitious transformational agenda while navigating a dynamic environment. While we expect the operating environment will continue to evolve, we are confident the resilience of the category, combined with the power of our proven business model and world-class team, position Ulta Beauty for continued profitable growth. \n And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? \nScott Settersten: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave said earlier, today, we reported results for the first quarter that were generally in line with our expectations. We entered 2023 anticipating that the unprecedented growth in the beauty category would moderate and that the promotional environment would increase. These trends materialized in the first quarter and are reflected in our results.\n Starting with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter increased 12.3%, driven by 9.3% growth in comp sales and strong new store performance. In addition, other revenue increased $19 million, primarily due to growth in both credit card income and royalty income from our Target partnership. The comp sales growth for the quarter was driven by an 11% increase in transactions, primarily due to double-digit growth in store traffic, which more than offset a 1.5% decline in average ticket. The decline in average ticket reflected lower units per transaction, which more than offset higher average selling price. We estimate that product price increases, most of which were executed last year, contributed about 400 basis points to the overall comp increase. \n Looking at the cadence of sales through the quarter, momentum from post-holiday tailwinds continued into February, which also benefited from lapping COVID headwinds last year. Comp sales subsequently moderated to mid-single digits as we move through the quarter. During the quarter, we opened 5 new stores and closed one store. In addition, we relocated one store and remodeled 2 stores. \n For the quarter, gross margin was down 10 basis points compared to the same period last year at 40% of sales. Higher inventory shrink, lower merchandise margin, higher supply chain costs, and deleverage of salon expenses were partially offset by strong growth in other revenue and leverage of store fixed costs. As Dave shared earlier, we continue to experience a worsening trend of theft and organized retail crime. We are actively working to stabilize and mitigate these trends through investments in staffing, training and fixtures, and we are working collaboratively with law enforcement and third-party organizations to address these challenges. \n In addition to greater pressure from shrink, gross margin was impacted by lower merchandise margin, primarily due to increased promotional activity and category mix shifts, which more than offset benefit from price increases. We also incurred additional costs in the quarter related to our supply chain optimization efforts. \n SG&A increased 22.2% to $612 million, which was slightly better than our plan. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 180 basis points to 23.2% compared to 21.4% last year, primarily due to deleverage of store payroll and benefits, corporate overhead and marketing expense, partially offset by leverage of incentive compensation and store expenses due to higher sales. \n Store payroll and benefits expense increased, driven primarily by higher average wage rates and increased staffing levels compared to the same period last year. Corporate overhead expense deleveraged in the quarter, primarily due to investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, other IT capabilities and UB Media. Marketing expense increased, reflecting investment in strategies to drive member acquisition and retention, increase brand awareness, and expand omni member penetration. \n Operating margin was 16.8% of sales compared to 18.7% of sales in the first quarter of 2022. As expected, the decline in operating margin primarily reflects the impact of SG&A deleverage and lapping our extraordinary results in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Net interest income for the quarter increased to $7.3 million, driven by higher average interest rates and higher average cash balances during the quarter. The company's tax rate decreased to 22.8% compared to 24.2% in the first quarter last year. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to greater benefit from income tax accounting for stock-based compensation. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 9.2% to $6.88 compared to $6.30 last year. \n Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 11.5% to $1.8 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 41 net new stores, the increase reflects the impact of higher purchases to support demand, product cost increases and inventory to support new brand launches and expansion of existing brands. \n Capital expenditures were $109.8 million for the quarter compared to $71.1 million last year. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily related to investments in IT and supply chain, as well as new, remodeled and relocated stores. \n Depreciation decreased to $57.9 million compared to $62.8 million last year, primarily due to lower store depreciation and a shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense. We ended the quarter with $636.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. In the first quarter, we repurchased 541,000 shares at a cost of $285.8 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $816 million remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization. \n Turning now to our outlook. We have refined our expectations for the full year to reflect our first quarter actual performance and recent trends. We are maintaining our expectations for annual comp sales growth and diluted earnings per share, but are updating our outlook for operating margin. We continue to expect comp sales growth for the year will be between 4% and 5%, with growth moderating as we move through the year. As we shared on our last call, we expect comp growth for the first half to be in the upper single-digit range and then moderate to low single-digit growth in the second half. \n We now expect operating margin for the full year will be between 14.5% and 14.8% of sales, primarily reflecting an updated view of gross margin. We have increased our expectations for gross margin deleverage from our original outlook to include the impact of higher shrink and a more competitive and promotional environment. We continue to expect SG&A deleverage, driven primarily by $60 million to $70 million of incremental spend to support strategic investments as well as the impact of ongoing inflationary pressures. \n We have updated our assumptions for interest income to reflect the current interest rate environment and are now planning for about $17 million of interest income for the year. We have also incorporated our first quarter tax rate into our full year forecast and now expect the effective tax rate for the year will be approximately 23.8%. These assumptions result in guidance for diluted earnings per share in the range of $24.70 to $25.40 per share. \n In closing, fiscal 2023 is off to a solid start. We remain optimistic about the health of the beauty category, confident in our team and our growth strategies and steadfast in our belief that our proven business model uniquely positions us to deliver for our guests, associates and shareholders. \n And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Simeon Siegel with BMO Capital Markets. \nSimeon Siegel: Dave, I know you talked about the mass versus prestige dynamic within the Ulta offering. Do you have any view as to whether you're seeing any signs of external trade down, I guess, either customers trading into or out of Ulta from somewhere else? And then Dave or Scott, I was hoping you could speak a little bit more about the decline in ticket. Any opinions on the lower UPT despite the higher ASP and transactions? I don't know if you think this is because of a purse tightening or if it's a mix dynamic or compare. Just any further color there would be helpful. \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. Thanks, Simeon. What we are seeing, as we said in the call, is mass and our business is growing faster than preceding -- we saw that in some previous quarters right now. And so a little bit of detail about that as we look underneath. As we look across income levels, there's actually good -- there's growth across all income levels, across all income cohorts, roughly equivalent across all cohorts, although the growth rate did moderate from Q4 pretty consistently. .\n As we said, traffic remains strong. Double-digit traffic average spend per member increased. Average ticket did decline as we have fewer units per transaction. When we look at the mass category, it's -- we have some exceptional newness going on and some really high-performing brands in our mass category, brands like e.l.f., NYX, The Ordinary, La Roche-Posay. So we know that is certainly contributing to that. And it's -- so the fact that mass is growing higher than prestige, it's difficult for us to exactly parse apart the core driver of that. But we know for sure, there's a high level of engagement in those brands because they are culturally relevant and driving great engagement. \n At the same time, we have strong growth and some strong newness on our prestige side of the business as well. Prestige skincare comping double digit as an example of that. So we're watching closely. What we feel is the total category remains strong. Engagement is high. As we've talked in previous quarters, this is an emotionally connected category that's important, and coming out of the pandemic, even more important in overall self-care and wellness and we expect that to continue. But the high level of growth that we've seen in these last 2 years, as we've talked about in several quarters, will moderate. We think ultimately getting back to more the high end of historical average, but we know engagement's high, and we continue to be encouraged by overall consumer engagement. \nScott Settersten: Yes. So overall, I would just remind you, Simeon, that we did state, so total units are up across the enterprise, right, for the period year-over-year, and total spend per member is up year-over-year as well. So again, great evidence of a healthy, strong business model at play. Very strong traffic trends in both channels, but especially in our brick-and-mortar channel that we're pleased to see. \n When we look at the specific units per transaction, again, it was down. It's been decelerating a bit over the course of the last 3 or 4 quarters, I guess, I would say. So again, not totally surprising to us to see that. And again, we would take away from that what most people, just looking at the trends and looking at how consumers, are just being a little bit more selective now than maybe they were at this time last year. But we're trying not to read too much into that at this point in time. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: So I wanted to go back to your commentary on the promotional environment. So clearly, it's gotten more competitive out there. I was just hoping to get more color in terms of what you guys are seeing. And if you look at some of the promotions out there, how is the gap compared to maybe what we've seen maybe pre-pandemic 2019 earlier? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. Well, as I mentioned on the call, we anticipated and planned for it to be more promotional this year coming out of all the trends that we've talked about over the couple of years. And what we saw as the quarter progressed that actually promotional activity did increase and was even a little bit more than we had anticipated through that quarter. So when we look at broader competitive activity, we know this is a strong category. It's an important category for all of our competitors. And our long-term approach to this has been to not to lead the promotional intensity, but to make sure that we are competitive and continue to be the leader and gain share in the environment. And so that's what's driving some of the competitive activity and the increase in promotional. \n As versus 2019, we're still below 2019, and we've planned and anticipate that, that will be the case through this year. As you know well, Rupesh, the 2019 and leading up to that was a highly promotional period. We're not anticipating getting back to those levels. But as we've talked about really throughout the last several quarters, we anticipated it getting more promotional, and we're certainly seeing that in the environment. As a reminder, we worked hard for the last several years and certainly through the last 2 years to expand our CRM capabilities to grow our loyalty program. 9% growth in our loyalty program, 41 million members now, gives us some new tools, some new capabilities to be more strategic, more pinpointed in our promotional activities targeted with those efforts, and we've employed those and we'll continue to be strategic and thoughtful as we look ahead in the environment as the year unfolds. \nOperator: Our next question is from Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. \nAnders Myhre: This is Anders Myhre, on for Steve Forbes. I wanted to start with services. So maybe a two-part question. One, outside of the details in the prepared remarks, can you comment further on the trends you were seeing broadly within services and possibly measured by member utilization rate? And two, can you provide an update on the percentage of consumers that make an in-store purchase after receiving a service? I believe in the past, there is approximately 50%. So I wanted to see if there's any moderation there. \nKecia Steelman: Yes. Well, thank you for the question. Yes. So again, our salon service business was really strong again in the quarter. We -- what we like that we've seen is we -- in the prepared remarks, we talked about these backbar events. So not that we specifically ever break out purchase by service guests, but what I can share with you is that our backbar events, what we've seen is 90% of guests that are purchasing through those activations are new to those brands. So the guest experience and services is really resonating when we get them in the chair. \n [ Hot ] and color is the main driver of our overall services business. And then the trends that we're seeing really are around health care -- hair care around loss of hair treatments, and that also helps with our average ticket. So the business is really strong. Our stylists are really critical to our overall business. We hired over 950 stylists in this last quarter. So the business is strong. We've got capacity, and it's a unique proposition that we have here at Ulta Beauty. \nOperator: Our next question is from Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank. \nKrisztina Katai: I had a question on the Ultamate Rewards program, right, which continues to set records, both with membership and spend per member, has your share of wallet increased with your members, given some of the successful high-profile brand launches and also the luxury assortment that you're creating? And I also wanted to ask what type of return do you see on some of the more personalized or tailored promos that you offer whenever needed as you leverage the vast amount of data that you have? \nDavid Kimbell: Great. Well, yes, our loyalty program, Ultamate Rewards, is one of our greatest assets, and I'm really excited that the investments that we've made, the work that the team does, the commitment that our store teams have driving that experience continue to pay off. We're really proud of 9% growth in members in Q1, spend per member growth. Our strategies, our plans are  working. \n We do -- separately, we do believe we continue to improve share of wallet of our best guests. I talked about Platinum and Diamond members being -- showing strong growth. We believe we continue to add new experiences, add new brands, engage them in more touch points. Everything that we do really is designed to increase share of wallet. If we have a store-only guest, to get them to shop, to use our salon, to shop online, to download our app, to get our credit card, to shop at Target. All these experiences collectively add to share of wallet. And we have continued evidence that when we do that, it works to increase share of wallet. \n And one example, a store-only guest that starts shopping us in an omnichannel online way. Their spend with us increases over 2.5x. So we know we're improving share of wallet across our engaged guests. And as we add new members, which we continue to do as we grow, we're on the journey of getting them more engaged with all of our touch points. So we are committed to that. We're finding a lot of success. \n As far as some of the personalization, that's another aspect of our experience that we've been working hard on for several years, and it is working and paying off. The return of our programs around things like replenishment or engaging in new categories are working. We see strong return. And in fact, the return is strong enough that we're going to continue to invest more in data capabilities, bringing in new tools, leveraging innovation across all ways of experimenting and engaging with our guests. So we're seeing good returns, and we see there's a lot more opportunity for us ahead. In the world of personalization, you will buy our data. \nOperator: Our next question is from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. \nIrwin Boruchow: Scott, I was just wondering if you could give more color on the shrink theft component of what's impacting you guys in the P&L. And I'm just asking, it does sound like it's a fairly meaningful dynamic that's taking place. And if there's any way you can kind of quantify that so we kind of know what the impact was in Q1 or what you're now pricing in for the remainder of the year? Anything there would just be a little bit more helpful so we understand just how impactful it is to your gross margin. \nScott Settersten: Yes. So it was -- when I think about the financial results and totality, and really shrink was the thing that surprised us in the quarter, and that's really the driver when we think about the operating margin adjustment for the year. So we knew sales were going to moderate a little bit after 2 spectacularly strong years. We knew the promotional environment was going to ramp up some. And maybe it's slightly richer than we were expecting, but that's not the driver. \n The driver is shrink, by far. And so that's what put a pretty meaningful drag on our first quarter, and we're expecting those trends to continue the rest of the year. Again, coming into 2023, we thought the shrink trends were going to moderate a little bit because of some of the investments we were putting behind mitigation tactics. But they haven't resonated yet. We're still hopeful. We're still -- our teams are doing a great job. A lot of effort is going into this. But from a financial standpoint, we're not banking on any improvement the rest of the way. So kind of remain a challenge for the rest of the year. \nDavid Kimbell: Ike, I'm glad you asked. I just -- I'd add the -- as I mentioned in the script, this is a really important and critical topic. There's certainly the financial impact that Scott described. But this is impacting our associates. It's impacting our guests. And unfortunately, despite our efforts, and investments, it's getting worse, not better, and we need to -- we're working hard. \n And I mentioned this, but what it's going to take is our efforts, and I'm going to ask Kecia to describe in a bit more detail some of the steps we're taking. But we're working hard within what we directly control, but we need support from other -- partnership with other retailers, support from local leaders, from law enforcement, from DAs, from national governmental leaders. This is a macro problem that needs a macro answer, and I'm personally heavily involved in it to help try to find solutions, both for our business and hopefully contribute to some answers across retail. But it's an important topic and one that I'm focused on. But we are doing a lot. Kecia, do you want to highlight a few of those things? \nKecia Steelman: Sure. Yes. We'll be in 70% of the chain by the end of this year, with locked fragrance cabinets as fragrance is one of the base target areas that we see them going after. And we're also increasing labor in those specific locations. We're training and educating our associates how best to handle these types of situations. It's upsetting. If you're shopping in a store, and you see this activity happening, it's pretty shocking. \n I'm sure you've seen some of the reports that have come out there, the camera systems catching these groups coming in. So we've invested in security guards, armed security guards in some locations, partnering with our landlords at what can we do to help police the parking lots and throw them from even coming in. So it's a full court press out there, and we're keeping the communication lines open with our associates when this happens. Like I said, very disturbing and deciding to course-correct as an entire retail group. \nScott Settersten: Just one final note, Ike, on that one. So for quantification purposes, as a reference point in the first quarter, the shrink deleveraged above expectations, totally offset all fixed store cost. \nOperator: Our next question is from Korinne Wolfmeyer with Piper Sandler. \nKorinne Wolfmeyer: I'd just like to touch on -- a little bit on your customer retention efforts. I know you've talked a bit on the loyalty program and how that's been doing. But as we think about maybe consumers doing a little bit more pressure in their wallet and maybe seeking out more, say, mass retailers or lower-cost items. How are you ensuring customers stick with Ulta and keeping that retention rate strong? \nDavid Kimbell: Well, Korinne, this is, as you would imagine, a huge focus for our entire team. And everybody in the company really participates in loyalty and retention. And that fundamentally starts with delivering a great experience. We have 50,000 associates in our stores that are committed to delighting our guests every time they walk in, and that's key to retention that every guest experience is a positive uplifting fun, engaging experience. And I'm proud that, that is so consistently the experience that our guests receive and what they love about. \n Our retention remains strong, and we -- and that was an important driver of our 9% growth in loyalty in Q1. And we've got a number of activities from, as I said, the in-store experience with all of our digital touch points, our experience and connection that we have with our guests through -- through Target, our Ulta Beauty at Target, and all of our personalization and communication efforts really engage and excite and delight our guests. So we are pleased with retention and feel that we have a very strong, probably best-in-class retention rate that we do. \n And as things -- as the environment shifts, and I talked about some of that in the script and an earlier question about shifts between mass and prestige. And as that changes, again, that is one of the unique aspects of Ulta Beauty. Nobody does what Ulta Beauty does. We're the only ones that offer from entry-level price, the masstige, to prestige, to luxury, all price points, all categories. So as long as we keep delighting and exciting our guests, if they choose to adjust their spending or maybe decide to buy different price points, they can do that within Ulta across all aspects, and that's been a key aspect -- a key part of our business and one that we'll continue to lean on and leverage going forward. \nOperator: Our next question is from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. \nOlivia Tong Cheang: I want to see if you could talk a little bit about the incremental promotions coming from, whether it's certain categories, certain channels that are pushing it harder as they try to expand or whether it's fairly broad-based. And then you said you -- I know you said you won't leave the promos, but of course, you have to be competitive. Can you talk about how your promo levels compare to your peers? And is there more you can do to leverage your loyalty members and the data that you have that you could potentially promote less [ versus previous ] years and still stay at the same level of competitiveness? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. First, I'd say the incremental promotion we see it happening. We see really an intense competitive environment across all parts of the beauty category. And again, because of our model, mass to prestige, to luxury, we are directly competing with everybody that sells beauty. And so we watch and track and we're seeing promotional activity across mass, across prestige, across luxury. And so that's all part of it. And so I wouldn't say it's any one part of the category. \n As far as exactly, we don't have perfect insight. So we don't know exactly what each of our competitors are doing and understand all of their kind of internal measurements. But we watch very closely, track year-to-year, observe what's happening and then we do get some industry data that gives us a macro picture. So for us, it is just about making sure that we're delivering a great experience to our guests and delivering the right value at the right time. \n And you touched on it, but we have invested heavily in our capabilities to personalize and be more targeted. And that's what's allowed us to reduce our promotion from the levels that we saw in 2018 and 2019. And even as we plan for a more elevated level this year, as I mentioned earlier, we believe it will be below those levels, in part because of the tools that we have, the fact that now we have 41 million people. We have new personalization capabilities. We've got better CRM experience that allows us to be more pinpointed. That doesn't mean we won't do some broad scale offers here and there as they make sense for us. But under the covers, we're doing a whole lot more value add at a more personalized level, and that's paying off in an important way. \nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: One of the narratives from the skeptics that's going to come out of this report is that their hypothesis is coming true, trends are going to slow, promotional activity is going to increase and that's going to put pressure on Ulta Beauty's margins, and it's probably going to now feature some element of shrink as well. So if you look at where your margins are on pace to be this year, somewhere in the mid-14% range, you add the increase in shrink and the dilution that that's going to have on your margins. And if promotional activity were to go back to 2019 levels, what would that mean for your margins in that scenario? \nDavid Kimbell: Let me start, and I'm going to ask Scott to give a bit more color, but -- or definitely more color on specifically around your question. What I'd say is we're really confident in our business. We guided for this year that we'd be delivering 4% to 5% comp growth, and we're committed to doing that. That's what we set out to do, and we are on track to do that. .\n We've made an adjustment to our operating margins. Scott will give more detail on that, but that's a reflection of some very specific things. But we remain confident in our long-term operating margin and our profitability over time. And we will go address some of the shrink issues. We do not believe promo is going to get back to historic highs, and in part because of what I just talked about, the impact -- our ability, our capabilities around personalization and others. So I understand that some of those questions might be out there. But I'll tell you, we are committed to delivering what we set out to do. \n We are off to a good start to doing that in Q1: 9.3% comp, strong operating margin, strong EPS growth. And we believe our model is uniquely positioned to navigate whatever comes our way, and we've got the right team and the right strategies in place. So that's kind of how I feel about it at a macro level. But Scott, any color specifically about Michael's question? \nScott Settersten: No, I would just add that, again, shrink and slightly richer promotional mix, temporary headwinds, we are very ready and able to be able to react to those kinds of things. So again, to Dave's point, with the toolbox that we have and the levers that we have to optimize this business, we're still very confident the 14% to 15% is the right range to be in. Things like UB Media, that's just kind of really getting off the ground, is a long-term margin accretive part of our business model. Project SOAR, digital store of the future, all these other large strategic initiatives we have underway right now are going to provide meaningful benefits for our stakeholders over a long period of time. So very confident in our [indiscernible]. \nOperator: Our next question is from Susan Anderson with Canaccord. \nSusan Anderson: I was wondering if you could talk about the health and wellness business and how that's been trending relative to the rest of the store? Are you seeing a pretty good response from the consumer in terms of adding that to their basket? And then also, where do you see that going longer term? \nDavid Kimbell: Yes, I'm glad you asked as wellness is it's an important growth opportunity. I'd start -- before I talk specifically about the wellness shop and the assortment we have there, I'd say this overall idea of wellness and self-care and the connection it has to beauty, I talked about this for a little while. So you may have heard this before, but it is an important trend coming out over the last couple of years that we think will drive continued growth and engagement. \n The fact that more and more consumers understand the importance of beauty as part of their overall wellness routine is a very strong positive. It's one that's driving so much innovation, both in products specifically designed for wellness but also across makeup and fragrance and just bringing in more the idea of wellness into all forms of innovation. We did launch our wellness shop in May of 2021. We're currently in about 800 doors. We'll be adding more doors this year to continue to expand that presence. \n We have a strong presence online. We have 140 brands, 700 SKUs across category focus, and it's a great experience. It's working really well. A number of really engaging brands like Love Wellness, Truly, Kitsch, megababe, GOLDE that we just added, Lemme by Kourtney Kardashian, there's a strong experience, high level of engagement across all 6 of our segments and pillars. And we're really pleased with its impact in connection. But we're also just getting started in that assortment. And so we see good growth in that area over time, and we're excited about the potential of that business for the long term. \nOperator: Our final question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: Everyone, I think you had the wrong Simeon to start the call, but it's okay. My question is two parts. The first part is actually related to his earlier question, thinking about the AUR and some of the innovation that's driven some of the inflation, whether or not the customer is reaching some resistant point and the number of items they put in the basket. And second, how to think about shrink and just what level of accrual given we're seeing it still ramping across other retailers, how much you've accrued for and how much could work to get. \nScott Settersten: Maybe I'll start with shrink. So I addressed here just a few minutes earlier, just directional in the first quarter, shrink basically offset fixed store cost leverage entirely. So again, remember, that's been trending upward over the last couple of years with a huge peer step on the top line, Simeon. And so we would expect that trend to continue through the rest of the year. We're not -- we were expecting some moderation in 2023, but at this stage, it doesn't seem like we're going to be able to deliver that. So not optimistic about how that plays out in gross margin the rest of the way. \nDavid Kimbell: Yes. And Simeon, it's good to book end our Q&A by Simeon, so we're glad to do that. And I'd just say, yes, on the point, I mean, I think we covered some of the thoughts there about how we're seeing both spend per member, AUR, the units. I mean there's a lot of positive indicators on our business, and we're still working hard to get a read on how our consumer is navigating. We know there's pressures out there, but we also see a high level of engagement in beauty. \n And so our focus now is to continue to drive great engagement across all aspects, newness, innovation, our core business, to get them engaged in all of our touch points and make sure that we're delivering a great Ulta Beauty guest experience because we know when we do that, they respond. So we're tracking all that carefully. We'll continue to report out in future earnings calls and make sure that we are leading the category appropriately.\n So with that, let me just say I'd like to close by, again, thanking all of our Ulta Beauty associates across our stores, distribution centers and our corporate office offices for delivering another strong quarter for our stakeholders. We know the environment will continue to evolve. But as I've said, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategies, and we are very confident in our team as we look forward to build -- continue to build the foundation that we set here in the first quarter. So we look forward to speaking to you all again when we report results for the second quarter on August 24. Thanks. I hope everybody has a nice Memorial Day weekend, and we'll talk to you all again soon. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Kimbell",
            "content": "Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. Fiscal 2023 is off to a good start. For the first quarter, we delivered net sales, operating margin and diluted EPS that were consistent with our internal expectations.\n Net sales increased 12.3% to $2.6 billion, and comparable sales increased 9.3%. Operating margin was 16.8% of sales and diluted EPS increased 9.2% to $6.88 per share. Our store traffic remained healthy and member growth continued to be strong. We delivered growth across key categories, and we strengthened engagement with the Ulta Beauty brand. I want to thank our Ulta Beauty associates for their focus on creating great guest experiences while continuing to adapt to a dynamic environment and executing our transformational agenda. \n The operating environment continues to evolve and consumers are exploring how best to navigate the economic uncertainty. Inflation concerns remain high and consumers are spending more selectively while also showing a continued willingness to splurge and treat themselves. Engagement with beauty remains strong, reflecting the prioritization of self-care. Category growth is healthy but moderating as we lap 2 years of unprecedented growth. And as category growth normalizes, promotional activity is increasing. While we do not intend to lead promotional intensity, we will respond as appropriate to protect and expand our share using a variety of tools we have developed and invested in over the last several years. \n Using the consumer lens of how guests experience Ulta Beauty through our multiple touch points to include our physical stores, our e-commerce business and Ulta Beauty at Target, the Ulta Beauty experience is resonating with our guests and gaining share. As we have seen in previous quarters, sales in our mass category grew faster than prestige categories. It is difficult to know with certainty if the robust growth of mass products is due to strong engagement with innovative mass brands such as e.l.f. and La Roche-Posay or due to increased consumer price sensitivity. Importantly, Ulta Beauty is the only beauty retailer that offers a wide variety of price points, from entry level mass to luxury and everything in between. And as such, we are uniquely positioned to capture any consumer shifts within price points in the beauty category. \n Skincare was our best performing category again this quarter with both prestige and mass delivering double-digit comp growth, driven primarily by newness, engaging social media content and strong performance through 21 Days of Beauty and Spring Hall. Newness from innovative brands like The Ordinary, Drunk Elephant and Hero Cosmetics, as well as new brands, including Bubble, Beautycounter and BYOMA, contributed to growth during the quarter. In addition, social media platforms continue driving content category engagement, resulting in robust growth for dermatologist-recommended brands like La Roche-Posay and trend forward brands like COSRX. \n The fragrance and bath categories delivered low double-digit percent growth this quarter, lapping 2 consecutive years of strong double-digit growth. Newness from Ariana Grande, Carolina Herrera and Valentino contributed meaningfully, and our monthly Fragrance Crush program fueled strong engagement with newer brand Billie Eilish as well as established brands Lancome and Dior. In addition, Valentine's stay gift-giving was healthy across both men's and women's fragrances. \n Makeup delivered high single-digit growth for the quarter, driven by newness and guest engagement with 21 Days of Beauty and Spring Hall. Soft bronzing, glossy lips and expressive eyes and nails are trends driving growth for the category. New brands like Dior, about-face and NATASHA DENONA drove sales during the quarter, while new products from a wide range of brands including e.l.f., Fenty and NYX also contributed to growth. In addition, the expansion of MAC into more stores, combined with compelling newness, continued to drive sales. \n Finally, the hair category was flat for the quarter, with growth in hair care products and color offset by lower demand for tools as we lapped strong newness last year. Products focused on hair health, including bonding, scalp treatments and hydration, as well as those focused on styling, are resonating strongly. Newer brands like Donna's Recipe, Odele and Divi as well as new products from masstige brands Eva Nyc, Batiste and Andrew Fitzsimons were notable drivers for the category. Trend-relevant products from OUIA, Redken and Kenra resonated with guests, while engaging social media content drove healthy growth for Mielle and IGK. \n Our services business delivered double-digit comp growth again this quarter, driven by growth in cut and style, blowout and makeup services. As we have expanded our service offerings and enhanced our stylist talent, more members are using services. And our Salon Backbar Takeovers, which give our stylists a unique opportunity to introduce new brands and products to guests, drove sales growth and new member acquisition for participating brands. \n Now similar to what other retailers have shared, we continue to see pressure from inventory shrink this quarter and we have updated our full year guidance to reflect the persistence of this trend. While shrink is the result of various factors, theft, specifically organized retail crime, or ORC, is an increasingly concerning challenge, especially as we've seen a rise in violence and aggression during these incidents. \n Our first priority is the safety and well-being of our associates and our guests. We are committed to ensuring a safe work environment and are investing in fixtures, training, support structures and increased staffing and security to aggressively address this concerning trend. ORC impacts all of our stakeholders, guests, associates, brand partners, investors and communities, and it will not be solved by retailers alone. Given the complexity, it will take collaboration across retail, manufacturing, law enforcement and legislative levels to solve these problems. Now working together, I am optimistic we can create meaningful impact and bring forward creative, sustainable solutions to restore safe shopping experiences for everyone. \n As we have previously discussed, beauty is not immune to macroeconomic challenges, but has historically been more resilient compared to other discretionary categories due to its deep emotional connection with consumers. We believe this connection is even greater today given the importance of beauty as a form of self-care and wellness. As we navigate this dynamic operating environment, our strategic framework guides our priorities and positions us to build on our market leadership and drive long-term profitable growth. \n Let me give you an update on the progress we've made against this framework in the first quarter. Starting with our efforts to drive growth with an expanded definition of All Things Beauty, our strategy is to delight beauty enthusiasts with our thoughtfully curated assortment focused on inclusivity and leading trends. During the first quarter, we further enhanced our assortment with the launch of several exciting brands, including: NATASHA DENONA, a luxury artistry brand known for high-quality makeup pallets across eye, face and cheek; Beautycounter, a clean beauty pioneer, offering high-performing skincare and makeup with unmatched ingredient safety standards; and Odele, a haircare brand focused on clean, accessible products for the whole family. To drive engagement and capture additional market share this quarter, we launched Luxury at Ulta Beauty in 200 stores and on ulta.com. Driven by social platforms and strong Gen Z interest, luxury brands are fueling beauty category growth. \n Our vision for Luxury at Ulta Beauty is to provide guests with a uniquely modern luxury beauty experience, strategically curated to reflect what guests are engaging most in, including iconic luxury with brands like Dior and Lancome Absolue; clean luxury with brands like Hourglass CHANEL N\u00b01; and luxe artistry brands like NATASHA DENONA. In addition to strengthening our core assortment, we continue to expand, evolve and amplify our cross-category platforms. \n Let me share some first quarter highlights. We ended the quarter with 306 brands certified and at least one conscious beauty pillar, including newly certified brands Nutritious Estee Lauder, Winky Lux and Mielle. In celebration of Earth Day, to promote sustainability and to drive discovery, we launched a collectible Ulta Beauty reusable tote and a Conscious Beauty essential sample kit with Hero products from 14 certified brands, including boscia, Beekman 1802 and ACURE. We continue to support black-owned and founded brands with the launch of new brands, hanahana beauty and GOLDE. We created a black-owned and founded brands discovery kit featuring 11 brands, and 100% of the purchase price of this kit was donated to Big Brothers Big Sisters of America. \n In recognition of Black History Month, we celebrated and supported the Black community through [ rich ] Ode to Black Beauty storytelling and used our digital and social platforms to highlight innovative brands like Nude Sugar, Beauty Bakerie and Sunday II Sunday. \n As we meet beauty enthusiasts wherever they are on their beauty journey, all in your world, we are investing to enhance guest experiences across all of our touch points. This quarter, we completed the 2-year phased rollout of the guest-facing element of our digital store, delivering a fresh, innovative front-end guest experience across both ulta.com and our app. Today, guests enjoy more seamless navigation and checkout experiences; can discover and browse new experiences, including buy more save more, Luxury at Ulta Beauty and our new foundation finder; and also benefit from enhanced search and recommendation capabilities. \n Later this year, we will finish the transition by converting our back-end infrastructure to support enhanced checkout, order and inventory management and pricing and promotion capabilities. The completion of the front end of our digital store is a major milestone in our journey to enhance our omnichannel experiences. And it is worth noting, our teams executed these changes while maintaining an active digital platform and delivering our e-commerce growth goals. \n While we experienced some minor disruption during the transition, I am proud of how our digital, IT and guest services teams have worked together while minimizing the guest impact. To support omnichannel guest experience is -- we continued to expand our buy anywhere fill anywhere capabilities. This quarter, we introduced same-day delivery in 6 new markets, bringing the number of stores with this convenient option to 540 stores across 18 markets. In addition, we're making it easier for store associates to assist guests in ordering products online when not available in store through our upgraded POS system. We have refreshed store POS systems in 1,100 stores and are on track to complete this transition before holiday. \n Turning to our partnership with Target. We opened 4 Ulta Beauty shops in the quarter, ending with 359 locations. This touch point introduces new guests to Ulta Beauty and enables reengagement of lapsed guests, and we are leveraging our CRM capabilities to ensure bounce back to Ulta Beauty. Our dedicated field team continues to support this important partnership with training and field engagement, and we are working together with our Target partners to deliver an outstanding guest experience. \n Beauty is a personal emotionally connected category. To increase consideration, loyalty and engagement, we are creating authentic connections with our guests with work that sits at the heart of the beauty community. In the first quarter, we executed impactful activations around key cultural moments, including Black History Month, prom and Earth Day, and delivered improved brand health metrics with significant increases in awareness across Gen Z, Black and Hispanic consumers. These trends confirm that the Ulta Beauty brand is continually becoming stronger, more relevant and more meaningful to guests. We ended the first quarter with 41 million active members, 9% higher than the first quarter last year, driven by new member acquisition, lapsed member reactivation and healthy retention rates. Spend per member also increased, driven primarily by trip frequency and growth of Elite members. Increased visibility, personalized reminders and incentives are driving growth of Diamond and Platinum members. \n At the end of the first quarter, the number of members in these higher tiers increased more than 30% compared to the same period last year, which is a strong indicator of high loyalty and elevated engagement in all that Ulta Beauty has to offer. Our multifaceted go-to-market plan to drive member growth and nurture the member lifecycle is delivering results. \n To drive new member acquisition and reactivate lapsed members, we refreshed store associate training and created new tools to help associates communicate the program's benefits. We enhanced the integration of our loyalty program across our refreshed digital experiences and introduced guest-facing signage in stores to drive awareness. And we executed targeted reactivation campaigns and tested new personalized digital communications to improve retention and contactability. \n Turning to UB Media, our retail media network, we are harnessing the power of our exclusive first-party data to transform the way our brands connect with beauty enthusiasts. With dedicated resources and new tools in place, this quarter, we engaged with more brands, managed more digital campaigns and expanded our product portfolio to include advertising opportunities on Ulta-owned digital properties. As UB Media continues to scale, we are confident it will add meaningful value to our company over time. \n Reflecting our priority to drive operational excellence and optimization, we are executing an ambitious multiyear road map of transformation initiatives, which will unlock new capabilities and operation -- operating efficiencies to fuel our future growth. We are upgrading our enterprise resource planning platform, expanding and optimizing our supply chain with new facilities, systems and processes; transitioning our digital store to modern technology and architecture while upgrading our order management system; expanding our data management systems to enable further analytical capabilities; and upgrading POS systems in all stores. \n We have made good progress against our road map and expect to deliver major milestones over the next several months. While change of this magnitude can be disruptive, our teams have consistently moved quickly and collaboratively to limit impact to guests and associates. Our success is enabled by our people and we are investing purposely in our teams to protect and cultivate our world-class culture and talent. \n In the first quarter, we launched a refreshed and modernized Ulta Beauty competency model across the enterprise to drive further consistency in talent management processes, establish clear measures of success and enhance culture with common language. We also launched a new service award recognition program to elevate the associate experience and reward associates in meaningful ways. And we hosted our annual field leadership meeting, bringing together our general managers, district managers, field support teams and brand partners for several days of recognition, leadership development and product education. I walked away from this event inspired by our talented associates and their passion for serving our guests and driving Ulta Beauty's growth. \n Finally, we continue to expand our environmental and social impact. This quarter, we partnered with Pact Collective to test the packaging recycling program in select locations with the goal of collecting the beauty industry's hard to recycle packaging so that it is diverted from landfills and put to its highest and best use. We also published our 2022 ESG report, which describes our approach to priorities in these areas and provide key updates on our ESG initiatives, their connectedness to our business and the positive impact of beauty as a force for good. \n In closing, fiscal 2023 is off to a good start. Our teams are executing well against an ambitious transformational agenda while navigating a dynamic environment. While we expect the operating environment will continue to evolve, we are confident the resilience of the category, combined with the power of our proven business model and world-class team, position Ulta Beauty for continued profitable growth. \n And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? Yes. Thanks, Simeon. What we are seeing, as we said in the call, is mass and our business is growing faster than preceding -- we saw that in some previous quarters right now. And so a little bit of detail about that as we look underneath. As we look across income levels, there's actually good -- there's growth across all income levels, across all income cohorts, roughly equivalent across all cohorts, although the growth rate did moderate from Q4 pretty consistently. .\n As we said, traffic remains strong. Double-digit traffic average spend per member increased. Average ticket did decline as we have fewer units per transaction. When we look at the mass category, it's -- we have some exceptional newness going on and some really high-performing brands in our mass category, brands like e.l.f., NYX, The Ordinary, La Roche-Posay. So we know that is certainly contributing to that. And it's -- so the fact that mass is growing higher than prestige, it's difficult for us to exactly parse apart the core driver of that. But we know for sure, there's a high level of engagement in those brands because they are culturally relevant and driving great engagement. \n At the same time, we have strong growth and some strong newness on our prestige side of the business as well. Prestige skincare comping double digit as an example of that. So we're watching closely. What we feel is the total category remains strong. Engagement is high. As we've talked in previous quarters, this is an emotionally connected category that's important, and coming out of the pandemic, even more important in overall self-care and wellness and we expect that to continue. But the high level of growth that we've seen in these last 2 years, as we've talked about in several quarters, will moderate. We think ultimately getting back to more the high end of historical average, but we know engagement's high, and we continue to be encouraged by overall consumer engagement. Yes. Well, as I mentioned on the call, we anticipated and planned for it to be more promotional this year coming out of all the trends that we've talked about over the couple of years. And what we saw as the quarter progressed that actually promotional activity did increase and was even a little bit more than we had anticipated through that quarter. So when we look at broader competitive activity, we know this is a strong category. It's an important category for all of our competitors. And our long-term approach to this has been to not to lead the promotional intensity, but to make sure that we are competitive and continue to be the leader and gain share in the environment. And so that's what's driving some of the competitive activity and the increase in promotional. \n As versus 2019, we're still below 2019, and we've planned and anticipate that, that will be the case through this year. As you know well, Rupesh, the 2019 and leading up to that was a highly promotional period. We're not anticipating getting back to those levels. But as we've talked about really throughout the last several quarters, we anticipated it getting more promotional, and we're certainly seeing that in the environment. As a reminder, we worked hard for the last several years and certainly through the last 2 years to expand our CRM capabilities to grow our loyalty program. 9% growth in our loyalty program, 41 million members now, gives us some new tools, some new capabilities to be more strategic, more pinpointed in our promotional activities targeted with those efforts, and we've employed those and we'll continue to be strategic and thoughtful as we look ahead in the environment as the year unfolds. Great. Well, yes, our loyalty program, Ultamate Rewards, is one of our greatest assets, and I'm really excited that the investments that we've made, the work that the team does, the commitment that our store teams have driving that experience continue to pay off. We're really proud of 9% growth in members in Q1, spend per member growth. Our strategies, our plans are  working. \n We do -- separately, we do believe we continue to improve share of wallet of our best guests. I talked about Platinum and Diamond members being -- showing strong growth. We believe we continue to add new experiences, add new brands, engage them in more touch points. Everything that we do really is designed to increase share of wallet. If we have a store-only guest, to get them to shop, to use our salon, to shop online, to download our app, to get our credit card, to shop at Target. All these experiences collectively add to share of wallet. And we have continued evidence that when we do that, it works to increase share of wallet. \n And one example, a store-only guest that starts shopping us in an omnichannel online way. Their spend with us increases over 2.5x. So we know we're improving share of wallet across our engaged guests. And as we add new members, which we continue to do as we grow, we're on the journey of getting them more engaged with all of our touch points. So we are committed to that. We're finding a lot of success. \n As far as some of the personalization, that's another aspect of our experience that we've been working hard on for several years, and it is working and paying off. The return of our programs around things like replenishment or engaging in new categories are working. We see strong return. And in fact, the return is strong enough that we're going to continue to invest more in data capabilities, bringing in new tools, leveraging innovation across all ways of experimenting and engaging with our guests. So we're seeing good returns, and we see there's a lot more opportunity for us ahead. In the world of personalization, you will buy our data. Ike, I'm glad you asked. I just -- I'd add the -- as I mentioned in the script, this is a really important and critical topic. There's certainly the financial impact that Scott described. But this is impacting our associates. It's impacting our guests. And unfortunately, despite our efforts, and investments, it's getting worse, not better, and we need to -- we're working hard. \n And I mentioned this, but what it's going to take is our efforts, and I'm going to ask Kecia to describe in a bit more detail some of the steps we're taking. But we're working hard within what we directly control, but we need support from other -- partnership with other retailers, support from local leaders, from law enforcement, from DAs, from national governmental leaders. This is a macro problem that needs a macro answer, and I'm personally heavily involved in it to help try to find solutions, both for our business and hopefully contribute to some answers across retail. But it's an important topic and one that I'm focused on. But we are doing a lot. Kecia, do you want to highlight a few of those things? Well, Korinne, this is, as you would imagine, a huge focus for our entire team. And everybody in the company really participates in loyalty and retention. And that fundamentally starts with delivering a great experience. We have 50,000 associates in our stores that are committed to delighting our guests every time they walk in, and that's key to retention that every guest experience is a positive uplifting fun, engaging experience. And I'm proud that, that is so consistently the experience that our guests receive and what they love about. \n Our retention remains strong, and we -- and that was an important driver of our 9% growth in loyalty in Q1. And we've got a number of activities from, as I said, the in-store experience with all of our digital touch points, our experience and connection that we have with our guests through -- through Target, our Ulta Beauty at Target, and all of our personalization and communication efforts really engage and excite and delight our guests. So we are pleased with retention and feel that we have a very strong, probably best-in-class retention rate that we do. \n And as things -- as the environment shifts, and I talked about some of that in the script and an earlier question about shifts between mass and prestige. And as that changes, again, that is one of the unique aspects of Ulta Beauty. Nobody does what Ulta Beauty does. We're the only ones that offer from entry-level price, the masstige, to prestige, to luxury, all price points, all categories. So as long as we keep delighting and exciting our guests, if they choose to adjust their spending or maybe decide to buy different price points, they can do that within Ulta across all aspects, and that's been a key aspect -- a key part of our business and one that we'll continue to lean on and leverage going forward. Yes. First, I'd say the incremental promotion we see it happening. We see really an intense competitive environment across all parts of the beauty category. And again, because of our model, mass to prestige, to luxury, we are directly competing with everybody that sells beauty. And so we watch and track and we're seeing promotional activity across mass, across prestige, across luxury. And so that's all part of it. And so I wouldn't say it's any one part of the category. \n As far as exactly, we don't have perfect insight. So we don't know exactly what each of our competitors are doing and understand all of their kind of internal measurements. But we watch very closely, track year-to-year, observe what's happening and then we do get some industry data that gives us a macro picture. So for us, it is just about making sure that we're delivering a great experience to our guests and delivering the right value at the right time. \n And you touched on it, but we have invested heavily in our capabilities to personalize and be more targeted. And that's what's allowed us to reduce our promotion from the levels that we saw in 2018 and 2019. And even as we plan for a more elevated level this year, as I mentioned earlier, we believe it will be below those levels, in part because of the tools that we have, the fact that now we have 41 million people. We have new personalization capabilities. We've got better CRM experience that allows us to be more pinpointed. That doesn't mean we won't do some broad scale offers here and there as they make sense for us. But under the covers, we're doing a whole lot more value add at a more personalized level, and that's paying off in an important way. Let me start, and I'm going to ask Scott to give a bit more color, but -- or definitely more color on specifically around your question. What I'd say is we're really confident in our business. We guided for this year that we'd be delivering 4% to 5% comp growth, and we're committed to doing that. That's what we set out to do, and we are on track to do that. .\n We've made an adjustment to our operating margins. Scott will give more detail on that, but that's a reflection of some very specific things. But we remain confident in our long-term operating margin and our profitability over time. And we will go address some of the shrink issues. We do not believe promo is going to get back to historic highs, and in part because of what I just talked about, the impact -- our ability, our capabilities around personalization and others. So I understand that some of those questions might be out there. But I'll tell you, we are committed to delivering what we set out to do. \n We are off to a good start to doing that in Q1: 9.3% comp, strong operating margin, strong EPS growth. And we believe our model is uniquely positioned to navigate whatever comes our way, and we've got the right team and the right strategies in place. So that's kind of how I feel about it at a macro level. But Scott, any color specifically about Michael's question? Yes, I'm glad you asked as wellness is it's an important growth opportunity. I'd start -- before I talk specifically about the wellness shop and the assortment we have there, I'd say this overall idea of wellness and self-care and the connection it has to beauty, I talked about this for a little while. So you may have heard this before, but it is an important trend coming out over the last couple of years that we think will drive continued growth and engagement. \n The fact that more and more consumers understand the importance of beauty as part of their overall wellness routine is a very strong positive. It's one that's driving so much innovation, both in products specifically designed for wellness but also across makeup and fragrance and just bringing in more the idea of wellness into all forms of innovation. We did launch our wellness shop in May of 2021. We're currently in about 800 doors. We'll be adding more doors this year to continue to expand that presence. \n We have a strong presence online. We have 140 brands, 700 SKUs across category focus, and it's a great experience. It's working really well. A number of really engaging brands like Love Wellness, Truly, Kitsch, megababe, GOLDE that we just added, Lemme by Kourtney Kardashian, there's a strong experience, high level of engagement across all 6 of our segments and pillars. And we're really pleased with its impact in connection. But we're also just getting started in that assortment. And so we see good growth in that area over time, and we're excited about the potential of that business for the long term. Yes. And Simeon, it's good to book end our Q&A by Simeon, so we're glad to do that. And I'd just say, yes, on the point, I mean, I think we covered some of the thoughts there about how we're seeing both spend per member, AUR, the units. I mean there's a lot of positive indicators on our business, and we're still working hard to get a read on how our consumer is navigating. We know there's pressures out there, but we also see a high level of engagement in beauty. \n And so our focus now is to continue to drive great engagement across all aspects, newness, innovation, our core business, to get them engaged in all of our touch points and make sure that we're delivering a great Ulta Beauty guest experience because we know when we do that, they respond. So we're tracking all that carefully. We'll continue to report out in future earnings calls and make sure that we are leading the category appropriately.\n So with that, let me just say I'd like to close by, again, thanking all of our Ulta Beauty associates across our stores, distribution centers and our corporate office offices for delivering another strong quarter for our stakeholders. We know the environment will continue to evolve. But as I've said, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategies, and we are very confident in our team as we look forward to build -- continue to build the foundation that we set here in the first quarter. So we look forward to speaking to you all again when we report results for the second quarter on August 24. Thanks. I hope everybody has a nice Memorial Day weekend, and we'll talk to you all again soon."

            "name": "Scott Settersten",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave said earlier, today, we reported results for the first quarter that were generally in line with our expectations. We entered 2023 anticipating that the unprecedented growth in the beauty category would moderate and that the promotional environment would increase. These trends materialized in the first quarter and are reflected in our results.\n Starting with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter increased 12.3%, driven by 9.3% growth in comp sales and strong new store performance. In addition, other revenue increased $19 million, primarily due to growth in both credit card income and royalty income from our Target partnership. The comp sales growth for the quarter was driven by an 11% increase in transactions, primarily due to double-digit growth in store traffic, which more than offset a 1.5% decline in average ticket. The decline in average ticket reflected lower units per transaction, which more than offset higher average selling price. We estimate that product price increases, most of which were executed last year, contributed about 400 basis points to the overall comp increase. \n Looking at the cadence of sales through the quarter, momentum from post-holiday tailwinds continued into February, which also benefited from lapping COVID headwinds last year. Comp sales subsequently moderated to mid-single digits as we move through the quarter. During the quarter, we opened 5 new stores and closed one store. In addition, we relocated one store and remodeled 2 stores. \n For the quarter, gross margin was down 10 basis points compared to the same period last year at 40% of sales. Higher inventory shrink, lower merchandise margin, higher supply chain costs, and deleverage of salon expenses were partially offset by strong growth in other revenue and leverage of store fixed costs. As Dave shared earlier, we continue to experience a worsening trend of theft and organized retail crime. We are actively working to stabilize and mitigate these trends through investments in staffing, training and fixtures, and we are working collaboratively with law enforcement and third-party organizations to address these challenges. \n In addition to greater pressure from shrink, gross margin was impacted by lower merchandise margin, primarily due to increased promotional activity and category mix shifts, which more than offset benefit from price increases. We also incurred additional costs in the quarter related to our supply chain optimization efforts. \n SG&A increased 22.2% to $612 million, which was slightly better than our plan. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 180 basis points to 23.2% compared to 21.4% last year, primarily due to deleverage of store payroll and benefits, corporate overhead and marketing expense, partially offset by leverage of incentive compensation and store expenses due to higher sales. \n Store payroll and benefits expense increased, driven primarily by higher average wage rates and increased staffing levels compared to the same period last year. Corporate overhead expense deleveraged in the quarter, primarily due to investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, other IT capabilities and UB Media. Marketing expense increased, reflecting investment in strategies to drive member acquisition and retention, increase brand awareness, and expand omni member penetration. \n Operating margin was 16.8% of sales compared to 18.7% of sales in the first quarter of 2022. As expected, the decline in operating margin primarily reflects the impact of SG&A deleverage and lapping our extraordinary results in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Net interest income for the quarter increased to $7.3 million, driven by higher average interest rates and higher average cash balances during the quarter. The company's tax rate decreased to 22.8% compared to 24.2% in the first quarter last year. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to greater benefit from income tax accounting for stock-based compensation. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 9.2% to $6.88 compared to $6.30 last year. \n Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 11.5% to $1.8 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 41 net new stores, the increase reflects the impact of higher purchases to support demand, product cost increases and inventory to support new brand launches and expansion of existing brands. \n Capital expenditures were $109.8 million for the quarter compared to $71.1 million last year. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily related to investments in IT and supply chain, as well as new, remodeled and relocated stores. \n Depreciation decreased to $57.9 million compared to $62.8 million last year, primarily due to lower store depreciation and a shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense. We ended the quarter with $636.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. In the first quarter, we repurchased 541,000 shares at a cost of $285.8 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $816 million remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization. \n Turning now to our outlook. We have refined our expectations for the full year to reflect our first quarter actual performance and recent trends. We are maintaining our expectations for annual comp sales growth and diluted earnings per share, but are updating our outlook for operating margin. We continue to expect comp sales growth for the year will be between 4% and 5%, with growth moderating as we move through the year. As we shared on our last call, we expect comp growth for the first half to be in the upper single-digit range and then moderate to low single-digit growth in the second half. \n We now expect operating margin for the full year will be between 14.5% and 14.8% of sales, primarily reflecting an updated view of gross margin. We have increased our expectations for gross margin deleverage from our original outlook to include the impact of higher shrink and a more competitive and promotional environment. We continue to expect SG&A deleverage, driven primarily by $60 million to $70 million of incremental spend to support strategic investments as well as the impact of ongoing inflationary pressures. \n We have updated our assumptions for interest income to reflect the current interest rate environment and are now planning for about $17 million of interest income for the year. We have also incorporated our first quarter tax rate into our full year forecast and now expect the effective tax rate for the year will be approximately 23.8%. These assumptions result in guidance for diluted earnings per share in the range of $24.70 to $25.40 per share. \n In closing, fiscal 2023 is off to a solid start. We remain optimistic about the health of the beauty category, confident in our team and our growth strategies and steadfast in our belief that our proven business model uniquely positions us to deliver for our guests, associates and shareholders. \n And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. Yes. So overall, I would just remind you, Simeon, that we did state, so total units are up across the enterprise, right, for the period year-over-year, and total spend per member is up year-over-year as well. So again, great evidence of a healthy, strong business model at play. Very strong traffic trends in both channels, but especially in our brick-and-mortar channel that we're pleased to see. \n When we look at the specific units per transaction, again, it was down. It's been decelerating a bit over the course of the last 3 or 4 quarters, I guess, I would say. So again, not totally surprising to us to see that. And again, we would take away from that what most people, just looking at the trends and looking at how consumers, are just being a little bit more selective now than maybe they were at this time last year. But we're trying not to read too much into that at this point in time. Yes. So it was -- when I think about the financial results and totality, and really shrink was the thing that surprised us in the quarter, and that's really the driver when we think about the operating margin adjustment for the year. So we knew sales were going to moderate a little bit after 2 spectacularly strong years. We knew the promotional environment was going to ramp up some. And maybe it's slightly richer than we were expecting, but that's not the driver. \n The driver is shrink, by far. And so that's what put a pretty meaningful drag on our first quarter, and we're expecting those trends to continue the rest of the year. Again, coming into 2023, we thought the shrink trends were going to moderate a little bit because of some of the investments we were putting behind mitigation tactics. But they haven't resonated yet. We're still hopeful. We're still -- our teams are doing a great job. A lot of effort is going into this. But from a financial standpoint, we're not banking on any improvement the rest of the way. So kind of remain a challenge for the rest of the year. Just one final note, Ike, on that one. So for quantification purposes, as a reference point in the first quarter, the shrink deleveraged above expectations, totally offset all fixed store cost. No, I would just add that, again, shrink and slightly richer promotional mix, temporary headwinds, we are very ready and able to be able to react to those kinds of things. So again, to Dave's point, with the toolbox that we have and the levers that we have to optimize this business, we're still very confident the 14% to 15% is the right range to be in. Things like UB Media, that's just kind of really getting off the ground, is a long-term margin accretive part of our business model. Project SOAR, digital store of the future, all these other large strategic initiatives we have underway right now are going to provide meaningful benefits for our stakeholders over a long period of time. So very confident in our [indiscernible]. Maybe I'll start with shrink. So I addressed here just a few minutes earlier, just directional in the first quarter, shrink basically offset fixed store cost leverage entirely. So again, remember, that's been trending upward over the last couple of years with a huge peer step on the top line, Simeon. And so we would expect that trend to continue through the rest of the year. We're not -- we were expecting some moderation in 2023, but at this stage, it doesn't seem like we're going to be able to deliver that. So not optimistic about how that plays out in gross margin the rest of the way."

            "name": "Kecia Steelman",
            "content": "Yes. Well, thank you for the question. Yes. So again, our salon service business was really strong again in the quarter. We -- what we like that we've seen is we -- in the prepared remarks, we talked about these backbar events. So not that we specifically ever break out purchase by service guests, but what I can share with you is that our backbar events, what we've seen is 90% of guests that are purchasing through those activations are new to those brands. So the guest experience and services is really resonating when we get them in the chair. \n [ Hot ] and color is the main driver of our overall services business. And then the trends that we're seeing really are around health care -- hair care around loss of hair treatments, and that also helps with our average ticket. So the business is really strong. Our stylists are really critical to our overall business. We hired over 950 stylists in this last quarter. So the business is strong. We've got capacity, and it's a unique proposition that we have here at Ulta Beauty. Sure. Yes. We'll be in 70% of the chain by the end of this year, with locked fragrance cabinets as fragrance is one of the base target areas that we see them going after. And we're also increasing labor in those specific locations. We're training and educating our associates how best to handle these types of situations. It's upsetting. If you're shopping in a store, and you see this activity happening, it's pretty shocking. \n I'm sure you've seen some of the reports that have come out there, the camera systems catching these groups coming in. So we've invested in security guards, armed security guards in some locations, partnering with our landlords at what can we do to help police the parking lots and throw them from even coming in. So it's a full court press out there, and we're keeping the communication lines open with our associates when this happens. Like I said, very disturbing and deciding to course-correct as an entire retail group."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and then re-enter the queue for any additional questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rawlins, you may proceed.\nKiley Rawlins: Thank you, Julian. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for a discussion of Ulta Beauty's results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Hosting our call today are Dave Kimbell, Chief Executive Officer, and Paula Oyibo, Chief Financial Officer. Kecia Steelman, President and Chief Operating Officer, will join us for the Q&A session. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company's safe harbor language. Many of our remarks today will contain forward-looking statements which speak only as of today, December 5th, 2024. We refer you to our earnings release and SEC filings where you will find a number of factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. We'll begin this afternoon with prepared remarks from Dave and Paula. Following our prepared comments, we'll open the call for questions. As always, the IR team will be available for any follow-up questions after the call. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave. Dave?\nDave Kimbell: Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. Our team delivered improved performance for this quarter with better-than-expected sales and profitability. For the quarter, net sales increased 1.7% to $2.5 billion and comparable sales increased 0.6%. Diluted EPS increased 1.4% to $5.14 per share. As we shared on our last call, we are navigating a number of headwinds, including the normalization of the US beauty category, a dynamic consumer environment, and elevated competition, particularly in prestige beauty. We are starting to see benefit from actions we are taking to reinforce our market position and improve our performance. And while the headwinds have not abated, we are making progress. In the third quarter, our prestige market share trends improved, resulting in flat market share this quarter based on Circana data for the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024. The trend was driven primarily by improvements in makeup and hair, and we continue to see strength in fragrance and skin care. Our share performance in Mass Beauty was consistent with the second quarter. Comp growth improved from the second quarter trend, driven by stronger transaction trends across both stores and e-commerce channels. We continued to expand our loyalty program, ending the quarter with 44.4 million active members, 5% more than last year. We continued to convert new members, we reactivated more lapsed members, and we improved existing member retention. Our marketing strategies to support our tent pole events and drive relevance and buzz deliver double digit growth in earned media value and stronger sentiment. And we made progress to optimize our new ERP system and help our teams adapt to new processes, balance inventories across the network, and deliver a better guest experience. Our teams are working hard to strengthen our market position, and I want to thank all of our associates for continuing to deliver great guest experiences while working collaboratively to drive improved performance in a dynamic operating environment. Turning to performance by category. Fragrance was our strongest category, delivering high single-digit comp growth, driven by men's fragrance, gender-neutral fragrances, and new products, including new fall and holiday gift sets. The growth of men's fragrance was fueled primarily by newness from ARMANI and YSL and the appeal of established franchises from Jean Paul Gaultier and Valentino. Consumer interest in gender neutral scents is increasing and our assortment including Billie Eilish and NOYZ, an exclusive fragrance LUSH that's launched this summer, is driving guest engagement. New women's brands Kylie Jenner and Orebella, both exclusive to Ulta Beauty and new women's fragrances from Valentino, YSL, and NEST also contributed to overall category growth. The skincare category delivered mid-single-digit comp growth this quarter, as strong growth in body care was partially offset by a decline in prestige skin care. Mass skin care was flat. The strong performance of body care was driven in large part by newer brand Sol de Janeiro, which continues to engage guests with exciting innovation and exclusivity and Touchland, which introduced compelling newness. In prestige skin care, newness from brands OLEHENRIKSEN, Sacheu, DIME Beauty, and others resonated with guests, while engagement from Naturium, Bubble, and La Roche-Posay delivered growth in the mass skin care category. Comp sales in the makeup category decreased in the low single-digit range driven primarily by softness in mass makeup. Strong growth from recently relaunched Ulta Beauty Collection was offset by certain brands lapping space expansion, strong innovation or social media engagement last year. Prestige makeup was flat. New prestige brands Charlotte Tilbury, ILIA Beauty and DIBS Beauty resonated with guests and compelling product newness combined with in-store investments delivered growth for established brands MAC and Clinique. Promotional events during the quarter including 21 Days of Beauty and Fall Haul performed well, driving growth for several makeup brands, while our engaging Wicked collaboration was well received, highlighted by exclusive brand r.e.m. beauty. Comp sales for the hair care category also decreased in the low single-digit range. Exciting newness from Matrix, [Way] (ph), Divi, and Odele delivered growth for the category, while Redken continued to drive healthy guest engagement with their Hero product lines. In hair tools, new products from Shark Beauty and Dyson resonated with guests. This growth was offset by softness in key brands with expanded distribution and limited newness this year. Our services business delivered low single-digit comp growth, primarily driven by engagement in core services, including color, styling, and hair treatments. Ear piercing and makeup services also performed well. And our salon backbar takeovers, which get stylists an opportunity to introduce brands to guests, continued to drive product attachment, and new guest acquisition for participating brands. We are seeing improvements in our business, and we are focused on strengthening our market position and performance further. In October, we shared our refreshed strategic framework designed to lean into our existing strengths while also driving innovation to meet the evolving needs of beauty enthusiasts. As the beauty destination of a lifetime, we intend to drive profitable growth and market share leadership in beauty and wellness over the longer term through curating the best of all things beauty and wellness for all beauty enthusiasts, fostering authentic empowering human connections that inspire, delight and engage at every touch point, engaging our guests wherever they want to shop by expanding our reach through seamless and immersive omnichannel experiences, and building lifelong loyalty and brand love through member growth and personalization. We are confident our focus on these foundational areas will drive stronger revenue and earnings growth over the long term. And the near term, we are addressing key areas to reinforce our competitive position. Let me share some highlights of the progress made this quarter, starting with our efforts to strengthen our assortment. We are enhancing our brand portfolio to drive category growth. During the third quarter, we launched new makeup brands ILIA Beauty, DIBS Beauty, and RMS Beauty, as well as emerging skincare brand Oak Essentials. Additionally, we expanded our wellness offerings with emerging brands, The Honey Pot and Joylux. Looking ahead, we have an exciting pipeline of brand launches planned for the fourth quarter, including the recently announced prestige skincare brand, TATCHA, celebrated for balancing timeless Japanese botanicals with proven clinical ingredients, XO KHLOE, an exclusive fragrance brand created by Khloe Kardashian, and Apothekary, an emerging wellness brand. In addition to new brands, we launched two exciting exclusive collaborations this quarter. First, as the exclusive beauty retail partner with NBCUniversal Pictures for the movie Wicked, we worked with key brands to develop a limited edition collection of products across multiple price points and categories. The Wicked inspired collection features products from leading brands including r.e.m. beauty by Ariana Grande and Beekman 1802, both of which are exclusive to Ulta Beauty, as well as OPI and Scunci among others. With immersive in-store experiences and engaging displays, Wicked came to life in Ulta Beauty stores through our digital channels and through Ulta Beauty at Target. Second, we launched an exclusive and a disruptive beauty offering of the beloved Mini Brands, which offers miniature versions of popular consumer brands. This first ever Beauty Mini Brands collection includes 68 tiny replicas of best selling products from 13 brands, including e.l.f., NYX, Drybar, and Supergoop!. Both of these unique collaborations are driving strong sales, awareness, traffic, and engagement, especially with Gen Z millennial members. As we discussed at our recent Investor Day, engaging guest experiences drive differentiation, loyalty, and meaningful business value, and we are focused on creating authentic, personalized experiences across all our channels. In Q3 we hosted more than 13,000 in-store events including unique celebrity and brand founder events, multi-branded events, and skin care focused events. We also expanded our salon event, The Workshop, to more stores and invited guests to learn how to create salon-worthy blowouts while receiving customized coaching and personalized recommendations from our talented in-store stylists. We are enhancing our digital experiences to drive traffic and sales. During the quarter, key online activations drove guest engagement, and our expanded sampling program delivered double-digit sales growth. Our digital merchandising strategies, including enhanced search, guided navigation, and enriched product pages drove conversion, and our site optimization efforts are improving the guest experience and delivering stronger conversion trends. Importantly, we continued to drive increased app adoption. In the third quarter, we saw double-digit growth in member engagement with the app, which accounted for about two-thirds of our e-commerce sales in Q3, up about 600 basis points from last year. We continued to introduce new digital experiences and resources to drive discovery and trial. This quarter we enhanced our suite of virtual try-on and AI enabled skin and hair analysis experiences with the launch of GLAMlab 2.0 which includes a new 3D engine to enhance precision and stability, shoppable makeup looks, and a new user interface that includes sharing capabilities. We also launched new digital buying guides that amplify search engine optimization while providing guests with educational content, beauty tips, and product recommendations. To deepen the meaningful connection we have with beauty enthusiasts, we launched UB Community, a welcoming, inclusive, digital forum for guests to connect, learn, empower, and engage learn, empower, and engage in the immersive world of beauty to foster authentic connections. Launched in October, our community amplifies the intersection of beauty, wellness and joy, and our user count is already three times our initial target, confirming the meaningful role Ulta Beauty plays in our members' lives. With more than 44 million active members, Ulta Beauty Rewards is an unmatched strategic asset that provides us with unique consumer insights to drive sales. In Q3, we expanded personalization across digital channels with enhanced product recommendations, replenishment reminders, site experiences and retargeted and social channels. Leaning into targeted life cycle campaigns in both owned and paid channels, we reactivated members with greater efficiency. Additionally, we grew our platinum and diamond member base, leveraging unique incentives like exclusive and early access to key events and brand launches, gifting and personalized offers that drive engagement. Platinum and diamond members shop more frequently and spend more each visit and continue to retain at best-in-class rates. Increasingly, social relevance drives authentic customer connection and brand advocacy, especially in beauty, and we're evolving to position social at the center of our marketing strategies to accelerate browse and earned media value growth. During the third quarter, we leveraged our marketing and social capabilities to lean into emerging trends, amplify key growth brands and activate new trend-focused events. We also engage talent from our UB Collective, our affiliate program, and Ulta Beauties, our new associate ambassador program as well as key brand founders to support key brand launches, exclusive collaborations and tent pole events in new and innovative ways across social channels to drive guest buzz and engagement. Efforts delivered accelerated EMV growth, increased impression and expanded key brand health metrics. We continue to enhance our product capabilities to grow our retail media network, UB Media. We recently partnered with e-commerce tech company, Rocket, to introduce AI non-endemic ads for products and services outside the beauty category, and we are partnering with Roblox, the ultimate virtual universe to create innovative advertising opportunities for our partners. Over the years, our Ultaverse has grown into one of the largest beauty games on Roblox, attracting over 11 million visits. With growing interest from beauty brands to participate in our Ultaverse, we're unlocking new possibilities at the intersection of gaming, innovation and media to bring those brands to life in exciting new ways through our UB Media capabilities. Now leveraging lessons in the second quarter, we continue to evolve and tailor our promotional strategies to reiterate our value offering and drive sales and traffic. We began the quarter with a new hair event showcasing the glossy hair trend, replacing last year's fall Gorgeous Hair event, this event featured a strong promo offer, new and exclusive items from Dyson and a spotlight on gloss and shine products. Especially strong in stores, the new event exceeded our expectations and drove strong results for participating brands. At the end of August, we brought back our beloved 21 Days of Beauty event. New beauty steals, member-only events and bonus offers, combined with robust marketing and social support, 21 Days of Beauty delivered strong growth versus last year's event. We wrapped up the quarter with a successful Fall Haul event, which drove mass engagement and new member acquisition with compelling offers that surprised and delighted guests. In addition to strengthening and evolving our merchandising tent pole events, we optimized our loyalty offers, proactively planning the timing, type and target audience of these offers. As a result, our promotional effectiveness improved from the first half trend. Shifting now to our plans and expectations for holiday. The formal holiday season is in full flight. And while we're encouraged by our performance through Cyber Monday, we have several significant holiday sales weeks still ahead. While consumers continue to spend, our insights suggest that economic concerns are driving a greater focus on value. With our diverse assortment of products and price points, compelling offers and convenient omnichannel touch points, we are well positioned to support our guests as they celebrate the season and our teams are excited, engaged and ready to help them deliver a joyful holiday. Our holiday campaign this year is Find Joy in the Present, a reminder of the joy that comes not only from gifts of beauty, but from the big and small moments that drive authentic emotional connection. With the goal of driving deeper emotional engagement, our campaign is supported with robust integrated activation across media, member marketing, PR and social channels as well as festive experiences in stores and on our digital platforms. We have strategies in place to fortify our competitive positioning and manage through the compressed holiday selling season. We are transforming our channels into a concierge for all things holiday, providing greater value to consumers with real-time beauty solutions, gift guides and tips tailored to our guests' needs and creating fun experiences that drive awareness and make Ulta Beauty the go-to destination for the holidays. Our merchandising team has created an exciting holiday assortment, with a strong focus on newness and exclusives balanced with value-driven holiday kits and core items that make great gifts. Whether guests wants to gift others or treat themselves, we have thoughtfully curated options across every category and budget. Our corporate and supply chain teams have been working hard all year to ensure Ulta Beauty is ready to bring our guests joy this holiday season. And our store teams are ready to bring the holiday to life for our guests, with new in-store events and demonstrations to build guest connection and drive sales and traffic. And with BOPIS, same-day delivery options and new for this holiday, our participation in DoorDash and soon-to-be launched Instacart marketplaces, it's never been easier or more convenient to shop at Ulta Beauty. With our engaging holiday messaging, incredible holiday assortment, knowledgeable associates ready to provide guidance and recommendations, new innovative digital tools and multiple ways to shop, I am confident we are well positioned to deliver another successful holiday season. In summary, I am encouraged by the improving trends we are seeing in the business and optimistic about our holiday plans. We believe the beauty category will remain resilient, and we are confident the actions we are taking to deliver stronger performance combined with our outstanding associates who are committed to offering guests authentic inclusive experiences across all of our touch points will enable us to reinforce our market position and drive long-term profitable growth. Now, before Paula discusses our financial results, I want to share that Monica Arnaudo, Chief Merchandising Officer, has announced her plan to retire from Ulta Beauty in the spring of 2025. Since joining Ulta Beauty in 2017, Monica has built an outstanding team and elevated our assortment in ways that have helped us deliver remarkable sales and market share growth, while furthering our mission to be our guests\u2019 most loved beauty destination. I want to thank Monica for everything she has contributed as a member of our executive team and for the impact she has had on our organization. While we work to identify Monica\u2019s successor, she is fully committed to supporting her team and Ulta Beauty with a successful transition. And now, I will turn the call over to Paula for a discussion of the financial results. Paula?\nPaula Oyibo: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to echo Dave's sentiments and congratulate Monica. Monica has been a trusted leader and steadfast ambassador of our brands, and we are so grateful for all of her contributions. Now turning to our financials. I'll begin with a discussion of our third quarter financial results and then provide more color on our fourth quarter and full year expectations. For the third quarter, we delivered better-than-expected performance across the P&L, reflecting stronger top line growth, continued financial discipline and expense management and favorable shrink trends. Net sales for the quarter increased 1.7%, sales contribution from new stores and a 0.6% increase in comp sales was partially offset by lower other revenue. During the quarter, we opened 28 new stores, closed two stores and remodeled 27 stores. The comp sales increase was driven by a 0.5% increase in transactions and a 0.1% increase in average ticket. Other revenue declined $5 million to $48 million, primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue related to our loyalty program, driven by the expansion of our member engagement efforts, which were partially offset an increase in income from our credit card program. Looking at the cadence of sales throughout the quarter. Comp sales in August decreased slightly primarily due to a shift in timing of our semiannual 21 Days of Beauty event, which resulted in stronger comp performance in September. October trends were positive but softened compared to the previous period. From a channel perspective, our e-commerce channel delivered mid-single-digit sales growth. The sales trend in comp stores improved from the second quarter, decreasing modestly compared to last year. For the quarter, gross margin decreased 20 basis points to 39.7% compared to 39.9% last year. The decline was primarily due to deleverage of fixed costs and lower other revenue, which was partially offset by favorable channel mix due to lower e-commerce shipping costs and lower shrink. Lower revenue growth resulted in deleverage of store and supply chain fixed costs. Additionally, more new store openings and the expansion of our supply chain network pressured these areas. As a percentage of sales, inventory shrink was lower than last year. Our investments in secure fragrance fixtures combined with new inventory management processes and enhanced training for our field teams are helping us control inventory shrink. Year-to-date, shrink as a percentage of sales is roughly flat with last year, and we continue to expect shrink will be flat for the full year. Merchandise margin was flat with lower inventory reserves primarily related to the relaunch of Ulta Beauty Collection, offset by unfavorable brand mix. Moving to expenses. SG&A increased 3.2% to $682 million. Overall, SG&A spend was better than planned again this quarter, primarily due to focused expense management. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 40 basis points to 27% compared to 26.6% last year, reflecting lower top line growth, most expenses deleveraged this quarter. In addition, SG&A deleveraged primarily due to higher store payroll and benefits, primarily due to higher average wage rates and higher corporate overhead, primarily due to strategic investments. These pressures were partially offset by lower incentive compensation, reflecting operational performance that was below our internal targets. Depreciation was $67 million for the quarter compared to $61 million last year, primarily due to new store and supply chain investments. Operating profit decreased 2.7% to $318.5 million. As a percentage of sales, operating margin was 12.6% of sales compared to 13.1% of sales last year, and diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 1.4% to $5.14 compared to $5.07 last year. Moving to the balance sheet and our capital allocation priorities. We ended the quarter with $178 million in cash and cash equivalents and $200 million in short-term debt. Similar to third quarter last year, we drew on our revolving credit facility during the quarter to support working capital needs and ongoing capital allocation priorities, including share repurchases and capital expenditures. Total inventory increased 1.9% to $2.4 billion compared to $2.3 billion last year. The increase was primarily due to the impact of 63 net new stores. Year-to-date, through the third quarter, we generated $302 million in operating cash flow. Capital expenditures were $114 million for the quarter, primarily reflecting investments in new and existing stores, IT investments and merchandise fixtures. In the third quarter, we returned $267 million of capital to our shareholders through the repurchase of 731,000 shares. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.9 billion remaining under our $3 billion share repurchase program we announced at our investor meeting in October. Now turning to our outlook. We have refined our sales and EPS guidance for the fiscal -- for fiscal 2024 to reflect our third quarter results, while continuing to take a cautious view of the consumer and operating environment. We expect net sales for the year will be between $11.1 billion and $11.2 billion, with comp sales growth between negative 1% and flat. For the year, we continue to plan to open approximately 60 to 65 net new stores and remodel or relocate 40 to 45 stores. We expect operating margin will be between 12.9% and 13.1% of net sales, with deleverage to come from both gross margin and SG&A, reflecting our top line expectations. Reflecting these assumptions, we now expect diluted EPS for the year will be between $23.20 and $23.75. With one quarter left in the year, I want to share how we are thinking about Q4. While we are encouraged by our third quarter results and our performance quarter-to-date, we also acknowledge that the fourth quarter will likely be impacted by a compressed holiday season, a dynamic operating environment and continued uncertainty around underlying consumer demand. For Q4 modeling purposes, we expect comp sales will decline in the low single-digit range and operating margin will be between 11.6% and 12.4%. One final update. We have updated our capital expenditure expectations for the full year and now expect to spend between $400 million and $425 million in CapEx in fiscal 2024, including approximately $230 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $130 million for supply chain and IT, and about $50 million for store maintenance and others. In closing, we know it will take time to see the full benefits from our efforts, but we remain confident that our go-to-market strategies and investments along with continued operational and financial discipline will enable us to drive stronger sales and value creation over the long term. And now, I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Simeon Siegel, BMO Capital Markets.\nSimeon Siegel: Thanks. Hey, everyone. Nice job, and if I forget later, I hope you and your families all have a nice holiday season. Dave, any further color you can share on how you're thinking about the broader competitive and promotional landscape over holiday? And then just Paula, could you quantify any of those gross margin pressure points this quarter, how you're thinking about the next quarter and beyond? And then just does any of today's progress in the full year guide lift impact your initial margin views you had given us in October? Thank you.\nDave Kimbell: Great. Thanks, Simeon, and happy holidays to you as well. I'll start with just the broader competitive and promotional landscape. And Paula, you can pick up on some of the margin specific areas. So for the third quarter, what -- as we -- as I mentioned in the remarks, we continue to see this is an intensely competitive time frame. And we've been managing and discussing that throughout the year. We feel like our actions, the adjustments we made in the third quarter helped us improve our performance, strengthen our performance, but we also recognize we have more work ahead of us. The dynamics in the marketplace continue, particularly in the prestige space, but we're seeing progress. And our unique proposition, the aspects that only Ulta delivers through our assortment, our loyalty program, our points of presence, the experience we deliver have always been key to our business and continue to be core drivers. Promotionally, what we experienced in the third quarter was continued normalization after some reduced promotion coming right out of COVID. So we anticipated that coming into Q3 -- coming into this year. We saw that in Q3. Our promotional rates in Q3 were lower than Q2, but still somewhat higher than last year. But as I mentioned in the remarks, our efforts to adjust our promotional strategy to lean in and amplify our tent-pole events, made our overall efforts more effective leveraging our CRM program and our personalization efforts are driving the business. As we look into the holiday, it is obviously a very promotional time frame, the most promotional time frame. That's certainly true this year. And as we navigate through and share our fourth quarter results, we'll have reflections on the overall dynamics, but we're anticipating continued promotional intensity, but not significantly outside of what we would expect so far this holiday. Paula, do you want to talk about that?\nPaula Oyibo: Sure. Good afternoon, Simeon. Yeah, so we raised our full year operating margin and EPS, reflecting Q3 performance and also ongoing expense discipline. What I would say as we think about kind of Q4, generally for the full year, we continue to expect gross margin deleverage, and when we think about Q4, reflecting the top line expectations in a competitive environment. Gross margin will continue to de-leverage. And really, the trends we've seen all year will continue. So, headwinds are the deleverage we expect to see from a fixed cost perspective, merchandise margin pressure will continue given promotions and category mix. And then our tailwinds, lower transportation costs, which we've been speaking about all year, we'll continue to provide some offsets to that. I would say from an SG&A perspective, we're expecting growth from a full year in the mid-single-digit range. But Q4, expecting that to be in the low single-digit growth range. We still expect or most of our expenses to deleverage on the lower sales. But we'll continue to maintain financial discipline as we have in Q3.\nSimeon Siegel: Great. Thanks\u2026\nPaula Oyibo: And I think the second -- okay. Thank you.\nSimeon Siegel: No, sorry. Didn\u2019t mean to cut you off.\nPaula Oyibo: No, all good. Thank you, Simeon.\nSimeon Siegel: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kelly Crago, Citi.\nKelly Crago: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to see if you could provide a little bit more context on the prestige makeup line that was flat in the quarter. How was it for the industry overall? And if you could just talk about the innovation pipeline in prestige -- I'm sorry if I said prestige beauty before, I'm talking about prestige makeup. If you could talk about the innovation pipeline there. And then just secondly, any way to kind of quantify the drag you've seen from the competitive pressures specifically with those new points of distribution and sort of where we're at in the timeline for when you expect those headwinds to abate further? Thanks.\nDave Kimbell: Great. Well, thanks, Kelly. Yeah, let's see, starting with prestige makeup, obviously, an important category, our largest category. And I'd start with saying, overall, we're pleased in the third quarter that prestige makeup was flat for the quarter for us, which was improvement from some of the trends. The drivers behind that are our innovation that we continue to launch brands like ILIA coming into our portfolio, strong execution across our key programs like 21 Days of Beauty, which is focused on prestige and make up, of course, is the highlight of that, and real emphasis on some of our core brands like the Clinique and MAC and other strong performing brands that we've been working closely with to ensure we're delivering for our guests and our guests respond well to them. And so we're really -- we've been focused on this category for a long time to strengthen its performance and we're really pleased that it was able -- that we were able to do that. Overall, in the category, we saw the category, the total prestige makeup category a bit more than us in low single-digits. So we saw pressure share, although our share performance, while still pressured, improved from the second quarter. So we're making headway, and we're pleased with that. Overall, on the competitive environment, you asked about competitive openings. As we've been talking about throughout the year, that's certainly a meaningful dynamic as there's been more than 1,000 new points of distribution in prestige beauty that over the last couple of years. And that has been a pressure. I shared in previous discussions that 80% of our stores have experienced at least one competitive opening and more than half have had multiple competitive openings, and that continues to be a dynamic that's going on in the marketplace. Having said that, we're confident in the actions that we're taking. We know we've seen historically new store openings. We're able to absorb the shorter-term hit, but then turn our stores back into positive contributors to our business over the long term. This is a different dynamic given the scale, just the sheer number of new stores opening in a short period of time. But we're confident in our ability to do that. We did see improvements in Q3 that contributed to the stronger performance we had in Q3 in total versus Q2. So we feel like we saw some headway in that. But we're not -- but it's we're still in the midst of it. And so by no means are we claiming that we're through it. We've got more work to do. We're working through the dynamics. And our focus there is continue to do what we do best, lean into our strengths in our stores and online and all of our experiences that activity, those things that I highlighted on earlier are what helped us make progress this quarter and other things that are going to drive us into 2025 as we continue to strengthen our business.\nKelly Crago: Thanks. Best of luck and happy holidays.\nDave Kimbell: Happy holidays.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Korinne Wolfmeyer, Piper Sandler.\nKorinne Wolfmeyer: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. I'd like to touch a little bit on the competitiveness on the mass piece of business. I feel like we talked a lot about prestige, but I do want to understand mass, a lot of the broader mass -- larger mass retailers have been talking a little bit more positively about beauty. You've got dollar stores expanding more in beauty. So, how is this impacting the competitive landscape would you say for that piece of the business? And how are you thinking about the mass piece going forward and heading into 2025? Thank you.\nDave Kimbell: Well, yes. Thanks, Korinne. The -- I'll start with saying that beauty is a very attractive category. And so we've talked many times about the fact that anybody in beauty, whether in the mass side, prestige side, luxury is emphasizing the category, investing in the category and that's been going on across all of our competitors. In the mass specific business, yeah, that -- the total mass business continues to perform in that mid-single-digit range for the quarter in total mass. And it's an important category for us. As you know, one of the key differentiators of our business is strength in mass and [mass] (ph) and prestige and luxury. And so we continue to be focused on our mass business and the important role that it plays. So that we're well aware of the dynamics. We have seen mass makeup as a category -- cost of category decelerate. Certainly, there's brands that are stronger, but the total category has been more pressured, but we're seeing strength -- continued strength in mass skin, which is an important business for us. So we're focused on continuing to drive our mass business and make sure we're delivering the assortment that we know our guests love the ability to engage with us across all price points and continue to be confident in our ability to excite them and engage them in our mass business.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony Chukumba, Loop Capital Markets.\nAnthony Chukumba: Thank you so much for taking my question. Hopefully, you can hear me okay. And I'll just keep it to one question. Obviously, you had a very impressive sequential improvement in your performance. And you've touched on a few different things, but if you had to sort of almost like kind of stack rank what you thought drove the better performance, would it be the more effective promotions? Would it be some of the merchandising changes? Would it be some of the partnerships you talked about, like, with Wicked and I guess, the Mini Brands or whatever. Yeah, if you could just give us -- help us to understand what, from a sequential perspective led to the improvement in performance. Thank you.\nDave Kimbell: Great. Thanks, Anthony. Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't point to one thing. There was not one thing that ever really drives our business. And we talked about coming out of the second quarter. While we're pleased with some aspects of our business, we were clear on areas that we needed to address, and we leaned into several of the key factors. Assortment is always critical. Bringing in newness, some of the brands I highlighted like ILIA into the quarter played an important role. The collaborations that you mentioned also drove excitement and enthusiasm. Assortment is always a key driver and certainly was in the third quarter. Our promotional effectiveness, we had some learnings in the second quarter as we were faced with more pressure sales, how we adapted our promotional environment. We had learnings there that we built from into the third quarter. Leaning in, strengthening our core tent pole events that our guests value from Ulta Beauty, 21 Days of Beauty, our hair brand and Fall Haul as well as smart, purposeful targeted and effective complementary promotions throughout the quarter in a very personalized. So that drove a strong effectiveness. We worked hard throughout the quarter. Our teams across the organization, store teams, for sure supply chain, our IT teams, our digital teams to make sure we were delivering a great experience to improve conversion, and we're pleased that we were able to do that both in store and strong performance online. And that took a holistic effort with making sure we have strong engagement from our store associates and strong execution online. And we also -- the last thing I'd mention is we highlighted in the second quarter, some disruption from some system changes and we made improvements in that space to make sure our products were where they needed to be. So multiple elements contributed. It was a really holistic effort across the organization, and we're pleased. Having said that, we know we've got more work to do. We're -- while we're pleased with the sequential improvement, we are focused on stronger improvement over time as we move both through the holiday period and into 2025 and beyond. So we'll continue to lean into all of those things and the broader strategies that we went through in a lot of detail at our Investor Day in October.\nAnthony Chukumba: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Christopher Horvers, JPMorgan Chase & Company.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks, good evening. So I'll throw a quick two-parter in there as well. So the first part is, are you positive quarter-to-date? You mentioned encourage -- and how are you thinking about the balance between the five fewer days but at the same time, have a very substantial gift card business and five fewer days would suggest a strong January follow-through. And then following up on an earlier question, any further thoughts on how you think about '25. You talked about a floor of 11% long-term 12% plus, how did this quarter change that point of view, if at all? Thanks.\nPaula Oyibo: Hi, Chris, thanks for the question. What I would say is we won\u2019t necessarily get into the details of specifically comp quarter-to-date. But what I will say is that, our holiday season is off to a solid start and our teams are executing well. We are encouraged by what we're seeing, but we also recognize that we have several important weeks ahead of us in the holiday season, even an operating environment is dynamic. And so that is why we shared that we're expecting Q4 comp sales to decline in the low single-digit range. So that's what we're thinking from a quarter perspective. And I would say, yeah, there is a component of the dynamic environment that is related to how consumers the fewer shopping days and things of that sort that we are obviously contemplating as we think about our expectations for Q4. As we think about 2025, again, still several important weeks left ahead of us, and we're focused on closing -- getting to a holiday strong and closing out the fiscal year strong. And we will provide additional color on 2025 when we provide our guidance in March, consistent with what we typically do. Now that being said, I would say directional color that we provided at our Investor Day remains the same. We expect 2024 and 2025 to be transitional period as we invest to reaccelerate our growth, and we continue to expect to make investments in 2025 that will position us for a stronger long term. but we will make decisions to enable -- to ensure that we're delivering operating margin at least above 11%.\nChristopher Horvers: That\u2019s great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kate McShane, Goldman Sachs.\nEmily Ghosh: Hi, this is Emily Ghosh, on for Kate. We were wondering on UB Media, how big of a competitive moat do you think it could be, especially considering what it does to help your relationship with vendor partners? And how much is UB Media contributing to the long-term operating margin outlook that you provided at the Investor Day?\nDave Kimbell: Great. Thanks, Emily. Yes, the -- we think we're very optimistic and excited about the role that UB Media is and will play on our business going forward. As you suggest, we have a real competitive opportunity because of the scale and the breadth of our business, the data that we have, the understanding of beauty engagement and transactions across really all beauty enthusiasts of all ages and all geographies is really unmatched. And so we've worked hard to deliver an experience for our brand partners that adds value and most importantly, adds strong ROI in their media investments and the growth that we've seen in that business reinforces that we're able to do that. We're -- as we did talk about at our Investor Day, continued investment and capabilities. I highlighted a couple of those capabilities on the call earlier today related to roadblocks and other ways that we can further give our brands opportunities. But because of the brand relationships that we have and the role that we play in the category, we are confident that our opportunity to grow this business, continue to grow this business over time will be will be a positive impact on the business. Paula, do you want to talk about the financial impact?\nPaula Oyibo: Sure. What I would say is UB Media, Emily, is contributing positively to gross margin in a way to think about it over time is that it plays in for role for us, and it will help offset some of the merchandise margin pressure. We currently see we have shared as we make certain investments in brand building and other things in 2025 and beyond that would serve to help offset some of those pressures.\nEmily Ghosh: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Oliver Chen, TD Cowen.\nOliver Chen: Hi, thanks, David and Kecia. On your thinking longer term, what will it take positive comp in terms of what categories perhaps you see as the biggest opportunities? And was the commentary on October being a bit softer. Was that surprising to you? It sounds like you may continue to expect to see a fair bit of volatility. And Kecia, online half store sales, is it a mid-single-digit leverage occupancy. Anything we should know about that in terms of achieving fixed cost leverage based on the comp? Thank you.\nDave Kimbell: Thank you. Oliver, let's see. So first on long-term growth, what's going to deliver positive comps. I guess I would go back to what we talked about in detail at our Investor Day. We really see a combination of leaning in and reinforcing our established strengths as well as innovating across our entire ecosystem as key contributors to our performance. We talked about four key pillars or platforms assortment, having the best assortment across beauty and wellness experience, delighting our guests in every touch point that we have access, continuing to expand our availability, both with stores, accelerated new store openings as well as strong online expressions and then, of course, loyalty and building brand love. We're really focused on driving innovation across each of those and making sure that we're ready to do that. And what we -- what I talked about in an earlier question, that contributed to the third quarter improvement versus the second quarter. It's the foundation. It's the fundamentals. It's the core things, Oliver, you know about our business having tracked us for a long time. When assortment is stronger and experience is right and our loyalty is working and our touch points are driving both in-store and online, those are the things that will come together. So much -- really all of it, we just shared a couple of months ago, those are the aspects that will drive our business going forward.\nPaula Oyibo: Yeah. And, Oliver, this is Paula. Given you asked a question about October and whether or not we were surprised. What I would say is now -- and we thought, Dave mentioned and we talked about the timing and some of our tent pole event. And so that had a role to play in kind of the by period performance in Q3. And then I think you had a question about leverage points, and we don't specifically disclose a specific point, and we've shared in the past one way to think about things is from a rent perspective, expense is around 4%. And so as you think about comp and total growth, maybe think about it in that perspective.\nOliver Chen: Happy holidays. Thanks.\nDave Kimbell: Thanks, Oliver.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Krisztina Katai, Deutsche Bank.\nKrisztina Katai: Hi, good afternoon. Congrats on a nice quarter. So I just wanted to follow up on your early learnings from your market share reinforcing strategy. It obviously enabled you to maintain flat market share in the third quarter, at least in prestige. Where are you seeing some of the biggest gains in member engagement? I think, Dave, you talked about both platinum and diamond members are up in the program year-over-year. And then just as the competitive opening pressures abate, is it fair to say that maybe the worst is behind us? And is there a timeline for when you think maybe you could return to market share gains? Thank you.\nDave Kimbell: Well, let's see. So, on the -- where we've seen engagement, yeah, you highlighted an important part of our business, which is what we call our lead guest, our Platinum and our Diamond members. And we're pleased that we continue to see strong performance from them, high engagement, high spend, they are obviously our best guest. But we're seeing that across the board, and it's something we've been focused on to continue to grow our business. Our loyalty program in total was up 5% for the quarter, and that was a combination of attracting new members as one of the things we talked about in October was even though we've had a lot of growth in that -- in our loyalty program over time, we still see a lot of opportunity ahead, and we're continuing to attract new members and bring them into our business. And that, of course, is important fuel for future growth. We also had success reactivating lapsed members, a lapsed member is somebody that has a -- is part of the program but hasn't purchased with us for the at least once in the last 12 months. And we have a very focused CRM personalized program going after that group, and we continue to see success with that. And then our retention is strong. There is an intense competitive environment, but our guests continue to demonstrate that they like what Ulta is offering. And so retention remains healthy. And so those things come together. We're seeing it across all ages, all geographies, strength across all types of beauty enthusiasts, which is an important part of our business. Competitively, you asked about the dynamics there. And I continue to say something that we've shared in the past is, it's difficult for us to exactly predict or lay out when we would see us completely moving through this because we've never experienced the scale of this in such a concentrated period of time. Having said that, I'll reiterate something I mentioned earlier, which is we have confidence. We've seen it in the data before new store openings. Our stores are able to recover and return to strong contributors. The data that we see now, stores that have not been impacted by competitive opening continue to perform better and positively, and we saw improved performance in Q3. But I would not take that fully as a, okay, we're through 100% through it, and it's totally behind us. This is a meaningful disruption in the category. We're learning every period. What -- how the dynamics are evolving, but we did make progress in Q3, and it's our focus to continue to do that as we move into 2025.\nDave Kimbell: All right. So with that, thank you all. I will wrap up. Thank you for joining us today. So, I want to close out by thanking our more than 55,000 Ulta Beauty associates working together in our stores, in our distribution centers and across our entire corporate team. I sincerely appreciate their continued focus and commitment to delivering unique and memorable guest experiences across all our channels. So, as we close, I want to wish you all a happy and healthy holiday season. There's still time to get out and shop at Ulta Beauty. So make sure you put that into your holiday shopping plans, and we look forward to speaking to you again when we report results for fiscal 2024 on March 13. Have a great evening. Thank you all.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "name": "Paula Oyibo",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to echo Dave's sentiments and congratulate Monica. Monica has been a trusted leader and steadfast ambassador of our brands, and we are so grateful for all of her contributions. Now turning to our financials. I'll begin with a discussion of our third quarter financial results and then provide more color on our fourth quarter and full year expectations. For the third quarter, we delivered better-than-expected performance across the P&L, reflecting stronger top line growth, continued financial discipline and expense management and favorable shrink trends. Net sales for the quarter increased 1.7%, sales contribution from new stores and a 0.6% increase in comp sales was partially offset by lower other revenue. During the quarter, we opened 28 new stores, closed two stores and remodeled 27 stores. The comp sales increase was driven by a 0.5% increase in transactions and a 0.1% increase in average ticket. Other revenue declined $5 million to $48 million, primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue related to our loyalty program, driven by the expansion of our member engagement efforts, which were partially offset an increase in income from our credit card program. Looking at the cadence of sales throughout the quarter. Comp sales in August decreased slightly primarily due to a shift in timing of our semiannual 21 Days of Beauty event, which resulted in stronger comp performance in September. October trends were positive but softened compared to the previous period. From a channel perspective, our e-commerce channel delivered mid-single-digit sales growth. The sales trend in comp stores improved from the second quarter, decreasing modestly compared to last year. For the quarter, gross margin decreased 20 basis points to 39.7% compared to 39.9% last year. The decline was primarily due to deleverage of fixed costs and lower other revenue, which was partially offset by favorable channel mix due to lower e-commerce shipping costs and lower shrink. Lower revenue growth resulted in deleverage of store and supply chain fixed costs. Additionally, more new store openings and the expansion of our supply chain network pressured these areas. As a percentage of sales, inventory shrink was lower than last year. Our investments in secure fragrance fixtures combined with new inventory management processes and enhanced training for our field teams are helping us control inventory shrink. Year-to-date, shrink as a percentage of sales is roughly flat with last year, and we continue to expect shrink will be flat for the full year. Merchandise margin was flat with lower inventory reserves primarily related to the relaunch of Ulta Beauty Collection, offset by unfavorable brand mix. Moving to expenses. SG&A increased 3.2% to $682 million. Overall, SG&A spend was better than planned again this quarter, primarily due to focused expense management. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 40 basis points to 27% compared to 26.6% last year, reflecting lower top line growth, most expenses deleveraged this quarter. In addition, SG&A deleveraged primarily due to higher store payroll and benefits, primarily due to higher average wage rates and higher corporate overhead, primarily due to strategic investments. These pressures were partially offset by lower incentive compensation, reflecting operational performance that was below our internal targets. Depreciation was $67 million for the quarter compared to $61 million last year, primarily due to new store and supply chain investments. Operating profit decreased 2.7% to $318.5 million. As a percentage of sales, operating margin was 12.6% of sales compared to 13.1% of sales last year, and diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 1.4% to $5.14 compared to $5.07 last year. Moving to the balance sheet and our capital allocation priorities. We ended the quarter with $178 million in cash and cash equivalents and $200 million in short-term debt. Similar to third quarter last year, we drew on our revolving credit facility during the quarter to support working capital needs and ongoing capital allocation priorities, including share repurchases and capital expenditures. Total inventory increased 1.9% to $2.4 billion compared to $2.3 billion last year. The increase was primarily due to the impact of 63 net new stores. Year-to-date, through the third quarter, we generated $302 million in operating cash flow. Capital expenditures were $114 million for the quarter, primarily reflecting investments in new and existing stores, IT investments and merchandise fixtures. In the third quarter, we returned $267 million of capital to our shareholders through the repurchase of 731,000 shares. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.9 billion remaining under our $3 billion share repurchase program we announced at our investor meeting in October. Now turning to our outlook. We have refined our sales and EPS guidance for the fiscal -- for fiscal 2024 to reflect our third quarter results, while continuing to take a cautious view of the consumer and operating environment. We expect net sales for the year will be between $11.1 billion and $11.2 billion, with comp sales growth between negative 1% and flat. For the year, we continue to plan to open approximately 60 to 65 net new stores and remodel or relocate 40 to 45 stores. We expect operating margin will be between 12.9% and 13.1% of net sales, with deleverage to come from both gross margin and SG&A, reflecting our top line expectations. Reflecting these assumptions, we now expect diluted EPS for the year will be between $23.20 and $23.75. With one quarter left in the year, I want to share how we are thinking about Q4. While we are encouraged by our third quarter results and our performance quarter-to-date, we also acknowledge that the fourth quarter will likely be impacted by a compressed holiday season, a dynamic operating environment and continued uncertainty around underlying consumer demand. For Q4 modeling purposes, we expect comp sales will decline in the low single-digit range and operating margin will be between 11.6% and 12.4%. One final update. We have updated our capital expenditure expectations for the full year and now expect to spend between $400 million and $425 million in CapEx in fiscal 2024, including approximately $230 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $130 million for supply chain and IT, and about $50 million for store maintenance and others. In closing, we know it will take time to see the full benefits from our efforts, but we remain confident that our go-to-market strategies and investments along with continued operational and financial discipline will enable us to drive stronger sales and value creation over the long term. And now, I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. Sure. Good afternoon, Simeon. Yeah, so we raised our full year operating margin and EPS, reflecting Q3 performance and also ongoing expense discipline. What I would say as we think about kind of Q4, generally for the full year, we continue to expect gross margin deleverage, and when we think about Q4, reflecting the top line expectations in a competitive environment. Gross margin will continue to de-leverage. And really, the trends we've seen all year will continue. So, headwinds are the deleverage we expect to see from a fixed cost perspective, merchandise margin pressure will continue given promotions and category mix. And then our tailwinds, lower transportation costs, which we've been speaking about all year, we'll continue to provide some offsets to that. I would say from an SG&A perspective, we're expecting growth from a full year in the mid-single-digit range. But Q4, expecting that to be in the low single-digit growth range. We still expect or most of our expenses to deleverage on the lower sales. But we'll continue to maintain financial discipline as we have in Q3. And I think the second -- okay. Thank you. No, all good. Thank you, Simeon. Hi, Chris, thanks for the question. What I would say is we won't necessarily get into the details of specifically comp quarter-to-date. But what I will say is that, our holiday season is off to a solid start and our teams are executing well. We are encouraged by what we're seeing, but we also recognize that we have several important weeks ahead of us in the holiday season, even an operating environment is dynamic. And so that is why we shared that we're expecting Q4 comp sales to decline in the low single-digit range. So that's what we're thinking from a quarter perspective. And I would say, yeah, there is a component of the dynamic environment that is related to how consumers the fewer shopping days and things of that sort that we are obviously contemplating as we think about our expectations for Q4. As we think about 2025, again, still several important weeks left ahead of us, and we're focused on closing -- getting to a holiday strong and closing out the fiscal year strong. And we will provide additional color on 2025 when we provide our guidance in March, consistent with what we typically do. Now that being said, I would say directional color that we provided at our Investor Day remains the same. We expect 2024 and 2025 to be transitional period as we invest to reaccelerate our growth, and we continue to expect to make investments in 2025 that will position us for a stronger long term. but we will make decisions to enable -- to ensure that we're delivering operating margin at least above 11%. Sure. What I would say is UB Media, Emily, is contributing positively to gross margin in a way to think about it over time is that it plays in for role for us, and it will help offset some of the merchandise margin pressure. We currently see we have shared as we make certain investments in brand building and other things in 2025 and beyond that would serve to help offset some of those pressures. Yeah. And, Oliver, this is Paula. Given you asked a question about October and whether or not we were surprised. What I would say is now -- and we thought, Dave mentioned and we talked about the timing and some of our tent pole event. And so that had a role to play in kind of the by period performance in Q3. And then I think you had a question about leverage points, and we don't specifically disclose a specific point, and we've shared in the past one way to think about things is from a rent perspective, expense is around 4%. And so as you think about comp and total growth, maybe think about it in that perspective."

            "name": "Dave Kimbell",
            "content": "Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. Our team delivered improved performance for this quarter with better-than-expected sales and profitability. For the quarter, net sales increased 1.7% to $2.5 billion and comparable sales increased 0.6%. Diluted EPS increased 1.4% to $5.14 per share. As we shared on our last call, we are navigating a number of headwinds, including the normalization of the US beauty category, a dynamic consumer environment, and elevated competition, particularly in prestige beauty. We are starting to see benefit from actions we are taking to reinforce our market position and improve our performance. And while the headwinds have not abated, we are making progress. In the third quarter, our prestige market share trends improved, resulting in flat market share this quarter based on Circana data for the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024. The trend was driven primarily by improvements in makeup and hair, and we continue to see strength in fragrance and skin care. Our share performance in Mass Beauty was consistent with the second quarter. Comp growth improved from the second quarter trend, driven by stronger transaction trends across both stores and e-commerce channels. We continued to expand our loyalty program, ending the quarter with 44.4 million active members, 5% more than last year. We continued to convert new members, we reactivated more lapsed members, and we improved existing member retention. Our marketing strategies to support our tent pole events and drive relevance and buzz deliver double digit growth in earned media value and stronger sentiment. And we made progress to optimize our new ERP system and help our teams adapt to new processes, balance inventories across the network, and deliver a better guest experience. Our teams are working hard to strengthen our market position, and I want to thank all of our associates for continuing to deliver great guest experiences while working collaboratively to drive improved performance in a dynamic operating environment. Turning to performance by category. Fragrance was our strongest category, delivering high single-digit comp growth, driven by men's fragrance, gender-neutral fragrances, and new products, including new fall and holiday gift sets. The growth of men's fragrance was fueled primarily by newness from ARMANI and YSL and the appeal of established franchises from Jean Paul Gaultier and Valentino. Consumer interest in gender neutral scents is increasing and our assortment including Billie Eilish and NOYZ, an exclusive fragrance LUSH that's launched this summer, is driving guest engagement. New women's brands Kylie Jenner and Orebella, both exclusive to Ulta Beauty and new women's fragrances from Valentino, YSL, and NEST also contributed to overall category growth. The skincare category delivered mid-single-digit comp growth this quarter, as strong growth in body care was partially offset by a decline in prestige skin care. Mass skin care was flat. The strong performance of body care was driven in large part by newer brand Sol de Janeiro, which continues to engage guests with exciting innovation and exclusivity and Touchland, which introduced compelling newness. In prestige skin care, newness from brands OLEHENRIKSEN, Sacheu, DIME Beauty, and others resonated with guests, while engagement from Naturium, Bubble, and La Roche-Posay delivered growth in the mass skin care category. Comp sales in the makeup category decreased in the low single-digit range driven primarily by softness in mass makeup. Strong growth from recently relaunched Ulta Beauty Collection was offset by certain brands lapping space expansion, strong innovation or social media engagement last year. Prestige makeup was flat. New prestige brands Charlotte Tilbury, ILIA Beauty and DIBS Beauty resonated with guests and compelling product newness combined with in-store investments delivered growth for established brands MAC and Clinique. Promotional events during the quarter including 21 Days of Beauty and Fall Haul performed well, driving growth for several makeup brands, while our engaging Wicked collaboration was well received, highlighted by exclusive brand r.e.m. beauty. Comp sales for the hair care category also decreased in the low single-digit range. Exciting newness from Matrix, [Way] (ph), Divi, and Odele delivered growth for the category, while Redken continued to drive healthy guest engagement with their Hero product lines. In hair tools, new products from Shark Beauty and Dyson resonated with guests. This growth was offset by softness in key brands with expanded distribution and limited newness this year. Our services business delivered low single-digit comp growth, primarily driven by engagement in core services, including color, styling, and hair treatments. Ear piercing and makeup services also performed well. And our salon backbar takeovers, which get stylists an opportunity to introduce brands to guests, continued to drive product attachment, and new guest acquisition for participating brands. We are seeing improvements in our business, and we are focused on strengthening our market position and performance further. In October, we shared our refreshed strategic framework designed to lean into our existing strengths while also driving innovation to meet the evolving needs of beauty enthusiasts. As the beauty destination of a lifetime, we intend to drive profitable growth and market share leadership in beauty and wellness over the longer term through curating the best of all things beauty and wellness for all beauty enthusiasts, fostering authentic empowering human connections that inspire, delight and engage at every touch point, engaging our guests wherever they want to shop by expanding our reach through seamless and immersive omnichannel experiences, and building lifelong loyalty and brand love through member growth and personalization. We are confident our focus on these foundational areas will drive stronger revenue and earnings growth over the long term. And the near term, we are addressing key areas to reinforce our competitive position. Let me share some highlights of the progress made this quarter, starting with our efforts to strengthen our assortment. We are enhancing our brand portfolio to drive category growth. During the third quarter, we launched new makeup brands ILIA Beauty, DIBS Beauty, and RMS Beauty, as well as emerging skincare brand Oak Essentials. Additionally, we expanded our wellness offerings with emerging brands, The Honey Pot and Joylux. Looking ahead, we have an exciting pipeline of brand launches planned for the fourth quarter, including the recently announced prestige skincare brand, TATCHA, celebrated for balancing timeless Japanese botanicals with proven clinical ingredients, XO KHLOE, an exclusive fragrance brand created by Khloe Kardashian, and Apothekary, an emerging wellness brand. In addition to new brands, we launched two exciting exclusive collaborations this quarter. First, as the exclusive beauty retail partner with NBCUniversal Pictures for the movie Wicked, we worked with key brands to develop a limited edition collection of products across multiple price points and categories. The Wicked inspired collection features products from leading brands including r.e.m. beauty by Ariana Grande and Beekman 1802, both of which are exclusive to Ulta Beauty, as well as OPI and Scunci among others. With immersive in-store experiences and engaging displays, Wicked came to life in Ulta Beauty stores through our digital channels and through Ulta Beauty at Target. Second, we launched an exclusive and a disruptive beauty offering of the beloved Mini Brands, which offers miniature versions of popular consumer brands. This first ever Beauty Mini Brands collection includes 68 tiny replicas of best selling products from 13 brands, including e.l.f., NYX, Drybar, and Supergoop!. Both of these unique collaborations are driving strong sales, awareness, traffic, and engagement, especially with Gen Z millennial members. As we discussed at our recent Investor Day, engaging guest experiences drive differentiation, loyalty, and meaningful business value, and we are focused on creating authentic, personalized experiences across all our channels. In Q3 we hosted more than 13,000 in-store events including unique celebrity and brand founder events, multi-branded events, and skin care focused events. We also expanded our salon event, The Workshop, to more stores and invited guests to learn how to create salon-worthy blowouts while receiving customized coaching and personalized recommendations from our talented in-store stylists. We are enhancing our digital experiences to drive traffic and sales. During the quarter, key online activations drove guest engagement, and our expanded sampling program delivered double-digit sales growth. Our digital merchandising strategies, including enhanced search, guided navigation, and enriched product pages drove conversion, and our site optimization efforts are improving the guest experience and delivering stronger conversion trends. Importantly, we continued to drive increased app adoption. In the third quarter, we saw double-digit growth in member engagement with the app, which accounted for about two-thirds of our e-commerce sales in Q3, up about 600 basis points from last year. We continued to introduce new digital experiences and resources to drive discovery and trial. This quarter we enhanced our suite of virtual try-on and AI enabled skin and hair analysis experiences with the launch of GLAMlab 2.0 which includes a new 3D engine to enhance precision and stability, shoppable makeup looks, and a new user interface that includes sharing capabilities. We also launched new digital buying guides that amplify search engine optimization while providing guests with educational content, beauty tips, and product recommendations. To deepen the meaningful connection we have with beauty enthusiasts, we launched UB Community, a welcoming, inclusive, digital forum for guests to connect, learn, empower, and engage learn, empower, and engage in the immersive world of beauty to foster authentic connections. Launched in October, our community amplifies the intersection of beauty, wellness and joy, and our user count is already three times our initial target, confirming the meaningful role Ulta Beauty plays in our members' lives. With more than 44 million active members, Ulta Beauty Rewards is an unmatched strategic asset that provides us with unique consumer insights to drive sales. In Q3, we expanded personalization across digital channels with enhanced product recommendations, replenishment reminders, site experiences and retargeted and social channels. Leaning into targeted life cycle campaigns in both owned and paid channels, we reactivated members with greater efficiency. Additionally, we grew our platinum and diamond member base, leveraging unique incentives like exclusive and early access to key events and brand launches, gifting and personalized offers that drive engagement. Platinum and diamond members shop more frequently and spend more each visit and continue to retain at best-in-class rates. Increasingly, social relevance drives authentic customer connection and brand advocacy, especially in beauty, and we're evolving to position social at the center of our marketing strategies to accelerate browse and earned media value growth. During the third quarter, we leveraged our marketing and social capabilities to lean into emerging trends, amplify key growth brands and activate new trend-focused events. We also engage talent from our UB Collective, our affiliate program, and Ulta Beauties, our new associate ambassador program as well as key brand founders to support key brand launches, exclusive collaborations and tent pole events in new and innovative ways across social channels to drive guest buzz and engagement. Efforts delivered accelerated EMV growth, increased impression and expanded key brand health metrics. We continue to enhance our product capabilities to grow our retail media network, UB Media. We recently partnered with e-commerce tech company, Rocket, to introduce AI non-endemic ads for products and services outside the beauty category, and we are partnering with Roblox, the ultimate virtual universe to create innovative advertising opportunities for our partners. Over the years, our Ultaverse has grown into one of the largest beauty games on Roblox, attracting over 11 million visits. With growing interest from beauty brands to participate in our Ultaverse, we're unlocking new possibilities at the intersection of gaming, innovation and media to bring those brands to life in exciting new ways through our UB Media capabilities. Now leveraging lessons in the second quarter, we continue to evolve and tailor our promotional strategies to reiterate our value offering and drive sales and traffic. We began the quarter with a new hair event showcasing the glossy hair trend, replacing last year's fall Gorgeous Hair event, this event featured a strong promo offer, new and exclusive items from Dyson and a spotlight on gloss and shine products. Especially strong in stores, the new event exceeded our expectations and drove strong results for participating brands. At the end of August, we brought back our beloved 21 Days of Beauty event. New beauty steals, member-only events and bonus offers, combined with robust marketing and social support, 21 Days of Beauty delivered strong growth versus last year's event. We wrapped up the quarter with a successful Fall Haul event, which drove mass engagement and new member acquisition with compelling offers that surprised and delighted guests. In addition to strengthening and evolving our merchandising tent pole events, we optimized our loyalty offers, proactively planning the timing, type and target audience of these offers. As a result, our promotional effectiveness improved from the first half trend. Shifting now to our plans and expectations for holiday. The formal holiday season is in full flight. And while we're encouraged by our performance through Cyber Monday, we have several significant holiday sales weeks still ahead. While consumers continue to spend, our insights suggest that economic concerns are driving a greater focus on value. With our diverse assortment of products and price points, compelling offers and convenient omnichannel touch points, we are well positioned to support our guests as they celebrate the season and our teams are excited, engaged and ready to help them deliver a joyful holiday. Our holiday campaign this year is Find Joy in the Present, a reminder of the joy that comes not only from gifts of beauty, but from the big and small moments that drive authentic emotional connection. With the goal of driving deeper emotional engagement, our campaign is supported with robust integrated activation across media, member marketing, PR and social channels as well as festive experiences in stores and on our digital platforms. We have strategies in place to fortify our competitive positioning and manage through the compressed holiday selling season. We are transforming our channels into a concierge for all things holiday, providing greater value to consumers with real-time beauty solutions, gift guides and tips tailored to our guests' needs and creating fun experiences that drive awareness and make Ulta Beauty the go-to destination for the holidays. Our merchandising team has created an exciting holiday assortment, with a strong focus on newness and exclusives balanced with value-driven holiday kits and core items that make great gifts. Whether guests wants to gift others or treat themselves, we have thoughtfully curated options across every category and budget. Our corporate and supply chain teams have been working hard all year to ensure Ulta Beauty is ready to bring our guests joy this holiday season. And our store teams are ready to bring the holiday to life for our guests, with new in-store events and demonstrations to build guest connection and drive sales and traffic. And with BOPIS, same-day delivery options and new for this holiday, our participation in DoorDash and soon-to-be launched Instacart marketplaces, it's never been easier or more convenient to shop at Ulta Beauty. With our engaging holiday messaging, incredible holiday assortment, knowledgeable associates ready to provide guidance and recommendations, new innovative digital tools and multiple ways to shop, I am confident we are well positioned to deliver another successful holiday season. In summary, I am encouraged by the improving trends we are seeing in the business and optimistic about our holiday plans. We believe the beauty category will remain resilient, and we are confident the actions we are taking to deliver stronger performance combined with our outstanding associates who are committed to offering guests authentic inclusive experiences across all of our touch points will enable us to reinforce our market position and drive long-term profitable growth. Now, before Paula discusses our financial results, I want to share that Monica Arnaudo, Chief Merchandising Officer, has announced her plan to retire from Ulta Beauty in the spring of 2025. Since joining Ulta Beauty in 2017, Monica has built an outstanding team and elevated our assortment in ways that have helped us deliver remarkable sales and market share growth, while furthering our mission to be our guests' most loved beauty destination. I want to thank Monica for everything she has contributed as a member of our executive team and for the impact she has had on our organization. While we work to identify Monica's successor, she is fully committed to supporting her team and Ulta Beauty with a successful transition. And now, I will turn the call over to Paula for a discussion of the financial results. Paula? Great. Thanks, Simeon, and happy holidays to you as well. I'll start with just the broader competitive and promotional landscape. And Paula, you can pick up on some of the margin specific areas. So for the third quarter, what -- as we -- as I mentioned in the remarks, we continue to see this is an intensely competitive time frame. And we've been managing and discussing that throughout the year. We feel like our actions, the adjustments we made in the third quarter helped us improve our performance, strengthen our performance, but we also recognize we have more work ahead of us. The dynamics in the marketplace continue, particularly in the prestige space, but we're seeing progress. And our unique proposition, the aspects that only Ulta delivers through our assortment, our loyalty program, our points of presence, the experience we deliver have always been key to our business and continue to be core drivers. Promotionally, what we experienced in the third quarter was continued normalization after some reduced promotion coming right out of COVID. So we anticipated that coming into Q3 -- coming into this year. We saw that in Q3. Our promotional rates in Q3 were lower than Q2, but still somewhat higher than last year. But as I mentioned in the remarks, our efforts to adjust our promotional strategy to lean in and amplify our tent-pole events, made our overall efforts more effective leveraging our CRM program and our personalization efforts are driving the business. As we look into the holiday, it is obviously a very promotional time frame, the most promotional time frame. That's certainly true this year. And as we navigate through and share our fourth quarter results, we'll have reflections on the overall dynamics, but we're anticipating continued promotional intensity, but not significantly outside of what we would expect so far this holiday. Paula, do you want to talk about that? Great. Well, thanks, Kelly. Yeah, let's see, starting with prestige makeup, obviously, an important category, our largest category. And I'd start with saying, overall, we're pleased in the third quarter that prestige makeup was flat for the quarter for us, which was improvement from some of the trends. The drivers behind that are our innovation that we continue to launch brands like ILIA coming into our portfolio, strong execution across our key programs like 21 Days of Beauty, which is focused on prestige and make up, of course, is the highlight of that, and real emphasis on some of our core brands like the Clinique and MAC and other strong performing brands that we've been working closely with to ensure we're delivering for our guests and our guests respond well to them. And so we're really -- we've been focused on this category for a long time to strengthen its performance and we're really pleased that it was able -- that we were able to do that. Overall, in the category, we saw the category, the total prestige makeup category a bit more than us in low single-digits. So we saw pressure share, although our share performance, while still pressured, improved from the second quarter. So we're making headway, and we're pleased with that. Overall, on the competitive environment, you asked about competitive openings. As we've been talking about throughout the year, that's certainly a meaningful dynamic as there's been more than 1,000 new points of distribution in prestige beauty that over the last couple of years. And that has been a pressure. I shared in previous discussions that 80% of our stores have experienced at least one competitive opening and more than half have had multiple competitive openings, and that continues to be a dynamic that's going on in the marketplace. Having said that, we're confident in the actions that we're taking. We know we've seen historically new store openings. We're able to absorb the shorter-term hit, but then turn our stores back into positive contributors to our business over the long term. This is a different dynamic given the scale, just the sheer number of new stores opening in a short period of time. But we're confident in our ability to do that. We did see improvements in Q3 that contributed to the stronger performance we had in Q3 in total versus Q2. So we feel like we saw some headway in that. But we're not -- but it's we're still in the midst of it. And so by no means are we claiming that we're through it. We've got more work to do. We're working through the dynamics. And our focus there is continue to do what we do best, lean into our strengths in our stores and online and all of our experiences that activity, those things that I highlighted on earlier are what helped us make progress this quarter and other things that are going to drive us into 2025 as we continue to strengthen our business. Happy holidays. Well, yes. Thanks, Korinne. The -- I'll start with saying that beauty is a very attractive category. And so we've talked many times about the fact that anybody in beauty, whether in the mass side, prestige side, luxury is emphasizing the category, investing in the category and that's been going on across all of our competitors. In the mass specific business, yeah, that -- the total mass business continues to perform in that mid-single-digit range for the quarter in total mass. And it's an important category for us. As you know, one of the key differentiators of our business is strength in mass and [mass] (ph) and prestige and luxury. And so we continue to be focused on our mass business and the important role that it plays. So that we're well aware of the dynamics. We have seen mass makeup as a category -- cost of category decelerate. Certainly, there's brands that are stronger, but the total category has been more pressured, but we're seeing strength -- continued strength in mass skin, which is an important business for us. So we're focused on continuing to drive our mass business and make sure we're delivering the assortment that we know our guests love the ability to engage with us across all price points and continue to be confident in our ability to excite them and engage them in our mass business. Great. Thanks, Anthony. Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't point to one thing. There was not one thing that ever really drives our business. And we talked about coming out of the second quarter. While we're pleased with some aspects of our business, we were clear on areas that we needed to address, and we leaned into several of the key factors. Assortment is always critical. Bringing in newness, some of the brands I highlighted like ILIA into the quarter played an important role. The collaborations that you mentioned also drove excitement and enthusiasm. Assortment is always a key driver and certainly was in the third quarter. Our promotional effectiveness, we had some learnings in the second quarter as we were faced with more pressure sales, how we adapted our promotional environment. We had learnings there that we built from into the third quarter. Leaning in, strengthening our core tent pole events that our guests value from Ulta Beauty, 21 Days of Beauty, our hair brand and Fall Haul as well as smart, purposeful targeted and effective complementary promotions throughout the quarter in a very personalized. So that drove a strong effectiveness. We worked hard throughout the quarter. Our teams across the organization, store teams, for sure supply chain, our IT teams, our digital teams to make sure we were delivering a great experience to improve conversion, and we're pleased that we were able to do that both in store and strong performance online. And that took a holistic effort with making sure we have strong engagement from our store associates and strong execution online. And we also -- the last thing I'd mention is we highlighted in the second quarter, some disruption from some system changes and we made improvements in that space to make sure our products were where they needed to be. So multiple elements contributed. It was a really holistic effort across the organization, and we're pleased. Having said that, we know we've got more work to do. We're -- while we're pleased with the sequential improvement, we are focused on stronger improvement over time as we move both through the holiday period and into 2025 and beyond. So we'll continue to lean into all of those things and the broader strategies that we went through in a lot of detail at our Investor Day in October. Great. Thanks, Emily. Yes, the -- we think we're very optimistic and excited about the role that UB Media is and will play on our business going forward. As you suggest, we have a real competitive opportunity because of the scale and the breadth of our business, the data that we have, the understanding of beauty engagement and transactions across really all beauty enthusiasts of all ages and all geographies is really unmatched. And so we've worked hard to deliver an experience for our brand partners that adds value and most importantly, adds strong ROI in their media investments and the growth that we've seen in that business reinforces that we're able to do that. We're -- as we did talk about at our Investor Day, continued investment and capabilities. I highlighted a couple of those capabilities on the call earlier today related to roadblocks and other ways that we can further give our brands opportunities. But because of the brand relationships that we have and the role that we play in the category, we are confident that our opportunity to grow this business, continue to grow this business over time will be will be a positive impact on the business. Paula, do you want to talk about the financial impact? Thank you. Oliver, let's see. So first on long-term growth, what's going to deliver positive comps. I guess I would go back to what we talked about in detail at our Investor Day. We really see a combination of leaning in and reinforcing our established strengths as well as innovating across our entire ecosystem as key contributors to our performance. We talked about four key pillars or platforms assortment, having the best assortment across beauty and wellness experience, delighting our guests in every touch point that we have access, continuing to expand our availability, both with stores, accelerated new store openings as well as strong online expressions and then, of course, loyalty and building brand love. We're really focused on driving innovation across each of those and making sure that we're ready to do that. And what we -- what I talked about in an earlier question, that contributed to the third quarter improvement versus the second quarter. It's the foundation. It's the fundamentals. It's the core things, Oliver, you know about our business having tracked us for a long time. When assortment is stronger and experience is right and our loyalty is working and our touch points are driving both in-store and online, those are the things that will come together. So much -- really all of it, we just shared a couple of months ago, those are the aspects that will drive our business going forward. Thanks, Oliver. Well, let's see. So, on the -- where we've seen engagement, yeah, you highlighted an important part of our business, which is what we call our lead guest, our Platinum and our Diamond members. And we're pleased that we continue to see strong performance from them, high engagement, high spend, they are obviously our best guest. But we're seeing that across the board, and it's something we've been focused on to continue to grow our business. Our loyalty program in total was up 5% for the quarter, and that was a combination of attracting new members as one of the things we talked about in October was even though we've had a lot of growth in that -- in our loyalty program over time, we still see a lot of opportunity ahead, and we're continuing to attract new members and bring them into our business. And that, of course, is important fuel for future growth. We also had success reactivating lapsed members, a lapsed member is somebody that has a -- is part of the program but hasn't purchased with us for the at least once in the last 12 months. And we have a very focused CRM personalized program going after that group, and we continue to see success with that. And then our retention is strong. There is an intense competitive environment, but our guests continue to demonstrate that they like what Ulta is offering. And so retention remains healthy. And so those things come together. We're seeing it across all ages, all geographies, strength across all types of beauty enthusiasts, which is an important part of our business. Competitively, you asked about the dynamics there. And I continue to say something that we've shared in the past is, it's difficult for us to exactly predict or lay out when we would see us completely moving through this because we've never experienced the scale of this in such a concentrated period of time. Having said that, I'll reiterate something I mentioned earlier, which is we have confidence. We've seen it in the data before new store openings. Our stores are able to recover and return to strong contributors. The data that we see now, stores that have not been impacted by competitive opening continue to perform better and positively, and we saw improved performance in Q3. But I would not take that fully as a, okay, we're through 100% through it, and it's totally behind us. This is a meaningful disruption in the category. We're learning every period. What -- how the dynamics are evolving, but we did make progress in Q3, and it's our focus to continue to do that as we move into 2025. All right. So with that, thank you all. I will wrap up. Thank you for joining us today. So, I want to close out by thanking our more than 55,000 Ulta Beauty associates working together in our stores, in our distribution centers and across our entire corporate team. I sincerely appreciate their continued focus and commitment to delivering unique and memorable guest experiences across all our channels. So, as we close, I want to wish you all a happy and healthy holiday season. There's still time to get out and shop at Ulta Beauty. So make sure you put that into your holiday shopping plans, and we look forward to speaking to you again when we report results for fiscal 2024 on March 13. Have a great evening. Thank you all."

Dave?\nDave Kimbell: Thank you, Kylie, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. For the quarter, net sales increased 0.9% to $2.6 billion and comparable sales decreased 1.2%. Operating profit was 12.9% of sales and diluted EPS was $5.30 per share. Although, we anticipated the headwinds experienced in the first quarter would continue, our results were short of our expectations, driven by a decrease in comp store sales, specifically comp store transactions. E-commerce sales increased as expected. We do not believe these results reflect the strong engagement with our brand, the strength of our operating model, or the performance I know we can deliver over the longer term. Importantly, we are clear about the factors that adversely impacted our store transaction growth in the second quarter, and we have actions underway to address the trends. We attribute the decline in comp store transactions to four factors. First, while the beauty category remains resilient, growth is normalizing after three years of unprecedented gains. Additionally, consumer behavior is starting to shift as consumers increasingly focus on value and become more cautious with their spending. Based on data from Circana, U.S. beauty growth slowed to approximately 3% through the first half of 2024, with prestige beauty experiencing high-single digit growth and mass beauty maintaining low-single digit growth. Second, competitive intensity in the beauty category remains high. As we have shared previously, the strength of the beauty category, combined with an attractive margin profile, has drawn substantial and diverse competition to the category. Today, there are significantly more places to buy beauty, especially prestige beauty, with more than 1,000 new points of distribution opened in the last three years. As a result, our market share continues to be challenged, particularly within prestige beauty. Based on Circana data for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024, we maintained our share in Mass Beauty, but lost share in the beauty -- prestige beauty, particularly driven by makeup and hair categories. We know beauty enthusiasts love to shop for beauty, and they love Ulta Beauty and the unique experiences we offer. But they also love engaging in new beauty offerings. As a result, we often see a short-term impact of new distribution points on an existing nearby store, whether it's a competitor opening or a new Ulta Beauty store. What is unique about the current environment is the scale and pace of change. More than 80% of our stores have been impacted by one or more competitive opening in recent years, with more than half impacted by multiple competitive openings. This significant portion of our store fleet is experiencing a prolonged sales impact. Notably, the positive signals we see in our broader business reinforce the appeal of our differentiated model and our confidence that we will mitigate these near-term competitive pressures. Our brand awareness and brand love continue to increase with strong gains across multiple demographics, demonstrating the broad appeal of our unique, All Things Beauty, All In One Place offering. We continue to attract new and lapsed members to our loyalty program, while maintaining strong retention of our existing members. At the end of the second quarter, we had 43.9 million active Ulta Beauty Rewards members, 5% more than last year. Importantly, we continue to experience healthy growth in our platinum and diamond members. Newness continues to resonate with guests and drive growth. Newer brands, including Sol de Janeiro, Charlotte Tilbury, and OLEHENRIKSEN are driving sales, new member acquisition and member reengagement while newness from a variety of existing brands, including Clinique, Way and PEACH & LILY are driving healthy comp growth. Guests continue to engage with our unique in-store services offering, which delivered mid-single digit growth in the quarter. And new stores continue to perform well. During the quarter, we opened 17 stores, including our 1,400 store and their performance was in line with our expectations. Now we've disrupted the beauty category for more than 30 years and we understand how to successfully manage competitive forces. To reinforce our competitive position and drive stronger performance, we are aggressively taking actions across five areas: strengthening our assortment, expanding our social relevance, enhancing our digital experience, leveraging our powerful loyalty program, and evolving our promotional levers. I will discuss each of these areas in detail shortly. Now in addition to these external factors, we experienced unanticipated operational disruption during the quarter, resulting from the completion of our ERP transformation. In March, we began updating key store systems through a thoughtful and controlled implementation plan. And in July, we finished the migration of all of our stores to our new ERP platform. We are pleased to have successfully completed this important phase, but we have experienced some unexpected operational challenges as our teams have adjusted to new capabilities, new processes, and new ways of working associated with the new systems. Specifically, through the transition, our teams were managing portions of our fleet on both the old and new systems, which led to some store inventory allocation disruption. With all of our stores and DCs now operating on the same core systems, we are shifting from implementation to system optimization and are working quickly to help our teams navigate these new ways of working in order to balance inventories across the network and deliver an optimized guest experience. To minimize future disruption, we have identified key legacy processes that are creating friction and implemented proactive monitoring as well as dedicated support to quickly address issues when they arise. I am confident that our new capabilities will support better, more agile decision-making in the future. And I'm grateful for our collective team's hard work and dedication to manage through this critical transformation. The fourth factor impacting our performance this quarter was the effect of incremental promotions, which did not deliver the expected sales lift. As the top line trends softened in late June and July, we executed incremental promotions to drive revenue. These offers drove strong sales and traffic across our digital platforms, but did not deliver the expected incrementality in stores. The increased frequency of offers, combined with the introduction of new offer structures, put pressure on average selling price without activating incremental purchases in stores. We understand why the incremental promotions did not deliver as expected and will apply these learnings as we manage promotional activity in the second half. Turning now to performance by category. Fragrance delivered double-digit growth, driven by strong guest engagement with Mother's Day and exciting newness. Newness from existing brands, including Valentino, YSL, and Burberry as well as new brands, NOYZ, Orebella and Kylie Jenner, all of which are exclusive to Ulta, contributed to the category's growth. Our exciting Mother's Day gift with purchase offers and gift sets fueled strong guest engagement and our unique assortment of gift sets for Father's Day and back-to-school also delivered growth for the category. The skin care category delivered mid-single digit comp growth this quarter driven by strong growth in Body Care. Sol de Janeiro continues to excite guests, and this quarter, we introduced an exclusive body mist, which is resonating well. Reflecting the appeal of dermatologist recommended brands and favorite La Roche-Posay and new brands, PanOxyl and VANICREAM delivered strong growth. And relevant mass brands, including Bubble and BIOMA continued to engage guests. Overall, prestige skincare was pressured as engaging newness from PEACH & LILY and OLEHENRIKSEN was offset by softness from certain brands impacted by increased distribution or the lapping of strong social media engagement last year. Comp sales in the makeup category decreased mid-single digit range. Among new brands, Charlotte Tilbury, Polite Society, and WYN BEAUTY as well as exclusive newness from Clinique delivered strong growth. This growth was more than offset by sales decreases from existing brands that had newness that did not meet expectations or have experienced increased points of distribution in the market. In Mass makeup, e.l.f., about-face, and Milani delivered strong growth, but this growth was mitigated by planned softness in Ulta Beauty Collection as we prepared for the brand relaunch. Comp sales for the hair care category decreased in the high-single digit range, driven primarily by planned promotional shift. As we shared previously, we incorporated prestige hair care offers in our first quarter semi-annual beauty sale and eliminated our Gorgeous Hair event, which took place in May of last year. In addition, the impact of exciting newness from Wahl, Divi and Odele and strong engagement with Redken was offset by pressure from key brands lapping strong newness last year. As I mentioned at the outset, we are focused on five key areas to reinforce our competitive position. And we are pleased with the progress we've made in many areas and have identified further opportunities to shift our momentum. Starting with our efforts to strengthen our assortment. During the quarter, we continued to enhance our brand portfolio with new engaging brands, including Orebella, Naturium and Naked Sundays while also launching several emerging exclusive prints through our Spark program, including Door, a clean French beauty inspired skincare brand; Magic Molecule, a skincare healing brand; and NOYZ of premium gender-neutral fragrance. We also expanded the key growth driving brands like Sol de Janeiro, MAC, and Kiehl's into additional stores. Looking ahead, we have an exciting pipeline of brand launches planned for the balance of the year, including the recently announced ILIA Beauty, a clean skin centric prestige makeup brand; and DIBS Beauty, a multipurpose easy-to-use makeup brand. In addition to enhancing our assortment with compelling newness, we are focused on building greater awareness and engagement with key exclusive brands, including PEACH & LILY, Polite Society, WYN BEAUTY, and LolaVie, while also collaborating closely with strategic legacy brands to drive stronger growth and profitability. I'm excited to share that we have relaunched Ulta Beauty Collection to inspire beauty discovery, celebrate self-expression, and create a deeper emotional connection with guests. With simplified and good-for-you formulas, the new collection includes refreshed fan favorites as well as new innovations that reflect modern trends across skin care, body care, bath, suncare and cosmetics. Certified with clean ingredients and cruelty free products across the entire assortment, the reimagined collection is positioned at a masstige price point and is designed to make beauty discovery purposeful and accessible for beauty enthusiasts of all ages. While the new assortment has only been available for a few weeks and is still ramping up as we roll out additional SKUs, we are pleased with our early results. Social relevance powers customer connection and loyalty. To accelerate our social relevance and enhance our brand awareness, we have scaled our creator and influencer networks, and we are expanding our culture forward activations to ensure we are at the heart of the social and cultural conversation for beauty. As a result, this quarter, we delivered meaningful growth and earned media value and social sentiment and drove more than 250 million social impressions. During the quarter, we doubled the size of our influencer network to include a double -- a diverse range of influencers across key audience segments to reflect our inclusive audience targeting strategy. We also launched Ulta Beauties, our new associated ambassador program to harness the superpowers of our team and highlight the expertise and passion of our talented associates. As a group, these talented creators developed compelling content in support of our big summer Beauty sale, back-to-school, and the Joy project, which increased our EMV by more than 10% this quarter. Additionally, we launched a new affiliate program, UB Creates to drive traffic and conversion. Last year, we launched the Joy project, a multiyear initiative to make Beauty and the world a more joyful place. In celebration of National Day of Joy, we kicked off the second chapter of our Joy project with the launch of a social movement to spark positivity in the beauty space, partnering with brands, celebrities and creators as well as our own UB collective and UB beauties, our viral complement chain reached more than 260 million people and generated meaningful growth in EMV. To continue to expand our social relevance, we plan to deploy amplification and content strategies in the second half, leading into trend in cultural moments, leveraging our expanded creator network and enhancing brand partner activations. Leveraging new capabilities, we are enhancing our digital experiences to drive traffic and sales. During the quarter, we enhanced search and filtering functionality and make it easier for guests to find what they want quickly. And we streamlined the path to purchase with a new quick add-to-bag feature, making it more convenient for guests to add products to their cart. And to facilitate greater basket building, we introduced new personalized product recommendations and additional upsell placements along the guest purchasing journey. Importantly, we continue to drive increased app adoption through associate engagement, targeted communications, and app-only offers. In the second quarter, member engagement with our app increased 16%. And now our app accounts for about two-thirds of our e-commerce sales, 600 basis points higher than last year. While the app is a vital tool to drive e-commerce sales, the majority of our spend from app users actually incurs in store, making the app another key engagement tool to drive sales per member. As we look forward, we will continue to create and apply new digital features and functionality to give our guests new and more convenient ways to discover, transact and engage with Ulta Beauty. With more than 44 million active members, our loyalty program is a strategic asset that provides us with unique insights across categories, price points and channels and enables us to drive traffic and spend per member. To drive deeper connection and greater awareness, we are amplifying the value of our rewards program through member-only events, social engagement, and marketing activations. In May, we launched Member Love, a member only event of enticing category focused points offers, which delivered healthy member engagement and higher spend per member. And in July, we launched our first member tiered offer to drive traffic, new member acquisition, and member reactivations. In addition to targeted events and communications, we have integrated our rewards program into our digital experience, MAGs and tentpole events to drive engagement and reinforce the value of the program. Looking ahead, we are focused on attracting customer segments to drive new member growth, driving differentiated engagement early in the life cycle to enhance retention, and leveraging our extensive member data to accelerate traffic. Finally, we continue to evolve our promotional strategies to drive traffic and sales. Supported by a robust media strategy, in-store amplification, and engaging social content, we enhanced our big summer Beauty sale event with compelling offers across categories and price points. In addition to driving strong sales, the event delivered growth in new members and member reactivation as well as increased penetration of existing members. And always a fan favorite, we're excited to kick off 21 Days of Beauty with a new look, new beauty steals and unique events for our best members. As the competitive and promotional environment evolves, we will apply the learnings I mentioned earlier and leverage our member insights to execute productive, targeted offers while eliminating less effective promotions and applying new capabilities to create engaging events for our guests. In closing, Ulta Beauty remains a key beauty destination with strong consumer awareness and brand love. And our exceptional teams are committed to offering guests unique inclusive beauty experiences across all of our touch points. We are confident we have identified the factors that impacted our performance in the second quarter and are focused on the right actions to deliver stronger performance. As we turn to the second half of the year, our teams are focused on driving stronger sales and traffic, executing with excellence for our guests, exercising financial discipline as we adapt to a more challenging operating environment, and protecting and cultivating our unique culture, driven by our talented and passionate associates. While it will take time to shift the top line trend, I remain extremely confident in our model and in our ability to execute and win in an increasingly competitive category. And now, I will turn the call over to Paula for a discussion of the financial results and outlook. Paula?\nPaula Oyibo: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin with a discussion of our second quarter financial results and then provide more color on our updated outlook. We faced greater-than-expected challenges in the second quarter, resulting in overall financial performance that were below our expectations. Sales growth from comp stores was softer than expected and gross margin was pressured by incremental promotional offers. However, our teams exercised financial discipline, and we took swift actions to mitigate impacts of the top line trend. Net sales for the quarter increased 0.9%, solid new store performance from 49 net new stores and a 12% increase in other revenue, primarily due to an increase in credit card income and growth in royalty income from our target partnership was partially offset by a 1.2% decline in comparable sales. During the quarter, we opened 17 new stores, closed one store, remodeled nine stores and relocated one store. The comp sales decline was driven by a 1.8% decline in transactions, which was partially offset by a 0.6% increase in average ticket. The increase in average ticket reflects growth in average selling price per item, offset by lower average unit per transaction. Looking at the cadence of sales. Net sales trends decelerated as we moved through the quarter, with July being our most challenged period. Comp store sales climbed in the low-single digit rate, primarily driven by a decrease in store transactions. Average ticket also decreased. Our digital channel performance was stronger with e-commerce sales increasing in the low-single digit range. Across digital channels, the sales trends accelerated as we moved through the quarter, with incremental promotional activity driving stronger guest engagement particularly in July. For the quarter, gross margin decreased 100 basis points to 38.3% compared to 39.3% last year. The decline was primarily due to lower merchandise margin and deleverage of store fixed costs, which were partially offset by growth in other revenues and lower shrink. Merchandise margin declined primarily due to increased promotional activity, adverse impact from brand mix and the continued lapping of benefits from price increases last year. While the impact of promotional activity was higher than planned, it was well below 2019 levels. Store fixed costs also delevered driven by lower top line growth and more net new store openings. As a percentage of sales, inventory shrink was lower in the quarter. We completed the rollout of our new fragrance fixtures to all stores and introduced an additional fixture to protect our assortment of popular smaller rollerball fragrances. These investments are having a meaningful impact on fragrance test, and we expect the additional fixtures will support a continuation of the trend. In addition, we continue to increase our ORC focus and have deployed new tools, capabilities and training to our store and field loss prevention teams. Year-to-date, shrink as a percentage of sales is flat with last year, and we continue to expect shrink will be roughly flat for the full year. Moving to expenses. SG&A increased 7.3% to $645 million. Overall, SG&A spend was better than planned again this quarter, primarily due to focused expense management. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 160 basis points to 25.3% compared to 23.7% last year. Reflecting lower top line growth, most expenses deleveraged this quarter. In addition, we preserved sales driving expenses, including store labor and marketing, and completed key elements of our transformational agenda this quarter. These pressures were partially offset by lower incentive compensation, reflecting operational performance that was below our internal target. Operating margin was 12.9% of sales compared to 15.5% of sales last year. And diluted GAAP earnings per share was $5.30 compared to $6.02 last year. Moving to the balance sheet and capital allocation priorities. We ended the quarter with $414 million in cash and cash equivalents. Total inventory increased 10.1% to $2 billion compared to $1.8 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 49 net new stores, the increase was primarily due to inventory to support new brands and the opening of our new market fulfillment center in Greer, South Carolina, which opened in the third quarter last year. Year-to-date, through the second quarter, we generated $359 million in operating cash flow. Capital expenditures were $95 million for the quarter, primarily reflecting investments in new and existing stores, IT investments, and merchandise fixtures. Depreciated was $65 million compared to $62 million last year, primarily due to higher depreciation related to new stores and IT investments. In the second quarter, we returned $212 million of capital to our shareholders through the repurchase of 550,000 shares. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.6 billion remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization. Now turning to our outlook. We have taken a more cautious view for the year. We now expect net sales for the year will be between $11 billion and $11.2 billion, with comp sales in the range of down 2% to flat. In addition to reflecting our first half performance, our updated outlook for sales assumes it will take more time for our actions to change the top line trajectory, and that stores impacted by multiple competitive openings will continue to be pressured more than the rest of the fleet. The operating environment remains dynamic, and the low end of our range implies incremental pressure on consumer spending. For the year, we expect operating margin will be between 12.7% and 13% of net sales. Most of the reduction in our expectation for operating margin compared to our previous view is due to the lower top line. But we have also included flexibility to respond to the evolving promotional environment. For the year, we expect gross margin will deleverage 70 basis points to 90 basis points as lower merchandise margin and deleverage of store fixed costs are partially offset by other revenue growth and lower transportation costs. For the year, we expect SG&A expense will increase in the mid-single digit range. We expect many of the trends we experienced in the first half will continue in the second half, with SG&A driving most of the operating margin deleverage. Reflecting these assumptions, we now anticipate diluted EPS will be in the range of $22.60 to $23.50 per share. We continue to expect to generate strong operating cash flow for the year, which will support our planned CapEx investments of $400 million to $450 million and share repurchases of $1 billion. In closing, we are focused on improving performance in the second half, and we believe our newness and go-to-market strategies, along with continued operational and financial discipline will enable us to navigate the dynamic environment and drive improved sales and profit momentum over time. And now, I'll turn the call over to our operator to moderate the Q&A section. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Forbes: Good evening, Dave, Paula. Dave, I was hoping you could expand on the competitive pressures you noted in the prepared remarks. Any way to help us contextualize the size of this headwind such as year one cannibalization rates, and any early insights on the recovery path? Meaning, what does the recovery for those stores impacted look like? And maybe you can give us an example of some of those earlier stores that were impacted, any time frame to sort of get back to those prior levels pre cannibalization? Thank you.\nDave Kimbell: Great. Thanks for the question, Steve. And yeah, let me just start with saying, we -- of course, we're no strangers to competition. We know how to compete effectively. And this is, as I said in the remarks, a very attractive category that continues to increase in the competitive environment. As it relates to increased points of pressure, what we've shared before is that we have historically seen a short-term impact on new distribution points on our existing store when a competitor opens near one of our stores. What's unique about this time in this environment is the scale and the pace of change, which is it made it difficult for us to fully forecast the cumulative impact. 88% (ph) of our stores have been impacted by one -- at least one store. And as I said in the remarks, more than half of our stores have been impacted by multiple competitive openings, which to give you context of what that means is, if you take a single Ulta Beauty store, two or more competitive stores have opened within that store's trade area, which is unusual for us historically and something that we're navigating through. What we saw during this quarter is that stores that have had multiple competitive openings, which again could happen over the -- at different times over the three years that we've been navigating, as those stores with multiple competitive openings are underperforming those stores with no or limited competitive impact. Stores that have -- the segment of stores that have not had a direct in-market trade area competitive impact delivered positive comps for the quarter, which is another reason that we feel confident in our model, in our business, in our guest engagement. Stores that have just one competitive opening that occurred early in the expansion cycle are performing in line with historical trends, another data point that gives us confidence as we look forward. But we know we're still in the midst of this. Stores have opened aggressively over the last couple of years. These competitive pressures will likely continue into the near term. But the positive signals I highlighted in our broader business, the guest engagement, the impact of newness, the impact of our new stores, the success of our salon business, the loyalty growth, all of those factors suggest to us and give us a lot of confidence that our business continues to have underlying strength in health and we're navigating through this short term. We know it will take time, but we are not sitting still and we're aggressively taking actions across all the things that I highlighted in the prepared remarks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nAmy Teske: Hi. Good afternoon. This is Amy Teske on for Mark. With the demand backdrop continuing to be pressured, can you talk more about the actions you were taking within SG&A to limit the amount of deleverage you're seeing in the model? Thank you.\nKecia Steelman: Sure. Thank you. Thank you, Amy. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we did deliver better than planned SG&A due to focused and disciplined cost management as we navigated our top line pressures. As we think about the second half, we've planned SG&A expenses to increase in the mid-single digit range for the year, reflecting a more moderated growth in the second half. We continue to exercise financial discipline as we navigate these near-term pressures, while still making sure that we're investing and ensure we're well positioned for success over the long term. But as we look ahead, we're expecting that moderation in SG&A growth because we are completing our transformation, many of our transformational investments are completing. And we will continue to, like I said, exercise financial discipline as we navigate.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lasser: Good evening. Thank you so much for taking my question. Given the competitive overlap with all these new points of distribution is not going to go away anytime soon, how long do you expect that it will take to restore the business to positive comps? And since it seems that hitting the promotional lever is not having the intended impact, what is the backup plan or what is the alternative if the actions you are taking don't work to restore positive comps? Thank you.\nDave Kimbell: Thanks, Michael. Yes, it is, as we've discussed, a dynamic and competitive environment that we're navigating through, and I gave you some of those dynamics in my prepared remarks. We are -- and as I said, we remain confident and bullish in the long-term outlook for this business because of all the positives that I've highlighted. We're executing across a number of efforts to drive our business. Here's what I know about our business right now. We are seeing many positive signals that are gaining traction, and we're addressing areas that maybe are not working as well as we had hoped. Assortment is always key. So when we look at key levers, assortment is critical. Newness is working and resonating with our guests, brands like So de Janeiro, Charlotte, OLEHENRIKSEN are driving sales. Our new -- our exclusive brands are playing an important role, and we continue to add brands, Naturium in Q2. And tomorrow, we launch ILIA, an important makeup brand that we're excited to add to our assortment. So continued innovation is a key lever for us that's working, and we'll continue to drive that. I talked about the importance of marketing and social relevance and connecting, deepening brand love. We're pleased with the progress, all-time high of brand love and brand awareness. And we'll continue to drive that because we know that drives connection and awareness and reinforces the role that we play in our guests' lives. Our digital business is critical. And I shared that our digital sales were on expectation, and we're focused on delivering across all of the experiences, you know that we've invested heavily in our digital capabilities over the last couple of years. Earlier this year, we completed our new digital store platform, and that's giving us new ways to delight our guests. And that's working, and we'll be focused on driving that. Loyalty is core to our long-term success. We're pleased with the 5% year-over-year growth, high level of retention, high level of engagement from a best guest, our platinum and diamond guests and a critical part of that business going forward. Services and experience is also driving positive. Promo is an important piece of our business, and I'm glad you highlighted it. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, some of the incremental offers that we added as our performance decelerated in the second half of the quarter did not have the intended effect in -- particularly in our store channel. Promos, generally though, our tent pole events, I mentioned our big summer Beauty sale. Tomorrow, we launch 21 Days of Beauty. Our big promotional events are working, are attracting new guests, are demonstrating the behaviors. And we continue to amplify and elevate those, and you'll see that come to market with our next one, again, starting tomorrow with 21 Days of Beauty. But we'll take our learnings and promotional impact that we had in the second quarter as we navigate this challenging competitive environment through the second half of the year and continue to focus on the highest return, highest impact promos. So promos are working but we did have some experiences that -- and last thing, I'd just say, if you just step back, Michael, and just think about our business, we feel very confident that we're well positioned to recover. We've got a differentiated business model. And while some elements have been pressured, our model continues to be connected to our guests. And the experiences we offer are unique, enduring. Nobody does what Ulta Beauty does, our guest value, the assortment, the loyalty, the unique services offer, our omnichannel offerings. And I'd say most importantly, the unique experience we deliver to our guests in our stores and online. We allow our guests to discover beauty on their own terms, and we continue to deliver that every day in our stores, and I'm very proud of what our teams are doing. So we're sharpening our differentiated model. We're focused on leaning in on what's working, addressing the dynamics that -- where we have opportunity. And while, as I said, it's going to take a little time to turn back to our custom position of being a share gainer, we are confident we'll get there and our actions are designed to do just that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nRupesh Parikh: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So just going back to unit growth and also target rollout. Just given the more difficult environment right now, like any thoughts on salon unit growth? And as you look at Target, I believe that continues to roll out. Just curious how that's playing out in the current backdrop.\nDave Kimbell: Yes. We -- as far as our own stores, we're pleased with our new store openings. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our new stores, despite some of the other dynamics going on, continue to perform well. And we are -- we have opportunities across the country in a variety of different types of markets to continue to fill in, to reach new markets, to reach new consumers. I've shared before in previous calls, the work we're doing with our small format store, that's performing well. So we're going to lean in more there. And so we're confident that again, we will work through these competitive pressures, and we want to make sure we're reaching as many beauty enthusiast in all parts of the country as possible with our new stores. And then our Target partnership is working. I'll let Kecia give a little bit of color, but we're pleased with that partnership, the strategic role that it plays in our member engagement program is still very strong. And we're positive and optimistic about that path.\nKecia Steelman: Yes. In the last quarter, we opened four Ulta Beauty at Target stores. We have 541 total locations through the quarter. We're still on track to hit our 800 stores through our commitment. It's about deepening that guest engagement. It's about driving growth of the new member and the conversion and the reengagement of lapsed members, and we're seeing that. And then I think it's also really key that nearly 4 million guests have linked their Ulta Beauty and their Target circle loyalty programs together. We do see this as another way to just continue to connect with that guest and engage them back into the Ulta Beauty home store.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Crago with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nKelly Crago: Hi. Thanks for taking our question. I just wanted to follow up on the promotional levels that you're kind of assuming this year. What gives you the confidence that promo levels can sustain at this lower rate relative to pre-COVID just given the category slowing, the consumers seeking value? And there's been a big step up in the competitive environment. And then just secondly, just curious your thoughts on just the makeup of the product assortment. Any rethinking of how maybe big you are in some of these brands that are distributed -- not over distributed, but have seen the distribution points increase quite a bit, some of these more established brands. Just any thoughts on how you see the brand assortment evolving over the next couple of years. Thanks.\nDave Kimbell: Thanks, Kelly. Yes. On the promotional levers, when we look out over the -- well, when we look through this year and what's ahead of us, promotional activity has increased, as I highlighted. And that does reflect both the normalization of the category and increased competition. And as I shared, we were more promotional in the first half of the year. As we turn to the second half, promotion will play an important role. The second half, driven by holiday is always a more promotional period. Holiday is a different dynamic and is intensely promotional to begin with, has been for years, regardless of the competitive environment. As we're competing not just in beauty, but we're competing for gifting occasions across consumers' baskets. And so we're prepared for that. And we'll -- we continue to take our learnings. As we look back pre-COVID, we continue to believe that the environment, while intense, will remain rational. Our guidance assumes that while higher than last year, we will be below 2019 levels for the year, driven by smart execution, CRM capabilities that we have built aggressively over the years, driving efficiency, leaning into our tent pole events and maximizing those. And so while promotional has played a bigger role, we feel we've got it rightsized as we look into the second half of the year, knowing it's a higher promotional period. As far as assortment and what's ahead, Ulta Beauty has a very unique assortment. All price points across mass and prestige, strength in makeup, haircare, skincare, fragrance, bath, wellness services as well, and we're really proud of that. It's one of the things our guests continue to tell us that they really love about us. And the fact that we deliver that in an omnichannel way, in-store and online. So to your specific question around legacy brands, they play an important role. We're really pleased and proud of our partnership with some of the biggest brands in the world. And we're focused on driving growth with those brands. We have a very unique experience in store with many of these brands that brings education, entertainment, events to our guests. We drive exclusivity with our guests through some of these brands. An example is Black Honey with Clinique that we've launched that's in market right now. And so we'll continue to partner with these brands to bring in new experiences. These brands play an important role because of the trust and engagement that they have, the opportunity to bring new guests in and delight our existing guests. But at the same time, we are focused on finding what's new. It's one of the greatest things about this category is the level of entrepreneurship, newness, innovation, and we will continue to drive that. I've highlighted a few already, a few in the fragrance category, as an example, Orebella, Kylie, NOYZ, all new, all exclusive, all exciting, all performing well. Brands in makeup like WYN and Polite Society, both new, both exclusive and we have many others. So we'll lean into the broad mix. For us, it's all things beauty. And to do that, we need to be winning and leading across all types of brands, and that's what we're focused on going into the future.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Korinne Wolfmeyer with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nKorinne Wolfmeyer: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I'd like to hear a little bit more about the operational disruption you referenced with the ERP transition. Can you provide a little bit more color on what exactly happened, how the business was impacted? And what gives you confidence that the issue is cleared out going forward? Thank you.\nKecia Steelman: Yes, Korinne. As Dave mentioned in his earlier comments that we executed by far the most complex element of our multiyear ERP implementation during this quarter, and that was the rollout to our stores. Our teams had to manage dual systems as we phase through the 1,400-plus stores that we have. So that just really added a lot of complexity. It created challenges to our purchasing, our store allocation and our planning processes and systems. And we do see this as a short-term headwind. The great news is that we've completed this challenging phase, so we're through it now. And what I would say what we're doing is that we're really fine-tuning and optimizing the system. And while there's still some investments for continued optimization, we've really built that already into an ERP budget plan, and it's reflected in the current guidance. A change of this magnitude when you're going through DCs and stores, it's really not easy. And adapting takes some time. But we're really grateful to our teams for embracing these transformative changes. And we feel like we're really making progress. And we're confident that we're positioned and ready to have a great holiday season.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nJuliana Duque: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. This is Juliana on for Ike. As we head into your Analyst Day in a few weeks, I was just wondering if there's any preliminary update on the long-term algo or the long-term margin target that you can give us? Thank you.\nKecia Steelman: Hi, Juliana. Thank you for the question. And I certainly understand and appreciate the reason for the question, but we are not providing an update on our long-term expectations on the call today. But as you mentioned, we do plan to do so at our Investor Day in October. And at that time, we are very much looking forward to sharing how we're thinking about our future growth, including kind of the growth opportunities ahead in the category, opportunities specifically for us, what investments, if any, it will take to support those. And how that translates into our long-term financial expectations. And so looking forward to that in just about a month or so.\nJuliana Duque: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Baker: Okay. Hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask about the pace of the share losses in prestige. So your business seems to have gotten worse based on your comps, but some industry data and competitive data are also seeing a deceleration. So I wonder if you can give us any color on the gap between what you're seeing in your own business and competitors. Are you seeing the share losses actually get worse here, I guess, is the question. Thanks.\nDave Kimbell: Yeah, Michael. Thanks for the question. As you said, yes, the category has, as I highlighted, moderated, really is anticipated through the year after multi-years of growth. As far as our performance, as I said, we maintained mass -- share in mass, but continue to be pressured in prestige. And that's driven in particular by hair and makeup, which are the categories that I've talked about in the past. No, we wouldn't say that it's getting any worse. The dynamics are as they've been for much of the year as it relates to share, it's a reflection of both the monitoring category, continued competitive pressures and then some of the other dynamics that we've highlighted and discussed here today are what contributed to the performance we delivered in the second quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashley Helgans with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nAshley Helgans: Hey. Thanks for taking the question. So a question around kind of the increasing competitive environment. Has that changed the ability to get new brands at all? And then when you're adding new brands like ILIA, do you factor in where they're currently distributed? Thanks.\nDave Kimbell: Yeah. No. Great question, Ashley, and thanks for sharing. I'd say big picture, no. I mean, our brand partners are so key to our success and something that I have been so proud of how our team manages our relationships and works as true partners to building our brands. Brands continue to see Ulta Beauty as a leading destination to expand their business, whether they're an existing brand like ILIA or a new brand that's just been created that's looking to reach $44 million of the best beauty enthusiasts across the country. And we're demonstrating that right now. Our brands continue to lean into us. So I've highlighted a few things, rolling established brands through innovation, exclusives on those brands, expansion of those brands and finding new ways. I mentioned expanding Kiehl's, a brand that we've had for a while and finding new ways to reach our guests, expanding that into stores. Brands are excited about that because they see growth. Launching big established brands like ILIA and discovering new and exclusive brands. So we are focused every day on creating an environment that our brands see value with us, and they do. 44 million members, 1,400 stores, a strong and dynamic digital environment and an experience that's unique. Despite the competitive environment nobody does what Ulta Beauty does. And our brands, probably understand that better than others. And that's why we've had such success creating deep relationships and continuing to attract both existing and brand-new to the world brands. And that's something that I see will continue to drive our business going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nOlivia Tong: Great. Thank you. A few questions left. First, how much of the miss relative to your expectations this quarter do you think was a function of the category decelerating versus your own share loss? And then second, why do you think the promos that you did this quarter didn't quite work? And then as you think about the rest of the year, is it you have to deploy more promo or different promo because it looks like from your full year outlook revision that you expect comps to potentially fall another 100 basis points in the second half versus Q2. And just lastly, if you could talk about what you saw towards the end of the quarter into this quarter that influences your guidance. Thank you.\nDave Kimbell: Great. Thanks, Olivia. Let's see. First, on the mix of the drivers. We highlighted four primary elements that we believe impacted our business in the second quarter. And we think each played a role in our sales performance with the competitive pressures continuing to be the largest driver. So as we've talked about here today, continue to focus on the competitive pressure, recognizing the category, while still healthy, has moderated some. So it requires us to continue to elevate our efforts and then addressing some of the internal dynamics around our operational efforts as well as promotional. So all contributed, and we're focused on driving them. For promo specifically, we -- as I've mentioned, what has not -- maybe what did not work as much was not our tent pole events, our core strategic elements, our loyalty events, the key connections that we have. But as I said, we -- our sales moderated throughout the quarter. And as we saw that, call it, in mid-June and into July, on top of some of the efforts we already had, like our big summer Beauty sale and other programs, we layered in incremental promotions. And historically, we've done some of that, and it's worked in different ways. But this time, what we saw was that layering helped in the e-com business, as we highlighted, and did drive traffic and sales on e-com. But added some complexity in store in how that came to life and did not resonate as well. And so when we saw our consumers engaging with them, we created an environment that was not as clear and crisp as we needed it to be. And so we're addressing that going forward. As far as our outlook into the rest of the year and the role of promo as well as other things, we have assessed the impact of the new and existing challenges that we've been talking about here today, and we evaluated a number of scenarios that anticipate a variety of macro consumer changes, competitive category performance, holiday shifts, and a more promotional environment. We've taken all that into account, and that's reflected in our outlook. But I'd say last thing I'd say to all that is, I hope it's clear, we're not standing still. I've highlighted many of the things that we're doing. We're taking action. We're building off successes with newness and other efforts that we have across the business. We do not anticipate having to lean only on promo. That's never what we've had to do. And all of the actions across loyalty, innovation, newness, services, guest experience, digital will come together to drive us and give us confidence in our comp guidance for the second half of the year.\nKiley Rawlins: Operator, I think we have time for one more question.\nOperator: All right. Great. Our last question comes from the line of Susan Anderson with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.\nSusan Anderson: Hi. Good evening. Thanks for fitting me in here. I guess, I was curious, it sounds like most of the competitive pressure is on the prestige side, and it did sound like you maintained that mass share. But are you also seeing any increased competition on the mass side maybe being some of the mass retailers getting more competitive from a promotional standpoint? And then also just really quick on the hair care, was that decline or change there primarily driven by prestige or did you see anything else on the mass side as well? Thanks.\nDave Kimbell: Great. Yes. This is a very competitive category. And so while we're pleased that we maintained share of mass, we know there's competition happening both on the mass and the prestige side. But we haven't seen -- what we haven't seen in mass is the dramatic increase in points of distribution or expanded presence both with physical stores and online. And that's allowed us to continue to drive our experience. And an important aspect is while we talk about our business in mass and prestige, our guest really looks at the whole thing and comes in for both together and buy both together in the same basic from entry-level mass up through masstige, prestige, and luxury. And so we need all things to be clicking to driving traffic and engagement and basket. And so when there's pressure on one part of the business, it impacts our whole store. But our mass business is performing well, and we're confident in our outlook there. As far as the hair dynamics, I mentioned in the remarks, the primary driver. We're pleased with our hair business. It's a critical part of our business. I mentioned our salon is performing well. The hair business primary driver of the performance there was a shift in one of our strategic tent pole events in hair from the second quarter into the first quarter. And that was the primary driver of the lower results in that. But our hair business is important, and we continue to find ways to drive that business going forward.\nSusan Anderson: Great. Thanks so much.\nDave Kimbell: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Susan, and thank you all again for joining us today. We very much appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. And I wanted to take this last moment to thank our more than 55,000 Ulta Beauty associates for their continued focus and commitment to serving our guests. Our teams have managed through significant change over these last three years, and I so appreciate how quickly they've embraced new technology, new processes, new ways of working, always while keeping our guests and each other at the center of everything that we do. So we look forward to speaking to you all again a little sooner than normal after one of our quarterly calls and at our investor event in October. I hope to see you there, and I hope you all have a good evening, and thanks again for joining.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Paula Oyibo",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin with a discussion of our second quarter financial results and then provide more color on our updated outlook. We faced greater-than-expected challenges in the second quarter, resulting in overall financial performance that were below our expectations. Sales growth from comp stores was softer than expected and gross margin was pressured by incremental promotional offers. However, our teams exercised financial discipline, and we took swift actions to mitigate impacts of the top line trend. Net sales for the quarter increased 0.9%, solid new store performance from 49 net new stores and a 12% increase in other revenue, primarily due to an increase in credit card income and growth in royalty income from our target partnership was partially offset by a 1.2% decline in comparable sales. During the quarter, we opened 17 new stores, closed one store, remodeled nine stores and relocated one store. The comp sales decline was driven by a 1.8% decline in transactions, which was partially offset by a 0.6% increase in average ticket. The increase in average ticket reflects growth in average selling price per item, offset by lower average unit per transaction. Looking at the cadence of sales. Net sales trends decelerated as we moved through the quarter, with July being our most challenged period. Comp store sales climbed in the low-single digit rate, primarily driven by a decrease in store transactions. Average ticket also decreased. Our digital channel performance was stronger with e-commerce sales increasing in the low-single digit range. Across digital channels, the sales trends accelerated as we moved through the quarter, with incremental promotional activity driving stronger guest engagement particularly in July. For the quarter, gross margin decreased 100 basis points to 38.3% compared to 39.3% last year. The decline was primarily due to lower merchandise margin and deleverage of store fixed costs, which were partially offset by growth in other revenues and lower shrink. Merchandise margin declined primarily due to increased promotional activity, adverse impact from brand mix and the continued lapping of benefits from price increases last year. While the impact of promotional activity was higher than planned, it was well below 2019 levels. Store fixed costs also delevered driven by lower top line growth and more net new store openings. As a percentage of sales, inventory shrink was lower in the quarter. We completed the rollout of our new fragrance fixtures to all stores and introduced an additional fixture to protect our assortment of popular smaller rollerball fragrances. These investments are having a meaningful impact on fragrance test, and we expect the additional fixtures will support a continuation of the trend. In addition, we continue to increase our ORC focus and have deployed new tools, capabilities and training to our store and field loss prevention teams. Year-to-date, shrink as a percentage of sales is flat with last year, and we continue to expect shrink will be roughly flat for the full year. Moving to expenses. SG&A increased 7.3% to $645 million. Overall, SG&A spend was better than planned again this quarter, primarily due to focused expense management. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 160 basis points to 25.3% compared to 23.7% last year. Reflecting lower top line growth, most expenses deleveraged this quarter. In addition, we preserved sales driving expenses, including store labor and marketing, and completed key elements of our transformational agenda this quarter. These pressures were partially offset by lower incentive compensation, reflecting operational performance that was below our internal target. Operating margin was 12.9% of sales compared to 15.5% of sales last year. And diluted GAAP earnings per share was $5.30 compared to $6.02 last year. Moving to the balance sheet and capital allocation priorities. We ended the quarter with $414 million in cash and cash equivalents. Total inventory increased 10.1% to $2 billion compared to $1.8 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 49 net new stores, the increase was primarily due to inventory to support new brands and the opening of our new market fulfillment center in Greer, South Carolina, which opened in the third quarter last year. Year-to-date, through the second quarter, we generated $359 million in operating cash flow. Capital expenditures were $95 million for the quarter, primarily reflecting investments in new and existing stores, IT investments, and merchandise fixtures. Depreciated was $65 million compared to $62 million last year, primarily due to higher depreciation related to new stores and IT investments. In the second quarter, we returned $212 million of capital to our shareholders through the repurchase of 550,000 shares. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.6 billion remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization. Now turning to our outlook. We have taken a more cautious view for the year. We now expect net sales for the year will be between $11 billion and $11.2 billion, with comp sales in the range of down 2% to flat. In addition to reflecting our first half performance, our updated outlook for sales assumes it will take more time for our actions to change the top line trajectory, and that stores impacted by multiple competitive openings will continue to be pressured more than the rest of the fleet. The operating environment remains dynamic, and the low end of our range implies incremental pressure on consumer spending. For the year, we expect operating margin will be between 12.7% and 13% of net sales. Most of the reduction in our expectation for operating margin compared to our previous view is due to the lower top line. But we have also included flexibility to respond to the evolving promotional environment. For the year, we expect gross margin will deleverage 70 basis points to 90 basis points as lower merchandise margin and deleverage of store fixed costs are partially offset by other revenue growth and lower transportation costs. For the year, we expect SG&A expense will increase in the mid-single digit range. We expect many of the trends we experienced in the first half will continue in the second half, with SG&A driving most of the operating margin deleverage. Reflecting these assumptions, we now anticipate diluted EPS will be in the range of $22.60 to $23.50 per share. We continue to expect to generate strong operating cash flow for the year, which will support our planned CapEx investments of $400 million to $450 million and share repurchases of $1 billion. In closing, we are focused on improving performance in the second half, and we believe our newness and go-to-market strategies, along with continued operational and financial discipline will enable us to navigate the dynamic environment and drive improved sales and profit momentum over time. And now, I'll turn the call over to our operator to moderate the Q&A section. Operator?"

            "name": "Dave Kimbell",
            "content": "Thank you, Kylie, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. For the quarter, net sales increased 0.9% to $2.6 billion and comparable sales decreased 1.2%. Operating profit was 12.9% of sales and diluted EPS was $5.30 per share. Although, we anticipated the headwinds experienced in the first quarter would continue, our results were short of our expectations, driven by a decrease in comp store sales, specifically comp store transactions. E-commerce sales increased as expected. We do not believe these results reflect the strong engagement with our brand, the strength of our operating model, or the performance I know we can deliver over the longer term. Importantly, we are clear about the factors that adversely impacted our store transaction growth in the second quarter, and we have actions underway to address the trends. We attribute the decline in comp store transactions to four factors. First, while the beauty category remains resilient, growth is normalizing after three years of unprecedented gains. Additionally, consumer behavior is starting to shift as consumers increasingly focus on value and become more cautious with their spending. Based on data from Circana, U.S. beauty growth slowed to approximately 3% through the first half of 2024, with prestige beauty experiencing high-single digit growth and mass beauty maintaining low-single digit growth. Second, competitive intensity in the beauty category remains high. As we have shared previously, the strength of the beauty category, combined with an attractive margin profile, has drawn substantial and diverse competition to the category. Today, there are significantly more places to buy beauty, especially prestige beauty, with more than 1,000 new points of distribution opened in the last three years. As a result, our market share continues to be challenged, particularly within prestige beauty. Based on Circana data for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024, we maintained our share in Mass Beauty, but lost share in the beauty -- prestige beauty, particularly driven by makeup and hair categories. We know beauty enthusiasts love to shop for beauty, and they love Ulta Beauty and the unique experiences we offer. But they also love engaging in new beauty offerings. As a result, we often see a short-term impact of new distribution points on an existing nearby store, whether it's a competitor opening or a new Ulta Beauty store. What is unique about the current environment is the scale and pace of change. More than 80% of our stores have been impacted by one or more competitive opening in recent years, with more than half impacted by multiple competitive openings. This significant portion of our store fleet is experiencing a prolonged sales impact. Notably, the positive signals we see in our broader business reinforce the appeal of our differentiated model and our confidence that we will mitigate these near-term competitive pressures. Our brand awareness and brand love continue to increase with strong gains across multiple demographics, demonstrating the broad appeal of our unique, All Things Beauty, All In One Place offering. We continue to attract new and lapsed members to our loyalty program, while maintaining strong retention of our existing members. At the end of the second quarter, we had 43.9 million active Ulta Beauty Rewards members, 5% more than last year. Importantly, we continue to experience healthy growth in our platinum and diamond members. Newness continues to resonate with guests and drive growth. Newer brands, including Sol de Janeiro, Charlotte Tilbury, and OLEHENRIKSEN are driving sales, new member acquisition and member reengagement while newness from a variety of existing brands, including Clinique, Way and PEACH & LILY are driving healthy comp growth. Guests continue to engage with our unique in-store services offering, which delivered mid-single digit growth in the quarter. And new stores continue to perform well. During the quarter, we opened 17 stores, including our 1,400 store and their performance was in line with our expectations. Now we've disrupted the beauty category for more than 30 years and we understand how to successfully manage competitive forces. To reinforce our competitive position and drive stronger performance, we are aggressively taking actions across five areas: strengthening our assortment, expanding our social relevance, enhancing our digital experience, leveraging our powerful loyalty program, and evolving our promotional levers. I will discuss each of these areas in detail shortly. Now in addition to these external factors, we experienced unanticipated operational disruption during the quarter, resulting from the completion of our ERP transformation. In March, we began updating key store systems through a thoughtful and controlled implementation plan. And in July, we finished the migration of all of our stores to our new ERP platform. We are pleased to have successfully completed this important phase, but we have experienced some unexpected operational challenges as our teams have adjusted to new capabilities, new processes, and new ways of working associated with the new systems. Specifically, through the transition, our teams were managing portions of our fleet on both the old and new systems, which led to some store inventory allocation disruption. With all of our stores and DCs now operating on the same core systems, we are shifting from implementation to system optimization and are working quickly to help our teams navigate these new ways of working in order to balance inventories across the network and deliver an optimized guest experience. To minimize future disruption, we have identified key legacy processes that are creating friction and implemented proactive monitoring as well as dedicated support to quickly address issues when they arise. I am confident that our new capabilities will support better, more agile decision-making in the future. And I'm grateful for our collective team's hard work and dedication to manage through this critical transformation. The fourth factor impacting our performance this quarter was the effect of incremental promotions, which did not deliver the expected sales lift. As the top line trends softened in late June and July, we executed incremental promotions to drive revenue. These offers drove strong sales and traffic across our digital platforms, but did not deliver the expected incrementality in stores. The increased frequency of offers, combined with the introduction of new offer structures, put pressure on average selling price without activating incremental purchases in stores. We understand why the incremental promotions did not deliver as expected and will apply these learnings as we manage promotional activity in the second half. Turning now to performance by category. Fragrance delivered double-digit growth, driven by strong guest engagement with Mother's Day and exciting newness. Newness from existing brands, including Valentino, YSL, and Burberry as well as new brands, NOYZ, Orebella and Kylie Jenner, all of which are exclusive to Ulta, contributed to the category's growth. Our exciting Mother's Day gift with purchase offers and gift sets fueled strong guest engagement and our unique assortment of gift sets for Father's Day and back-to-school also delivered growth for the category. The skin care category delivered mid-single digit comp growth this quarter driven by strong growth in Body Care. Sol de Janeiro continues to excite guests, and this quarter, we introduced an exclusive body mist, which is resonating well. Reflecting the appeal of dermatologist recommended brands and favorite La Roche-Posay and new brands, PanOxyl and VANICREAM delivered strong growth. And relevant mass brands, including Bubble and BIOMA continued to engage guests. Overall, prestige skincare was pressured as engaging newness from PEACH & LILY and OLEHENRIKSEN was offset by softness from certain brands impacted by increased distribution or the lapping of strong social media engagement last year. Comp sales in the makeup category decreased mid-single digit range. Among new brands, Charlotte Tilbury, Polite Society, and WYN BEAUTY as well as exclusive newness from Clinique delivered strong growth. This growth was more than offset by sales decreases from existing brands that had newness that did not meet expectations or have experienced increased points of distribution in the market. In Mass makeup, e.l.f., about-face, and Milani delivered strong growth, but this growth was mitigated by planned softness in Ulta Beauty Collection as we prepared for the brand relaunch. Comp sales for the hair care category decreased in the high-single digit range, driven primarily by planned promotional shift. As we shared previously, we incorporated prestige hair care offers in our first quarter semi-annual beauty sale and eliminated our Gorgeous Hair event, which took place in May of last year. In addition, the impact of exciting newness from Wahl, Divi and Odele and strong engagement with Redken was offset by pressure from key brands lapping strong newness last year. As I mentioned at the outset, we are focused on five key areas to reinforce our competitive position. And we are pleased with the progress we've made in many areas and have identified further opportunities to shift our momentum. Starting with our efforts to strengthen our assortment. During the quarter, we continued to enhance our brand portfolio with new engaging brands, including Orebella, Naturium and Naked Sundays while also launching several emerging exclusive prints through our Spark program, including Door, a clean French beauty inspired skincare brand; Magic Molecule, a skincare healing brand; and NOYZ of premium gender-neutral fragrance. We also expanded the key growth driving brands like Sol de Janeiro, MAC, and Kiehl's into additional stores. Looking ahead, we have an exciting pipeline of brand launches planned for the balance of the year, including the recently announced ILIA Beauty, a clean skin centric prestige makeup brand; and DIBS Beauty, a multipurpose easy-to-use makeup brand. In addition to enhancing our assortment with compelling newness, we are focused on building greater awareness and engagement with key exclusive brands, including PEACH & LILY, Polite Society, WYN BEAUTY, and LolaVie, while also collaborating closely with strategic legacy brands to drive stronger growth and profitability. I'm excited to share that we have relaunched Ulta Beauty Collection to inspire beauty discovery, celebrate self-expression, and create a deeper emotional connection with guests. With simplified and good-for-you formulas, the new collection includes refreshed fan favorites as well as new innovations that reflect modern trends across skin care, body care, bath, suncare and cosmetics. Certified with clean ingredients and cruelty free products across the entire assortment, the reimagined collection is positioned at a masstige price point and is designed to make beauty discovery purposeful and accessible for beauty enthusiasts of all ages. While the new assortment has only been available for a few weeks and is still ramping up as we roll out additional SKUs, we are pleased with our early results. Social relevance powers customer connection and loyalty. To accelerate our social relevance and enhance our brand awareness, we have scaled our creator and influencer networks, and we are expanding our culture forward activations to ensure we are at the heart of the social and cultural conversation for beauty. As a result, this quarter, we delivered meaningful growth and earned media value and social sentiment and drove more than 250 million social impressions. During the quarter, we doubled the size of our influencer network to include a double -- a diverse range of influencers across key audience segments to reflect our inclusive audience targeting strategy. We also launched Ulta Beauties, our new associated ambassador program to harness the superpowers of our team and highlight the expertise and passion of our talented associates. As a group, these talented creators developed compelling content in support of our big summer Beauty sale, back-to-school, and the Joy project, which increased our EMV by more than 10% this quarter. Additionally, we launched a new affiliate program, UB Creates to drive traffic and conversion. Last year, we launched the Joy project, a multiyear initiative to make Beauty and the world a more joyful place. In celebration of National Day of Joy, we kicked off the second chapter of our Joy project with the launch of a social movement to spark positivity in the beauty space, partnering with brands, celebrities and creators as well as our own UB collective and UB beauties, our viral complement chain reached more than 260 million people and generated meaningful growth in EMV. To continue to expand our social relevance, we plan to deploy amplification and content strategies in the second half, leading into trend in cultural moments, leveraging our expanded creator network and enhancing brand partner activations. Leveraging new capabilities, we are enhancing our digital experiences to drive traffic and sales. During the quarter, we enhanced search and filtering functionality and make it easier for guests to find what they want quickly. And we streamlined the path to purchase with a new quick add-to-bag feature, making it more convenient for guests to add products to their cart. And to facilitate greater basket building, we introduced new personalized product recommendations and additional upsell placements along the guest purchasing journey. Importantly, we continue to drive increased app adoption through associate engagement, targeted communications, and app-only offers. In the second quarter, member engagement with our app increased 16%. And now our app accounts for about two-thirds of our e-commerce sales, 600 basis points higher than last year. While the app is a vital tool to drive e-commerce sales, the majority of our spend from app users actually incurs in store, making the app another key engagement tool to drive sales per member. As we look forward, we will continue to create and apply new digital features and functionality to give our guests new and more convenient ways to discover, transact and engage with Ulta Beauty. With more than 44 million active members, our loyalty program is a strategic asset that provides us with unique insights across categories, price points and channels and enables us to drive traffic and spend per member. To drive deeper connection and greater awareness, we are amplifying the value of our rewards program through member-only events, social engagement, and marketing activations. In May, we launched Member Love, a member only event of enticing category focused points offers, which delivered healthy member engagement and higher spend per member. And in July, we launched our first member tiered offer to drive traffic, new member acquisition, and member reactivations. In addition to targeted events and communications, we have integrated our rewards program into our digital experience, MAGs and tentpole events to drive engagement and reinforce the value of the program. Looking ahead, we are focused on attracting customer segments to drive new member growth, driving differentiated engagement early in the life cycle to enhance retention, and leveraging our extensive member data to accelerate traffic. Finally, we continue to evolve our promotional strategies to drive traffic and sales. Supported by a robust media strategy, in-store amplification, and engaging social content, we enhanced our big summer Beauty sale event with compelling offers across categories and price points. In addition to driving strong sales, the event delivered growth in new members and member reactivation as well as increased penetration of existing members. And always a fan favorite, we're excited to kick off 21 Days of Beauty with a new look, new beauty steals and unique events for our best members. As the competitive and promotional environment evolves, we will apply the learnings I mentioned earlier and leverage our member insights to execute productive, targeted offers while eliminating less effective promotions and applying new capabilities to create engaging events for our guests. In closing, Ulta Beauty remains a key beauty destination with strong consumer awareness and brand love. And our exceptional teams are committed to offering guests unique inclusive beauty experiences across all of our touch points. We are confident we have identified the factors that impacted our performance in the second quarter and are focused on the right actions to deliver stronger performance. As we turn to the second half of the year, our teams are focused on driving stronger sales and traffic, executing with excellence for our guests, exercising financial discipline as we adapt to a more challenging operating environment, and protecting and cultivating our unique culture, driven by our talented and passionate associates. While it will take time to shift the top line trend, I remain extremely confident in our model and in our ability to execute and win in an increasingly competitive category. And now, I will turn the call over to Paula for a discussion of the financial results and outlook. Paula? Great. Thanks for the question, Steve. And yeah, let me just start with saying, we -- of course, we're no strangers to competition. We know how to compete effectively. And this is, as I said in the remarks, a very attractive category that continues to increase in the competitive environment. As it relates to increased points of pressure, what we've shared before is that we have historically seen a short-term impact on new distribution points on our existing store when a competitor opens near one of our stores. What's unique about this time in this environment is the scale and the pace of change, which is it made it difficult for us to fully forecast the cumulative impact. 88% (ph) of our stores have been impacted by one -- at least one store. And as I said in the remarks, more than half of our stores have been impacted by multiple competitive openings, which to give you context of what that means is, if you take a single Ulta Beauty store, two or more competitive stores have opened within that store's trade area, which is unusual for us historically and something that we're navigating through. What we saw during this quarter is that stores that have had multiple competitive openings, which again could happen over the -- at different times over the three years that we've been navigating, as those stores with multiple competitive openings are underperforming those stores with no or limited competitive impact. Stores that have -- the segment of stores that have not had a direct in-market trade area competitive impact delivered positive comps for the quarter, which is another reason that we feel confident in our model, in our business, in our guest engagement. Stores that have just one competitive opening that occurred early in the expansion cycle are performing in line with historical trends, another data point that gives us confidence as we look forward. But we know we're still in the midst of this. Stores have opened aggressively over the last couple of years. These competitive pressures will likely continue into the near term. But the positive signals I highlighted in our broader business, the guest engagement, the impact of newness, the impact of our new stores, the success of our salon business, the loyalty growth, all of those factors suggest to us and give us a lot of confidence that our business continues to have underlying strength in health and we're navigating through this short term. We know it will take time, but we are not sitting still and we're aggressively taking actions across all the things that I highlighted in the prepared remarks. Thanks, Michael. Yes, it is, as we've discussed, a dynamic and competitive environment that we're navigating through, and I gave you some of those dynamics in my prepared remarks. We are -- and as I said, we remain confident and bullish in the long-term outlook for this business because of all the positives that I've highlighted. We're executing across a number of efforts to drive our business. Here's what I know about our business right now. We are seeing many positive signals that are gaining traction, and we're addressing areas that maybe are not working as well as we had hoped. Assortment is always key. So when we look at key levers, assortment is critical. Newness is working and resonating with our guests, brands like So de Janeiro, Charlotte, OLEHENRIKSEN are driving sales. Our new -- our exclusive brands are playing an important role, and we continue to add brands, Naturium in Q2. And tomorrow, we launch ILIA, an important makeup brand that we're excited to add to our assortment. So continued innovation is a key lever for us that's working, and we'll continue to drive that. I talked about the importance of marketing and social relevance and connecting, deepening brand love. We're pleased with the progress, all-time high of brand love and brand awareness. And we'll continue to drive that because we know that drives connection and awareness and reinforces the role that we play in our guests' lives. Our digital business is critical. And I shared that our digital sales were on expectation, and we're focused on delivering across all of the experiences, you know that we've invested heavily in our digital capabilities over the last couple of years. Earlier this year, we completed our new digital store platform, and that's giving us new ways to delight our guests. And that's working, and we'll be focused on driving that. Loyalty is core to our long-term success. We're pleased with the 5% year-over-year growth, high level of retention, high level of engagement from a best guest, our platinum and diamond guests and a critical part of that business going forward. Services and experience is also driving positive. Promo is an important piece of our business, and I'm glad you highlighted it. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, some of the incremental offers that we added as our performance decelerated in the second half of the quarter did not have the intended effect in -- particularly in our store channel. Promos, generally though, our tent pole events, I mentioned our big summer Beauty sale. Tomorrow, we launch 21 Days of Beauty. Our big promotional events are working, are attracting new guests, are demonstrating the behaviors. And we continue to amplify and elevate those, and you'll see that come to market with our next one, again, starting tomorrow with 21 Days of Beauty. But we'll take our learnings and promotional impact that we had in the second quarter as we navigate this challenging competitive environment through the second half of the year and continue to focus on the highest return, highest impact promos. So promos are working but we did have some experiences that -- and last thing, I'd just say, if you just step back, Michael, and just think about our business, we feel very confident that we're well positioned to recover. We've got a differentiated business model. And while some elements have been pressured, our model continues to be connected to our guests. And the experiences we offer are unique, enduring. Nobody does what Ulta Beauty does, our guest value, the assortment, the loyalty, the unique services offer, our omnichannel offerings. And I'd say most importantly, the unique experience we deliver to our guests in our stores and online. We allow our guests to discover beauty on their own terms, and we continue to deliver that every day in our stores, and I'm very proud of what our teams are doing. So we're sharpening our differentiated model. We're focused on leaning in on what's working, addressing the dynamics that -- where we have opportunity. And while, as I said, it's going to take a little time to turn back to our custom position of being a share gainer, we are confident we'll get there and our actions are designed to do just that. Yes. We -- as far as our own stores, we're pleased with our new store openings. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our new stores, despite some of the other dynamics going on, continue to perform well. And we are -- we have opportunities across the country in a variety of different types of markets to continue to fill in, to reach new markets, to reach new consumers. I've shared before in previous calls, the work we're doing with our small format store, that's performing well. So we're going to lean in more there. And so we're confident that again, we will work through these competitive pressures, and we want to make sure we're reaching as many beauty enthusiast in all parts of the country as possible with our new stores. And then our Target partnership is working. I'll let Kecia give a little bit of color, but we're pleased with that partnership, the strategic role that it plays in our member engagement program is still very strong. And we're positive and optimistic about that path. Thanks, Kelly. Yes. On the promotional levers, when we look out over the -- well, when we look through this year and what's ahead of us, promotional activity has increased, as I highlighted. And that does reflect both the normalization of the category and increased competition. And as I shared, we were more promotional in the first half of the year. As we turn to the second half, promotion will play an important role. The second half, driven by holiday is always a more promotional period. Holiday is a different dynamic and is intensely promotional to begin with, has been for years, regardless of the competitive environment. As we're competing not just in beauty, but we're competing for gifting occasions across consumers' baskets. And so we're prepared for that. And we'll -- we continue to take our learnings. As we look back pre-COVID, we continue to believe that the environment, while intense, will remain rational. Our guidance assumes that while higher than last year, we will be below 2019 levels for the year, driven by smart execution, CRM capabilities that we have built aggressively over the years, driving efficiency, leaning into our tent pole events and maximizing those. And so while promotional has played a bigger role, we feel we've got it rightsized as we look into the second half of the year, knowing it's a higher promotional period. As far as assortment and what's ahead, Ulta Beauty has a very unique assortment. All price points across mass and prestige, strength in makeup, haircare, skincare, fragrance, bath, wellness services as well, and we're really proud of that. It's one of the things our guests continue to tell us that they really love about us. And the fact that we deliver that in an omnichannel way, in-store and online. So to your specific question around legacy brands, they play an important role. We're really pleased and proud of our partnership with some of the biggest brands in the world. And we're focused on driving growth with those brands. We have a very unique experience in store with many of these brands that brings education, entertainment, events to our guests. We drive exclusivity with our guests through some of these brands. An example is Black Honey with Clinique that we've launched that's in market right now. And so we'll continue to partner with these brands to bring in new experiences. These brands play an important role because of the trust and engagement that they have, the opportunity to bring new guests in and delight our existing guests. But at the same time, we are focused on finding what's new. It's one of the greatest things about this category is the level of entrepreneurship, newness, innovation, and we will continue to drive that. I've highlighted a few already, a few in the fragrance category, as an example, Orebella, Kylie, NOYZ, all new, all exclusive, all exciting, all performing well. Brands in makeup like WYN and Polite Society, both new, both exclusive and we have many others. So we'll lean into the broad mix. For us, it's all things beauty. And to do that, we need to be winning and leading across all types of brands, and that's what we're focused on going into the future. Yeah, Michael. Thanks for the question. As you said, yes, the category has, as I highlighted, moderated, really is anticipated through the year after multi-years of growth. As far as our performance, as I said, we maintained mass -- share in mass, but continue to be pressured in prestige. And that's driven in particular by hair and makeup, which are the categories that I've talked about in the past. No, we wouldn't say that it's getting any worse. The dynamics are as they've been for much of the year as it relates to share, it's a reflection of both the monitoring category, continued competitive pressures and then some of the other dynamics that we've highlighted and discussed here today are what contributed to the performance we delivered in the second quarter. Yeah. No. Great question, Ashley, and thanks for sharing. I'd say big picture, no. I mean, our brand partners are so key to our success and something that I have been so proud of how our team manages our relationships and works as true partners to building our brands. Brands continue to see Ulta Beauty as a leading destination to expand their business, whether they're an existing brand like ILIA or a new brand that's just been created that's looking to reach $44 million of the best beauty enthusiasts across the country. And we're demonstrating that right now. Our brands continue to lean into us. So I've highlighted a few things, rolling established brands through innovation, exclusives on those brands, expansion of those brands and finding new ways. I mentioned expanding Kiehl's, a brand that we've had for a while and finding new ways to reach our guests, expanding that into stores. Brands are excited about that because they see growth. Launching big established brands like ILIA and discovering new and exclusive brands. So we are focused every day on creating an environment that our brands see value with us, and they do. 44 million members, 1,400 stores, a strong and dynamic digital environment and an experience that's unique. Despite the competitive environment nobody does what Ulta Beauty does. And our brands, probably understand that better than others. And that's why we've had such success creating deep relationships and continuing to attract both existing and brand-new to the world brands. And that's something that I see will continue to drive our business going forward. Great. Thanks, Olivia. Let's see. First, on the mix of the drivers. We highlighted four primary elements that we believe impacted our business in the second quarter. And we think each played a role in our sales performance with the competitive pressures continuing to be the largest driver. So as we've talked about here today, continue to focus on the competitive pressure, recognizing the category, while still healthy, has moderated some. So it requires us to continue to elevate our efforts and then addressing some of the internal dynamics around our operational efforts as well as promotional. So all contributed, and we're focused on driving them. For promo specifically, we -- as I've mentioned, what has not -- maybe what did not work as much was not our tent pole events, our core strategic elements, our loyalty events, the key connections that we have. But as I said, we -- our sales moderated throughout the quarter. And as we saw that, call it, in mid-June and into July, on top of some of the efforts we already had, like our big summer Beauty sale and other programs, we layered in incremental promotions. And historically, we've done some of that, and it's worked in different ways. But this time, what we saw was that layering helped in the e-com business, as we highlighted, and did drive traffic and sales on e-com. But added some complexity in store in how that came to life and did not resonate as well. And so when we saw our consumers engaging with them, we created an environment that was not as clear and crisp as we needed it to be. And so we're addressing that going forward. As far as our outlook into the rest of the year and the role of promo as well as other things, we have assessed the impact of the new and existing challenges that we've been talking about here today, and we evaluated a number of scenarios that anticipate a variety of macro consumer changes, competitive category performance, holiday shifts, and a more promotional environment. We've taken all that into account, and that's reflected in our outlook. But I'd say last thing I'd say to all that is, I hope it's clear, we're not standing still. I've highlighted many of the things that we're doing. We're taking action. We're building off successes with newness and other efforts that we have across the business. We do not anticipate having to lean only on promo. That's never what we've had to do. And all of the actions across loyalty, innovation, newness, services, guest experience, digital will come together to drive us and give us confidence in our comp guidance for the second half of the year. Great. Yes. This is a very competitive category. And so while we're pleased that we maintained share of mass, we know there's competition happening both on the mass and the prestige side. But we haven't seen -- what we haven't seen in mass is the dramatic increase in points of distribution or expanded presence both with physical stores and online. And that's allowed us to continue to drive our experience. And an important aspect is while we talk about our business in mass and prestige, our guest really looks at the whole thing and comes in for both together and buy both together in the same basic from entry-level mass up through masstige, prestige, and luxury. And so we need all things to be clicking to driving traffic and engagement and basket. And so when there's pressure on one part of the business, it impacts our whole store. But our mass business is performing well, and we're confident in our outlook there. As far as the hair dynamics, I mentioned in the remarks, the primary driver. We're pleased with our hair business. It's a critical part of our business. I mentioned our salon is performing well. The hair business primary driver of the performance there was a shift in one of our strategic tent pole events in hair from the second quarter into the first quarter. And that was the primary driver of the lower results in that. But our hair business is important, and we continue to find ways to drive that business going forward. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Susan, and thank you all again for joining us today. We very much appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. And I wanted to take this last moment to thank our more than 55,000 Ulta Beauty associates for their continued focus and commitment to serving our guests. Our teams have managed through significant change over these last three years, and I so appreciate how quickly they've embraced new technology, new processes, new ways of working, always while keeping our guests and each other at the center of everything that we do. So we look forward to speaking to you all again a little sooner than normal after one of our quarterly calls and at our investor event in October. I hope to see you there, and I hope you all have a good evening, and thanks again for joining."

Dave?\nDave Kimbell: Thank you, Kylie, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. For the first quarter, net sales increased 3.5% to $2.7 billion and comp sales grew 1.6%. Operating profit was 14.7% of sales and diluted EPS was $6.47 per share. We expected comp growth this quarter would be in the low single-digit range as we lapped strong performance last year. I am proud of how our teams adjusted our go-to-market activity to adapt to a rapidly evolving marketplace, thoughtfully managed expenses across the enterprise and importantly, continued to execute our transformational agenda with excellence. As we look forward to the rest of the year, we believe it is prudent to anticipate a continuation of the dynamic environment we experienced in the first quarter and therefore have adjusted our expectations for the remainder of the year. Paula will give more detail on these revisions later in her prepared comments. Before we talk about the quarter, I want to emphasize a few important points. First, we are confident in our model and our ability to gain share and drive significant sustainable value over the long-term. The actions we have taken and investments we have made over the past few years have fortified our operating foundation and we are a stronger, more profitable company today than we were just a few years ago. And we have an outstanding team that knows how to execute and deliver profitably and they are doing so every day with focus, passion and determination. However, we are not satisfied with our market share trends and we are taking actions to reinforce our leadership position and accelerate growth. For more than 30 years, Ulta Beauty has disrupted the beauty industry by bringing mass brands, prestige brands, luxury brands and services together in an accessible, fun shopping environment. This differentiated strategy, combined with welcoming an inclusive guest experiences, has enabled us to shape consumer expectations and drive profitable growth. Today, we operate nearly 1,400 stores and manage a multibillion dollar digital business, providing guests with unique opportunities to play, discover and try beauty. With warm and authentic experiences, our passionate associates are creating strong emotional connections with our guests and helping them discover beauty on their own terms. We've created a world-class loyalty program that engages with more than 43 million active members and provides us with valuable customer and transaction data, and we've expanded our differentiated assortment and built strong strategic partnership with large and emerging brands around the world. We operate in a healthy, growing category. While growth is moderating as expected after three years of unprecedented expansion and competitive intensity is increasing, we have a powerful operating model, excellent brand partnerships and I believe the impact of our winning culture and outstanding teams will enable us to protect and expand our leadership position. In the first quarter, we've strengthened our market position in several areas. Consumer awareness and brand love for Ulta Beauty continues to increase. Our marketing amplification of key brand launches, elevation of our tentpole events and culturally relevant social activation delivered 4 points of improvement in unaided brand awareness this quarter, driven primarily by key growth cohorts. Trust for our expertise, welcoming guest experiences, a diverse assortment and efforts to increase convenience through multiple touch points drove our brand love metric to record levels with strong gains among both Gen Z and baby boomers, which demonstrates the broad appeal of our model. Newness is resonating with our guests. Recent brand launches, including Sol de Janeiro, Charlotte Tilbury and exclusive brands win by Serena Williams and Kylie Jenner Fragrance, are driving sales, new member acquisition and member reengagement. We delivered traffic growth in both our store and digital channels. We increased marketing investments across TV, audio and social platforms to maximize our brand launches, support our semiannual beauty and Spring Haul tentpole events, and amplify our brand equity with the Joy Project. These strategic media investments drove higher traffic across our web and app platforms and increased traffic growth per store, even as we lapped strong double-digit growth last year. Our world-class loyalty program expanded again this quarter with the retention of our most valuable members remains very strong. We ended the quarter with 43.6 million Ulta Beauty rewards members, 6% higher than last year, primarily driven by member retention. Additionally, we continued to acquire new members and reengage lapsed members. Targeted marketing efforts are elevating more members to our platinum and diamond tiers, and exclusive promotions, point accelerators and personalized contents are driving engagement and retention of these valuable members. Our new store portfolio continues to perform well. During the quarter, we opened 12 stores, seven more than last year, and their performance exceeded our expectations. Our associate retention has improved across stores, distribution centers and our corporate teams, and we are on track to complete critical elements of our transformational agenda this year, giving us a stronger foundation for future growth. Our teams are operating at a high level as we execute these transitions, and it is worth noting that they delivered several significant operational milestones this quarter. First, we successfully completed the final phase of our digital store transition and are on track to decommission the legacy platform in the second quarter. Second, we completed an important phase of Project SOAR with a successful transition of our Dallas, Greenwood and Fresno distribution centers to our new ERP system. Now, all of our primary distribution centers are operating on the same platform. Third, we began the process of migrating stores to our new ERP system and I am pleased to share that we have completed the transition in 30% of our fleet. The benefits include an upgrade of a key digital application to provide our store teams with a guided user experience, enhanced reporting to support inventory management, and increased visibility to product information to elevate the guest experience. Beauty is a competitive category and our success reflects the differentiation we provide in the market and our effectiveness in creating meaningful and enduring guest connections. These strengths have enabled us to outperform the market, especially through the pandemic recovery. According to Circana data, between 2019 and 2023, Ulta Beauty expanded its share of both prestige and mass beauty significantly. More recently, the strength of the beauty category, combined with an attractive margin profile, has drawn significant and diverse competition to the category. Today, there are significantly more places to buy beauty, especially prestige beauty, with more than 1,000 new points of distribution opened in the last two years. Additionally, prestige brands are expanding their online availability as digital penetration grows in the category. As a result, our market share has been more challenged for the last few quarters, particularly within the prestige beauty category. Using the consumer lens of how guests experience Ulta Beauty through all of our touch points, we estimate we maintained our share of the total U.S. beauty product industry this quarter. Based on Circana data for the 13 weeks ended May 5, 2024, we outpaced the growth of the mass market but lost share in prestige beauty, primarily driven by pressure in makeup and hair. This prestige share pressure was concentrated in stores as we increased share in e-com for the quarter. Given our proven ability to engage our guests and lead the industry, I am confident we can reinvigorate market share gains. At our Analyst Day in October, we will share longer term plans to drive share growth, but today I want to highlight actions we are taking now to leverage our traffic growth, increase conversion and accelerate top line growth. Our plans are focused on five key areas; strengthening our assortment, accelerating our social relevance, enhancing our digital experience, leveraging our world class loyalty program and evolving our promotional levers. Starting with our assortment, we are enhancing our assortment with the addition of highly recognized brands as well as emerging and exclusive brands. This year, our brand pipeline includes more than 25 new brands, including many exclusive to Ulta Beauty. Importantly, this year's pipeline includes a balanced mix of category growth driving brands like Sol de Janeiro and Charlotte Tilbury and Naturium and emerging exclusive brands like Wyn, a makeup brand developed by Serena Williams and Orebella, a fragrance brand developed by Bella Hadid. To support stronger growth of our core assortment, we plan to accelerate growth with key exclusive brands including Polite Society, Live Tinted and LolaVie, among others. We plan to expand key growth driving brands into more stores and we are excited to relaunch the Ulta Beauty collection this summer. Additionally, we intend to leverage our marketing and social capabilities to lean into emerging trends, amplify key growth brands and drive relevance and engagement and activate new trend focused events across all our channels. Social media is amplifying and accelerating beauty. Social relevance is the gateway to customer reach, connection and engagement, and relevance drives sales and loyalty. While we have increased our EMV and share voice across key platforms including TikTok and Instagram, we see further opportunity to ensure we are at the heart of the social and cultural conversation for beauty. To accelerate our social relevance, we will scale our creator network, amplify brand networks and collaborations, and use our platforms to showcase our unique assortment. With the completion of our digital store transition, we are increasing our focus on leveraging new capabilities and optimizing the guest experience to accelerate traffic, drive conversion and increase average ticket. We recently expanded our partnership with DoorDash with our launch on DoorDash Marketplace, which extends our unique assortment to the more than 70 million active users of the DoorDash app. We will introduce new digital buying guides that amplify search engine optimization while providing guests with educational content, beauty tips and product recommendations. We will improve the path to purchase through guided navigation and leverage new innovative search capabilities to facilitate discovery and we will accelerate app adoption through targeted communication and offers as app users spend nearly two times more. In the first quarter, our app accounted for 57% of our e-commerce sales, up more than 450 basis points compared to last year. Our loyalty program is a powerful strategic asset and we will lean into this platform to drive greater engagement and support top line growth. Earlier this year, we rebranded the program to Ulta Beauty rewards, enhanced the birthday experience, and launched a refreshed look in stores online and across social. These improvements are driving greater awareness and deepen connections with our members. We have also introduced new mobile POS capabilities to engage existing members and drive new member acquisition, and we are testing new ways for guests to engage with loyalty benefits in store transactions. At the same time, we are leaning in to amplify the value of the program through member love events and social engagement and we are also testing new gamification platforms, creating new ways to engage with our program and Ulta Beauty. And later this year, we will activate new marketing technology that will advance our personalization efforts with our guests. Finally, we continue to enhance our promotional events and strategies. We will evolve our unique tentpole events to drive basket and new member acquisition, increase our use of effective targeted offers while eliminating or shifting less productive offers, and to create new platforms and offers to excite and engage our guests. In closing, we continue to expect the beauty category will grow in the mid-single-digit range this year barring a major economic event. We are confident we have identified the right actions to deliver stronger revenue growth, and our associates are working together as one unified Ulta Beauty team to expand our leadership position and deliver engaging guest experiences across all our touch points. I look forward to sharing our progress with you throughout the year. And now, I will turn the call over to Paula for a discussion of the financial results. Paula?\nPaula Oyibo: Thanks Dave and good afternoon everyone. As Dave shared, our team responded to the dynamic operating environment with focus and financial discipline. As a result, we delivered net income and diluted EPS in line with our internal expectations. We are focused on reinforcing our leadership position and driving stronger performance, and while we believe our efforts will deliver results, we think it is prudent to expect many of the pressures we identified and faced throughout the first quarter may continue for the balance of the year and therefore have revised our annual guidance. I'll begin with a discussion of our first quarter results, followed by comments about our updated full year outlook. Net sales for the quarter increased 3.5%, driven by 1.6% growth in comp sales. The contribution from 36 net new stores opened since the first quarter last year and a $9 million increase in other revenue, primarily due to an increase in credit card income and growth in royalty income from our Target partnership. Comp transactions for the quarter increased 1.3%, driven by traffic growth in stores and on our digital platforms. Average ticket increased 0.3%. Looking at the cadence of sales throughout the quarter, comp sales in February decreased slightly as we lapped strong double digit comps last year. Comp growth accelerated in March, reflecting the impact of our semiannual beauty events and the benefit of the Easter shift. April trends were positive but softened compared to march, primarily reflecting the adverse impact of the Easter shift. From a channel perspective, e-commerce sales increased in the high-single-digit range. Sales from comp stores were flat compared to last year, reflecting the expansion of brick and mortar distribution points and the lapping of strong comp growth last year. Turning to comp sales performance by category, fragrance delivered double digit growth, driven by newness from existing brands and exciting brand launches, including Cosmic from Kylie Jenner, which is exclusive to Ulta Beauty. Additionally, Valentine's Day drove strong growth across both men and women's fragrances. The skincare category delivered mid-single-digit comp growth this quarter, primarily driven by double digit growth in body care and mask skin care, which was partially offset by a decline in prestige skincare. The strong performance of body care was driven primarily by the launch of Sol de Janeiro and the expansion of key emerging brands into additional Ulta Beauty stores. The growth of mass skincare was primarily due to strong engagement with our dermatologist recommended platform as well as the expansion of in-store presentation of select emerging brands. Our prestige business was challenged this quarter, reflecting the impact of increased distribution for key brands, timing shifts of product newness, and the lapping of the impact of strong social media engagement with certain brands last year. Hair care comp sales increased to low single digit range, primarily due to newness in hair tools. The inclusion of prestige hair care in our semiannual beauty event and high engagement with mass hair care products during our Spring Haul event. Makeup comp sales decreased to mid-single-digit range, while new brands and guest engagements with our luxury platform was strong, this growth was more than offset by sales decreases from brands that experienced extraordinary growth last year, units from existing brands that did not meet expectations, and increased points of distribution. In addition, sales of the Ulta Beauty collection were impacted by planned markdowns as we prepared to re-launch the brand this summer. Finally, the strength of our services business continued with high-single-digit comp growth in the quarter, driven by increases in hair treatment, specialty services including ear piercing, brow and makeup, and core salon cut and color services. For the quarter, gross margin decreased 80 basis points to 39.2% compared to 40% last year. This decrease was primarily due to lower merchandise margins and higher inventory shrink, which were partially offset by growth in other revenue. Merchandise margin declined during the quarter primarily due to increased promotions, adverse impact from brand mix and the lapping of benefits from price increases last year. Promotional activity in the quarter was higher than last year reflecting the expansion of our semiannual beauty event and incremental offers to drive traffic. Inventory shrink was higher in the quarter. Our investments in new fixtures and operating processes are reducing shrink in the fragrance category, but this improvement is being offset by higher shrink in other prestige categories. Moving to expenses, SG&A increased 8.8% to $666 million. Overall SG&A spend was better than planned due to disciplined expense management. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 120 basis points to 24.4% compared to 23.2% last year. In addition to the impact of lower top line growth, higher corporate overhead, store payroll and benefits and store expenses contributed to the deleverage in the quarter. Corporate overhead expense increased in the quarter primarily due to technology related strategic investments. The increase in store payroll and benefits was driven primarily by higher average wage rates, and the increase in store expenses was primarily due to IT investments and increased testers. Operating margin was 14.7% of sales compared to 16.8% of sales last year. Net interest income for the quarter was $6.9 million compared to $7.3 million last year. Lower average cash balances were partially offset by the benefit of higher average interest rates. The company's tax rate increased to 23.2% compared to 22.8% in the first quarter last year. The higher effective tax rate is primarily due to less benefit from income tax accounting for stock based compensation. For the quarter diluted GAAP earnings per share was $6.47 compared to $6.88 last year. Now moving to the balance sheet and capital allocation, we ended the quarter with $524.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. Total inventory increased 8.8% to $1.9 billion compared to $1.8 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 36 net new stores, the increase was primarily due to the inventory needed to support new brands in our new market fulfillment center in Greer, South Carolina. Capital expenditures were $91 million for the quarter, reflecting investments in merchandise, fixtures, new and existing stores and IT investments. Depreciation was $64.7 million compared to $57.9 million last year, primarily due to higher depreciation related to new stores and IT investments. In the first quarter, we returned $285.1 million of capital to our shareholders through the repurchase of 588,000 shares. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.8 billion remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization. Now, turning to our outlook, we have updated our expectations for the full year to reflect our first quarter performance, the dynamic operating environment and the actions we are taking to draw to drive stronger top line growth. With this in mind, we currently expect net sales to be between $11.5 billion to $11.6 billion, with comp sales growth in the range of 2% to 3%. We continue to expect comp growth to be in the low single digit range in the first half of the year. We expect comp growth to accelerate in the second half of the year to be between 2% and 4%, reflecting the impact of our sales driving initiatives, our newness pipeline and decelerating growth in the second half of last year. We currently expect operating margin to be between 13.7% and 14% of net sales, primarily driven by SG&A deleverage as we protect sales driving investments, including marketing and store labor, complete many of the elements of our transformational agenda and operationalize investments made in 2023. We will also continue to maintain our financial discipline. For the full year we now expect SG&A growth to be in the mid-to-high single digit range, with growth in the low double digit range in the first half of the year and in the low-to-mid-single digit range in the second half of the year. We expect gross margin for the year to be down modestly as lower merchandise margin and deleverage of fixed costs are mostly offset by lower supply chain costs and other revenue growth. For modeling purposes, we anticipate growth margin will deleverage in the first half of the year, primarily driven by lower merchandise margin, deleverage of fixed costs due to lower sales and higher shrink partially offset by growth of other revenue. In the second half of the year we expect growth margin to be flat to up modestly as higher merchandise margin and lower supply chain costs offset deleverage of fixed costs. As a result, we now anticipate diluted EPS to be in the range of $25.20 to $26 per share. We expect diluted EPS to decline in the first half of the year and be flat to up modestly in the second half of the year, including the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2023, which was $181.9 million of net sales and $0.46 of diluted EPS. Finally, we continue to expect to repurchase $1 billion of Ultra Beauty stock this year, reflecting the strength of our cash flow and the confidence we have in our future. And now I'll turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?\nDave Kimbell: Before we begin the Q&A session, I'd like to recap our perspective on the first quarter and reiterate our confidence in our plans. Love for the Ulta Beauty brand is growing. Our member retention is strong and our teams are laser focused on delivering great guest experiences, while managing through an evolving environment. We are pleased with the progress we are making across key areas of our business and we are taking steps to drive stronger performance through strengthening our assortment, expanding our relevance, enhancing our digital experience, leveraging our world class loyalty program and evolving our promotional levers. We have a strong plan in place to navigate near-term pressures while continuing to invest in support of the long-term opportunity. I am confident in the power of our differentiated business model and our team's ability to execute with excellence against our priorities and deliver value for our shareholders. Ulta Beauty is a force in the beauty industry as we captured a large share of this dynamic category and I am as optimistic as ever about the future of our business. And now I'll turn the call over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Simeon Siegel with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nSimeon Siegel: Thanks. Hey everyone, good afternoon. Dave, I guess maybe following up on that, I was just hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on the guidance change, perhaps to oversimplify it. And I apologize if this is an annoying question, but I guess are you comfortable that you're lowering it deep enough and now work towards the long-term margin rate? Just any help in terms of thinking how you're thinking about your margin target and the underlying opportunity would probably be helpful. Thank you, guys.\nDave Kimbell: Well, thanks, Simeon, for the question. I'll start with some overarching thoughts and then maybe, Paula, you can give some specifics on the operating margin outlook. I'd say broadly, we are confident in our outlook for the year. As we've assessed the landscape in which we're operating, we see the opportunities ahead of us. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there are a lot of positives across our business right now as we see strong engagement in our brand growth and brand love and awareness, strength in key parts and aspects of our business traffic continuing to be healthy in stores and online, newness working, new stores performing well. So we are confident in many of the key metrics of our business and then clear about our opportunity to address some of the areas that we've been more pressured. When we look at the comp outlook that we've updated for the year, which is obviously a key part of our overall model, we feel very clear and confident about that revised outlook here. We do see over the -- particularly in the second half of the year, our lap becomes a bit easier and so as we look at on a two-year stack, we feel very comfortable and confident in that. But I'd say more important, we are taking actions, as I described in the prepared remarks, to address where we have some potential to drive our business even more with more newness, strong marketing, enhanced digital capabilities as we take advantage of the new platform that we put in, and of course, leaning heavily on our loyalty program to take full advantage of our relaunch there. So we feel clear about what's ahead of us, confident in our comp. And then as that relates specifically to the margin outlook, Paula, do you want to give some more color on that?\nPaula Oyibo: Sure. Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, Simeon. What I would say is, as we think about our operating margin guide of 37 to 40 on the comp of 2% to 3%, we've shared that top line performance plays an important role in driving fixed cost leverage for us. And with the comps now below our long-term algo of 3% to 5% comps, we expect less leverage and have adjusted our operating margin expectations accordingly. One thing that I will also share is that in addition to the fixed cost deleverage on lower sales, we've embedded flexibility in our guidance to invest in sales levers like promo, marketing and store labor to strengthen our top line and defend share and so that also gives us confidence in the adjusted comp guide that Dave spoke about.\nSimeon Siegel: Great. Thanks a lot. Guys, best of luck for the rest of the year.\nDave Kimbell: Thanks, Simeon.\nOperator: Our next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nSimeon Gutman: All right, that was a setup. Hi, everyone. So my question, Dave, talking about prestige and the increased shifting to channels, can you share if that's brands that are deciding to sell on different channels or you're just seeing the customer, I guess, moving over themselves and have we absorbed the worst of that? That's the first part. And then this is connected to the question, is it fair to think that merchandise -- is merchandise margins about 200 basis points above where we were around the pre-COVID time, and it feels like you have an appropriate mix now? You kind of see where the business is going in terms of the tradeoff between sales and gross margin, such that we're not going to retest those pre-COVID lows. Thank you.\nDave Kimbell: All right. Well yes, I'll talk about the overall competitive environment and what we're seeing in there, and then Paula can give you some more color on the merch margin and our outlook related to that. So to reiterate, as we look at the competitive environment, what we, as I mentioned in the remarks, this category has always been an attractive, and it's always been very competitive, given the growth potential, the connection it has with consumers, its margin profile. So we've long, for the entire 33-year history of this company, we've been competing in a very competitive environment. What's unique about what\u2019s going on today, is the cumulative impact of the competitive intensity really driven by significant increase in distribution of prestige, both in store and online. And as consumers navigate that broader choice, they're making choices. We're confident in our ability to continue to engage, and that shows up in some of the results I highlighted, but it certainly is an impact. When we look at stores opening near our stores, we talked about this in the past, historically. We do see a short-term hit to a nearby store when a competitor opens up and we're able to recover and those stores comp at our enterprise level. What's unique about right now is the scale of it to have over 1,000 new locations within a short-term period. It's unprecedented in our history and probably in retail more broadly. So it means that we're navigating that and understanding consumer behavior as we go forward. But even with that, to highlight again some of the things that we see, our strengths even in this elevated competitive environment, holding share in total beauty for the quarter is a real positive as we gained in mass and we gained in prestige e-com, in our brand love, our brand awareness, our total loyalty members, our member retention, our traffic all up, all positive, all healthy, as we see strength with our consumer connection. So your question about our consumer, the fact that we gained 6% in total members, our retention is healthy, we're moving more members up into platinum and diamond and retention of those guests is very high and our brand love reached an all-time high. The connection to Ulta Beauty is strong and we're managing through this really again, unprecedented competitive environment. And all the things I talked about, our confidence in our model, our confidence in the health of this category, and our ability to adapt and adjust our strategies and initiatives, as I discussed, give us confidence both in delivering the updated guidance, but I'd say even more importantly, the future continues to be very bright for Ulta Beauty because we're well positioned with a strong share of the category, strong connection to consumers, and the ability to navigate and adjust our plans as necessary as we've been doing throughout the history of this company. Paula, do you want to talk then about merch margin?\nPaula Oyibo: Sure, Dave. Simeon, I'll give a little color on merch margin. When we think about merch margin from a guidance perspective, we currently expect lower merchandise margin for the year due to the lower sales, increased promotional activity and category mix. We saw merchandise margin decline in Q1 generally for these similar reasons, increase in promo, adverse impacts from brand mix, and then we had a bit of lapping price increases from 2023. When we think about 2020 versus 2019, you are correct. As of last year, we were about 200 basis points of merch margin above 2019 levels. And really, what I would say is a lot of that benefit that we saw was coming from ongoing category performance improvement efforts by our merchandise team, category mix and promo efficiency. Now we are seeing that some of that merch margin is getting a bit pressured as we're seeing in Q1 and as reflected in our current guide.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay, thank you. Good luck.\nOperator: Our next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nKate McShane: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking our question. We wanted to drill down a little bit more on the marketing spend that you're planning to increase for the year. We're just wondering, how much of an increase are we talking about? What are some of the tactics here? And are you building in a corresponding sales lift with the marketing spend? And then finally, just within that, did you elevate the marketing in the midst of Q1 and did that have any impact on the comp?\nDave Kimbell: Well, what I'd say is, as we look forward throughout the year to clarify, Paula mentioned in her remarks that we are protecting our investment in marketing, in store labor and other aspects that we know drive our business and that's reflected in our updated operating margin outlook and we'll continue to invest appropriately as we see opportunities to support growth, so all of that is reflected. The types of things we're doing are continuing to strengthen our connection with our guests. As I said, our unaided awareness and our brand love both increased meaningfully in Q1 after strong growth throughout 2023, we are on a good trajectory as it relates to connecting our guests. The fact that we're driving traffic in both to our stores and online, we're growing our connection to our app, our loyalty, engagement and retention is strong. Our marketing efforts are working. The point in my comments about us finding even better ways and stronger ways to connect is an always on focus for us and we see continued opportunity to drive greater connection through social, so that will be a big focus for us. I highlighted our growth in EMV, which is which we're pleased with, but we know we can do even more. It is the key driver of this category, the way so many consumers are learning and discovering and engaging in the category. So we will continue to have a focus there. And importantly, we're partnering with our brands to find ways to connect as their brands drive growth within our environment. So we're pleased with the efficiency of our spend. It is driving our results and we'll continue to optimize our spend and add appropriately throughout the year as we see opportunities and all of that is reflected both in our top line and our operating margin outlook.\nKate McShane: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nChris Horvers: Thanks and good morning. So I'll also do a two pronged question here. So it seems like the 1.6% comp wasn't really different from your internal plan. And you had mentioned and you had expected improvement over the year on all the factors that you mentioned. So at the same time you lowered the back half. So can you just share with us, was it just you're being preemptive to maybe a hockey stick that you set up? And then can you also talk about, April ex-Easter, was that better than the 1.6% for the quarter ex-Easter shift and any commentary on how May is doing so far?\nDave Kimbell: All right, thanks Chris. Yes, let me take the first part, and again, I'll ask Paula to talk about most recent trends. Yes, 1.6% comp is and we talked about delivering comps in the first half of the year in the low single digits. The reason that we see the need to adjust our outlook for the year is the 1.6% is clearly, and we talked about this earlier in the quarter Chris, at the low end of that range of low single digits. We anticipate the pressures and dynamics that I've been talking about to continue into Q2. And so as we looked at the second half of the year, while we see upside potential through the activities that I mentioned in driving elevated efforts across many parts of our business, strong newness platform and an easier overlap, we do anticipate an increase in the second half of the year, but because of the first half landing at the low end of that range, we see, we felt it was appropriate to update our outlook for the whole year, anticipating some of the pressures, even with growth in the second half of the year, elevated growth in the second half of the year, those pressures continuing through throughout the year, so that all lands us in that updated outlook of 2% to 3%. As far as April and more recent outlook Paula, do you want to talk about that?\nPaula Oyibo: Yes. Thank you. So, Chris, as it relates to the cadence for the quarter and our April exit rate for the quarter, March was the strongest period for a quarter. And it's for all the reasons you mentioned benefiting from the Easter timing as well as our expansion of our Q1 beauty event. Comps in April were positive, but did moderate from March as we expected, negatively impacted from the timing of the Easter shift. With regards to May and what we're seeing quarter-to-date, I won't comment on that specifically, but what I will share is that we expect Q2 comps to look very similar to the first quarter comp.\nChris Horvers: Got it. And then just one quick follow up. You did mention that you expect merchandise margin, I believe up in the back half of the year, but lower in the first half. So what drives the change in the merchandise margin dynamic? Thank you.\nPaula Oyibo: Yes. Well, so we expect more pressure in the first half due to the promo and brand mix and that lapping effect of those price increases. And so when we think about the second half, we're not lapping the price increase benefits and we will be largely past the inventory markdowns associated with our rebranding of Ulta Beauty collection. We'll still have the brand mix and promo impact, but net-net, we're expecting the second half to be flat.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Altschwager with Baird. Please proceed.\nMark Altschwager: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on the competitive backdrop, but maybe slightly different angles. So you've talked about the increased points of distribution, but at the same time, Ulta has been investing a lot in its loyalty program and its data analytics capabilities for years that I suspect can drive a lot of value for brand partners. So how is your value proposition for these brands evolving? And what gives you the confidence that you can remain a premier distribution point for established and emerging brands even as this competitive environment continues to evolve?\nDave Kimbell: Mark, that's a great question and we're very confident in that. We have worked hard over many years to build very strong relationships with our brand partners, both the largest brands in the category and a real dedicated effort in supporting emerging new smaller brands. And that is an area of high confidence that we'll continue to be connected and partnering with our brands. We are a very large part of the category across all segments; mass and prestige, makeup, hair care, skincare, fragrance, bath, wellness. We play a significant role. We have a unique proposition. Nobody does what Ulta Beauty does. Our stores and the experience we deliver is special and differentiated and our brands recognize that. They value the opportunity that they have in our stores and on our online to connect with now nearly 44 million loyalty members and the activation and capabilities we have to activate their strategies directly with the largest pool of beauty enthusiasts in the country. And we have long been a destination for growth and so many of our brands are driving growth and taking full advantage of that experience. So I am confident in our brand relationships as we work through some of the changes in the category. In my direct discussion with brands and our overall relationships, we are working together to continue to drive growth and strengthen our partnership, add new brands, as many of which I've highlighted, and drive our business forward in partnership with our brands and that will continue for sure.\nMark Altschwager: Thank you, Dave. Quick follow-up for Paula on inventory. As we look at the inventory growth versus the sales growth, the spread is, I think, wider there than we've seen in a bit and obviously you're adjusting your demand outlook for the back half of the year. Any pockets of aging inventory that could weigh on margins and anything incorporated there from a clearance markdown perspective in the second quarter? Thank you.\nPaula Oyibo: No, real concern with regards to inventory. I guess for perspective, approximately 75% of that inventory growth in the quarter was attributable to our new brands and our new stores that were mainly due to opening at DC. We do expect that growth to normalize as we progress during the year. And I know we've shared this previously, but as you think about inventory, keep in mind that most of our inventory is current and largely what we consider core product, which means very little seasonal or at risk inventory. And as you mentioned, we do look for opportunities to invest in inventory to best position ourselves to capture future demand and so we are also doing that as well.\nOperator: Our next question is from Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Please proceed.\nOliver Chen: Hi, David and Paula. Regarding makeup being down mid-single digits and also thinking about the newness opportunity there, what's embedded with guidance for how that meaningful category may proceed? And we continue to see a lot of innovation at competitors such as Amazon, which is leveraging a lot of personalization as well as affiliates and community members. What are your thoughts in terms of how you'll remain competitive? And I know there has always been a lot of overlap with product that they sell and you sell as well. Thank you.\nDave Kimbell: Well, so first on makeup, it's the largest part. It continues to be the largest part of our business, about 44% of our business and we have a very large share of that category. And when we look at our business right now, we talked about some pressure on the prestige side. Many of the things that I've highlighted and the mass, the category slowed some as we were lapping a very strong Q1 and first half of last year. When I look out and embedded in our guidance is confidence on many parts of our makeup business and the ability to strengthen our performance in that. On the mass side, we see continued opportunities with several brands, including Elf has performed very well and has been an important partner for us. Exclusive partnership with Morphe. We've got key partnership with NYX, early lead on some of their innovation. We've got brands like Juvia's Place and about base that have demonstrated strong partnership and growth in our business. So we're confident in our ability to continue to evolve that. And on the prestige side, the newness that I've highlighted has contributed and while we've got more work to do there, Charlotte Tilbury is now in 600 stores and online and has contributed meaningfully to our business. We highlighted the continued expansion and performance of our luxury business. Brands like Wyn, the launch with Serena and we're expanding MAC into more doors. That is just rolling out really as we speak into more doors. And we've got a number of really exciting exclusive brands, brands like Live Tinted, Polite Society, Rabanne, Wyn, and others in the makeup space that are just an outstanding portfolio of emerging brands that we are confident will drive growth over time. So we will continue to drive makeup connection. We've got a very big makeup business and we've got clear plans to drive that going forward as far as other competitive environment in the digital space. The efforts that I talked about across our business apply both to in-store and online. One of the great things about our business is when we get our in-store guests shopping online, they increase their brand, love their brain connection, our share of wallet, their spend goes up two and a half times. And our efforts there and we gained share in the prestige e-com business in Q1, despite some of the other pressures that I talked about. So we see opportunity to continue to drive programs like communities and affiliates. We're doing a lot of that, drive more influencers, expand our assortment, and drive newness across the business. So competing both in-store and online is what we do, and we're focused on that and makeup as we are with all of our categories looking forward.\nOliver Chen: Thank you. Best regards.\nDave Kimbell: Thanks, Oliver.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Binetti with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\nMichael Binetti: Hey guys, thanks for taking our question here. So Paula, I think the math for the rest of the year puts operating margin below 14%, just the rest of year on a comp range 2% to 4%. Not far from your long term guide. Can you speak to how we rebuild to the level back to the long-term 14% to 15% margin if the comp trend continues at the 2% to 4% type rate in the second half or the comment that you think you can hold share in a category that grows mid-single digits, is that supportive of 14% to 15% margins? And then I guess secondly, as you look at the higher markdowns in the marketplace today and think about the backdrop of some of the key brands and the expanding distribution you pointed to, are you seeing promotions more pronounced in the products and brands that have expanded their distribution the most? I'm curious if there's any link there.\nPaula Oyibo: Okay, let me, I'll take the first question and then Dave will talk about what we're seeing from the social environment with the bank [ph]. So Michael, what we've shared is that the top line performance plays a really important role in our ability to drive fixed cost leverage and comps below our long-term algorithm really causes a challenge for us to be able to drive margins at that range above the 14% and 15%. You see that with how we've adjusted our guidance. So on a 2% or 3%, our low end has come down because of the effect of that difficulty of leveraging occupancy costs. What I would say is, from a long-term perspective, we're not sharing long term guidance on the call today, but we do have an Investor Day in October and we plan to share more about the opportunities ahead, how we're thinking about the next phase of growth, and of course how that impacts our financials.\nDave Kimbell: Yes. As far as promotional environment Michael, we came into the year with the assumption that the promotional environment would increase, but remain rational and we built in expectations that we would be able to continue to invest in core parts of our business going forward. What we're seeing now is largely that's holding true. We continue to plan for promotional levels to increase in 2023 because of the competitive nature of this business right now. But as we saw in the first quarter, and we anticipate through the rest of the year, we're not looking to an irrational level, I guess I'd say, of promotional. And we expect our promotional levels to be below 2019 levels for the year. And that's in large part due to our CRM capabilities, promotional efficiencies. As far as specifically about brands, I don't, we haven't really witnessed any specific trends, brands that are in this competitor or in a certain marketplace. It's a broad dynamic going on across the industry again, elevated but still below historical highs.\nKiley Rawlins: So, operator, I think we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our next question is from Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nKrisztina Katai: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. So Dave, I wanted to follow-up on the call to action items. Maybe if you could talk a bit more about how these are helping with just the increased member retention you're seeing. What you can share on the promotional efficiencies of your different and point multiplier events that you have been working on to spend market share. And then secondly, just how do you view the composition of your brand portfolio currently? And I'm asking this in particular, just your legacy brands with some of them getting their own storefront at a competitor's website. Thank you.\nDave Kimbell: Well, let's see the actions that we're taking to drive our business. I've highlighted them and all of them come in. We came in into the year with a number of initiatives that we're continuing to drive and then we're finding ways to do even more newness being a big part of that. We're excited about our program. I highlighted many of the activities we talked about social and marketing efforts specifically around promotional program. And a few things I'd highlight is we're continuing to amplify and elevate our key tentpole events like our semiannual beauty event we held in Q1, our Spring Haul event. We've got an event coming up in the summer of this year and more throughout the rest of the year and certainly going into holiday. That is an effort that every year we continue to find ways to improve, elevate the connection and the relationship that we build with our guests through the power of these tentpole events. We complement that through a steady effort in promotional connection that's more targeted through the power of our loyalty program and the strength in the personalization efforts and we see that right now we're in the midst of a program. If you've seen in the market what we call member love, it's a three week program, each week highlighting a different category, this week focused on skin care. And what we see with that is a really differentiated way to connect with our guests again, add more value to our guests in a way that only Ulta Beauty can to leverage our personalization and differentiation capabilities, the strength of our loyalty program, and we're pleased with the results. So we'll continue to amplify the big efforts that we have throughout the year and complement that with targeted, efficient promotions that we have a lot of data to continue to optimize. As far as our brand portfolio, I'm really proud and pleased with the portfolio that we have. We've got the very best of beauty. We've got brands across all major categories, all price points from the biggest, most established, longest term brands in this category that continue to provide great performance and outlook for us. Brands like MAC and Clinique and Lancome, the Estee Lauder brand, newer brands like Cosmic from Kylie and Wyn from Serena. We've got the portfolio of emerging brands, large brands and strength in all key segments of the category. So I highlighted that the competitive environment continues to evolve and brands will adapt to that and take advantage of growth prospects where they see them. But to reiterate something I mentioned in a previous question, our brand relationships are incredibly strong. It's something that we value immensely and work hard to continue to develop. And so our brand CS as a place for growth they're experiencing, so many of them are experiencing that growth right now. And that's one of the many reasons that I am very confident in the future of Ulta Beauty. And we're very clear on our, what's ahead of us throughout 2024 and ready to continue to lead the category for the long-term.\nKrisztina Katai: Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nDave Kimbell: Okay. So with that, let me wrap up today with just a couple of quick remarks. Our teams are working hard to deliver against our short-term objectives while also taking necessary steps to position Ulta Beauty for longer term profitable growth. And I want to thank our more than 50,000 Ulta Beauty associates across the country for all that they are doing. Again, I appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty, and we look forward to speaking to you all again when we report, our results for the second quarter on August 29. I hope you all have a great evening. Thanks again for joining.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Paula Oyibo",
            "content": "Thanks Dave and good afternoon everyone. As Dave shared, our team responded to the dynamic operating environment with focus and financial discipline. As a result, we delivered net income and diluted EPS in line with our internal expectations. We are focused on reinforcing our leadership position and driving stronger performance, and while we believe our efforts will deliver results, we think it is prudent to expect many of the pressures we identified and faced throughout the first quarter may continue for the balance of the year and therefore have revised our annual guidance. I'll begin with a discussion of our first quarter results, followed by comments about our updated full year outlook. Net sales for the quarter increased 3.5%, driven by 1.6% growth in comp sales. The contribution from 36 net new stores opened since the first quarter last year and a $9 million increase in other revenue, primarily due to an increase in credit card income and growth in royalty income from our Target partnership. Comp transactions for the quarter increased 1.3%, driven by traffic growth in stores and on our digital platforms. Average ticket increased 0.3%. Looking at the cadence of sales throughout the quarter, comp sales in February decreased slightly as we lapped strong double digit comps last year. Comp growth accelerated in March, reflecting the impact of our semiannual beauty events and the benefit of the Easter shift. April trends were positive but softened compared to march, primarily reflecting the adverse impact of the Easter shift. From a channel perspective, e-commerce sales increased in the high-single-digit range. Sales from comp stores were flat compared to last year, reflecting the expansion of brick and mortar distribution points and the lapping of strong comp growth last year. Turning to comp sales performance by category, fragrance delivered double digit growth, driven by newness from existing brands and exciting brand launches, including Cosmic from Kylie Jenner, which is exclusive to Ulta Beauty. Additionally, Valentine's Day drove strong growth across both men and women's fragrances. The skincare category delivered mid-single-digit comp growth this quarter, primarily driven by double digit growth in body care and mask skin care, which was partially offset by a decline in prestige skincare. The strong performance of body care was driven primarily by the launch of Sol de Janeiro and the expansion of key emerging brands into additional Ulta Beauty stores. The growth of mass skincare was primarily due to strong engagement with our dermatologist recommended platform as well as the expansion of in-store presentation of select emerging brands. Our prestige business was challenged this quarter, reflecting the impact of increased distribution for key brands, timing shifts of product newness, and the lapping of the impact of strong social media engagement with certain brands last year. Hair care comp sales increased to low single digit range, primarily due to newness in hair tools. The inclusion of prestige hair care in our semiannual beauty event and high engagement with mass hair care products during our Spring Haul event. Makeup comp sales decreased to mid-single-digit range, while new brands and guest engagements with our luxury platform was strong, this growth was more than offset by sales decreases from brands that experienced extraordinary growth last year, units from existing brands that did not meet expectations, and increased points of distribution. In addition, sales of the Ulta Beauty collection were impacted by planned markdowns as we prepared to re-launch the brand this summer. Finally, the strength of our services business continued with high-single-digit comp growth in the quarter, driven by increases in hair treatment, specialty services including ear piercing, brow and makeup, and core salon cut and color services. For the quarter, gross margin decreased 80 basis points to 39.2% compared to 40% last year. This decrease was primarily due to lower merchandise margins and higher inventory shrink, which were partially offset by growth in other revenue. Merchandise margin declined during the quarter primarily due to increased promotions, adverse impact from brand mix and the lapping of benefits from price increases last year. Promotional activity in the quarter was higher than last year reflecting the expansion of our semiannual beauty event and incremental offers to drive traffic. Inventory shrink was higher in the quarter. Our investments in new fixtures and operating processes are reducing shrink in the fragrance category, but this improvement is being offset by higher shrink in other prestige categories. Moving to expenses, SG&A increased 8.8% to $666 million. Overall SG&A spend was better than planned due to disciplined expense management. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 120 basis points to 24.4% compared to 23.2% last year. In addition to the impact of lower top line growth, higher corporate overhead, store payroll and benefits and store expenses contributed to the deleverage in the quarter. Corporate overhead expense increased in the quarter primarily due to technology related strategic investments. The increase in store payroll and benefits was driven primarily by higher average wage rates, and the increase in store expenses was primarily due to IT investments and increased testers. Operating margin was 14.7% of sales compared to 16.8% of sales last year. Net interest income for the quarter was $6.9 million compared to $7.3 million last year. Lower average cash balances were partially offset by the benefit of higher average interest rates. The company's tax rate increased to 23.2% compared to 22.8% in the first quarter last year. The higher effective tax rate is primarily due to less benefit from income tax accounting for stock based compensation. For the quarter diluted GAAP earnings per share was $6.47 compared to $6.88 last year. Now moving to the balance sheet and capital allocation, we ended the quarter with $524.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. Total inventory increased 8.8% to $1.9 billion compared to $1.8 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 36 net new stores, the increase was primarily due to the inventory needed to support new brands in our new market fulfillment center in Greer, South Carolina. Capital expenditures were $91 million for the quarter, reflecting investments in merchandise, fixtures, new and existing stores and IT investments. Depreciation was $64.7 million compared to $57.9 million last year, primarily due to higher depreciation related to new stores and IT investments. In the first quarter, we returned $285.1 million of capital to our shareholders through the repurchase of 588,000 shares. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.8 billion remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization. Now, turning to our outlook, we have updated our expectations for the full year to reflect our first quarter performance, the dynamic operating environment and the actions we are taking to draw to drive stronger top line growth. With this in mind, we currently expect net sales to be between $11.5 billion to $11.6 billion, with comp sales growth in the range of 2% to 3%. We continue to expect comp growth to be in the low single digit range in the first half of the year. We expect comp growth to accelerate in the second half of the year to be between 2% and 4%, reflecting the impact of our sales driving initiatives, our newness pipeline and decelerating growth in the second half of last year. We currently expect operating margin to be between 13.7% and 14% of net sales, primarily driven by SG&A deleverage as we protect sales driving investments, including marketing and store labor, complete many of the elements of our transformational agenda and operationalize investments made in 2023. We will also continue to maintain our financial discipline. For the full year we now expect SG&A growth to be in the mid-to-high single digit range, with growth in the low double digit range in the first half of the year and in the low-to-mid-single digit range in the second half of the year. We expect gross margin for the year to be down modestly as lower merchandise margin and deleverage of fixed costs are mostly offset by lower supply chain costs and other revenue growth. For modeling purposes, we anticipate growth margin will deleverage in the first half of the year, primarily driven by lower merchandise margin, deleverage of fixed costs due to lower sales and higher shrink partially offset by growth of other revenue. In the second half of the year we expect growth margin to be flat to up modestly as higher merchandise margin and lower supply chain costs offset deleverage of fixed costs. As a result, we now anticipate diluted EPS to be in the range of $25.20 to $26 per share. We expect diluted EPS to decline in the first half of the year and be flat to up modestly in the second half of the year, including the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2023, which was $181.9 million of net sales and $0.46 of diluted EPS. Finally, we continue to expect to repurchase $1 billion of Ultra Beauty stock this year, reflecting the strength of our cash flow and the confidence we have in our future. And now I'll turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? Sure. Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, Simeon. What I would say is, as we think about our operating margin guide of 37 to 40 on the comp of 2% to 3%, we've shared that top line performance plays an important role in driving fixed cost leverage for us. And with the comps now below our long-term algo of 3% to 5% comps, we expect less leverage and have adjusted our operating margin expectations accordingly. One thing that I will also share is that in addition to the fixed cost deleverage on lower sales, we've embedded flexibility in our guidance to invest in sales levers like promo, marketing and store labor to strengthen our top line and defend share and so that also gives us confidence in the adjusted comp guide that Dave spoke about. Sure, Dave. Simeon, I'll give a little color on merch margin. When we think about merch margin from a guidance perspective, we currently expect lower merchandise margin for the year due to the lower sales, increased promotional activity and category mix. We saw merchandise margin decline in Q1 generally for these similar reasons, increase in promo, adverse impacts from brand mix, and then we had a bit of lapping price increases from 2023. When we think about 2020 versus 2019, you are correct. As of last year, we were about 200 basis points of merch margin above 2019 levels. And really, what I would say is a lot of that benefit that we saw was coming from ongoing category performance improvement efforts by our merchandise team, category mix and promo efficiency. Now we are seeing that some of that merch margin is getting a bit pressured as we're seeing in Q1 and as reflected in our current guide. Yes. Thank you. So, Chris, as it relates to the cadence for the quarter and our April exit rate for the quarter, March was the strongest period for a quarter. And it's for all the reasons you mentioned benefiting from the Easter timing as well as our expansion of our Q1 beauty event. Comps in April were positive, but did moderate from March as we expected, negatively impacted from the timing of the Easter shift. With regards to May and what we're seeing quarter-to-date, I won't comment on that specifically, but what I will share is that we expect Q2 comps to look very similar to the first quarter comp. Yes. Well, so we expect more pressure in the first half due to the promo and brand mix and that lapping effect of those price increases. And so when we think about the second half, we're not lapping the price increase benefits and we will be largely past the inventory markdowns associated with our rebranding of Ulta Beauty collection. We'll still have the brand mix and promo impact, but net-net, we're expecting the second half to be flat. No, real concern with regards to inventory. I guess for perspective, approximately 75% of that inventory growth in the quarter was attributable to our new brands and our new stores that were mainly due to opening at DC. We do expect that growth to normalize as we progress during the year. And I know we've shared this previously, but as you think about inventory, keep in mind that most of our inventory is current and largely what we consider core product, which means very little seasonal or at risk inventory. And as you mentioned, we do look for opportunities to invest in inventory to best position ourselves to capture future demand and so we are also doing that as well. Okay, let me, I'll take the first question and then Dave will talk about what we're seeing from the social environment with the bank [ph]. So Michael, what we've shared is that the top line performance plays a really important role in our ability to drive fixed cost leverage and comps below our long-term algorithm really causes a challenge for us to be able to drive margins at that range above the 14% and 15%. You see that with how we've adjusted our guidance. So on a 2% or 3%, our low end has come down because of the effect of that difficulty of leveraging occupancy costs. What I would say is, from a long-term perspective, we're not sharing long term guidance on the call today, but we do have an Investor Day in October and we plan to share more about the opportunities ahead, how we're thinking about the next phase of growth, and of course how that impacts our financials."

            "name": "Dave Kimbell",
            "content": "Thank you, Kylie, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. For the first quarter, net sales increased 3.5% to $2.7 billion and comp sales grew 1.6%. Operating profit was 14.7% of sales and diluted EPS was $6.47 per share. We expected comp growth this quarter would be in the low single-digit range as we lapped strong performance last year. I am proud of how our teams adjusted our go-to-market activity to adapt to a rapidly evolving marketplace, thoughtfully managed expenses across the enterprise and importantly, continued to execute our transformational agenda with excellence. As we look forward to the rest of the year, we believe it is prudent to anticipate a continuation of the dynamic environment we experienced in the first quarter and therefore have adjusted our expectations for the remainder of the year. Paula will give more detail on these revisions later in her prepared comments. Before we talk about the quarter, I want to emphasize a few important points. First, we are confident in our model and our ability to gain share and drive significant sustainable value over the long-term. The actions we have taken and investments we have made over the past few years have fortified our operating foundation and we are a stronger, more profitable company today than we were just a few years ago. And we have an outstanding team that knows how to execute and deliver profitably and they are doing so every day with focus, passion and determination. However, we are not satisfied with our market share trends and we are taking actions to reinforce our leadership position and accelerate growth. For more than 30 years, Ulta Beauty has disrupted the beauty industry by bringing mass brands, prestige brands, luxury brands and services together in an accessible, fun shopping environment. This differentiated strategy, combined with welcoming an inclusive guest experiences, has enabled us to shape consumer expectations and drive profitable growth. Today, we operate nearly 1,400 stores and manage a multibillion dollar digital business, providing guests with unique opportunities to play, discover and try beauty. With warm and authentic experiences, our passionate associates are creating strong emotional connections with our guests and helping them discover beauty on their own terms. We've created a world-class loyalty program that engages with more than 43 million active members and provides us with valuable customer and transaction data, and we've expanded our differentiated assortment and built strong strategic partnership with large and emerging brands around the world. We operate in a healthy, growing category. While growth is moderating as expected after three years of unprecedented expansion and competitive intensity is increasing, we have a powerful operating model, excellent brand partnerships and I believe the impact of our winning culture and outstanding teams will enable us to protect and expand our leadership position. In the first quarter, we've strengthened our market position in several areas. Consumer awareness and brand love for Ulta Beauty continues to increase. Our marketing amplification of key brand launches, elevation of our tentpole events and culturally relevant social activation delivered 4 points of improvement in unaided brand awareness this quarter, driven primarily by key growth cohorts. Trust for our expertise, welcoming guest experiences, a diverse assortment and efforts to increase convenience through multiple touch points drove our brand love metric to record levels with strong gains among both Gen Z and baby boomers, which demonstrates the broad appeal of our model. Newness is resonating with our guests. Recent brand launches, including Sol de Janeiro, Charlotte Tilbury and exclusive brands win by Serena Williams and Kylie Jenner Fragrance, are driving sales, new member acquisition and member reengagement. We delivered traffic growth in both our store and digital channels. We increased marketing investments across TV, audio and social platforms to maximize our brand launches, support our semiannual beauty and Spring Haul tentpole events, and amplify our brand equity with the Joy Project. These strategic media investments drove higher traffic across our web and app platforms and increased traffic growth per store, even as we lapped strong double-digit growth last year. Our world-class loyalty program expanded again this quarter with the retention of our most valuable members remains very strong. We ended the quarter with 43.6 million Ulta Beauty rewards members, 6% higher than last year, primarily driven by member retention. Additionally, we continued to acquire new members and reengage lapsed members. Targeted marketing efforts are elevating more members to our platinum and diamond tiers, and exclusive promotions, point accelerators and personalized contents are driving engagement and retention of these valuable members. Our new store portfolio continues to perform well. During the quarter, we opened 12 stores, seven more than last year, and their performance exceeded our expectations. Our associate retention has improved across stores, distribution centers and our corporate teams, and we are on track to complete critical elements of our transformational agenda this year, giving us a stronger foundation for future growth. Our teams are operating at a high level as we execute these transitions, and it is worth noting that they delivered several significant operational milestones this quarter. First, we successfully completed the final phase of our digital store transition and are on track to decommission the legacy platform in the second quarter. Second, we completed an important phase of Project SOAR with a successful transition of our Dallas, Greenwood and Fresno distribution centers to our new ERP system. Now, all of our primary distribution centers are operating on the same platform. Third, we began the process of migrating stores to our new ERP system and I am pleased to share that we have completed the transition in 30% of our fleet. The benefits include an upgrade of a key digital application to provide our store teams with a guided user experience, enhanced reporting to support inventory management, and increased visibility to product information to elevate the guest experience. Beauty is a competitive category and our success reflects the differentiation we provide in the market and our effectiveness in creating meaningful and enduring guest connections. These strengths have enabled us to outperform the market, especially through the pandemic recovery. According to Circana data, between 2019 and 2023, Ulta Beauty expanded its share of both prestige and mass beauty significantly. More recently, the strength of the beauty category, combined with an attractive margin profile, has drawn significant and diverse competition to the category. Today, there are significantly more places to buy beauty, especially prestige beauty, with more than 1,000 new points of distribution opened in the last two years. Additionally, prestige brands are expanding their online availability as digital penetration grows in the category. As a result, our market share has been more challenged for the last few quarters, particularly within the prestige beauty category. Using the consumer lens of how guests experience Ulta Beauty through all of our touch points, we estimate we maintained our share of the total U.S. beauty product industry this quarter. Based on Circana data for the 13 weeks ended May 5, 2024, we outpaced the growth of the mass market but lost share in prestige beauty, primarily driven by pressure in makeup and hair. This prestige share pressure was concentrated in stores as we increased share in e-com for the quarter. Given our proven ability to engage our guests and lead the industry, I am confident we can reinvigorate market share gains. At our Analyst Day in October, we will share longer term plans to drive share growth, but today I want to highlight actions we are taking now to leverage our traffic growth, increase conversion and accelerate top line growth. Our plans are focused on five key areas; strengthening our assortment, accelerating our social relevance, enhancing our digital experience, leveraging our world class loyalty program and evolving our promotional levers. Starting with our assortment, we are enhancing our assortment with the addition of highly recognized brands as well as emerging and exclusive brands. This year, our brand pipeline includes more than 25 new brands, including many exclusive to Ulta Beauty. Importantly, this year's pipeline includes a balanced mix of category growth driving brands like Sol de Janeiro and Charlotte Tilbury and Naturium and emerging exclusive brands like Wyn, a makeup brand developed by Serena Williams and Orebella, a fragrance brand developed by Bella Hadid. To support stronger growth of our core assortment, we plan to accelerate growth with key exclusive brands including Polite Society, Live Tinted and LolaVie, among others. We plan to expand key growth driving brands into more stores and we are excited to relaunch the Ulta Beauty collection this summer. Additionally, we intend to leverage our marketing and social capabilities to lean into emerging trends, amplify key growth brands and drive relevance and engagement and activate new trend focused events across all our channels. Social media is amplifying and accelerating beauty. Social relevance is the gateway to customer reach, connection and engagement, and relevance drives sales and loyalty. While we have increased our EMV and share voice across key platforms including TikTok and Instagram, we see further opportunity to ensure we are at the heart of the social and cultural conversation for beauty. To accelerate our social relevance, we will scale our creator network, amplify brand networks and collaborations, and use our platforms to showcase our unique assortment. With the completion of our digital store transition, we are increasing our focus on leveraging new capabilities and optimizing the guest experience to accelerate traffic, drive conversion and increase average ticket. We recently expanded our partnership with DoorDash with our launch on DoorDash Marketplace, which extends our unique assortment to the more than 70 million active users of the DoorDash app. We will introduce new digital buying guides that amplify search engine optimization while providing guests with educational content, beauty tips and product recommendations. We will improve the path to purchase through guided navigation and leverage new innovative search capabilities to facilitate discovery and we will accelerate app adoption through targeted communication and offers as app users spend nearly two times more. In the first quarter, our app accounted for 57% of our e-commerce sales, up more than 450 basis points compared to last year. Our loyalty program is a powerful strategic asset and we will lean into this platform to drive greater engagement and support top line growth. Earlier this year, we rebranded the program to Ulta Beauty rewards, enhanced the birthday experience, and launched a refreshed look in stores online and across social. These improvements are driving greater awareness and deepen connections with our members. We have also introduced new mobile POS capabilities to engage existing members and drive new member acquisition, and we are testing new ways for guests to engage with loyalty benefits in store transactions. At the same time, we are leaning in to amplify the value of the program through member love events and social engagement and we are also testing new gamification platforms, creating new ways to engage with our program and Ulta Beauty. And later this year, we will activate new marketing technology that will advance our personalization efforts with our guests. Finally, we continue to enhance our promotional events and strategies. We will evolve our unique tentpole events to drive basket and new member acquisition, increase our use of effective targeted offers while eliminating or shifting less productive offers, and to create new platforms and offers to excite and engage our guests. In closing, we continue to expect the beauty category will grow in the mid-single-digit range this year barring a major economic event. We are confident we have identified the right actions to deliver stronger revenue growth, and our associates are working together as one unified Ulta Beauty team to expand our leadership position and deliver engaging guest experiences across all our touch points. I look forward to sharing our progress with you throughout the year. And now, I will turn the call over to Paula for a discussion of the financial results. Paula? Before we begin the Q&A session, I'd like to recap our perspective on the first quarter and reiterate our confidence in our plans. Love for the Ulta Beauty brand is growing. Our member retention is strong and our teams are laser focused on delivering great guest experiences, while managing through an evolving environment. We are pleased with the progress we are making across key areas of our business and we are taking steps to drive stronger performance through strengthening our assortment, expanding our relevance, enhancing our digital experience, leveraging our world class loyalty program and evolving our promotional levers. We have a strong plan in place to navigate near-term pressures while continuing to invest in support of the long-term opportunity. I am confident in the power of our differentiated business model and our team's ability to execute with excellence against our priorities and deliver value for our shareholders. Ulta Beauty is a force in the beauty industry as we captured a large share of this dynamic category and I am as optimistic as ever about the future of our business. And now I'll turn the call over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session. Well, thanks, Simeon, for the question. I'll start with some overarching thoughts and then maybe, Paula, you can give some specifics on the operating margin outlook. I'd say broadly, we are confident in our outlook for the year. As we've assessed the landscape in which we're operating, we see the opportunities ahead of us. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there are a lot of positives across our business right now as we see strong engagement in our brand growth and brand love and awareness, strength in key parts and aspects of our business traffic continuing to be healthy in stores and online, newness working, new stores performing well. So we are confident in many of the key metrics of our business and then clear about our opportunity to address some of the areas that we've been more pressured. When we look at the comp outlook that we've updated for the year, which is obviously a key part of our overall model, we feel very clear and confident about that revised outlook here. We do see over the -- particularly in the second half of the year, our lap becomes a bit easier and so as we look at on a two-year stack, we feel very comfortable and confident in that. But I'd say more important, we are taking actions, as I described in the prepared remarks, to address where we have some potential to drive our business even more with more newness, strong marketing, enhanced digital capabilities as we take advantage of the new platform that we put in, and of course, leaning heavily on our loyalty program to take full advantage of our relaunch there. So we feel clear about what's ahead of us, confident in our comp. And then as that relates specifically to the margin outlook, Paula, do you want to give some more color on that? Thanks, Simeon. All right. Well yes, I'll talk about the overall competitive environment and what we're seeing in there, and then Paula can give you some more color on the merch margin and our outlook related to that. So to reiterate, as we look at the competitive environment, what we, as I mentioned in the remarks, this category has always been an attractive, and it's always been very competitive, given the growth potential, the connection it has with consumers, its margin profile. So we've long, for the entire 33-year history of this company, we've been competing in a very competitive environment. What's unique about what's going on today, is the cumulative impact of the competitive intensity really driven by significant increase in distribution of prestige, both in store and online. And as consumers navigate that broader choice, they're making choices. We're confident in our ability to continue to engage, and that shows up in some of the results I highlighted, but it certainly is an impact. When we look at stores opening near our stores, we talked about this in the past, historically. We do see a short-term hit to a nearby store when a competitor opens up and we're able to recover and those stores comp at our enterprise level. What's unique about right now is the scale of it to have over 1,000 new locations within a short-term period. It's unprecedented in our history and probably in retail more broadly. So it means that we're navigating that and understanding consumer behavior as we go forward. But even with that, to highlight again some of the things that we see, our strengths even in this elevated competitive environment, holding share in total beauty for the quarter is a real positive as we gained in mass and we gained in prestige e-com, in our brand love, our brand awareness, our total loyalty members, our member retention, our traffic all up, all positive, all healthy, as we see strength with our consumer connection. So your question about our consumer, the fact that we gained 6% in total members, our retention is healthy, we're moving more members up into platinum and diamond and retention of those guests is very high and our brand love reached an all-time high. The connection to Ulta Beauty is strong and we're managing through this really again, unprecedented competitive environment. And all the things I talked about, our confidence in our model, our confidence in the health of this category, and our ability to adapt and adjust our strategies and initiatives, as I discussed, give us confidence both in delivering the updated guidance, but I'd say even more importantly, the future continues to be very bright for Ulta Beauty because we're well positioned with a strong share of the category, strong connection to consumers, and the ability to navigate and adjust our plans as necessary as we've been doing throughout the history of this company. Paula, do you want to talk then about merch margin? Well, what I'd say is, as we look forward throughout the year to clarify, Paula mentioned in her remarks that we are protecting our investment in marketing, in store labor and other aspects that we know drive our business and that's reflected in our updated operating margin outlook and we'll continue to invest appropriately as we see opportunities to support growth, so all of that is reflected. The types of things we're doing are continuing to strengthen our connection with our guests. As I said, our unaided awareness and our brand love both increased meaningfully in Q1 after strong growth throughout 2023, we are on a good trajectory as it relates to connecting our guests. The fact that we're driving traffic in both to our stores and online, we're growing our connection to our app, our loyalty, engagement and retention is strong. Our marketing efforts are working. The point in my comments about us finding even better ways and stronger ways to connect is an always on focus for us and we see continued opportunity to drive greater connection through social, so that will be a big focus for us. I highlighted our growth in EMV, which is which we're pleased with, but we know we can do even more. It is the key driver of this category, the way so many consumers are learning and discovering and engaging in the category. So we will continue to have a focus there. And importantly, we're partnering with our brands to find ways to connect as their brands drive growth within our environment. So we're pleased with the efficiency of our spend. It is driving our results and we'll continue to optimize our spend and add appropriately throughout the year as we see opportunities and all of that is reflected both in our top line and our operating margin outlook. All right, thanks Chris. Yes, let me take the first part, and again, I'll ask Paula to talk about most recent trends. Yes, 1.6% comp is and we talked about delivering comps in the first half of the year in the low single digits. The reason that we see the need to adjust our outlook for the year is the 1.6% is clearly, and we talked about this earlier in the quarter Chris, at the low end of that range of low single digits. We anticipate the pressures and dynamics that I've been talking about to continue into Q2. And so as we looked at the second half of the year, while we see upside potential through the activities that I mentioned in driving elevated efforts across many parts of our business, strong newness platform and an easier overlap, we do anticipate an increase in the second half of the year, but because of the first half landing at the low end of that range, we see, we felt it was appropriate to update our outlook for the whole year, anticipating some of the pressures, even with growth in the second half of the year, elevated growth in the second half of the year, those pressures continuing through throughout the year, so that all lands us in that updated outlook of 2% to 3%. As far as April and more recent outlook Paula, do you want to talk about that? Mark, that's a great question and we're very confident in that. We have worked hard over many years to build very strong relationships with our brand partners, both the largest brands in the category and a real dedicated effort in supporting emerging new smaller brands. And that is an area of high confidence that we'll continue to be connected and partnering with our brands. We are a very large part of the category across all segments; mass and prestige, makeup, hair care, skincare, fragrance, bath, wellness. We play a significant role. We have a unique proposition. Nobody does what Ulta Beauty does. Our stores and the experience we deliver is special and differentiated and our brands recognize that. They value the opportunity that they have in our stores and on our online to connect with now nearly 44 million loyalty members and the activation and capabilities we have to activate their strategies directly with the largest pool of beauty enthusiasts in the country. And we have long been a destination for growth and so many of our brands are driving growth and taking full advantage of that experience. So I am confident in our brand relationships as we work through some of the changes in the category. In my direct discussion with brands and our overall relationships, we are working together to continue to drive growth and strengthen our partnership, add new brands, as many of which I've highlighted, and drive our business forward in partnership with our brands and that will continue for sure. Well, so first on makeup, it's the largest part. It continues to be the largest part of our business, about 44% of our business and we have a very large share of that category. And when we look at our business right now, we talked about some pressure on the prestige side. Many of the things that I've highlighted and the mass, the category slowed some as we were lapping a very strong Q1 and first half of last year. When I look out and embedded in our guidance is confidence on many parts of our makeup business and the ability to strengthen our performance in that. On the mass side, we see continued opportunities with several brands, including Elf has performed very well and has been an important partner for us. Exclusive partnership with Morphe. We've got key partnership with NYX, early lead on some of their innovation. We've got brands like Juvia's Place and about base that have demonstrated strong partnership and growth in our business. So we're confident in our ability to continue to evolve that. And on the prestige side, the newness that I've highlighted has contributed and while we've got more work to do there, Charlotte Tilbury is now in 600 stores and online and has contributed meaningfully to our business. We highlighted the continued expansion and performance of our luxury business. Brands like Wyn, the launch with Serena and we're expanding MAC into more doors. That is just rolling out really as we speak into more doors. And we've got a number of really exciting exclusive brands, brands like Live Tinted, Polite Society, Rabanne, Wyn, and others in the makeup space that are just an outstanding portfolio of emerging brands that we are confident will drive growth over time. So we will continue to drive makeup connection. We've got a very big makeup business and we've got clear plans to drive that going forward as far as other competitive environment in the digital space. The efforts that I talked about across our business apply both to in-store and online. One of the great things about our business is when we get our in-store guests shopping online, they increase their brand, love their brain connection, our share of wallet, their spend goes up two and a half times. And our efforts there and we gained share in the prestige e-com business in Q1, despite some of the other pressures that I talked about. So we see opportunity to continue to drive programs like communities and affiliates. We're doing a lot of that, drive more influencers, expand our assortment, and drive newness across the business. So competing both in-store and online is what we do, and we're focused on that and makeup as we are with all of our categories looking forward. Thanks, Oliver. Yes. As far as promotional environment Michael, we came into the year with the assumption that the promotional environment would increase, but remain rational and we built in expectations that we would be able to continue to invest in core parts of our business going forward. What we're seeing now is largely that's holding true. We continue to plan for promotional levels to increase in 2023 because of the competitive nature of this business right now. But as we saw in the first quarter, and we anticipate through the rest of the year, we're not looking to an irrational level, I guess I'd say, of promotional. And we expect our promotional levels to be below 2019 levels for the year. And that's in large part due to our CRM capabilities, promotional efficiencies. As far as specifically about brands, I don't, we haven't really witnessed any specific trends, brands that are in this competitor or in a certain marketplace. It's a broad dynamic going on across the industry again, elevated but still below historical highs. Well, let's see the actions that we're taking to drive our business. I've highlighted them and all of them come in. We came in into the year with a number of initiatives that we're continuing to drive and then we're finding ways to do even more newness being a big part of that. We're excited about our program. I highlighted many of the activities we talked about social and marketing efforts specifically around promotional program. And a few things I'd highlight is we're continuing to amplify and elevate our key tentpole events like our semiannual beauty event we held in Q1, our Spring Haul event. We've got an event coming up in the summer of this year and more throughout the rest of the year and certainly going into holiday. That is an effort that every year we continue to find ways to improve, elevate the connection and the relationship that we build with our guests through the power of these tentpole events. We complement that through a steady effort in promotional connection that's more targeted through the power of our loyalty program and the strength in the personalization efforts and we see that right now we're in the midst of a program. If you've seen in the market what we call member love, it's a three week program, each week highlighting a different category, this week focused on skin care. And what we see with that is a really differentiated way to connect with our guests again, add more value to our guests in a way that only Ulta Beauty can to leverage our personalization and differentiation capabilities, the strength of our loyalty program, and we're pleased with the results. So we'll continue to amplify the big efforts that we have throughout the year and complement that with targeted, efficient promotions that we have a lot of data to continue to optimize. As far as our brand portfolio, I'm really proud and pleased with the portfolio that we have. We've got the very best of beauty. We've got brands across all major categories, all price points from the biggest, most established, longest term brands in this category that continue to provide great performance and outlook for us. Brands like MAC and Clinique and Lancome, the Estee Lauder brand, newer brands like Cosmic from Kylie and Wyn from Serena. We've got the portfolio of emerging brands, large brands and strength in all key segments of the category. So I highlighted that the competitive environment continues to evolve and brands will adapt to that and take advantage of growth prospects where they see them. But to reiterate something I mentioned in a previous question, our brand relationships are incredibly strong. It's something that we value immensely and work hard to continue to develop. And so our brand CS as a place for growth they're experiencing, so many of them are experiencing that growth right now. And that's one of the many reasons that I am very confident in the future of Ulta Beauty. And we're very clear on our, what's ahead of us throughout 2024 and ready to continue to lead the category for the long-term. Okay. So with that, let me wrap up today with just a couple of quick remarks. Our teams are working hard to deliver against our short-term objectives while also taking necessary steps to position Ulta Beauty for longer term profitable growth. And I want to thank our more than 50,000 Ulta Beauty associates across the country for all that they are doing. Again, I appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty, and we look forward to speaking to you all again when we report, our results for the second quarter on August 29. I hope you all have a great evening. Thanks again for joining."
