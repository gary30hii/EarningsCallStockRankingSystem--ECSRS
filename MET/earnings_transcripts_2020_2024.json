At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday\u2019s earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife\u2019s SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.\nJohn Hall: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife\u2019s fourth quarter 2020 earnings and near-term outlook call. Before we begin, I refer you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides, which address the quarter, as well as our near-term outlook. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks, if you wish to follow along. An appendix to these slides features outlook sensitivities, disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information, which you should also review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In light of the busy morning Q&A will extend no further than the top of the hour. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michel.\nMichel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. No matter which lens to use to look at MetLife\u2019s performance. The fourth quarter, full year 2020 or the progress we have made toward our Next Horizon strategy, the portrait that emerges is one of a resilient company with consistent execution that delivers for its stakeholders. The year 2020 was an especially unforgiving environment for life insurance, marked by the worst pandemic in a century, record low interest rates and extreme market volatility, and yet at MetLife by reducing and diversifying our risk, controlling expenses, staying true to our investment principles and executing on our capital deployment philosophy, we overcame these challenges to produce strong earnings, cash and book value per share growth. Let\u2019s begin with our fourth quarter 2020 results. As you saw last night, we delivered quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion or $2.03 per share. One of the primary drivers was the exceptionally strong returns we earned on our private equity portfolio, which has long been an important source of value creation for MetLife. Overall, adjusted earnings excluding notables rose 30% year-over-year. Just as noteworthy during the quarter was the resilience of our business in the face of COVID-19. MetLife balanced risk exposure across the spectrum of mortality, morbidity and longevity was clearly evident in the quarter and the year. Certain parts of our business experienced significant adverse mortality, such as Group Life and Mexico. But those effects were more than offset by lower utilization in Group and EMEA and favorable underwriting in MetLife Holdings. We believe the strong diversification of our businesses represents a meaningful differentiator for MetLife and the current crisis and beyond. If we look at 2020 as a whole, some additional attributes of MetLife culture, strategy and performance come into view. I must begin by commending the way MetLife people stepped up for each other and our customers during the pandemic. That is our very purpose as a company to provide financial protection and support for people during life\u2019s most destabilizing moments. The pandemic was one of those moments for so many people who rely on MetLife and we were pleased to go above and beyond for them and for our broader communities. Between premium credits and contributions from the MetLife Foundation, we provided more than $0.25 billion of relief to help people cope with COVID-19. What enabled us to preserve our financial strength through the crisis was having the right strategy and an unwavering commitment to execution. We are a less interest sensitive company than we used to be. In a year where the 10-year Treasuries spent nine months below 1%, we delivered and adjusted return on equity, excluding notables of 12.3% and the positive earnings impact from volume growth significantly outweighed the drag from lower recurring investment income. That volume growth showed up in a number of ways. We recorded our second highest year of pension risk transfer sales ever, our stable value sales jumped significantly helping our reported liability balances within retirement and income solutions to grow by a very strong 14% and we successfully entered the U.K. longevity reinsurance market, where we see the potential for additional deals. Our expense discipline, which is one of the most critical levers we control was exceptional. We promised to deliver a 2020 direct expense ratio of 12.3%. Despite the challenges we face during the year, our actual direct expense ratio came in at 12% or 30 basis points lower. Year-over-year this represents an enterprise-wide direct expense reduction of roughly $300 million. All while continuing to make critical technology investments to improve the customer experience. Our cash generation, the ultimate measure of value creation was strong. We ended the year with $4.5 billion of cash and liquid assets at the holding company. This is well above the top end of our target buffer and comes during the year when we deployed approximately $4.5 billion toward common stock dividends, share repurchases and accretive M&A in addition to continuing to invest in new business growth. M&A remains a strategic asset for MetLife and a key tool as we evolve our portfolio to in the future. For example, we have long had the premier Group Benefits platform in the life insurance space and continue to deepen our competitive advantage in this highly profitable business. In 2019, we announced a suite of attractive new voluntary benefits, digital well, health savings accounts and pet insurance. In 2020, we grew Group Benefits adjusted PFOs by 5% and position the business for double-digit adjusted PFO growth in 2021 with the acquisition of Versant Health. And in the second quarter of this year, we expect to close on the sale of MetLife Auto & Home to Farmers Insurance. This transaction includes a 10-year strategic partnership that allows each company to do what it does best. Farmers to manufacture high quality P&C products and MetLife to distribute those products through the 3,800 employers in our U.S. Group Benefits network. At MetLife, the process of planting and proning to ensure we have the optimal business mix is nothing new. In 2020, we closed on the sale of our Hong Kong business, sold our Argentina Annuity business and agreed to sell our Russia business, which closed last month. I am so proud of what the team at MetLife has been able to accomplish during an atmosphere of disruption and chaos. I have heard 2020 referred to as the last year. For MetLife, it was anything but we seized on the opportunities in front of us and we will use our momentum as a springboard to emerge from the crisis in even stronger shape. Consider our P&C divestiture, we expect the accretion benefits will start to materialize in 2021 and will drive double-digit earnings per share growth in 2022. If we pull back further and look at MetLife\u2019s performance relative to our Next Horizon strategy, and to the commitments we made at our Investor Day in December 2019, we remained firmly on track. This was far from a given in light of the unprecedented challenges we faced in 2020. As a reminder, three of our anchoring commitments were; first, maintain a two-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75%; second, preserve a $3 billion to $4 billion cash buffer; and third, generate approximately $20 billion of free cash flow over five years. We are confident in our ability to achieve each of these commitments. As you know, based on market conditions at the end of March, we discussed a scenario in which our free cash flow ratio could fall below our two-year average target range of 65% to 75%. As John will discuss later, this is not a scenario we currently contemplate and we are affirming a 65% to 75% target range for our near-term outlook. As I mentioned earlier, the cash balance at our holding companies at the end of the year totaled $4.5 billion. Keep in mind that we expect to receive $3.5 billion in net cash and perhaps most impressive, given the economic backdrop, we remain on course to generate approximately $20 billion of free cash flow over the five-year period from 2020 through 2024, an amount equal to more than 40% of our current market cap. We believe that no matter which lens you use, the evidence of MetLife transformation is clear. It begins with our purpose of building a more confident future for all. By inspiring and enabling our people to deliver for our customers, we create value that extends to our shareholders and communities. Our commitment to preserving MetLife\u2019s financial strength is really just another way of saying that we will always keep our promises and manage this company sustainably for the long run. This requires discipline, determination and dedication to consistent performance. More than ever, we are convinced that we have the right ingredients to generate strong value creation, a sound strategy and attractive set of businesses and the management team with a relentless focus on execution. With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion to cover our financial results in greater detail and to discuss our 2021 outlook.\nJohn McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 4Q \u201820 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, an update on our cash and capital positions, and more detail on our near-term outlook. Starting on page three, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year. Net income in the quarter was $124 million or $1.7 billion lower than adjusted earnings. This variance is primarily due to net derivative losses from higher long-term interest rates and stronger equity markets. For the full year net income of $5.2 billion, which included net derivative gains of $1.1 billion was more in line with adjusted earnings. Our investment portfolio and our hedging program continued to perform as expected. On page four, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment. This comparison excludes net favorable notable items of $420 million in the fourth quarter of \u201819, which were accounted for in corporate and other. Excluding such items, adjusted earnings per share were up 33% and 34% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the segments, starting with the U.S. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were up 16% year-over-year, driven by expense margins, underwriting and volume growth. The Group Life mortality ratio was 96.3%, which is above the top end of our annual target range of 85% to 90% and included roughly 9 percentage points related to COVID-19 claims. For group non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 61.7%, lower annual target range of 72% to 77%, due to favorable dental and disability results. The higher dental utilization at the end of the third quarter did not continue in 4Q as we had anticipated, most likely due to the resurgence in COVID-19 cases. Turning to topline. Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 10% year-over-year on solid product growth, as well as the release of approximately $200 million of the remaining on earned dental premium reserve established in 2Q. Excluding this reserve release, Group Benefits PFO growth fell within our annual target range of 46%. Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 64% year-over-year. The primary drivers were strong investment margins, mostly due to higher variable investment income and volume growth. RIS investment spreads were 177 basis points, up 71 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Spreads excluding VII were 104 basis points, up 21 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the decline in LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures, excluding U.K. longevity reinsurance grew 14.3% year-over-year, due to strong volume growth across the product portfolio, as well as separate account investment performance. We completed five pension risk transfer deals, totaling $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter, a very strong result. For the full year of 2020, PRT sales were $4.7 billion. As Michel noted, that was our second highest year ever and we see a good pipeline going forward in 2021. Property & Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings of $112 million were up $87 million, as fewer miles driven lead to favorable auto underwriting margins. As previously announced, we expect to close a sale of the Auto & Home business to Farmer\u2019s Insurance in the second quarter. The purchase price is not subject to any adjustment for changes to the business performance or economic conditions from the deal announcement through closing. And starting with the first quarter of 2021, Property & Casualty results will be reflected as a divested business in our financial statements and excluded from adjusted earnings for all of 2021. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 45% and 42% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income, as well as favorable underwriting, volume growth and expense margins. Asia\u2019s solid volume growth was driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 5% on a constant currency basis. Latin America adjusted earnings were down $139 million on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting. Elevated COVID-19 related claims, primarily in Mexico impacted Latin America\u2019s adjusted earnings by approximately $160 million after-tax. EMEA adjusted earnings were up 23% and 27% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by favorable expense and underwriting margins. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 58%. This increase was primarily driven by higher private equity returns, as well as favorable Long Term Care underwriting and expense margins. The life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 59.6%, higher than the prior year quarter of 55.5% and our annual target range of 50% to 55%. While, life claims were elevated due to COVID-19, this was more than offset by favorable Long Term Care results, which benefited from both lower claim incidence and higher policy termination rates. Corporate and another adjusted loss was $198 million. This result is consistent with the expectation that we laid out for the second half of 2020. The company\u2019s effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 20% at the bottom of our 2020 guidance range of 20% to 22%. On page five, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the four quarters and full year of 2020. VII was $778 million in the fourth quarter. This strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio, which had an 8.4% return in the quarter. For the full year of 2020, VII was $1.2 billion and above our 2020 target range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. This outperformance was primarily attributable to exceptional private equity returns in the second half of the year. On page six, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. The attribution of VII by business segment is based on the quarterly returns for each segment individual portfolio. As a general rule of thumb, MetLife Holdings, RIS and Asia will account for approximately 90% or more of the total VII and are split around one-third each. Turning to page seven, this chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2020 and each quarter of 2020. In 4Q, our direct expense ratio was 12.3%. More significantly, our full year 2020 direct expense ratio was 12% and better than our annual target of 12.3%. Our five-year goal was to realize at least $800 million of pretax profit margin improvement by 2020, which represents an approximate 200 basis point decline from the 2015 baseline year. We exceeded that goal, and reduced our direct expense ratio by 230 basis points, clearly demonstrating our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. I will now discuss our cash and capital position on page eight. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.5 billion at December 31st, which is down from $7.8 billion at September 30th, but still above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential decrease in cash at the holding companies was primarily due to the completion of the Versant Health acquisition and the previously discussed redemption of preferred stock. Further cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $571 million in the fourth quarter, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In 2020, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and share repurchases. So far in 2021, we have repurchased another $434 million of shares, with roughly $2.4 billion remaining on our current authorization. For the two-year period, 2019 and 2020, our free cash flow ratio excluding notable items totaled 78%, which was above the high end of our 65% to 75% target range. In terms of statutory capital, for our U.S. companies, we expect our combined 2020 NAIC RBC ratio will be above our 360% target. Preliminary 2020 statutory operating earnings for our U.S. companies were approximately $4.3 billion, while net income was approximately $3.6 billion. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was $19.3 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of 4% year-over-year. Operating earnings more than offset dividends paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 906% as of September 30th, which is the latest public data. Before I shift to our near-term outlook on page 10, a few points on what we included in the appendix. The chart on page 14 reflects new business value metrics for MetLife major segments updated for 2019. We continue to have a relentless focus on deploying capital and resources to the highest value opportunities. MetLife invested $3.8 billion of capital in 2019 to support new business, which was deployed in an average unlevered IRR of approximately 15% with a payback period of seven years. Also pages 15 to 18 provide interest rate assumptions and key sensitivities by line of business. Turning back to slide 10, a macro environment remains uncertain and we expect COVID-19 impacts to remain with us through the first half of 2021. Also, we expect pent-up demand in certain utilization products to emerge in 2021, albeit more noticeably post-first quarter. While we expect interest rates will remain low, the steepening of the yield curve has helped support our investment spreads. Finally, based on the forward curve, the U.S. dollar is expected to weaken. Moving to near-term targets, we are maintaining our adjusted ROE range of 12% to 14%. Despite the headwinds associated with the lower interest rates and the realized gain from the sale of our P&C business, we expect to migrate back to the range over the near term period. We also expect to maintain our two-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75% of adjusted earnings. In the early part of 2020, we presented a scenario based on economic conditions as of March 31st, indicating that such conditions for an extended period of time could pressure our free cash flow ratio. However, since then, macroeconomic conditions, credit markets, as well as the company\u2019s business mix and performance have been resilient and support our current outlook. In addition, we remain committed to maintaining a direct expense ratio below 12.3%, while the sale of the P&C operation will put pressure on this target in 2021 due to its lower expense ratio. We expect to be back below the target starting in 2022 as a result of our commitment to an efficiency mindset. We are raising our VII guidance range in 2021 to $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. We project private equity to remain strong in 2021. Our plan assumes a 12% annual return on an average balance of approximately $9 billion. In addition, a portion of our real estate exposure has been shifting from direct ownership to indirect ownership through certain real estate funds. The net result will be a migration of around $100 million of recurring net investment income to VII in 2021 and beyond. Our Corporate and Other adjusted losses expected to remain $650 million to $750 million after tax and we are maintaining our effective tax rate of 20% to 22%. At the bottom of the page, you will see expected key interest rate sensitivities relative to our base case, which incorporates the forward curve as of December 31st. The takeaways that the changes in interest rates are expected to have a relatively modest impact on adjusted earnings over the near-term. So now I will discuss our near-term outlook for our business segments. Our comments will be anchored off full year 2020 reported results in our QFS, unless otherwise noted. Let\u2019s start with the U.S. on page 11. For Group Benefits, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to have low double-digit growth in 2021, aided by the Versant Health acquisition. Following 2021, we expect topline growth to revert to our historical target range of 4% to 6% annually. Regarding underwriting, we expect the annual Group Life mortality ratio to be between 85% to 90%. However, we do expect the first quarter of 2021 Group Life mortality ratio to be above the range as COVID-19-related mortality remains elevated. The group non-medical health interested adjusted benefit ratio of 65.3% in 2020 was extremely favorable, driven by unusually low utilization in dental and lower incidents in disability. Although, we do not believe the 2020 ratio is sustainable, dental utilization remains low so far in \u201821. In addition, we are lowering our expected annual group non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio to 70% to 75% from 72% to 77%. The reduction reflects our continued shift in business mix towards products with lower benefit ratios including voluntary products and the addition of Versant Health. For RIS, we are maintaining our 2% to 4% expected annual growth for total liability exposures across our general account spread business and fee-based businesses. We are also maintaining our expected annual RIS investment spread of 90 basis points to 115 basis points in 2021. For MetLife Holdings, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to decline between 5% to 7% annually, roughly consistent with the natural run-off of this legacy business. While the topline continues to decline, we are widening our adjusted earnings guidance of $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2021. Finally, we are also maintaining the life interest adjusted benefit ratio of 50% to 55% in 2021. While COVID-19-related life claims are expected to remain elevated in the first half of 2021, this will be more than offset by the benefit from a lower approved policyholder dividend scale. Now let\u2019s look at our non-U.S. businesses near-term guidance on page 12, which is presented on a reported basis for adjusted earnings and PFOs, and on a constant currency basis for sales in AUM. For Asia, we expect the recent sales momentum to continue and generate double-digit growth in 2021, followed by mid-to-high single-digit growth in \u201822 and \u201823. In addition, we expect general account AUM to maintain mid single-digit growth. We are expecting adjusted earnings to be essentially flat in 2021 increasing the mid single-digit growth in \u201822 and \u201823. Our Latin America business has been the most negatively impacted by COVID-19 and the environment remains less certain as vaccine protocols are still emerging. Given this backdrop, we expect adjusted PFOs to have high single-to-low double-digit annual growth over the near-term. We expect 2021 adjusted earnings to grow high-teens aided by favorable FX impacts of approximately $25 million. For the first quarter, adjusted earnings are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter of 2020 with gradual improvement, particularly in the second half of the year. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect Latin America\u2019s adjusted earnings to return to 2019 levels. In the contrast to Latin America, EMEA had a very strong 2020, benefiting from lower utilization in group medical in accident and health businesses due to COVID-19-related lockdowns. Regarding the topline, we expect EMEA sales and adjusted PFOs to grow mid-to-high single-digit over the near-term, given the unsustainable benefit ratio in 2020 we expected EMEA\u2019s adjusted earnings to grow low-to-mid single-digits against the more appropriate base line year of 2019. Let me conclude by saying, MetLife delivered another strong quarter to close out a very strong year, fulfilling our financial commitment to shareholders and keeping our promises to customers. Our capital liquidity and investment portfolio are strong, resilient and well-position to manage through this challenging environment and come out stronger. We are confident to the actions we are taking to be a simpler, more focused company, will continue to create long-term, sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the Operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instruction] Your first question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nErik Bass: Hi. Thank you. Can you talk about your preferred uses for the proceeds from the P&C business and do you have a timeframe over which you expect fully deploy the access capital closing the transaction?\nMichel Khalaf: Yeah. Hi, Erik, Michel. So let me start by just reiterating and you have heard me say this many times that, we believe excess capital above and beyond what\u2019s required to fund organic growth belongs to our shareholders and we would use it for share repurchases, common dividends and strategic acquisitions that clearer risk adjusted hurdle rate. So no change there and that\u2019s why we also announced in December that our Board has approved a new 3 billion buyback authorization. We repurchased 571 million of MetLife shares in the fourth quarter. In total for the year, we repurchased approximately 1.2 billion, and so far in 2021, we have repurchase another 434 million shares. So we still have roughly 2.4 billion remaining on our current authorization. We would expect to complete the new 3 billion authorization in 2021. And look, I think, we have also built a track record here of being deliberate in how we manage capital. So expect that to once we complete the current authorization, we will review assess the environment and then we would have a discussion with our Board about potentially a new authorization. So I hope that gives you a bit of color in terms of how we would sort of use the proceeds.\nErik Bass: Yes. Thank you. And then, secondly, can you talk about the outlook for RIS spreads? Why doesn\u2019t the spread range for 2021 increase given the benefits that we have seen from the steeper yield curve, as well as the higher outlook for the VII in 2021?\nJohn McCallion: Good morning, Erik. It\u2019s John. Look, I think that we have had some strong performance in 2020 to -- and we should recognize that VIII obviously came in very strong. We have also had -- we have had some kind of one-time pops, I will say, and we talked about this in the third quarter from things like we had some higher prepayment activity on some RMBS securities that were purchased at a discount several years ago. We actually saw that continue into the fourth quarter. So all-in-all, the way we see it is, we are able to maintain spreads despite the low rate environment. I think it\u2019s -- we are not immune to low rates, but I think we have a number of diverse set of products and businesses that where some perform well and low rates. And others, quite honestly, there is some roll-off reinvest risk. So all-in-all, we are very pleased to be able to maintain the spread guidance that we gave a year ago and I think we are happy with the outlook.\nErik Bass: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Kligerman: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just to follow-up on the last question, with regard to the environment for M&A is, are you -- are there more Versants out there that might be of interest to you. What are you seeing out there that might be of interest? And is there a lot of activity going on? And on the flip side with regard to MetLife Holdings, is there a heightened interest in your -- in annuity blocks in life blocks, in LTC? What are you seeing in that environment with necessarily specifically commenting on that?\nMichel Khalaf: Yeah. Hi, Andrew. It\u2019s Michel. Let me start and then John will talk to you about Holdings. What I would -- let me start by saying that, we are quite happy pleased with our portfolio of businesses. We don\u2019t see -- I don\u2019t see any major gaps there. We look at M&A as sort of a strategic capability here. But we also have an approach -- a global consistent approach in how we look at M&A opportunities from a strategic set perspective. They -- those opportunities would need to earn more than their cost of capital. We also look at potential M&A in terms of it being more attractive than share. And we also seek to sort of achieve a healthy balance between returning capital to our shareholders and investing in attractive future growth through M&A. So that\u2019s really the approach here. But if you were to ask me about sort of any gaps that we see, I would say, we don\u2019t see any major gaps in terms of our portfolio of businesses. And let me turn it over to John.\nJohn McCallion: Good morning, Andrew. Yeah. I would say that there is not a lot to update on relative to what back in the third quarter. Obviously, as I mentioned then, we do see that there\u2019s kind of a supply of capital out there that\u2019s starting to pick up. I think that\u2019s a good thing. Obviously rates rising is a good thing. And as I said before, part of our process in holdings is, we take a third-party external perspective of this business. We are working through different combinations, ideas, to think about how do we optimize and optimization can be how do we do things better internally to manage this business, as well as look for ways that there might be kind of a value enhancing transaction for us and for someone else. But no one transaction can be replicated. I think that\u2019s certainly one thing we have all learned. I think everyone has a unique situation and so we are working through -- we worked through our own and see if we can find an optimal solution. But we don\u2019t have to do anything. I think that\u2019s important. We have some pretty, I\u2019d say, best-in-class capabilities to manage the run-off, but nonetheless, we continue to take a third-party and external perspective.\nAndrew Kligerman: Got it. Thanks for that. And then just the follow-up would be, there\u2019s a lot of talk now that we are pretty deep into COVID that there\u2019s kind of a pull-forward on claims and so forth. So we have seen a financial benefit to the LTC line, and of course, in MetLife Holdings also the negative impacts on mortality. So could you talk how you see that affecting your mortality and your Long Term Care claim, respectively, going forward maybe into later \u201821 or \u201822? Do you think there will be any differences that we see going forward?\nJohn McCallion: Yeah. It\u2019s tough, Andrew, to really handicap that at this point. I mean, it\u2019s -- certainly we saw across, I\u2019d say, all key trends there was some favorability in LTC this quarter and that\u2019s probably the first quarter where we had kind of all drivers claim insurance was down, higher claim in policy termination rates, average claims size was a little lower. So -- we did see that. We still believe at this juncture and our long-term view is this is an aberration and a short short-term aberration that will revert back to trend. But I think it\u2019s something that we will need to monitor closely and continue evaluate as more data comes available.\nAndrew Kligerman: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nTom Gallagher: Good morning. One question I had is, John, I think you have mentioned your LTC block is hedged on the interest rate side for about five years. If the long end of the curve keeps moving higher and we get a bit of a reflection move here for the next couple of years, would you guys plan on extending the rate protection back in that block to further protect and immunize that business? Is that something you are contemplating right now?\nJohn McCallion: I would say we always contemplate updating our ALM and hedging across all portfolios, not just LTC. It\u2019s a -- it\u2019s proven to be a very valuable tool to constantly evaluate, look at different opportunities, develop the play books, be ready when things change, not reactive but proactive. So we would obviously consider that. Now, as you said, we are well-hedged from an interest rate perspective in LTC. Also there\u2019s just some inherent natural offsets in Long Term Care. So it depends what drives rates up, right? So you talked about inflation, you got to be careful about inflation, when it comes to Long Term Care, because that can have an offsetting effect. That can also help mitigate sometimes when rates get low. So all those things have to be considered.\nTom Gallagher: Got you. And then my follow-up is just on Asia, I thought that the guidance there was pretty constructive, mid-single digits in 2022, \u201823, that certainly compares very favorably to the big Japanese competitors. Is there something that\u2019s different about your Japanese business or would you say, it\u2019s your non-Japanese/Asian businesses are just growing a lot faster that are offsetting it? Can you provide a little color for what\u2019s allowing Met to hold up better than others?\nKishore Ponnavolu: This is Kishore. Thank you very much for that question. Certainly, one of the -- and this -- we referenced this before, a few strengths for our Japanese business is; number one, is the diversified channel mix that we have. We play across multiple channels. And we are strong in bank up, we have 120 plus banker relationships that run for quite extended periods with a lot of depth there. We also are very strong player in the IA channel, where our relationships with some of our federated agents run many, many, many, many years and similar to the large agencies as well. In addition, we have a fantastic resilient courier agency channel, which we have been investing in, and for the past couple years we have actually made significant investments in that channel for growth as well. And similarly on the product side, we are also well-diversified with a focus on annuity, as well as A&H and as well as life, and so play in all segments of that too. So that\u2019s a pretty different orientation with regards to that. Now, certainly, the other area also helps to that story, because we are in a number of markets where the growth is pretty aggressive. And you saw that play out over the last couple of years and that\u2019s -- and we expect that to play out down the road as well. Thank you.\nTom Gallagher: Thanks. Thanks, Kishore.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi. Good morning. So, first, just had a question on main trends in the Group business, you mentioned dental utilization is favorable. I am assuming it\u2019s not as good as it was or as low as it was early last year, but if you could talk about that? What -- also what you are seeing for disability claims and how much of an offset do you think these will lead to elevated Group Life claims in this yea?\nRamy Tadros: Sure. Jimmy, it\u2019s Ramy here. So let me just first kind of describe the first quarter for you and maybe 2020 in general. So for dental, we did see a significant depth as COVID hit and the dental offices were closed. And as you recall at the time, because of lack of availability of services, we did setup an unearned premium reserve back in the second quarter. From utilization perspective, we did expect some sort of catch-up effect or pent-up demand and we did see some of that in the third quarter, but in the fourth quarter, that kind of pulled back. And in particular it pulled back for preventative services. So think regular checkups, cleanings, et cetera. And as we go into Q1 for dental, we are still seeing some softness in the utilization. So it is coming in below expectations, again driven by those preventative services. So that\u2019s kind of the dental picture last year and coming into this quarter in terms of why we have visibility into. For disability, just as I mentioned whereas book for use. So disability is about 12% of our PFO. A third of that book is short-term disability and two-thirds is long-term disability. So for the STD book, it\u2019s not really a macro unemployment story, it\u2019s really all about injuries and minor surgeries, et cetera. And what we have seen in that book last year and what we continue to see this year so far is the rising COVID claims, have been basically offset by a decrease in some of the other claims with respect to injuries. So it\u2019s basically flat on the STD portion of the book. The LTD portion of the book is continues to be favorable. Now if past recessions are any guide, you would expect to see some impact in terms of frequency and recoveries on the LTD book. We typically see those impacts coming in with a lag. We continue to monitor this very carefully. But we are not yet seeing any unfavorability quite there, we are seeing favorability rather in terms of frequency for the LTD book so far.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. Thanks. And then just a question on the -- obviously your operating income was very strong, but net income was not as much and you had a large derivative loss. So I think you have mentioned that a majority of these derivatives are -- or the loss is uneconomic or it\u2019s hedging loss. But is a portion of it economic and how do you think about sort of below the line versus above the line, just the difference between operating versus net.\nMichel Khalaf: Good morning, Jimmy. So, first, yes, that\u2019s the case for the fourth quarter. I mean, if you look full year, I think, they are much more aligned and that\u2019s been the case now for some time. So we are going to see volatility on a quarterly basis and that should not be a surprise. But, yeah, it is part of our hedging program. Obviously, we put some of that mark-to-market non-cash time horizon below the line, just because the -- what we are hedging doesn\u2019t move in the same direction, so it could be confusing otherwise. And yeah, I think, as markets rise and you saw equity markets rise significantly, you can think that\u2019s where predominant level of our losses came. Also interest rates rose, so that\u2019s another place. So I would say as expected would be the punch line for us and very pleased with how it\u2019s performed so far.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.\nRyan Krueger: Hi. Good morning. Can you comment on the key drivers of the expected upside to your ROE getting back to the 12% to 14% target over the next few years?\nJohn McCallion: Hey, Ryan. It\u2019s John. So, as you mentioned, we said in our outlook that, we are comfortable with migrating back to the target of 12% to 14%. As I mentioned in my opening remarks a few things, for certainly next year and to some degree into 2022, the low interest rate environment and the impact from the sale of the P&C and related realized gain that will put pressure on ROE. But we do see an upward trajectory, given our current business mix, our growth outlook, our diverse set of investment capabilities, the returns that we have been generating on new business in the current environment. And then, lastly, the deployment of some excess capital. I think all of those things get you to migrate up and suggest that based on the current macro outlook for us achieving, probably, the lower end of that range, but nonetheless, in the range.\nRyan Krueger: Got it. Thanks. And then I just had a follow-up on non-medical health, given your comments on favorable dental utilization in the first quarter so far. Would you anticipate setting up an unearned premium reserve again in 2021 or is that more of one-off practice the volatility we saw in 2020?\nJohn McCallion: Yeah. I would just remind you, Ryan, the reason that we were able do that is, because services were not available. Dentists\u2019 offices were closed. We don\u2019t forecast that will be the case in 2021. So we will not expect the need or the requirement to set up an unearned premium reserve for that.\nRyan Krueger: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nNigel Dally: Great. Thanks and good morning. With your free cash flow ratio, given your guidance, I am assuming that you expect a relatively benign credit conditions. Just hoping to get clarification as to whether that\u2019s accurate, are you still looking at opportunistically de-risking your portfolio or is that no longer necessary?\nJohn McCallion: So, Nigel, it\u2019s John. Maybe I will start and if Steve wants to dive in on the credit outlook, I will let him do that. So, just as you said on our free cash flow outlook and just to help reconcile and reiterate some of the things I just -- I said in my opening remarks. We gave a scenario back in Q1 that assumed an extension really of the March 31st macroeconomic conditions. And then Steve articulated in that call, some assumptions around credit losses and downgrades. So what\u2019s different, right? As we said, market conditions have improved. Interest rates are higher. Equity and credit markets are resilient. And as a result, we have seen limited credit losses with the portfolio. And it\u2019s -- but notwithstanding the fact that, environment remains uncertain here. So that\u2019s kind of one. The other thing is, we have gone through as a result of those macro factors and kind of completing our year-end cash flow testing requirements and the final update for our VA principal based reserving in New York, and as a result, we expect our combined NAIC RBC ratio to remain above our target. And again, I\u2019d just say, that\u2019s a real testament to the team\u2019s approach and proactive approach to AUM and hedging. So, therefore, we -- our outlook for our cash flow guidance stays intact. So, maybe, Steve, can give some more on credit outlook.\nSteve Goulart: Sure. Thanks. Thanks, Nigel. It\u2019s Steve. I think John set the stage for that too, just thinking back, March 31st was a very different time period than we are in today and we certainly did look at how bad could the downside be. Since then we have seen obviously the Fed is really playing an active role in the markets. We have seen fiscal stimulus and so the markets continue to trundle along. However, what I\u2019d say on all of that is, our watch word continues to be one of caution in these markets. Again, some of the fundamentals are positive. The economic recovery continues -- seems to be continuing, although a lot of it is going to be based on the vaccine rollout now and what happens there. I look at some of the actions we made over the past nine months or so continuing to really manage the portfolio particularly in those sectors that we thought were more exposed in this economic environment and we are very pleased with how we are positioned today. But again, we are cautious and we look at spreads in the market today. Spreads are very tight. It\u2019s not clear that the return we are getting particularly in the public fixed income markets really matches the risk there. So we are cautious. We really continue to favor high quality names in the public markets. And most importantly, we continue to move to private assets in the private markets, which are strengths of ours and really do continue to show relative value and better risk reward trade-offs than we see in a number of the private markets. And that\u2019s where we are continuing to put the majority of our new investment flows.\nNigel Dally: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. The results in the back half of 2021, you also mentioned, vaccine distribution as an area of uncertainty. So just wanted to get some clarity as to what you are assuming with the guides of vaccine distribution. Just trying to understand whether that\u2019s potential area of vulnerability or whether you have been a bit cautious with the guides and assumptions that you are building into that?\nMichel Khalaf: Yeah. Nigel, you broke up a little bit. But I think the question was around just our -- what are we assuming in terms of vaccine rollout? Is that right?\nNigel Dally: Yeah. Vaccine rollout especially for LatAm.\nMichel Khalaf: For LatAm. Okay. Yeah. Maybe I will start and\u2026\nJohn McCallion: Yeah. And we have Eric Clurfain who took over as Head of LatAm effective January 1st with us, so he can provide some more color.\nMichel Khalaf: Yeah. And I will just say, as I said broadly speaking, I think, how that rolls out across the US. .and Latin America, TBD. But, so the there still remains quite a bit of uncertainty. Maybe I will turn it over to Eric.\nEric Clurfain: Sure. Thanks, John. So as you might recall, compared to the U.S., Latin America was really roughly on a quarter lag from the onset of the pandemic and this lag continues to hold. Regarding the -- looking ahead, the rollout of the vaccine, we expect delays and especially in Mexico. However, we are very pleased with the fundamentals and the financial strength of our business in the region and that remains strong and our leading franchise in the region remains intact. We expect our revenues to grow also really supported by strong persistency, which we have seen across the region and a good example is our flagship product in Mexico, our Met99 product and this will support growth in 2021. So just to close as you have seen in John\u2019s comments in our outlook, we expect \u201822 earnings to really come back and return to a historical levels by then.\nNigel Dally: That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi. Please go ahead.\nSuneet Kamath: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to go to the Group Benefits guidance, particularly the longer term outlook. So after a big lift in PFOs next year due to Versant, I think, you are reverting back to 4% to 6% growth, which is consistent with your outlook for last year -- from last year. I would have thought maybe there could be some upside to that just given the opportunity to cross-sell some of the diverse end product to your existing clients. So is the 4% to 6% conservative or is there an opportunity to maybe the high-end or exceed that based on cross-selling of the Versant product?\nRamy Tadros: Hi, Suneet. It\u2019s Ramy here. So just the headline number, remember here the 4% to 6% comes on top of a double-digit next year. So we are applying a 4% to 6% bigger PFO number. But if you were just to step back and look at that franchise and look at the 2020 results, we are seeing very strong momentum here. Our value proposition is resonating with our customers and intermediaries. And our 2020 results full year had a 5% PFO growth. And I would remind you that includes about a point of headwind from the dental premium discount that we provided in the second quarter. So this is a result we are really pleased with especially in the context of a challenging external environment. But looking forward in terms of our confidence in the outlook, we talked about Versant and we -- the strategic fit is there. We continue to see very good reaction from our customers and intermediaries about Versant and the integration is well underway. We continue to see very strong persistency across our book and rate actions that have been consistent with our expectations. In the jumbo market, which was light in 2020. That activity has returned in 2021 and we are kind of winning our fair share. So we are expecting to see strong sales figures coming into Q1. And then, finally, if you think about our outlook, I would say, what\u2019s coming into sharp focus here is the increasing importance of the investments we have been making and continue to make and our capabilities broadly, and specifically, our digital capabilities to kind of meet the changing needs of our customers and this is where our scaling ability to invest is paying off dividends. So to give you just a sense of that in voluntary PFOs, we saw a 20% growth in our PFOs in 2020 over \u201819 and we are expecting a similar growth in \u201821. Those numbers compound, so our 2020 PFOs involuntary were more than double our 2017 numbers. But this is a big ship to move and hence kind of the guidance is, we think is the right one beyond \u201821.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. I will stop there given the time. Thanks.\nOperator: And at this time, there are no further questions. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back to John Hall.\nJohn Hall: Great.

            "name": "Michel Khalaf",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. No matter which lens to use to look at MetLife's performance. The fourth quarter, full year 2020 or the progress we have made toward our Next Horizon strategy, the portrait that emerges is one of a resilient company with consistent execution that delivers for its stakeholders. The year 2020 was an especially unforgiving environment for life insurance, marked by the worst pandemic in a century, record low interest rates and extreme market volatility, and yet at MetLife by reducing and diversifying our risk, controlling expenses, staying true to our investment principles and executing on our capital deployment philosophy, we overcame these challenges to produce strong earnings, cash and book value per share growth. Let's begin with our fourth quarter 2020 results. As you saw last night, we delivered quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion or $2.03 per share. One of the primary drivers was the exceptionally strong returns we earned on our private equity portfolio, which has long been an important source of value creation for MetLife. Overall, adjusted earnings excluding notables rose 30% year-over-year. Just as noteworthy during the quarter was the resilience of our business in the face of COVID-19. MetLife balanced risk exposure across the spectrum of mortality, morbidity and longevity was clearly evident in the quarter and the year. Certain parts of our business experienced significant adverse mortality, such as Group Life and Mexico. But those effects were more than offset by lower utilization in Group and EMEA and favorable underwriting in MetLife Holdings. We believe the strong diversification of our businesses represents a meaningful differentiator for MetLife and the current crisis and beyond. If we look at 2020 as a whole, some additional attributes of MetLife culture, strategy and performance come into view. I must begin by commending the way MetLife people stepped up for each other and our customers during the pandemic. That is our very purpose as a company to provide financial protection and support for people during life's most destabilizing moments. The pandemic was one of those moments for so many people who rely on MetLife and we were pleased to go above and beyond for them and for our broader communities. Between premium credits and contributions from the MetLife Foundation, we provided more than $0.25 billion of relief to help people cope with COVID-19. What enabled us to preserve our financial strength through the crisis was having the right strategy and an unwavering commitment to execution. We are a less interest sensitive company than we used to be. In a year where the 10-year Treasuries spent nine months below 1%, we delivered and adjusted return on equity, excluding notables of 12.3% and the positive earnings impact from volume growth significantly outweighed the drag from lower recurring investment income. That volume growth showed up in a number of ways. We recorded our second highest year of pension risk transfer sales ever, our stable value sales jumped significantly helping our reported liability balances within retirement and income solutions to grow by a very strong 14% and we successfully entered the U.K. longevity reinsurance market, where we see the potential for additional deals. Our expense discipline, which is one of the most critical levers we control was exceptional. We promised to deliver a 2020 direct expense ratio of 12.3%. Despite the challenges we face during the year, our actual direct expense ratio came in at 12% or 30 basis points lower. Year-over-year this represents an enterprise-wide direct expense reduction of roughly $300 million. All while continuing to make critical technology investments to improve the customer experience. Our cash generation, the ultimate measure of value creation was strong. We ended the year with $4.5 billion of cash and liquid assets at the holding company. This is well above the top end of our target buffer and comes during the year when we deployed approximately $4.5 billion toward common stock dividends, share repurchases and accretive M&A in addition to continuing to invest in new business growth. M&A remains a strategic asset for MetLife and a key tool as we evolve our portfolio to in the future. For example, we have long had the premier Group Benefits platform in the life insurance space and continue to deepen our competitive advantage in this highly profitable business. In 2019, we announced a suite of attractive new voluntary benefits, digital well, health savings accounts and pet insurance. In 2020, we grew Group Benefits adjusted PFOs by 5% and position the business for double-digit adjusted PFO growth in 2021 with the acquisition of Versant Health. And in the second quarter of this year, we expect to close on the sale of MetLife Auto & Home to Farmers Insurance. This transaction includes a 10-year strategic partnership that allows each company to do what it does best. Farmers to manufacture high quality P&C products and MetLife to distribute those products through the 3,800 employers in our U.S. Group Benefits network. At MetLife, the process of planting and proning to ensure we have the optimal business mix is nothing new. In 2020, we closed on the sale of our Hong Kong business, sold our Argentina Annuity business and agreed to sell our Russia business, which closed last month. I am so proud of what the team at MetLife has been able to accomplish during an atmosphere of disruption and chaos. I have heard 2020 referred to as the last year. For MetLife, it was anything but we seized on the opportunities in front of us and we will use our momentum as a springboard to emerge from the crisis in even stronger shape. Consider our P&C divestiture, we expect the accretion benefits will start to materialize in 2021 and will drive double-digit earnings per share growth in 2022. If we pull back further and look at MetLife's performance relative to our Next Horizon strategy, and to the commitments we made at our Investor Day in December 2019, we remained firmly on track. This was far from a given in light of the unprecedented challenges we faced in 2020. As a reminder, three of our anchoring commitments were; first, maintain a two-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75%; second, preserve a $3 billion to $4 billion cash buffer; and third, generate approximately $20 billion of free cash flow over five years. We are confident in our ability to achieve each of these commitments. As you know, based on market conditions at the end of March, we discussed a scenario in which our free cash flow ratio could fall below our two-year average target range of 65% to 75%. As John will discuss later, this is not a scenario we currently contemplate and we are affirming a 65% to 75% target range for our near-term outlook. As I mentioned earlier, the cash balance at our holding companies at the end of the year totaled $4.5 billion. Keep in mind that we expect to receive $3.5 billion in net cash and perhaps most impressive, given the economic backdrop, we remain on course to generate approximately $20 billion of free cash flow over the five-year period from 2020 through 2024, an amount equal to more than 40% of our current market cap. We believe that no matter which lens you use, the evidence of MetLife transformation is clear. It begins with our purpose of building a more confident future for all. By inspiring and enabling our people to deliver for our customers, we create value that extends to our shareholders and communities. Our commitment to preserving MetLife's financial strength is really just another way of saying that we will always keep our promises and manage this company sustainably for the long run. This requires discipline, determination and dedication to consistent performance. More than ever, we are convinced that we have the right ingredients to generate strong value creation, a sound strategy and attractive set of businesses and the management team with a relentless focus on execution. With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion to cover our financial results in greater detail and to discuss our 2021 outlook. Yeah. Hi, Erik, Michel. So let me start by just reiterating and you have heard me say this many times that, we believe excess capital above and beyond what's required to fund organic growth belongs to our shareholders and we would use it for share repurchases, common dividends and strategic acquisitions that clearer risk adjusted hurdle rate. So no change there and that's why we also announced in December that our Board has approved a new 3 billion buyback authorization. We repurchased 571 million of MetLife shares in the fourth quarter. In total for the year, we repurchased approximately 1.2 billion, and so far in 2021, we have repurchase another 434 million shares. So we still have roughly 2.4 billion remaining on our current authorization. We would expect to complete the new 3 billion authorization in 2021. And look, I think, we have also built a track record here of being deliberate in how we manage capital. So expect that to once we complete the current authorization, we will review assess the environment and then we would have a discussion with our Board about potentially a new authorization. So I hope that gives you a bit of color in terms of how we would sort of use the proceeds. Yeah. Hi, Andrew. It's Michel. Let me start and then John will talk to you about Holdings. What I would -- let me start by saying that, we are quite happy pleased with our portfolio of businesses. We don't see -- I don't see any major gaps there. We look at M&A as sort of a strategic capability here. But we also have an approach -- a global consistent approach in how we look at M&A opportunities from a strategic set perspective. They -- those opportunities would need to earn more than their cost of capital. We also look at potential M&A in terms of it being more attractive than share. And we also seek to sort of achieve a healthy balance between returning capital to our shareholders and investing in attractive future growth through M&A. So that's really the approach here. But if you were to ask me about sort of any gaps that we see, I would say, we don't see any major gaps in terms of our portfolio of businesses. And let me turn it over to John. Good morning, Jimmy. So, first, yes, that's the case for the fourth quarter. I mean, if you look full year, I think, they are much more aligned and that's been the case now for some time. So we are going to see volatility on a quarterly basis and that should not be a surprise. But, yeah, it is part of our hedging program. Obviously, we put some of that mark-to-market non-cash time horizon below the line, just because the -- what we are hedging doesn't move in the same direction, so it could be confusing otherwise. And yeah, I think, as markets rise and you saw equity markets rise significantly, you can think that's where predominant level of our losses came. Also interest rates rose, so that's another place. So I would say as expected would be the punch line for us and very pleased with how it's performed so far. Yeah. Nigel, you broke up a little bit. But I think the question was around just our -- what are we assuming in terms of vaccine rollout? Is that right? For LatAm. Okay. Yeah. Maybe I will start and... Yeah. And I will just say, as I said broadly speaking, I think, how that rolls out across the US. .and Latin America, TBD. But, so the there still remains quite a bit of uncertainty. Maybe I will turn it over to Eric."

But looking forward in terms of our confidence in the outlook, we talked about Versant and we -- the strategic fit is there. We continue to see very good reaction from our customers and intermediaries about Versant and the integration is well underway. We continue to see very strong persistency across our book and rate actions that have been consistent with our expectations. In the jumbo market, which was light in 2020. That activity has returned in 2021 and we are kind of winning our fair share. So we are expecting to see strong sales figures coming into Q1. And then, finally, if you think about our outlook, I would say, what's coming into sharp focus here is the increasing importance of the investments we have been making and continue to make and our capabilities broadly, and specifically, our digital capabilities to kind of meet the changing needs of our customers and this is where our scaling ability to invest is paying off dividends. So to give you just a sense of that in voluntary PFOs, we saw a 20% growth in our PFOs in 2020 over \u201819 and we are expecting a similar growth in \u201821. Those numbers compound, so our 2020 PFOs involuntary were more than double our 2017 numbers. But this is a big ship to move and hence kind of the guidance is, we think is the right one beyond \u201821."

            "name": "John McCallion",
            "content": "Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 4Q \u201820 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, an update on our cash and capital positions, and more detail on our near-term outlook. Starting on page three, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year. Net income in the quarter was $124 million or $1.7 billion lower than adjusted earnings. This variance is primarily due to net derivative losses from higher long-term interest rates and stronger equity markets. For the full year net income of $5.2 billion, which included net derivative gains of $1.1 billion was more in line with adjusted earnings. Our investment portfolio and our hedging program continued to perform as expected. On page four, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment. This comparison excludes net favorable notable items of $420 million in the fourth quarter of \u201819, which were accounted for in corporate and other. Excluding such items, adjusted earnings per share were up 33% and 34% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the segments, starting with the U.S. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were up 16% year-over-year, driven by expense margins, underwriting and volume growth. The Group Life mortality ratio was 96.3%, which is above the top end of our annual target range of 85% to 90% and included roughly 9 percentage points related to COVID-19 claims. For group non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 61.7%, lower annual target range of 72% to 77%, due to favorable dental and disability results. The higher dental utilization at the end of the third quarter did not continue in 4Q as we had anticipated, most likely due to the resurgence in COVID-19 cases. Turning to topline. Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 10% year-over-year on solid product growth, as well as the release of approximately $200 million of the remaining on earned dental premium reserve established in 2Q. Excluding this reserve release, Group Benefits PFO growth fell within our annual target range of 46%. Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 64% year-over-year. The primary drivers were strong investment margins, mostly due to higher variable investment income and volume growth. RIS investment spreads were 177 basis points, up 71 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Spreads excluding VII were 104 basis points, up 21 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the decline in LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures, excluding U.K. longevity reinsurance grew 14.3% year-over-year, due to strong volume growth across the product portfolio, as well as separate account investment performance. We completed five pension risk transfer deals, totaling $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter, a very strong result. For the full year of 2020, PRT sales were $4.7 billion. As Michel noted, that was our second highest year ever and we see a good pipeline going forward in 2021. Property & Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings of $112 million were up $87 million, as fewer miles driven lead to favorable auto underwriting margins. As previously announced, we expect to close a sale of the Auto & Home business to Farmer's Insurance in the second quarter. The purchase price is not subject to any adjustment for changes to the business performance or economic conditions from the deal announcement through closing. And starting with the first quarter of 2021, Property & Casualty results will be reflected as a divested business in our financial statements and excluded from adjusted earnings for all of 2021. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 45% and 42% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income, as well as favorable underwriting, volume growth and expense margins. Asia's solid volume growth was driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 5% on a constant currency basis. Latin America adjusted earnings were down $139 million on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting. Elevated COVID-19 related claims, primarily in Mexico impacted Latin America's adjusted earnings by approximately $160 million after-tax. EMEA adjusted earnings were up 23% and 27% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by favorable expense and underwriting margins. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 58%. This increase was primarily driven by higher private equity returns, as well as favorable Long Term Care underwriting and expense margins. The life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 59.6%, higher than the prior year quarter of 55.5% and our annual target range of 50% to 55%. While, life claims were elevated due to COVID-19, this was more than offset by favorable Long Term Care results, which benefited from both lower claim incidence and higher policy termination rates. Corporate and another adjusted loss was $198 million. This result is consistent with the expectation that we laid out for the second half of 2020. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 20% at the bottom of our 2020 guidance range of 20% to 22%. On page five, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the four quarters and full year of 2020. VII was $778 million in the fourth quarter. This strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio, which had an 8.4% return in the quarter. For the full year of 2020, VII was $1.2 billion and above our 2020 target range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. This outperformance was primarily attributable to exceptional private equity returns in the second half of the year. On page six, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. The attribution of VII by business segment is based on the quarterly returns for each segment individual portfolio. As a general rule of thumb, MetLife Holdings, RIS and Asia will account for approximately 90% or more of the total VII and are split around one-third each. Turning to page seven, this chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2020 and each quarter of 2020. In 4Q, our direct expense ratio was 12.3%. More significantly, our full year 2020 direct expense ratio was 12% and better than our annual target of 12.3%. Our five-year goal was to realize at least $800 million of pretax profit margin improvement by 2020, which represents an approximate 200 basis point decline from the 2015 baseline year. We exceeded that goal, and reduced our direct expense ratio by 230 basis points, clearly demonstrating our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. I will now discuss our cash and capital position on page eight. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.5 billion at December 31st, which is down from $7.8 billion at September 30th, but still above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential decrease in cash at the holding companies was primarily due to the completion of the Versant Health acquisition and the previously discussed redemption of preferred stock. Further cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $571 million in the fourth quarter, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In 2020, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and share repurchases. So far in 2021, we have repurchased another $434 million of shares, with roughly $2.4 billion remaining on our current authorization. For the two-year period, 2019 and 2020, our free cash flow ratio excluding notable items totaled 78%, which was above the high end of our 65% to 75% target range. In terms of statutory capital, for our U.S. companies, we expect our combined 2020 NAIC RBC ratio will be above our 360% target. Preliminary 2020 statutory operating earnings for our U.S. companies were approximately $4.3 billion, while net income was approximately $3.6 billion. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was $19.3 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of 4% year-over-year. Operating earnings more than offset dividends paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 906% as of September 30th, which is the latest public data. Before I shift to our near-term outlook on page 10, a few points on what we included in the appendix. The chart on page 14 reflects new business value metrics for MetLife major segments updated for 2019. We continue to have a relentless focus on deploying capital and resources to the highest value opportunities. MetLife invested $3.8 billion of capital in 2019 to support new business, which was deployed in an average unlevered IRR of approximately 15% with a payback period of seven years. Also pages 15 to 18 provide interest rate assumptions and key sensitivities by line of business. Turning back to slide 10, a macro environment remains uncertain and we expect COVID-19 impacts to remain with us through the first half of 2021. Also, we expect pent-up demand in certain utilization products to emerge in 2021, albeit more noticeably post-first quarter. While we expect interest rates will remain low, the steepening of the yield curve has helped support our investment spreads. Finally, based on the forward curve, the U.S. dollar is expected to weaken. Moving to near-term targets, we are maintaining our adjusted ROE range of 12% to 14%. Despite the headwinds associated with the lower interest rates and the realized gain from the sale of our P&C business, we expect to migrate back to the range over the near term period. We also expect to maintain our two-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75% of adjusted earnings. In the early part of 2020, we presented a scenario based on economic conditions as of March 31st, indicating that such conditions for an extended period of time could pressure our free cash flow ratio. However, since then, macroeconomic conditions, credit markets, as well as the company's business mix and performance have been resilient and support our current outlook. In addition, we remain committed to maintaining a direct expense ratio below 12.3%, while the sale of the P&C operation will put pressure on this target in 2021 due to its lower expense ratio. We expect to be back below the target starting in 2022 as a result of our commitment to an efficiency mindset. We are raising our VII guidance range in 2021 to $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. We project private equity to remain strong in 2021. Our plan assumes a 12% annual return on an average balance of approximately $9 billion. In addition, a portion of our real estate exposure has been shifting from direct ownership to indirect ownership through certain real estate funds. The net result will be a migration of around $100 million of recurring net investment income to VII in 2021 and beyond. Our Corporate and Other adjusted losses expected to remain $650 million to $750 million after tax and we are maintaining our effective tax rate of 20% to 22%. At the bottom of the page, you will see expected key interest rate sensitivities relative to our base case, which incorporates the forward curve as of December 31st. The takeaways that the changes in interest rates are expected to have a relatively modest impact on adjusted earnings over the near-term. So now I will discuss our near-term outlook for our business segments. Our comments will be anchored off full year 2020 reported results in our QFS, unless otherwise noted. Let's start with the U.S. on page 11. For Group Benefits, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to have low double-digit growth in 2021, aided by the Versant Health acquisition. Following 2021, we expect topline growth to revert to our historical target range of 4% to 6% annually. Regarding underwriting, we expect the annual Group Life mortality ratio to be between 85% to 90%. However, we do expect the first quarter of 2021 Group Life mortality ratio to be above the range as COVID-19-related mortality remains elevated. The group non-medical health interested adjusted benefit ratio of 65.3% in 2020 was extremely favorable, driven by unusually low utilization in dental and lower incidents in disability. Although, we do not believe the 2020 ratio is sustainable, dental utilization remains low so far in \u201821. In addition, we are lowering our expected annual group non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio to 70% to 75% from 72% to 77%. The reduction reflects our continued shift in business mix towards products with lower benefit ratios including voluntary products and the addition of Versant Health. For RIS, we are maintaining our 2% to 4% expected annual growth for total liability exposures across our general account spread business and fee-based businesses. We are also maintaining our expected annual RIS investment spread of 90 basis points to 115 basis points in 2021. For MetLife Holdings, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to decline between 5% to 7% annually, roughly consistent with the natural run-off of this legacy business. While the topline continues to decline, we are widening our adjusted earnings guidance of $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2021. Finally, we are also maintaining the life interest adjusted benefit ratio of 50% to 55% in 2021. While COVID-19-related life claims are expected to remain elevated in the first half of 2021, this will be more than offset by the benefit from a lower approved policyholder dividend scale. Now let's look at our non-U.S. businesses near-term guidance on page 12, which is presented on a reported basis for adjusted earnings and PFOs, and on a constant currency basis for sales in AUM. For Asia, we expect the recent sales momentum to continue and generate double-digit growth in 2021, followed by mid-to-high single-digit growth in \u201822 and \u201823. In addition, we expect general account AUM to maintain mid single-digit growth. We are expecting adjusted earnings to be essentially flat in 2021 increasing the mid single-digit growth in \u201822 and \u201823. Our Latin America business has been the most negatively impacted by COVID-19 and the environment remains less certain as vaccine protocols are still emerging. Given this backdrop, we expect adjusted PFOs to have high single-to-low double-digit annual growth over the near-term. We expect 2021 adjusted earnings to grow high-teens aided by favorable FX impacts of approximately $25 million. For the first quarter, adjusted earnings are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter of 2020 with gradual improvement, particularly in the second half of the year. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect Latin America's adjusted earnings to return to 2019 levels. In the contrast to Latin America, EMEA had a very strong 2020, benefiting from lower utilization in group medical in accident and health businesses due to COVID-19-related lockdowns. Regarding the topline, we expect EMEA sales and adjusted PFOs to grow mid-to-high single-digit over the near-term, given the unsustainable benefit ratio in 2020 we expected EMEA's adjusted earnings to grow low-to-mid single-digits against the more appropriate base line year of 2019. Let me conclude by saying, MetLife delivered another strong quarter to close out a very strong year, fulfilling our financial commitment to shareholders and keeping our promises to customers. Our capital liquidity and investment portfolio are strong, resilient and well-position to manage through this challenging environment and come out stronger. We are confident to the actions we are taking to be a simpler, more focused company, will continue to create long-term, sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the Operator for your questions. Good morning, Erik. It's John. Look, I think that we have had some strong performance in 2020 to -- and we should recognize that VIII obviously came in very strong. We have also had -- we have had some kind of one-time pops, I will say, and we talked about this in the third quarter from things like we had some higher prepayment activity on some RMBS securities that were purchased at a discount several years ago. We actually saw that continue into the fourth quarter. So all-in-all, the way we see it is, we are able to maintain spreads despite the low rate environment. I think it's -- we are not immune to low rates, but I think we have a number of diverse set of products and businesses that where some perform well and low rates. And others, quite honestly, there is some roll-off reinvest risk. So all-in-all, we are very pleased to be able to maintain the spread guidance that we gave a year ago and I think we are happy with the outlook. Good morning, Andrew. Yeah. I would say that there is not a lot to update on relative to what back in the third quarter. Obviously, as I mentioned then, we do see that there's kind of a supply of capital out there that's starting to pick up. I think that's a good thing. Obviously rates rising is a good thing. And as I said before, part of our process in holdings is, we take a third-party external perspective of this business. We are working through different combinations, ideas, to think about how do we optimize and optimization can be how do we do things better internally to manage this business, as well as look for ways that there might be kind of a value enhancing transaction for us and for someone else. But no one transaction can be replicated. I think that's certainly one thing we have all learned. I think everyone has a unique situation and so we are working through -- we worked through our own and see if we can find an optimal solution. But we don't have to do anything. I think that's important. We have some pretty, I'd say, best-in-class capabilities to manage the run-off, but nonetheless, we continue to take a third-party and external perspective. Yeah. It's tough, Andrew, to really handicap that at this point. I mean, it's -- certainly we saw across, I'd say, all key trends there was some favorability in LTC this quarter and that's probably the first quarter where we had kind of all drivers claim insurance was down, higher claim in policy termination rates, average claims size was a little lower. So -- we did see that. We still believe at this juncture and our long-term view is this is an aberration and a short short-term aberration that will revert back to trend. But I think it's something that we will need to monitor closely and continue evaluate as more data comes available. I would say we always contemplate updating our ALM and hedging across all portfolios, not just LTC. It's a -- it's proven to be a very valuable tool to constantly evaluate, look at different opportunities, develop the play books, be ready when things change, not reactive but proactive. So we would obviously consider that. Now, as you said, we are well-hedged from an interest rate perspective in LTC. Also there's just some inherent natural offsets in Long Term Care. So it depends what drives rates up, right? So you talked about inflation, you got to be careful about inflation, when it comes to Long Term Care, because that can have an offsetting effect. That can also help mitigate sometimes when rates get low. So all those things have to be considered. Hey, Ryan. It's John. So, as you mentioned, we said in our outlook that, we are comfortable with migrating back to the target of 12% to 14%. As I mentioned in my opening remarks a few things, for certainly next year and to some degree into 2022, the low interest rate environment and the impact from the sale of the P&C and related realized gain that will put pressure on ROE. But we do see an upward trajectory, given our current business mix, our growth outlook, our diverse set of investment capabilities, the returns that we have been generating on new business in the current environment. And then, lastly, the deployment of some excess capital. I think all of those things get you to migrate up and suggest that based on the current macro outlook for us achieving, probably, the lower end of that range, but nonetheless, in the range. Yeah. I would just remind you, Ryan, the reason that we were able do that is, because services were not available. Dentists' offices were closed. We don't forecast that will be the case in 2021. So we will not expect the need or the requirement to set up an unearned premium reserve for that. So, Nigel, it's John. Maybe I will start and if Steve wants to dive in on the credit outlook, I will let him do that. So, just as you said on our free cash flow outlook and just to help reconcile and reiterate some of the things I just -- I said in my opening remarks. We gave a scenario back in Q1 that assumed an extension really of the March 31st macroeconomic conditions. And then Steve articulated in that call, some assumptions around credit losses and downgrades. So what's different, right? As we said, market conditions have improved. Interest rates are higher. Equity and credit markets are resilient. And as a result, we have seen limited credit losses with the portfolio. And it's -- but notwithstanding the fact that, environment remains uncertain here. So that's kind of one. The other thing is, we have gone through as a result of those macro factors and kind of completing our year-end cash flow testing requirements and the final update for our VA principal based reserving in New York, and as a result, we expect our combined NAIC RBC ratio to remain above our target. And again, I'd just say, that's a real testament to the team's approach and proactive approach to AUM and hedging. So, therefore, we -- our outlook for our cash flow guidance stays intact. So, maybe, Steve, can give some more on credit outlook. Yeah. And we have Eric Clurfain who took over as Head of LatAm effective January 1st with us, so he can provide some more color."

            "name": "Steve Goulart",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks. Thanks, Nigel. It's Steve. I think John set the stage for that too, just thinking back, March 31st was a very different time period than we are in today and we certainly did look at how bad could the downside be. Since then we have seen obviously the Fed is really playing an active role in the markets. We have seen fiscal stimulus and so the markets continue to trundle along. However, what I'd say on all of that is, our watch word continues to be one of caution in these markets. Again, some of the fundamentals are positive. The economic recovery continues -- seems to be continuing, although a lot of it is going to be based on the vaccine rollout now and what happens there. I look at some of the actions we made over the past nine months or so continuing to really manage the portfolio particularly in those sectors that we thought were more exposed in this economic environment and we are very pleased with how we are positioned today. But again, we are cautious and we look at spreads in the market today. Spreads are very tight. It's not clear that the return we are getting particularly in the public fixed income markets really matches the risk there. So we are cautious. We really continue to favor high quality names in the public markets. And most importantly, we continue to move to private assets in the private markets, which are strengths of ours and really do continue to show relative value and better risk reward trade-offs than we see in a number of the private markets. And that's where we are continuing to put the majority of our new investment flows."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday\u2019s earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife\u2019s SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.\nJohn Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife\u2019s third quarter 2020 earnings call. Before we begin, I refer you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release, and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks, if you wish to follow along. An appendix to these slides features disclosures and GAAP reconciliations, which you should also review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session that will extend to the top of the hour. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Before I turn the call over to Michele, I have a quick scheduling note. When we report MetLife full year results in February. We will consolidate our annual outlook call with our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call, making for an impactful 60 minute call. Stay tuned. With that, over to Michel.\nMichel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and welcome everyone. As you saw in our earnings release last night MetLife delivered strong financial results in the third quarter of 2020. These results are a testament to the kind of company that MetLife has become. We are simpler and more predictable. For example, the impact of our Annual Actuarial Assumption review was modest and consistent with the sensitivities we provided last quarter. We had a well-diversified mix of market leading businesses that diversity was on display and the largely offsetting impacts of COVID-19. And we have an ongoing commitment to consistent execution. A good quarter at MetLife is just another installment in what investors have come to expect of us. And what we expect of ourselves. Turning the numbers, we reported third quarter 2020 adjusted earnings of $1.6 billion, or $1.73 per share, compared to $1.27 per share a year ago. Net income of $633 million, was below adjusted earnings, mostly due to losses on derivatives held to protect our balance sheet against movements and equity markets and interest rates. For year-to-date 2020, MetLife has generated $5.1 billion of net income. Excluding all notable items, we reported quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion, or $1.95 per share, compared to $1.4 billion or $1.64 per share a year ago. The only notable item in the quarter was our annual actuarial assumption review, which had a negative $203 million impact on adjusted earnings and an incremental negative $98 million impact on net income. This is largely a function of lowering our long-term interest rate assumption from 3.75% to 2.75%. As expected, we experienced a significant recovery in our private equity portfolio, which we'll report on a one quarter lag, the rebound that occurred, a 6.7% return tracked with the mid-single digit forecast we provided in Q2. Other contributors, including hedge funds and prepayments, added meaningfully to our $652 million of pre-tax variable investment income. Turning to some third quarter business highlights, our US business segment produced very strong adjusted earnings, driven by group benefits and retirement and income solutions. In group benefits, group life mortality experience improved from the second quarter and dental utilization and disability remains favorable. RIS benefited from the rebound and VII, as well as temporarily wider recurring investment spreads. Offsetting this property and casualty so heavier than normal catastrophe losses that overwhelmed favorable auto claims frequency. Outside the US, Asians adjusted earnings action levels are up 34% from a year ago on higher VII, favorable underwriting, lower expenses and volume growth. Adjusted earnings next notables in Latin America were down 67% year-over-year, as COVID claims rose sharply as expected. In EMEA, adjusted earnings ex notables increased 26% due to lower expenses, favorable underwriting and volume growth. And finally for MetLife Holdings, adjusted earnings ex notables rose 35% on higher VII and better Long Term Care underwriting results. Our cash position strengthened during the quarter, and being at $7.8 billion well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The increase in cash is mostly due to our issuance of $1 billion of six preferred stock during the quarter, which was used in October to retire $1 billion of floating preferred stock. As we committed in September, we have resumed the purchases of our common stock, roughly, $80 million in the third quarter and about another $240 million since then. Despite the extreme disruption 2020 has presented, we are on track this year to deploy $4.3 billion of capital towards strategic M&A, common stock dividends and share repurchases. We believe this underscores the durability of our all-weather Next Horizon strategy and MetLife's consistent execution across a range of economic scenarios. We rolled our Next Horizon strategy almost one year ago with three main pillars, focus on deploying scarce capital and resources to their highest use, simplify MetLife by driving operational efficiency and improving the customer experience, and differentiate to drive competitive advantage in the marketplace. We believe we have made clear progress on all three fronts. At Investor Day last December, I noted that our capital management philosophy at MetLife has not changed. Capital is precious, and we are disciplined in deploying it to the highest value opportunities. Our purchase of Versant Health, which we expect to close before year-end, demonstrates our commitment to this approach. Vision Care is a capital-light business with strong risk adjusted returns and high free cash flow generation, like our US group benefits franchise more broadly, it is precisely the kind of business we want to grow. Knowing where not to play is just as important as knowing where to place our strategic bets. During the quarter, we booked the sale of our annuity business in Argentina, which was no longer the right fit for MetLife. While not material to MetLife, this divestment helps illustrate our ongoing process of planting and pruning in an effort to achieve the optimal business mix. When we talk about simplifying MetLife, we have two goals in mind, continuously improving our operational efficiency and becoming an easier company for our customers to do business with. On efficiency, given the headwinds we have faced this year, we knew it was going to be a challenge to meet our target of a 12.3% direct expense ratio, but this is a firm commitment, and we will keep it. Despite higher anticipated seasonal expenses in Q4, we are increasingly confident that we will beat this target for the full year. By embracing an efficiency mindset, we are also freeing up resources that can be reinvested in critical areas to improve the customer experience. A case in point is the investment we are making in group disability in the US. The shared goal of all stakeholders in the disability system, whether employees, employers or insurance carriers is to achieve the best possible health outcomes and get people back to their lives and livelihoods as quickly as possible. We are implementing an end-to-end disability and Absence Management solution to meet changing customer expectations and extend our leadership in this space. By investing in the customer experience here and across our businesses, we deepen MetLife's competitive advantage into the future. The third pillar of our strategy is differentiation, those competitive advantages that set us apart from our peers. One of the most important is our talent. A major strength of being a truly global company is that we can redeploy talent to match it against our most promising opportunities. This is precisely what we have done and the latest round of leadership changes that MetLife announced last month. And I want to begin by thanking Oscar Schmidt for his exemplary service to MetLife over the past 26 years. Under his leadership, MetLife has grown to become the largest life insurer in Latin America, with a well-diversified set of leading businesses across the region. When Oscar steps away from his executive position at the end of the year, we will rotate a number of executives into new roles. Eric Clurfain will move from CEO of Japan to Head of Latin America, Dirk Ostijn will move from Head of EMEA to CEO of Japan, and Nuria Garcia will move from Deputy Head of EMEA to running the region. Taken together, these appointments demonstrate not only our commitment to talent development, but are deep bunch of leaders who are ready to step up immediately and deliver value to our customers and shareholders. Another area of differentiation I want to highlight is sustainability, which is core to our purpose at MetLife. The best talent want to work for sustainable companies. Corporate customers want sustainability embedded in their supply chain. And investors are increasingly interested in owning companies that incorporate environmental, social and governance principles into how they operate. To highlight one example at MetLife, in September, we set ambitious new targets for our environmental performance. We committed to reduce our location-based greenhouse gas emissions by 30%, originate $20 billion in new green investments and direct $5 million to develop products and partnerships that will drive climate solutions all by the year 2030. We believe sustainability can be a competitive differentiator for us. At a day long session with our Board of Directors in late September, we pressure tested every aspect of our next horizon strategy. We came away more confident than ever that our strategy will not only continue to guide us through the current environment but position us to emerge from the crisis in even stronger shape. From capital deployment and digital acceleration to expense rigor and a culture of experimentation, we are accelerating the pace of change to win with customers and create shareholder value. Before I close, I would like to say a few words about one of the towering figures in the history of MetLife. John Creedon, MetLife's President and CEO from 1983 to 1989, passed away on October 11 at the age of 96. John's path at MetLife literally took him from the mail room to the board room. Among his many notable achievements was hiring Snoopy and the Peanuts gang, and furthering the company's expansion into global markets. But perhaps what best captures John's career was his passion for the customer. The overarching goal he had in every job was to exceed customer expectations. John's passing reminds us that we are stewards of a great institution. MetLife was around long before we got here, and it will be around long after we are gone. Our task is to create long-term value for MetLife's many stakeholders, including our shareholders, to ensure in the words of our purpose statement that we will be always with you build in a more confident future. With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion.\nJohn McCallion: Thank you, Michele. And good morning. I will start with the 3Q 2020 supplemental slides that we released last evening, which highlight information in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. In addition, the slide provides more detail on our annual global actuarial assumption review as well as an update on our cash and capital positions. Starting on page three, the schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the third quarter. Net income in the third quarter were $633 million, or $945 million lower than adjusted earnings. This variance is primarily due to net derivative losses resulting from higher long-term interest rates, as well as the stronger equity markets in the quarter. The investment portfolio and hedging program continue to perform as expected. In addition, the actuarial assumption review accounted for $98 million of the variance between net income and adjusted earnings, which I will now discuss in more detail on page four. During the quarter, the actuarial assumption review reduced net income by $301 million, of which $203 million impacted adjusted earnings. The most significant driver was the reduction of our long-term US 10 year treasury interest rate assumption from 3.75% to 2.75%. In addition to this 100 basis point reduction, we have extended our mean reversion rate to 12 years. These changes reflect expectations of lower interest rates for a longer period of time. The overall impact to earnings is consistent with the sensitivities provided on our second quarter 2020 earnings call. Page five provides a breakdown of the actuarial assumption viewed by business segment. The vast majority of the earnings impact was in MetLife Holdings, primarily due to the change in our long-term US interest rate assumption. We also had a few adjustments in Asia, Latin America and EMEA, primarily due to lower interest rates and various changes in policyholder behavior. On page six, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items in both periods. Both quarters exclude the impact of their respective actuarial assumption reviews. In addition, the prior year quarter had $88 million associated with our completed unit cost initiative, which was accounted for in Corporate and Other. Excluding these notable items, adjusted earnings were up 24% and 25% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were up 27% and 28% on a constant currency basis. Overall, variable investment income was higher than third quarter of 2019 by $257 million after tax. This year-over-year increase in VII accounted for nearly 75% of the total adjusted earnings growth, favorable expense margins and solid volume growth or other key year-over-year drivers. Turning to the performance of our businesses. Group benefits adjusted earnings were up 7% year-over-year. The group life mortality ratio was 89.6%, and which improved sequentially and included roughly three percentage points related to COVID-19 claims. This is at the top end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. We expect the group life mortality ratio in the fourth quarter to be modestly above the annual target range as fourth quarter tends to have higher seasonal life claims, and we expect COVID-19 related claims will remain elevated. The interest adjusted benefit ratio for group non-medical health was 67.4%, which is below our annual target range of 72% to 77%, driven by favorable dental and disability results. As the quarter progressed, dental utilization came in above expectations, which was offset by the partial release of the unearned premium reserve we established in the second quarter. We expect this dental utilization trend to continue and would expect the group non-medical health ratio in the fourth quarter to be at the low end of its annual target range of 72% to 77%. In regards to the topline, group benefits adjusted PFOs were up 7% year-over-year due to growth across most products and markets as well as the partial release of the unearned dental premium reserve. Excluding the unearned dental premium reserve release, which totaled approximately $110 million, group benefits PFO growth would have been within the annual target range of 4% to 6%. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 73% year-over-year. The drivers were strong investment margins, primarily higher variable investment income, favorable underwriting margins of roughly $50 million in the quarter, of which we estimate approximately half is related to elevated COVID-19 mortality and volume growth. RIS investment spreads for the quarter were 156 basis points, up 54 basis points year-over-year. Spreads, excluding VII, were 98 basis points in the quarter, up 19 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the decline in LIBOR rates and an increase in prepayments of RMBS held on our books at a discount. Looking ahead, we expect RIS investment spreads in 4Q to decline sequentially, primarily due to lower VII, but still come in at the top end of the annual guidance range of 90 to 115 basis points. RIS liability exposures grew 12.5% year-over-year driven by strong volume across the product portfolio, as well as separate account investment performance. While liability exposures grew, RIS adjusted PFOs, excluding pension risk transfers, were down 8% year-over-year due to lower structured settlement in institutional income annuity sales. Regarding pension risk transfers, we had approximately $500 million of PRT sales in the quarter and are seeing a good pipeline building once again. Property & Casualty or P&C adjusted earnings were down 68% versus the prior year period, driven by unfavorable underwriting margins due to higher catastrophe losses. The overall combined ratio was 104.2%, which was above our annual target range of 92% to 97% and the prior year quarter of 98.4%. Catastrophe losses were $115 million after-tax in the quarter, $60 million higher than 3Q of 2019. This quarter's cats primarily related to a tropical storm that impacted the Northeast and severe windstorms in the Midwest. It was the highest quarterly cat loss for our P&C business in nearly a decade. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 34% and 32% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income, as well as favorable underwriting and expense margins. In addition, Asia continues to benefit from solid volume growth, driven by higher general account assets under management, which were up 6% on an amortized cost basis. Looking ahead, we expect Asia's strong VII and favorable underwriting in 3Q to return to more normal levels in the fourth quarter. Latin America adjusted earnings were down 67% and 62% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting and lower Chilean and Kahe returns, which were essentially flat in the quarter. Elevated COVID-19 related life claims, primarily in Mexico, impacted Latin America's adjusted earnings by approximately $70 million after-tax in the quarter. We expect COVID-19 related claims in the fourth quarter to remain elevated. EMEA adjusted earnings were up 26% and 30% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by favorable underwriting margins as a result of lower claims and group policies in the region, as well as better expense margins and volume growth. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 35% year-over-year. This increase was primarily driven by higher private equity returns, as well as favorable underwriting margins, as lower claim incidents and long-term care more than offset marginally higher life claims due to COVID-19. The life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 60.2%, which included 7.3 percentage points related to the actuarial assumption review. Adjusting for this impact, the life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 52.9%, within our annual target range of 50% to 55%. Looking ahead to 4Q, we expect MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings to return to more normal levels due to lower VII and more normal underwriting results in long-term care. Corporate and Other adjusted loss was $131 million. This result was modestly more favorable than the prior year quarter, which had an adjusted loss of $135 million, excluding notable items. This quarter's results reflect lower expenses, partially offset by less favorable investment margins, as well as higher preferred stock dividends. As we outlined in our 2Q earnings call, we expect an adjusted loss range of $325 million to $375 million in the second half of 2020, which implies corporate and other adjusted losses to be between to $250 million in 4Q. The Company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 20% at the bottom of our 2020 guidance range of 20% to 22%. Now let's turn to VII in the quarter on page seven. This chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income over the prior five quarters, including $652 million in the third quarter of 2020. This strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio, which had a 6.7% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equities are generally accounted for on a one quarter lag, and the positive marks included in our third quarter results are in line with the outlook offered in our last earnings call. There was also a positive contribution to VII from hedge funds, which had a 13% return in the quarter, as well as higher prepayment fees. In the fourth quarter, we expect VII to remain strong, but closer to the pre 2Q 2020 trend levels. Now let's take a look at VII by segment on page eight. This table breaks out the third quarter VII of $515 million after-tax by segment. The three largest recipients of VII in the quarter were MetLife Holdings, RIS and Asia. The allocation of VII by business segment is based on the quarterly returns of their individual portfolios. That said, as a general rule, MetLife Holdings, RIS and Asia will account for approximately 90% of the total VII and roughly split one-third each. Our new money rate was 2.76% versus a roll-off rate of 3.81% in the quarter. This compares to a new money rate of 3.41% and a roll-off rate of 3.72% in 2Q of 2020. The 65 basis point sequential decline in the new money rate was primarily due to tighter credit spreads in the quarter, purchases of short term investments to match short-term issuances in our capital markets business, as well as higher liquidity at the holding company. We also purchased close to $1 billion in low yielding foreign government bonds, primarily JGBs, to invest cash flows associated with recurring premium income from our Japanese yen in-force block. Looking ahead, we expect new money yields in 4Q to remain at comparable 3Q levels as we maintain our disciplined approach to investing in high-quality assets despite persistently tight credit spreads. Turning to page nine. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2019 and the first three quarters of 2020. In 3Q, our direct expense ratio was 11.4%. This low ratio was driven by a reduction in direct expenses, increased availability of our dental services driving higher premium and a reserve release in corporate and other. Year-to-date, our direct expense ratio was 11.9%. We expect the direct expense ratio to be higher than trend in 4Q, primarily due to seasonality. In our Group Benefits business, we incur higher enrollment and other costs prior to receiving premiums. Also, certain corporate initiative costs are expected to be higher in 4Q. Overall, as Mitchell noted, we are increasingly confident that we will beat our full year target of approximately 12.3%. As we continue to deploy an efficiency mindset to increase capacity for reinvestment and to protect the margins of the firm. I will now discuss our cash and capital on page 10. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $7.8 billion at September 30, which is up from $6.6 billion at June 30 and well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The $1.2 billion increase in cash at the holding companies was primarily the result of a $1 billion preferred stock issuance in the quarter. The proceeds from this issuance were used in October to redeem $1 billion of preferred stock outstanding. In addition, cash at the holding companies reflect the net effects of subsidiary dividends payments of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $80 million in the quarter, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our US company's preliminary third quarter year-to-date 2020 statutory operating earnings were approximately $3.2 billion, while net income was approximately $2.8 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by $200 million from the prior year period, primarily due to higher VA rider reserves and the impact of a prior year dividend from an investment subsidiary. This was partially offset by the favorable underwriting, higher separate account returns and lower operating expenses. Year-to-date, net income was lower due to the decrease in operating earnings and other realized losses. These were partially offset by derivative gains in the current year. We estimate that our total US statutory adjusted capital was approximately $21 billion at September 30, up 12% compared to December 31, 2019. Operating Income and derivative gains more than offset dividends paid. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 892% as of June 30, which is the latest public data. Overall, MetLife delivered a strong quarter, bolstered by an increase in variable investment income and supported by the solid fundamentals from a diverse set of market leading businesses. In addition, we believe our capital, liquidity, and investment portfolio are strong, resilient, and well-positioned to manage through and come out stronger in this challenging environment. Finally, we are confident the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the capital discussion. You guys mentioned you have a good amount of excess capital above the buffer you'd like to hold at the holding company, even if we adjust for the preferred stock that you paid back subsequent to the end of the quarter. So just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about kind of working your way back down to kind of the target buffer. And as we think about the environment normalizing combined with potentially holding on to some excess capital for potential M&A as we hear about some kind of new properties that could potentially see out there in the life space?\nMichel Khalaf: Hey. Good morning, Elyse. It's Michel. So let me begin by saying that at a high level, we have a well-diversified mix of market leading businesses and I think that diversity was on display and the largely offsetting impact from COVID-19. In addition, we believe that our capital liquidity and investment portfolio are strong, resilient and well-positioned to manage through and come out stronger in this challenging environment. And ultimately, I think this, we believe, underscores the durability of our all-weather next Horizon strategy and our consistent execution across a range of economic scenarios. What I would say around sort of our capital management philosophy is that it has not changed. So we believe excess capital above and beyond what's required to fund organic growth belongs to our shareholders and should be used for share repurchases, common dividends or strategic acquisitions that clear a minimum risk-adjusted hurdle rate. As you mentioned, as you referenced, after we complete our buyback authorization by year-end and the Versant acquisition, we expect to have a cash buffer well in excess of our $3 billion to $4 billion target, but no change in terms of our philosophy and how we would deploy excess capital.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question, I wanted to get a little bit more color on the group side. The non-medical results have been pretty strong this year. Can you kind of alluded to favorable dental results, and it sounds like that you continue into the fourth quarter at the low-end of your range. How should we think about that business performing into 2021? Do you just have some initial thoughts, obviously, given that the business has been a little kind of volatile this year to see the impact of COVID?\nRamy Tadros: Good morning, Elyse. It's Ramy here. So with respect to the non-medical health ratio, first, you've got the disability part of that business. Historically, you've seen a linkage, although be delayed linkage between recessions and increases in frequency and lower recoveries on the LTD book. We have not seen that yet. The results continue to track pretty favorably on the LTD side. But there is a lag, and we're continuing to monitor this pretty carefully. On the STD side, the COVID impact has been a push for us, as we look forward. So higher coverage related claims have been offset by lower claims due to delays of elective surgeries, et cetera. So we continue to monitor the LTD book into next year. But I would remind you, we can re-price just shy of 50% of that business every year. So our block is about 13% of our PFOs and about half of that can be re-priced every year. So this is a short term business, and we have a track record of being able to appropriately react to changes in the environment and get the rate changes that we need. On the dental side, this year has been an exceptional year in the sense that we've had all the shutdowns and that are COVID related in the second quarter, and hence, the rationale and the reason why you've set up the unearned premium reserves. As we look forward, in terms of the dental business, as John mentioned, as the quarter progressed, dental offices are more fully opened. And we started seeing utilization levels primarily in September that came in above our typical levels, as the patients made up for those services. And this was offset by the partial release of the dental premium that was set up in the second quarter. Sitting here today, we expect to continue to see above typical utilization levels in the fourth quarter for dental. And you will also see us release the balance of the unearned premium reserve in the fourth quarter for the dental business.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate all the color. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nTom Gallagher: Thanks. First question is on MetLife Holdings. Just following the equitable risk transfer deal, a New York company with pretty attractive pricing on that deal. Would you say it makes you more likely to consider risk transfer for that business?\nJohn McCallion: Good morning, Tom. It's John. So let me just start with - I don't think our commentary would change here. So one, as I said before, our focus is on optimizing MetLife Holdings. It's a large and stable well-seasoned in force. It's diversified. It's got a number of natural offsets. It's a good source of sustainable free cash flow. That said, we've continued to take an external perspective in a third-party view of the business. And one, I think it makes us better at managing the business. Two, we need to do this work because it has got some complex - complexity to it. So you need to do the work upfront. And I think it can give us an opportunity to accelerate albeit appropriately, the release of capital and reserves. So I think it was an interesting data point. I think data spreads are still wide. But certainly, as I said before, I think some increases in supply here can narrow that. And I don't think it's changed the sense of urgency we have on how we optimize the business.\nTom Gallagher: Okay. Thanks. And just my follow-up is top line in group benefits, it's holding up pretty well and better than most peers. You see that trend continuing as you think about 2021?\nRamy Tadros: Hey, it's Ramy here. We're clearly pleased with the performance this quarter, and we're exceptionally pleased with the performance, especially in the context of a difficult environment. I mean, think about the rise in unemployment rates, think about we're in the middle of a pandemic as the largest group life insurer in the country and where they're paying claims and fulfilling promises to our customers and beneficiaries.  So just to give you a sense on top line, for the full year, we would expect to be - from a year-over-year perspective, close to the bottom end of our PFO guidance range of 4% to 6% and that's even if you factor in the premium discounts that we've given in Dental. And I would remind you that you should expect to also see top line PFO growth be in double-digits next year with the addition of Versant. So if you're thinking about the top line growth, we still have a pretty robust view of next year.\nTom Gallagher: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.\nRyan Krueger: Thanks. Good morning. First, I had one follow-up to Tom's question. One piece of MetLife Holdings is participating in Life, which I assume would be a pretty attractive liability to re-insurers. But my question is, because it's participating in from pre-demutualization, is there any impediment to you looking for risk transfer for that specific block?\nJohn McCallion: Hey, Ryan. It's John. I would just say to start that - I would say nothing is necessarily off the table, but there is a closed block, and then there's an open block that have participating policies associated with it. And I think, certainly, the closed block has different complexity associated with it. Both are very well-performing blocks of business. And as I said before, we have a number of businesses that are actually complementary, have a number of natural offsets, which - some of which you actually saw come through this quarter. But yes, I think just to answer your question directly, certain blocks would have different complexities than others.\nRyan Krueger: Got it. Thanks. And then on retirement spread, they did pick up quite a bit on an underlying basis ex VII in the quarter. And I heard your comment on the full year, but as we look a little bit longer into 2021, can you give us any sense of kind of the rough range to think about here?\nMichel Khalaf: So you may have heard John's opening remarks. We'll give - we're going to have an outlook call in February, and we'll give more color there. But look, I would just give maybe some qualitative commentary to start. One is, we've seen this - we've seen some resiliency here in our spreads. And it goes back to just a diverse set of businesses we have, not just in terms of source of earnings, but even across spread businesses. We have diverse set of spread businesses, some of which do well in a lower rate, steeper curve environment. And then we have longer tail legacy blocks that obviously would have some spread pressure over a long period of time. And so all things considered, I think we've seen a pretty resilient spread levels this year. Nonetheless, I think over time, there would be longer-term pressure on some of those other long-term blocks, but that ignores new business.\nRyan Krueger: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nNigel Dally: Great. Thanks and good morning. So we're optimizing your businesses. Can you discuss the importance of the property Casualty business the article back in September highlighting potentially the division could be put up to sale. Now you probably don't want to speak to that specific article, but hoping you can discuss just where it fits strategically into our overall mix?\nMichel Khalaf: Yes. Hi, Nigel, sure. So first of all, I would say this is a well-run, good business, our P&C business. It's been consistently profitable. It generates mid-teen ROEs. And it does have an important strategic connection to our Group business. It also produces a steady source of non-correlated free cash flow. So I think those are the comments that I would make about the business. And as you said, we're not going to speculate or we're not going to respond to any potential rumors here.\nNigel Dally: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nEric Bass: Hi. Thank you. Just going back to RIS, volumes have also been pretty strong year-to-date despite a lower level PRT activities, so just can you talk about what's been driving this and how you see the outlook for liability growth?\nRamy Tadros: Hey, Eric. It's Ramy here. So as we've talked about, there are a number of different parts or businesses within RIS, we have seen a significant pickup in sales and stable value deposits this year. A lot of that was driven by individuals seeking the safety, that stable value offers them inside their DC plans. Offsetting that, if you think about the other parts of RIS, we've seen more pressure in the structured settlements business, the institutional annuity business. And a lot of those businesses are rate sensitive. So the value proposition to the customer, if you will, is diminished and lower rate environment. And so think about the volumes there, as being - continuing to be driven by the rate environment. PRT, we're seeing it starting to pick up. As John mentioned, we're looking at a pretty healthy pipeline in Q4. But as we've talked about before, we're not chasing top line here. We continue to be highly disciplined, in terms of our pricing of every single deal that we look at, in the PRT space. And then finally, as you probably have seen, we are now well into our entry into the UK longevity market. So far this year, we're close to $1 billion in sales, in terms of longevity swaps. And we continue to see a robust pipeline there, into Q4 into next year. I would just come back and reiterate for RIS. We've seen a very healthy top line. We've seen very healthy growth in liability balances. But discipline is the name of the game here, in terms of looking for the returns, as opposed to chasing growth.\nErik Bass: Thank you. And then maybe, if I could ask one for Steve Goulart, just hoping you could discuss your outlook for the commercial real estate sector? And how you see the current stresses affecting both, your commercial mortgage loan portfolio as well as CMBS more broadly?\nSteven Goulart: Sure. Thanks, Erik. I think we've talked about this on a couple of prior calls. Obviously, it's an important topic. It's an important investment for us, in commercial mortgage loans. We continue to be optimistic, about the sector. We like it. We continue to invest in the sector. I think back actually to some of the comments I made, I think it was actually in perhaps a response to one of your questions. But we did see deferral requests, as we entered into the COVID pandemic. I think I mentioned on our last earnings call that those got to about 9%, of our principal balance outstanding, but that appears to be sort of where we topped out. And what's most important now is, as those are rolling off the deferral cost, we've seen 60% of them roll off. And they've all gone back to resuming payment. So I think that supports our underlying view of strength in this sector, Eric. And it continues to be important for us.\nErik Bass: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi. Please go ahead.\nSuneet Kamath: Thanks. I wanted to ask about Asia sales. They're down year-over-year, but up pretty sharply, on a sequential quarter basis. Just curious, what's going on there? We had heard from another company, that there was a pull forward of sales because of some rate changes that helped their sales growth. Just wondering, if there was any kind of similar dynamic at met? Or more specifically what you're seeing, in terms of driving that growth?\nKishore Ponnavolu: Suneet, this is Kishore. Let me say that the premise of your question is correct in the first part, so let me - based on your question, let me start by putting a little bit of context to our sales performance in Q2. In the second quarter, lockdowns and social distancing restrictions had a significant impact on our sales. And Q2 sales for Asia overall dropped 44%, 55% in Japan compared to prior year. To overcome this challenge, we took several distribution and product actions. As you're well aware of all the past investments, we've been making in sales platforms. And on top of that, we implemented several digital solutions to augment our face-to-face interactions. And we also stepped up our sales management activities as well. And because of these actions, we've seen a very strong recovery in Q3 sales, as you rightly pointed out. Q3 sales increased sequentially, 63% for overall Asia, 85% in Japan. And our year-over-year drop is now reduced to 16%. So you asked about the re-pricing that was we did re-price our level premium FX product. It was contributing, but not a major factor in driving our sequential growth. So another way to look at this is to how we're seeing, how this is going to play out for the rest of the year. We expect the impact of our actions that we've taken so far to sustain our Q3 momentum. While the environment is still challenging for face-to-face sales environment, we're seeing a pickup in our sales pipeline, and you should expect a positive year-on-year growth for Asia as a whole.\nSuneet Kamath: Got it. Thanks for that. And then I guess - yes. No, it does. Another quick one for John on the VA block. Just curious, as you've mentioned something about reserves on a statutory basis, but is this block sort of past the peak reserve funding period? Or are you still sort of building reserves as the block matures? And at what point do you think you'd be at sort of peak reserves? Thanks.\nJohn McCallion: Good morning, Suneet. Just as a reminder, we have roughly $50 billion of VA account balances. Half of it is a living benefit guarantee. As we showed you back at Investor Day, and that has been rolling off consistently over time. Having said that, there are certain components of that block that are building reserves and others that are, I'd say, kind of have - kind of settled down in terms of the reserve build. So it depends on which vintage you're talking about.\nSuneet Kamath: Is there any way to give us a percentage of the block at that peak reserves versus the block that's still building?\nJohn McCallion: I probably have to get back to you on that. I don't have it handy.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. Thanks.\nJohn McCallion: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi. Good morning. I had a couple of questions. First, on your Latin America business, sales were down a decent amount year-over-year. I'm assuming that's mostly because of COVID. And to the extent it is, can you give us any color on whether things got better as the quarter went on? And how do you see things working out through the next quarter or two? And then I have another one.\nOscar Schmidt: Yes. Hi, Jimmy. This is Oscar. So let me talk about the quality of our top line overall. So as you said, sales are down because of social distancing because of COVID that affects the entire region. But if you think about it, the sales that we're performing are all done remotely is really good performance considering the potential after social distancing goes away. But if you think about our premiums and fees, and you exclude PF. And let me say that PF in Chile, sales are really down because most of Chileans are deferring their decision to retire. So PF sales are really down. If you exclude PF impacts in our premiums and fees, year-over-year, we are growing above mid-single digits, which is pretty healthy considering the COVID environment. And that speaks about the quality of our persistency, not just the resilient sale [ph]. So we are very confident about our topline health, particularly if you strip out the PES, which, as I said are, obviously, related to a few number of silencing to retire. So we're very confident as well that as our agents are for core channels, they learn to remotely as they can start dealing face-to-face with these customers, sales are going to go back to normal and it's happening. So we're very happy about the potential.\nJimmy Bhullar: And then maybe a bigger picture question. You've done a few sort of niche acquisitions in Group benefits. But - and obviously, you're deploying capital towards buybacks as well. Given your - where your stock price is, can you comment on your interest in sort of larger acquisitions and how you think about those because there are - there is a decent amount of activity in the business lines that you're in. Are you interested in large acquisitions as well? Or not as much given sort of the potential accretion from buybacks at this price?\nOscar Schmidt: Hi, Jimmy. Look, I mean, I go back to our strategy and what we shared with you at Investor Day last December. If I look at our portfolio, especially factoring in some of the recent acquisitions, Versant Health, that in [Indiscernible] PetFirst and Digital Willing [ph] I don't - we don't see gaps in terms of the portfolio that - of businesses that we have. We see plenty of organic growth opportunities. And we're focused on getting the synergies and whether cost or revenue synergies from those acquisitions that I referenced. So hopefully, that gives you a bit of sort of insight into our thinking here.\nJimmy Bhullar: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.\nHumphrey Lee: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. My first question is, when looking at the annual assumption review, should we think about where there's going to be some ongoing run rate earnings impact into some of your segments?\nJohn McCallion: Good morning, Humphrey. Its John. No, we don't expect any material changes in ongoing run rate earnings as a result of the assumption review.\nHumphrey Lee: Got it. My second question is, I think, in Michel's prepared remarks, you talked about entering into absence management business. How should we think about the corresponding expense impact from the investment into the business? Especially since some of your peers have incurred quite a meaningful labor expenses for this business as they ramp up?\nRamy Tadros: Hi, Humphrey. Its Ramy here. So in terms of our actual expenses relating to our disability business this quarter, we're running right on line with expectations. So, we're not really seeing any impact here whatsoever. What Michel was talking about is some of our broader investments in technology and platform around disability and absence management. All of those numbers on all of those investments have been baked into our run rate that you've seen over the past many quarters. And our investments here are in areas like pricing sophistication, contract competitiveness, clinical model in terms of the return to health initiatives, which are critical for the LTD business. And we've already seen positive business outcomes and end-to-end disability and absence management solution, which Michel is talking about is already resonating in the market with the larger employers. It includes things like the digital interface for claimants, AI-driven automated claim processing, sophisticated data analytics for employers so that they can understand their workforce. And we're expecting to see growth here, although growth with discipline in this area going forward.\nJohn McCallion: And Humphrey, it's John. I would just add just to Ramy's point there. In a little bit the way you asked the question, this is all part of the - as we refer to as the efficiency mindset concept, where we continue to drive efficiencies every quarter in the firm and look for opportunities then to redeploy that into strategic reinvestments to support our market leading businesses and doing all of that within our run rate costs. So I would just go back to that point. We made that point at Investor Day, and I think it's a key component for us as we move forward.\nHumphrey Lee: Got it. Appreciate the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nJohn Barnidge: Thank you. Another licensure that reported last night talked about elevated non-COVID mortality from delaying care, heart attacks and deaths of despair in their book. As it relates to the Group Life business and benefits, are you seeing signs of this?\nRamy Tadros: No, we're not.\nJohn Barnidge: Okay. And then, are you seeing any signs of permanent change of behavior coming out of COVID that may impact claims utilization trends on a more secular basis? Thank you for the answers.\nRamy Tadros: Not yet.\nOperator: And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd now like to turn the call back to Michel Khalaf.\nMichel Khalaf: Thank you. In closing, I believe our performance in Q3 and so far in 2020, underscores the sense of urgency and laser focus and how this leadership team is executing on our Next Horizon strategy to create long-term shareholder value. I am thankful and proud of the effort and commitment of our employees around the world, who are going above and beyond to deliver for our customers. Please be safe and talk soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Michel Khalaf",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and welcome everyone. As you saw in our earnings release last night MetLife delivered strong financial results in the third quarter of 2020. These results are a testament to the kind of company that MetLife has become. We are simpler and more predictable. For example, the impact of our Annual Actuarial Assumption review was modest and consistent with the sensitivities we provided last quarter. We had a well-diversified mix of market leading businesses that diversity was on display and the largely offsetting impacts of COVID-19. And we have an ongoing commitment to consistent execution. A good quarter at MetLife is just another installment in what investors have come to expect of us. And what we expect of ourselves. Turning the numbers, we reported third quarter 2020 adjusted earnings of $1.6 billion, or $1.73 per share, compared to $1.27 per share a year ago. Net income of $633 million, was below adjusted earnings, mostly due to losses on derivatives held to protect our balance sheet against movements and equity markets and interest rates. For year-to-date 2020, MetLife has generated $5.1 billion of net income. Excluding all notable items, we reported quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion, or $1.95 per share, compared to $1.4 billion or $1.64 per share a year ago. The only notable item in the quarter was our annual actuarial assumption review, which had a negative $203 million impact on adjusted earnings and an incremental negative $98 million impact on net income. This is largely a function of lowering our long-term interest rate assumption from 3.75% to 2.75%. As expected, we experienced a significant recovery in our private equity portfolio, which we'll report on a one quarter lag, the rebound that occurred, a 6.7% return tracked with the mid-single digit forecast we provided in Q2. Other contributors, including hedge funds and prepayments, added meaningfully to our $652 million of pre-tax variable investment income. Turning to some third quarter business highlights, our US business segment produced very strong adjusted earnings, driven by group benefits and retirement and income solutions. In group benefits, group life mortality experience improved from the second quarter and dental utilization and disability remains favorable. RIS benefited from the rebound and VII, as well as temporarily wider recurring investment spreads. Offsetting this property and casualty so heavier than normal catastrophe losses that overwhelmed favorable auto claims frequency. Outside the US, Asians adjusted earnings action levels are up 34% from a year ago on higher VII, favorable underwriting, lower expenses and volume growth. Adjusted earnings next notables in Latin America were down 67% year-over-year, as COVID claims rose sharply as expected. In EMEA, adjusted earnings ex notables increased 26% due to lower expenses, favorable underwriting and volume growth. And finally for MetLife Holdings, adjusted earnings ex notables rose 35% on higher VII and better Long Term Care underwriting results. Our cash position strengthened during the quarter, and being at $7.8 billion well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The increase in cash is mostly due to our issuance of $1 billion of six preferred stock during the quarter, which was used in October to retire $1 billion of floating preferred stock. As we committed in September, we have resumed the purchases of our common stock, roughly, $80 million in the third quarter and about another $240 million since then. Despite the extreme disruption 2020 has presented, we are on track this year to deploy $4.3 billion of capital towards strategic M&A, common stock dividends and share repurchases. We believe this underscores the durability of our all-weather Next Horizon strategy and MetLife's consistent execution across a range of economic scenarios. We rolled our Next Horizon strategy almost one year ago with three main pillars, focus on deploying scarce capital and resources to their highest use, simplify MetLife by driving operational efficiency and improving the customer experience, and differentiate to drive competitive advantage in the marketplace. We believe we have made clear progress on all three fronts. At Investor Day last December, I noted that our capital management philosophy at MetLife has not changed. Capital is precious, and we are disciplined in deploying it to the highest value opportunities. Our purchase of Versant Health, which we expect to close before year-end, demonstrates our commitment to this approach. Vision Care is a capital-light business with strong risk adjusted returns and high free cash flow generation, like our US group benefits franchise more broadly, it is precisely the kind of business we want to grow. Knowing where not to play is just as important as knowing where to place our strategic bets. During the quarter, we booked the sale of our annuity business in Argentina, which was no longer the right fit for MetLife. While not material to MetLife, this divestment helps illustrate our ongoing process of planting and pruning in an effort to achieve the optimal business mix. When we talk about simplifying MetLife, we have two goals in mind, continuously improving our operational efficiency and becoming an easier company for our customers to do business with. On efficiency, given the headwinds we have faced this year, we knew it was going to be a challenge to meet our target of a 12.3% direct expense ratio, but this is a firm commitment, and we will keep it. Despite higher anticipated seasonal expenses in Q4, we are increasingly confident that we will beat this target for the full year. By embracing an efficiency mindset, we are also freeing up resources that can be reinvested in critical areas to improve the customer experience. A case in point is the investment we are making in group disability in the US. The shared goal of all stakeholders in the disability system, whether employees, employers or insurance carriers is to achieve the best possible health outcomes and get people back to their lives and livelihoods as quickly as possible. We are implementing an end-to-end disability and Absence Management solution to meet changing customer expectations and extend our leadership in this space. By investing in the customer experience here and across our businesses, we deepen MetLife's competitive advantage into the future. The third pillar of our strategy is differentiation, those competitive advantages that set us apart from our peers. One of the most important is our talent. A major strength of being a truly global company is that we can redeploy talent to match it against our most promising opportunities. This is precisely what we have done and the latest round of leadership changes that MetLife announced last month. And I want to begin by thanking Oscar Schmidt for his exemplary service to MetLife over the past 26 years. Under his leadership, MetLife has grown to become the largest life insurer in Latin America, with a well-diversified set of leading businesses across the region. When Oscar steps away from his executive position at the end of the year, we will rotate a number of executives into new roles. Eric Clurfain will move from CEO of Japan to Head of Latin America, Dirk Ostijn will move from Head of EMEA to CEO of Japan, and Nuria Garcia will move from Deputy Head of EMEA to running the region. Taken together, these appointments demonstrate not only our commitment to talent development, but are deep bunch of leaders who are ready to step up immediately and deliver value to our customers and shareholders. Another area of differentiation I want to highlight is sustainability, which is core to our purpose at MetLife. The best talent want to work for sustainable companies. Corporate customers want sustainability embedded in their supply chain. And investors are increasingly interested in owning companies that incorporate environmental, social and governance principles into how they operate. To highlight one example at MetLife, in September, we set ambitious new targets for our environmental performance. We committed to reduce our location-based greenhouse gas emissions by 30%, originate $20 billion in new green investments and direct $5 million to develop products and partnerships that will drive climate solutions all by the year 2030. We believe sustainability can be a competitive differentiator for us. At a day long session with our Board of Directors in late September, we pressure tested every aspect of our next horizon strategy. We came away more confident than ever that our strategy will not only continue to guide us through the current environment but position us to emerge from the crisis in even stronger shape. From capital deployment and digital acceleration to expense rigor and a culture of experimentation, we are accelerating the pace of change to win with customers and create shareholder value. Before I close, I would like to say a few words about one of the towering figures in the history of MetLife. John Creedon, MetLife's President and CEO from 1983 to 1989, passed away on October 11 at the age of 96. John's path at MetLife literally took him from the mail room to the board room. Among his many notable achievements was hiring Snoopy and the Peanuts gang, and furthering the company's expansion into global markets. But perhaps what best captures John's career was his passion for the customer. The overarching goal he had in every job was to exceed customer expectations. John's passing reminds us that we are stewards of a great institution. MetLife was around long before we got here, and it will be around long after we are gone. Our task is to create long-term value for MetLife's many stakeholders, including our shareholders, to ensure in the words of our purpose statement that we will be always with you build in a more confident future. With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion. Hey. Good morning, Elyse. It's Michel. So let me begin by saying that at a high level, we have a well-diversified mix of market leading businesses and I think that diversity was on display and the largely offsetting impact from COVID-19. In addition, we believe that our capital liquidity and investment portfolio are strong, resilient and well-positioned to manage through and come out stronger in this challenging environment. And ultimately, I think this, we believe, underscores the durability of our all-weather next Horizon strategy and our consistent execution across a range of economic scenarios. What I would say around sort of our capital management philosophy is that it has not changed. So we believe excess capital above and beyond what's required to fund organic growth belongs to our shareholders and should be used for share repurchases, common dividends or strategic acquisitions that clear a minimum risk-adjusted hurdle rate. As you mentioned, as you referenced, after we complete our buyback authorization by year-end and the Versant acquisition, we expect to have a cash buffer well in excess of our $3 billion to $4 billion target, but no change in terms of our philosophy and how we would deploy excess capital. So you may have heard John's opening remarks. We'll give - we're going to have an outlook call in February, and we'll give more color there. But look, I would just give maybe some qualitative commentary to start. One is, we've seen this - we've seen some resiliency here in our spreads. And it goes back to just a diverse set of businesses we have, not just in terms of source of earnings, but even across spread businesses. We have diverse set of spread businesses, some of which do well in a lower rate, steeper curve environment. And then we have longer tail legacy blocks that obviously would have some spread pressure over a long period of time. And so all things considered, I think we've seen a pretty resilient spread levels this year. Nonetheless, I think over time, there would be longer-term pressure on some of those other long-term blocks, but that ignores new business. Yes. Hi, Nigel, sure. So first of all, I would say this is a well-run, good business, our P&C business. It's been consistently profitable. It generates mid-teen ROEs. And it does have an important strategic connection to our Group business. It also produces a steady source of non-correlated free cash flow. So I think those are the comments that I would make about the business. And as you said, we're not going to speculate or we're not going to respond to any potential rumors here. Thank you. In closing, I believe our performance in Q3 and so far in 2020, underscores the sense of urgency and laser focus and how this leadership team is executing on our Next Horizon strategy to create long-term shareholder value. I am thankful and proud of the effort and commitment of our employees around the world, who are going above and beyond to deliver for our customers. Please be safe and talk soon."

            "name": "Ramy Tadros",
            "content": "Good morning, Elyse. It's Ramy here. So with respect to the non-medical health ratio, first, you've got the disability part of that business. Historically, you've seen a linkage, although be delayed linkage between recessions and increases in frequency and lower recoveries on the LTD book. We have not seen that yet. The results continue to track pretty favorably on the LTD side. But there is a lag, and we're continuing to monitor this pretty carefully. On the STD side, the COVID impact has been a push for us, as we look forward. So higher coverage related claims have been offset by lower claims due to delays of elective surgeries, et cetera. So we continue to monitor the LTD book into next year. But I would remind you, we can re-price just shy of 50% of that business every year. So our block is about 13% of our PFOs and about half of that can be re-priced every year. So this is a short term business, and we have a track record of being able to appropriately react to changes in the environment and get the rate changes that we need. On the dental side, this year has been an exceptional year in the sense that we've had all the shutdowns and that are COVID related in the second quarter, and hence, the rationale and the reason why you've set up the unearned premium reserves. As we look forward, in terms of the dental business, as John mentioned, as the quarter progressed, dental offices are more fully opened. And we started seeing utilization levels primarily in September that came in above our typical levels, as the patients made up for those services. And this was offset by the partial release of the dental premium that was set up in the second quarter. Sitting here today, we expect to continue to see above typical utilization levels in the fourth quarter for dental. And you will also see us release the balance of the unearned premium reserve in the fourth quarter for the dental business. Hey, it's Ramy here. We're clearly pleased with the performance this quarter, and we're exceptionally pleased with the performance, especially in the context of a difficult environment. I mean, think about the rise in unemployment rates, think about we're in the middle of a pandemic as the largest group life insurer in the country and where they're paying claims and fulfilling promises to our customers and beneficiaries.  So just to give you a sense on top line, for the full year, we would expect to be - from a year-over-year perspective, close to the bottom end of our PFO guidance range of 4% to 6% and that's even if you factor in the premium discounts that we've given in Dental. And I would remind you that you should expect to also see top line PFO growth be in double-digits next year with the addition of Versant. So if you're thinking about the top line growth, we still have a pretty robust view of next year. Hey, Eric. It's Ramy here. So as we've talked about, there are a number of different parts or businesses within RIS, we have seen a significant pickup in sales and stable value deposits this year. A lot of that was driven by individuals seeking the safety, that stable value offers them inside their DC plans. Offsetting that, if you think about the other parts of RIS, we've seen more pressure in the structured settlements business, the institutional annuity business. And a lot of those businesses are rate sensitive. So the value proposition to the customer, if you will, is diminished and lower rate environment. And so think about the volumes there, as being - continuing to be driven by the rate environment. PRT, we're seeing it starting to pick up. As John mentioned, we're looking at a pretty healthy pipeline in Q4. But as we've talked about before, we're not chasing top line here. We continue to be highly disciplined, in terms of our pricing of every single deal that we look at, in the PRT space. And then finally, as you probably have seen, we are now well into our entry into the UK longevity market. So far this year, we're close to $1 billion in sales, in terms of longevity swaps. And we continue to see a robust pipeline there, into Q4 into next year. I would just come back and reiterate for RIS. We've seen a very healthy top line. We've seen very healthy growth in liability balances. But discipline is the name of the game here, in terms of looking for the returns, as opposed to chasing growth. Hi, Humphrey. Its Ramy here. So in terms of our actual expenses relating to our disability business this quarter, we're running right on line with expectations. So, we're not really seeing any impact here whatsoever. What Michel was talking about is some of our broader investments in technology and platform around disability and absence management. All of those numbers on all of those investments have been baked into our run rate that you've seen over the past many quarters.

It includes things like the digital interface for claimants, AI-driven automated claim processing, sophisticated data analytics for employers so that they can understand their workforce.

            "name": "Kishore Ponnavolu",
            "content": "Suneet, this is Kishore. Let me say that the premise of your question is correct in the first part, so let me - based on your question, let me start by putting a little bit of context to our sales performance in Q2. In the second quarter, lockdowns and social distancing restrictions had a significant impact on our sales. And Q2 sales for Asia overall dropped 44%, 55% in Japan compared to prior year. To overcome this challenge, we took several distribution and product actions. As you're well aware of all the past investments, we've been making in sales platforms. And on top of that, we implemented several digital solutions to augment our face-to-face interactions. And we also stepped up our sales management activities as well. And because of these actions, we've seen a very strong recovery in Q3 sales, as you rightly pointed out. Q3 sales increased sequentially, 63% for overall Asia, 85% in Japan. And our year-over-year drop is now reduced to 16%. So you asked about the re-pricing that was we did re-price our level premium FX product. It was contributing, but not a major factor in driving our sequential growth. So another way to look at this is to how we're seeing, how this is going to play out for the rest of the year. We expect the impact of our actions that we've taken so far to sustain our Q3 momentum. While the environment is still challenging for face-to-face sales environment, we're seeing a pickup in our sales pipeline, and you should expect a positive year-on-year growth for Asia as a whole."

            "name": "John McCallion",
            "content": "Thank you, Michele. And good morning. I will start with the 3Q 2020 supplemental slides that we released last evening, which highlight information in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. In addition, the slide provides more detail on our annual global actuarial assumption review as well as an update on our cash and capital positions. Starting on page three, the schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the third quarter. Net income in the third quarter were $633 million, or $945 million lower than adjusted earnings. This variance is primarily due to net derivative losses resulting from higher long-term interest rates, as well as the stronger equity markets in the quarter. The investment portfolio and hedging program continue to perform as expected. In addition, the actuarial assumption review accounted for $98 million of the variance between net income and adjusted earnings, which I will now discuss in more detail on page four. During the quarter, the actuarial assumption review reduced net income by $301 million, of which $203 million impacted adjusted earnings. The most significant driver was the reduction of our long-term US 10 year treasury interest rate assumption from 3.75% to 2.75%. In addition to this 100 basis point reduction, we have extended our mean reversion rate to 12 years. These changes reflect expectations of lower interest rates for a longer period of time. The overall impact to earnings is consistent with the sensitivities provided on our second quarter 2020 earnings call. Page five provides a breakdown of the actuarial assumption viewed by business segment. The vast majority of the earnings impact was in MetLife Holdings, primarily due to the change in our long-term US interest rate assumption. We also had a few adjustments in Asia, Latin America and EMEA, primarily due to lower interest rates and various changes in policyholder behavior. On page six, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items in both periods. Both quarters exclude the impact of their respective actuarial assumption reviews. In addition, the prior year quarter had $88 million associated with our completed unit cost initiative, which was accounted for in Corporate and Other. Excluding these notable items, adjusted earnings were up 24% and 25% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were up 27% and 28% on a constant currency basis. Overall, variable investment income was higher than third quarter of 2019 by $257 million after tax. This year-over-year increase in VII accounted for nearly 75% of the total adjusted earnings growth, favorable expense margins and solid volume growth or other key year-over-year drivers. Turning to the performance of our businesses. Group benefits adjusted earnings were up 7% year-over-year. The group life mortality ratio was 89.6%, and which improved sequentially and included roughly three percentage points related to COVID-19 claims. This is at the top end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. We expect the group life mortality ratio in the fourth quarter to be modestly above the annual target range as fourth quarter tends to have higher seasonal life claims, and we expect COVID-19 related claims will remain elevated. The interest adjusted benefit ratio for group non-medical health was 67.4%, which is below our annual target range of 72% to 77%, driven by favorable dental and disability results. As the quarter progressed, dental utilization came in above expectations, which was offset by the partial release of the unearned premium reserve we established in the second quarter. We expect this dental utilization trend to continue and would expect the group non-medical health ratio in the fourth quarter to be at the low end of its annual target range of 72% to 77%. In regards to the topline, group benefits adjusted PFOs were up 7% year-over-year due to growth across most products and markets as well as the partial release of the unearned dental premium reserve. Excluding the unearned dental premium reserve release, which totaled approximately $110 million, group benefits PFO growth would have been within the annual target range of 4% to 6%. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 73% year-over-year. The drivers were strong investment margins, primarily higher variable investment income, favorable underwriting margins of roughly $50 million in the quarter, of which we estimate approximately half is related to elevated COVID-19 mortality and volume growth. RIS investment spreads for the quarter were 156 basis points, up 54 basis points year-over-year. Spreads, excluding VII, were 98 basis points in the quarter, up 19 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the decline in LIBOR rates and an increase in prepayments of RMBS held on our books at a discount. Looking ahead, we expect RIS investment spreads in 4Q to decline sequentially, primarily due to lower VII, but still come in at the top end of the annual guidance range of 90 to 115 basis points. RIS liability exposures grew 12.5% year-over-year driven by strong volume across the product portfolio, as well as separate account investment performance. While liability exposures grew, RIS adjusted PFOs, excluding pension risk transfers, were down 8% year-over-year due to lower structured settlement in institutional income annuity sales. Regarding pension risk transfers, we had approximately $500 million of PRT sales in the quarter and are seeing a good pipeline building once again. Property & Casualty or P&C adjusted earnings were down 68% versus the prior year period, driven by unfavorable underwriting margins due to higher catastrophe losses. The overall combined ratio was 104.2%, which was above our annual target range of 92% to 97% and the prior year quarter of 98.4%. Catastrophe losses were $115 million after-tax in the quarter, $60 million higher than 3Q of 2019. This quarter's cats primarily related to a tropical storm that impacted the Northeast and severe windstorms in the Midwest. It was the highest quarterly cat loss for our P&C business in nearly a decade. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 34% and 32% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income, as well as favorable underwriting and expense margins. In addition, Asia continues to benefit from solid volume growth, driven by higher general account assets under management, which were up 6% on an amortized cost basis. Looking ahead, we expect Asia's strong VII and favorable underwriting in 3Q to return to more normal levels in the fourth quarter. Latin America adjusted earnings were down 67% and 62% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting and lower Chilean and Kahe returns, which were essentially flat in the quarter. Elevated COVID-19 related life claims, primarily in Mexico, impacted Latin America's adjusted earnings by approximately $70 million after-tax in the quarter. We expect COVID-19 related claims in the fourth quarter to remain elevated. EMEA adjusted earnings were up 26% and 30% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by favorable underwriting margins as a result of lower claims and group policies in the region, as well as better expense margins and volume growth. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 35% year-over-year. This increase was primarily driven by higher private equity returns, as well as favorable underwriting margins, as lower claim incidents and long-term care more than offset marginally higher life claims due to COVID-19. The life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 60.2%, which included 7.3 percentage points related to the actuarial assumption review. Adjusting for this impact, the life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 52.9%, within our annual target range of 50% to 55%. Looking ahead to 4Q, we expect MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings to return to more normal levels due to lower VII and more normal underwriting results in long-term care. Corporate and Other adjusted loss was $131 million. This result was modestly more favorable than the prior year quarter, which had an adjusted loss of $135 million, excluding notable items. This quarter's results reflect lower expenses, partially offset by less favorable investment margins, as well as higher preferred stock dividends. As we outlined in our 2Q earnings call, we expect an adjusted loss range of $325 million to $375 million in the second half of 2020, which implies corporate and other adjusted losses to be between to $250 million in 4Q. The Company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 20% at the bottom of our 2020 guidance range of 20% to 22%. Now let's turn to VII in the quarter on page seven. This chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income over the prior five quarters, including $652 million in the third quarter of 2020. This strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio, which had a 6.7% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equities are generally accounted for on a one quarter lag, and the positive marks included in our third quarter results are in line with the outlook offered in our last earnings call. There was also a positive contribution to VII from hedge funds, which had a 13% return in the quarter, as well as higher prepayment fees. In the fourth quarter, we expect VII to remain strong, but closer to the pre 2Q 2020 trend levels. Now let's take a look at VII by segment on page eight. This table breaks out the third quarter VII of $515 million after-tax by segment. The three largest recipients of VII in the quarter were MetLife Holdings, RIS and Asia. The allocation of VII by business segment is based on the quarterly returns of their individual portfolios. That said, as a general rule, MetLife Holdings, RIS and Asia will account for approximately 90% of the total VII and roughly split one-third each. Our new money rate was 2.76% versus a roll-off rate of 3.81% in the quarter. This compares to a new money rate of 3.41% and a roll-off rate of 3.72% in 2Q of 2020. The 65 basis point sequential decline in the new money rate was primarily due to tighter credit spreads in the quarter, purchases of short term investments to match short-term issuances in our capital markets business, as well as higher liquidity at the holding company. We also purchased close to $1 billion in low yielding foreign government bonds, primarily JGBs, to invest cash flows associated with recurring premium income from our Japanese yen in-force block. Looking ahead, we expect new money yields in 4Q to remain at comparable 3Q levels as we maintain our disciplined approach to investing in high-quality assets despite persistently tight credit spreads. Turning to page nine. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2019 and the first three quarters of 2020. In 3Q, our direct expense ratio was 11.4%. This low ratio was driven by a reduction in direct expenses, increased availability of our dental services driving higher premium and a reserve release in corporate and other. Year-to-date, our direct expense ratio was 11.9%. We expect the direct expense ratio to be higher than trend in 4Q, primarily due to seasonality. In our Group Benefits business, we incur higher enrollment and other costs prior to receiving premiums. Also, certain corporate initiative costs are expected to be higher in 4Q. Overall, as Mitchell noted, we are increasingly confident that we will beat our full year target of approximately 12.3%. As we continue to deploy an efficiency mindset to increase capacity for reinvestment and to protect the margins of the firm. I will now discuss our cash and capital on page 10. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $7.8 billion at September 30, which is up from $6.6 billion at June 30 and well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The $1.2 billion increase in cash at the holding companies was primarily the result of a $1 billion preferred stock issuance in the quarter. The proceeds from this issuance were used in October to redeem $1 billion of preferred stock outstanding. In addition, cash at the holding companies reflect the net effects of subsidiary dividends payments of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $80 million in the quarter, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our US company's preliminary third quarter year-to-date 2020 statutory operating earnings were approximately $3.2 billion, while net income was approximately $2.8 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by $200 million from the prior year period, primarily due to higher VA rider reserves and the impact of a prior year dividend from an investment subsidiary. This was partially offset by the favorable underwriting, higher separate account returns and lower operating expenses. Year-to-date, net income was lower due to the decrease in operating earnings and other realized losses. These were partially offset by derivative gains in the current year. We estimate that our total US statutory adjusted capital was approximately $21 billion at September 30, up 12% compared to December 31, 2019. Operating Income and derivative gains more than offset dividends paid. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 892% as of June 30, which is the latest public data. Overall, MetLife delivered a strong quarter, bolstered by an increase in variable investment income and supported by the solid fundamentals from a diverse set of market leading businesses. In addition, we believe our capital, liquidity, and investment portfolio are strong, resilient, and well-positioned to manage through and come out stronger in this challenging environment. Finally, we are confident the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Good morning, Tom. It's John. So let me just start with - I don't think our commentary would change here. So one, as I said before, our focus is on optimizing MetLife Holdings. It's a large and stable well-seasoned in force. It's diversified. It's got a number of natural offsets. It's a good source of sustainable free cash flow. That said, we've continued to take an external perspective in a third-party view of the business. And one, I think it makes us better at managing the business. Two, we need to do this work because it has got some complex - complexity to it. So you need to do the work upfront. And I think it can give us an opportunity to accelerate albeit appropriately, the release of capital and reserves. So I think it was an interesting data point. I think data spreads are still wide. But certainly, as I said before, I think some increases in supply here can narrow that. And I don't think it's changed the sense of urgency we have on how we optimize the business. Hey, Ryan. It's John. I would just say to start that - I would say nothing is necessarily off the table, but there is a closed block, and then there's an open block that have participating policies associated with it. And I think, certainly, the closed block has different complexity associated with it. Both are very well-performing blocks of business. And as I said before, we have a number of businesses that are actually complementary, have a number of natural offsets, which - some of which you actually saw come through this quarter. But yes, I think just to answer your question directly, certain blocks would have different complexities than others. Good morning, Suneet. Just as a reminder, we have roughly $50 billion of VA account balances. Half of it is a living benefit guarantee. As we showed you back at Investor Day, and that has been rolling off consistently over time. Having said that, there are certain components of that block that are building reserves and others that are, I'd say, kind of have - kind of settled down in terms of the reserve build. So it depends on which vintage you're talking about. I probably have to get back to you on that. I don't have it handy. Yes. Good morning, Humphrey. Its John. No, we don't expect any material changes in ongoing run rate earnings as a result of the assumption review. And Humphrey, it's John. I would just add just to Ramy's point there. In a little bit the way you asked the question, this is all part of the - as we refer to as the efficiency mindset concept, where we continue to drive efficiencies every quarter in the firm and look for opportunities then to redeploy that into strategic reinvestments to support our market leading businesses and doing all of that within our run rate costs. So I would just go back to that point. We made that point at Investor Day, and I think it's a key component for us as we move forward."

It's an important investment for us, in commercial mortgage loans. We continue to be optimistic, about the sector. We like it. We continue to invest in the sector. I think back actually to some of the comments I made, I think it was actually in perhaps a response to one of your questions. But we did see deferral requests, as we entered into the COVID pandemic. I think I mentioned on our last earnings call that those got to about 9%, of our principal balance outstanding, but that appears to be sort of where we topped out. And what's most important now is, as those are rolling off the deferral cost, we've seen 60% of them roll off. And they've all gone back to resuming payment. So I think that supports our underlying view of strength in this sector, Eric. And it continues to be important for us."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Head of Investor Relations.\nJohn Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. We hope you and your families are both safe and healthy. Before we begin, I refer you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussions are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set a supplemental slides. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. An appendix to these slides features disclosures and GAAP reconciliations, which you should also review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session that will extend to the top of the hour. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Now over to Michel.\nMichel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and welcome, everyone. My focus this morning will be on how MetLife is successfully managing through the current crisis, financially, operationally and culturally. I'll begin with our financial performance in the second quarter, which demonstrates 3 key fundamentals about our business. First, we have become a simpler and more predictable company. On our last earnings call, we set the major pandemic related impact in the second quarter would be the loss in our private equity portfolio. The negative 8.2% return we reported fell squarely within the range provided. Second, our businesses are well diversified by both geography and product, providing meaningful offsets to increased claims from COVID-19. In aggregate, the second quarter was not an underwriting event.  And third, we remain a company that is committed to and generate strong free cash flow, providing us with significant liquidity and flexibility. In the quarter, we reported adjusted earnings of $758 million or $0.83 per share compared to $1.38 per share a year ago. Net income of $68 million fell below adjusted earnings primarily due to losses on derivatives helped to protect our balance sheet against declining equity markets. On a 2020 year-to-date basis, MetLife has generated $4.4 billion of net income. As you know, our private equity portfolio is reported on a one quarter lag, so the results reflect the extremely difficult first quarter equity market. The percentage decline in our private equity portfolio was much smaller than the 20% drop in the S&P 500, but still generated an after-tax quarterly loss of $0.48 per share, consistent with the expectations we shared with you. Given the substantial rebound in the equity market, we expect a significant recovery in our private equity portfolio when we next report our quarterly results. Our roughly $500 billion investment portfolio remains a key strength for MetLife.  We believe the diversity, quality and liquidity of our portfolio as well as our early actions to reduce risk position us well for a variety of market outcomes. Year-to-date, we have seen only modest realized investment losses. Our underwriting results in the quarter reflect the broad diversity of our businesses. For example, higher claims frequencies in the U.S. were largely balanced by fewer auto insurance claims of selling longevity impact and lower claims and utilization of other protection products globally. Our group benefits business is instructive. Higher mortality drove our group life benefit ratio beyond our annual target range, but this was offset in part by a decrease in dental utilization. Looking ahead, we expect group life mortality to improve but remain elevated in the third quarter. And while dental utilization should increase as we move through the year, with deferred recognition of dental premium given the significant decrease in the availability of dental services. This has the effect of limiting outsized results in any one quarter. Overall, we continue to expect that the diversity of our business mix will mitigate the global underwriting impact of COVID-19.  Turning to free cash flow. We have long spoken of a life insurers capacity to generate cash as one of the most critical measures of the strength and sustainability of its business model. In the second quarter, we were able to grow total cash and liquid assets at our holding companies to $6.6 billion. This is up from $5.3 billion sequentially and well above our cash buffer target of $3 billion to $4 billion. Our strong cash reserves provide us with significant financial flexibility to navigate an uncertain and changing economic landscape, including taking advantage of opportunities as well as managing potential impacts to our investment portfolio. Beyond our financial results, I would like to spend a few minutes on other ways we are managing the challenges presented by the pandemic. Operationally, our people continue to show grit and determination and not only stepping up to respond effectively to a challenging environment, but in accelerating some of the trends that will be critical to our long-term success. Enterprise-wide, 75% of our employees continue to work remotely. Throughout the crisis, we have been able to deliver for our customers without interruption. In our U.S. group business, for example, we continue to meet or exceed our service level agreements. The crisis is also causing us to fast forward the digitization of our company, which will produce lasting benefits.  Turning to the U.S. Group business again. We have expedited and now completed the rollout of an enhanced digital platform that makes it easier for customers to get benefit information, make payments and for a claim. Since the start of the year, the number of people eligible to access the platform has grown by more than 30 million. In addition to continuing to invest to improve the customer experience, we also provided our customers with significant premium relief in the second quarter. While this created some top line pressure, we remain committed to strong expense discipline. We moved quickly to find savings as part of our efficiency mindset and are still on track to achieve our full year direct expense ratio target of 12.3%. For the first 6 months of the year, the ratio is 12.2%. An essential part of being a high-performing company is having a strong culture and here, too, we are seeing improvements. One of the biggest concerns about the shift to working from home was that employee engagement would suffer.  We have been experiencing the opposite effect. In all 3 of our priority areas, collaboration across the enterprise, a strong focus on the customer and a spirit of experimentation, employee engagement has actually strengthened. Part of this is the deep sense of purpose that our employees feel at a time when what we do matters more than ever. Another factor is our commitment as a leadership team to communicating at unprecedented levels. For example, we have been holding interactive global town halls for all of our employees every other week. Our commitment to building momentum for our next Horizon strategy has a new urgency as well. More than 25,000 employees have participated in immersive virtual sessions to build a strong sense of ownership. The pillars of our strategy remain more relevant than ever, focus on deploying scarce capital to its highest use, simplify MetLife by driving operational efficiency and improving the customer experience and differentiate to drive competitive advantage in the marketplace.  Far from slowing us down, the current crisis is accelerating our efforts to find attractive opportunities. In June, we closed our first ever deal in the U.K. longevity reinsurance market. Longevity risk is a business that allows us to tap several competitive advantages, including our world-class actuarial talent. In addition, the underwriting and capital dynamics of this business fit well with our internal rate of return and payback period requirements. Another growth opportunity is the need of products we are adding to our market-leading employee benefits platform. In January, we closed on the acquisition of PetFirst to give us access to the fast-growing pet insurance market. Even though we will not launch the product on our platform until later this year, 25 large employers with approximately 250,000 eligible employees have already signed up to offer pet insurance as a voluntary benefit. Before I close, I would like to say a word about MetLife's commitment to diversity and inclusion, a topic that has taken on greater importance in light of recent protests across the United States. MetLife has taken a number of steps to contribute to a more just and equitable society. We have spoken out in the face of injustice.  We have committed to improving diversity within our own workforce, and we have contributed financially to organizations that advance rational equity. While we know there is more work to do, both as a company and as a society, our purpose is motivating us to help make forward progress. What I hope you will take away from today's call is that MetLife feels a tremendous sense of urgency about the future. Everyone has heard the expression, don't let a crisis go to waste. At MetLife, we are taking that to heart and doing the work now to position ourselves for long-term success. We're becoming more efficient. We're gaining new customer insights. We're strengthening our culture and we're remaining laser-focused on consistent execution. With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion to discuss our second quarter results in greater detail.\nJohn McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I'll start with the 2Q '20 supplemental slides that we released last evening, which highlight information in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. In addition, the slide provides more detail on our outlook for the third quarter as well as an update on our cash and capital positions.  Starting on Page 3. The schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the second quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $68 million, were $690 million lower than adjusted earnings of $758 million. This variance is primarily due to net derivative losses resulting from the stronger equity markets as well as higher long-term interest rates in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $4.4 billion compared to net income of $3 billion in the first half of 2019. The investment portfolio and hedging program continue to perform as expected. Also, as highlighted on Page 3, adjusted earnings included a $438 million after-tax loss in Variable Investment Income, or VII. I will provide more details on this shortly. On Page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding total notable items. This quarter's results did not include any notable items, while the prior year quarter had $70 million associated with our recently completed unit cost initiative, which was accounted for in corporate and other. Excluding the UCI cost in the second quarter of '19, adjusted earnings were down 45% and down 44% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were down 43% and down 41% on a constant currency basis. Overall, Variable Investment Income was lower than second quarter of '19 by $702 million after tax. This decline in VII was more than the decline in total adjusted earnings year-over-year. Positive year-over-year drivers included solid volume growth, favorable expense margins and equity market strength in the quarter. This was partially offset by the lower recurring interest margins and less favorable taxes compared to 2Q of '19.  Turning to the performance of our businesses. Group benefits adjusted earnings were down 20% year-over-year. The Group Life mortality ratio was 95.9% due to elevated claims related to COVID-19. This is above our annual target range of 85% to 90% and less favorable to the prior year quarter of 85.3%. The interest adjusted benefit ratio for group nonmedical health was 58.5%, which is well below our annual target range of 72% to 77% and also favorable to the prior year quarter ratio of 75.4%. The primary driver was extremely low dental utilization, which I will discuss in more details shortly. In regards to the top line, Group benefits adjusted PFOs were down 5% year-over-year, primarily due to lower dental premiums from the deferral of revenues given a significant decrease in the availability of dental services and to account for a 25% premium credit to all fully insured customers, excluding these dental premium adjustments, which totaled approximately $500 million in the quarter. Group benefits PFOs would have been within its annual target range due to solid growth across all markets.  Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 45% year-over-year due to unfavorable investment margins related to the decline in variable investment income, which was partially offset by favorable underwriting margins. RIS investment spreads for the quarter were 25 basis points, down 94 basis points year-over-year. Spreads, excluding VII, were 85 basis points in the quarter, up 1 basis point year-over-year due to a decline in LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures grew 11% year-over-year, driven by strong volume across all products and separate account investment performance in the quarter. While liability exposures grew RIS adjusted PFOS, excluding pension risk transfers, were down 22% year-over-year due to lower structured settlement and institutional income booty sales. Property and Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings were up 19% versus the prior year period, driven by favorable underwriting margins, partially offset by unfavorable investment margins related to variable investment income. The overall combined ratio was 91.1%, which was more favorable than our annual target range of 92% to 97% and the prior year quarter ratio of 96.1%. P&C results benefited from lower auto claim frequencies due to a decline in miles driven in the quarter. This was partially offset by higher catastrophe losses of $89 million after-tax compared to $62 million after tax in 2Q of '19.  Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were down 29% and 27% on a constant currency basis due to lower investment margins resulting primarily from the decline in variable investment income in the quarter. This was partially offset by solid volume growth, which was driven by a 5% increase in general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis as well as favorable expense margins. Latin America adjusted earnings were down 17% as foreign exchange rates across the region dampened year-over-year results. If today's FX rates hold, we would expect the year-over-year impact to Latin America's third quarter earnings to be similar to the second quarter. On a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings were up 3%, driven by higher equity markets, favorably impacting our Chilean and Kahe returns, which were up 14% in the quarter as well as favorable underwriting margins. This was partially offset by unfavorable investment margins. EMEA adjusted earnings were up 51% and 59% on a constant currency basis. This was a record adjusted earnings quarter for EMEA, primarily due to favorable underwriting margins as a result of lower claims in group Medical and accident and health policies in the region as well as better expense margins. We would expect EMEA's underwriting results to be closer to historical levels in the third quarter. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down $279 million year-over-year. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income of $250 million after-tax, compared to the prior year. As well as lower recurring interest margins and unfavorable underwriting due to COVID-19 related claims. The Life Interest adjusted benefit ratio was 59.1% and which was above the prior year quarter of 53.9% and above our annual target range of 50% to 55%. Higher equity markets in the quarter were a partial offset to the year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings. The separate account return in the quarter was 14.8%, which resulted in a positive $13 million initial impact, which compares to a positive $5 million initial impact in 2Q '19. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $289 million. This result was less favorable to the prior year quarter, which had an adjusted loss of $237 million, excluding $70 million of UCI costs. The decline in variable investment income was the quarter. Looking ahead, we would expect corporate and other losses to be between $325 in the second half of the year. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 19.2%, modestly below our 2020 guidance range of 20% to 22%.  Now let's turn to Page 5. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income over the prior 5 quarters, including a loss of $555 million in the second quarter of 2020. The loss was entirely attributable to the private equity portfolio which had a negative 8.2% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equities are generally accounted for on a one quarter lag, and the negative marks included in our 2Q '20 financial results are in line with our disclosures from the last earnings call.  With regards to recurring investment income, our new money rate was 3.41% versus a roll-off rate of 3.72% in the quarter. This compares to a new money rate of 4.01% and a roll-off rate of 4.34% in 2Q '19. We have added a table on Page 6 that breaks out the second quarter negative VII of $438 million after-tax by segment. The largest VII impacts to adjusted earnings in the quarter were MetLife Holdings and Retirement and Income Solutions, followed by Asia and corporate and other.  In the quarter, certain timing adjustments have shifted the relative VII impact between Asia and corporate and other. Going forward, these timing adjustments will be eliminated and as such, we would expect Asia's adjusted earnings to have a larger contribution from VII and corporate and other to have less as compared to the second quarter.  Now let's turn to Page 7. This chart provides one approach to illustrate the impact of below trend VII on our reported earnings. The box in red reflects the adjusted EPS impact of $0.48 related to the negative VII experienced in the quarter. This was the first quarterly loss for VII since 2009. The $0.22 highlighted in the green box illustrates the adjusted EPS impact assuming VII at the quarterly midpoint of our 2020 annual target range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. To be clear, this chart should not be viewed as quarterly guidance, but rather as one approach to illustrate the below trend results.  Moving to Page 8. This walk provides more detail on the group non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio. As I noted earlier, the reported ratio of 58.5% was very favorable, driven by low dental utilization. However, 2 adjustments are needed for comparability to our annual target guidance of 72% to 77% and the sensitivities we provided on our outlook call last December. First, the ratio should be adjusted by 3.9 points for the 20th earlier. Second, the ratio should also be adjusted by 7.1 points related to the establishment of an unearned premium reserve. We established an unearned premium reserve recognition with the availability of dental service sources. As dental offices have begun to open across the U.S., we have seen utilization pick up in July for more involved treatments and procedures, which represent less than 20% of our typical overall dental claims. However, incidence remains low for more routine visits. We expect dental utilization to pick up in the second half of the year, pushing the ratio closer to the low end of our 72% to 77% target range.  Turning to Page 9. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2019 and the first two quarters of 2020. In 2020, our year-to-date direct expense ratio was 12.2%, while the ratio was elevated in 2Q at 12.4% due to top line pressure from premium credits in our dental and auto businesses, as well as the establishment of a dental premium reserve. We remain on track and committed to achieving our full year target of approximately 12.3% as we continue to deploy an efficiency mindset to increase capacity for needs of the firm. Now I'd like to spend some time reviewing several key considerations for the third quarter, given the continued uncertainty of the current environment. These considerations are summarized on Page 10.  Starting with investments. We expect a strong recovery in variable investment income in the third quarter with our best estimate for private equity returns to be a positive mid-single digit, which is based on a $7.2 billion PE balance at June 30. Regarding recurring investment income, we continue to experience downward pressure from lower rates. However, reinvestment rates have held up reasonably well during the first half of the year, given our diverse market-leading asset origination capabilities. Finally, we expect the short end of the yield curve to remain favorable, supporting investment spreads. Moving on to underwriting margins. We continue to anticipate modest underwriting impacts from COVID-19 on a combined basis. Assuming deaths rise in the U.S. to approximately 200,000 through the third quarter. We expect life insurance claims frequency in the U.S. to moderate. With life insurance benefit ratios and group benefits and MetLife Holdings moving closer to their respective annual target ranges. However, we do expect claims activity to significantly increase in Latin America in the third quarter, as the region is behind other parts of the world in COVID-19 emergence. Additionally, we would expect some level of offsets from businesses with longevity risks, most notably in Retirement and Income Solutions. So currently, we expect a limited overall impact to underwriting margins on a combined basis for 3Q.  Turning to top line metrics, we would expect global face-to-face sales to remain challenged, negatively impacting most of our segments. However, we do anticipate modest sequential sales improvement in Japan. We expect lower adjusted PFOs in most segments with the exception of group benefits, which we expect to have mid- single-digit growth year-over-year. While we expect to encounter volume and top line growth pressures, our efficiency mindset is a core tenet of our strategy to manage margin pressures across our business. As I noted earlier, we remain on track to meet our direct expense ratio full year target of approximately 12.3% despite the challenges of the current environment.  Now let's turn to Page 11. Given the persistent low interest rate environment, we decided to add this page on estimated impacts to our income statement and balance sheet. If we were to lower our long-term actuarial U.S. interest rate assumption of 3.75% by 25, 50, 100 or 150 basis points. For each hypothetical scenario, GAAP loss recognition is not triggered, and there would be a relatively modest impact to net income, specifically, with respect to the 150 basis point down scenario, which would bring our long-term mean reversion rate assumption to 2.25%. I would highlight 2 points. First, the approximate $425 million net income impact is consistent with the guidance range disclosed on our 1Q '20 earnings call. And second, we will continue to have a significant margin for purposes of GAAP loss recognition. Overall, I believe these sensitivities of test a MetLife significantly reduced risk profile. I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 12. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6.6 billion at June 30, which is up from $5.3 billion at March 31 and well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The $1.3 billion increase in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends payment of our common stock dividend as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows.  Next, I would like to provide you an update on our capital position. As a reminder, for our U.S. companies, our combined NAIC RBC ratio was 395% at year-end 2019 and comfortably above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, preliminary second quarter year-to-date 2020 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.8 billion, while net income was approximately $2.1 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by approximately $600 million from the first half of 2019, primarily due to higher VA rider reserves and the impact of a prior year dividend from an investment subsidiary. This was partially offset by lower operating expenses. Year-to-date net income was driven by derivative gains, partially offset by lower operating earnings. Our expected total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $21.1 billion as of June 30, up 13% compared to December 31, 2019. Derivative gains and operating income more than offset dividends paid and other investment losses.  Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 799% as of March 31, which is the latest public data. In summary, this quarter's adjusted earnings were dampened by the negative private equity returns which are based on a one quarter accounting lag. However, the underlying business fundamentals from our diverse market-leading businesses were evident in our results despite the challenging environment. Looking ahead, we expect our third quarter adjusted earnings to benefit from a strong recovery in private equity returns, while continuing to absorb modest underwriting impacts from COVID-19. In addition, we believe our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are strong, resilient and well positioned to manage through this unprecedented environment. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous.\nErik Bass: First question, with $6.6 billion of holding company liquidity and credit impact, [Technical Difficulty] this is -- and is that something that's potentially on the table for the third quarter? Or do you want to wait longer to see how the environment evolves?\nMichel Khalaf: Erek, we lost you there in the middle do you mind repeating the question?\nErik Bass: Certainly. It was -- in May on the outlook for capital return. And with the $6.6 billion of HoldCo liquidity and credit impacts trending a bit below fear so far? Just how are you thinking about the timing of resuming share repurchases? And is that something that's potentially on the table for 3Q?\nMichel Khalaf: Sure. So as you know, last quarter, we put our share repurchase program on pause. And we felt that was prudent to build our cash and capital and to maintain -- in order to maintain financial flexibility. Our view is that there remains substantial uncertainty in the economy as well as with the pandemic, which is going to take more time to clear. Yet having said that, over the past 3 months, we've seen a resilient equity market and tighter credit spreads, as you reference, government and Fed reserve policy. And our cash position has grown to $6.6 million, which gives us greater financial flexibility and optionality. So if you take all of these factors together, we would not roll out capital management in the latter part of 20 but we remain on plus for the time being. So I hope that answers your question.\nErik Bass: Yes. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up for John on Group. I just wanted to clarify kind of is the idea of the unearned premium reserve to essentially better align the timing of revenues and expenses. So should we think of this as essentially taking some excess earnings from the second quarter and allocating them to future periods when you expect claims and incidents to be higher?\nJohn McCallion: Erik, yes, it's very much about the availability of service. And so in the second quarter, dental offices were closed for quite a bit of time. Remind, part of that, we gave back a 25% premium credit to fully insured customers. And then as you said, we also then said we needed to defer some revenue so that it would be recognized when those services are available. And so those are -- that is a timing item.\nErik Bass: Got it. So it's essentially the earnings -- if you hadn't booked that, would have been higher in the second quarter, but you'll recoup that at some point in the future?\nJohn McCallion: That's correct.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore.\nThomas Gallagher: The reduction that you gave on free cash flow guide for 2021 last quarter, I think a piece of that was driven by elevated credit loss assumptions. My question is, if interest rates stay low, but credit remains fairly benign, where do you think that would land you in terms of the free cash flow conversion heading into 2021?\nJohn McCallion: Tom, I would just remind you, that was a scenario, not a guide. It was -- there's a lot of different factors. We had a 1- to 2-year assumption of how this may play out. It was based on macro factors as of March 31 when spreads were wide, our equity markets were worse, we'll say interest rates are modestly down. If you look at the 10 years since then. So things, as Michel said, there has been a somewhat resilient equity and credit market for the last 3 months. I'd still say we're in the mode of caution at this point in terms of what the outlook it will be and how this will play out. I also talked about last time that, that factors in some level of cash flow testing. It's a range of outcomes. And that some -- the estimates we provided were based on New York special consideration letter that we receive every year. The last one we got was a year ago, it was based on a certain macroeconomic environment. We'll work through hopefully constructively with them this time. But we wanted to just give a I'll say, a stress set of scenarios for what's a possible outcome. But it's -- I wouldn't call it a guide. I'd just say that's -- those are kind of possible outcomes-based on where but it depends on where macro factors are at the end of the year.\nThomas Gallagher: Got you. And then my follow-up is, any update on MetLife Holdings and the potential for risk transfer or interest rates than the current level of interest rates too low, making the bid as spread too wide? Or do you think something could still happen there even if rates remain kind of where they are?\nMichel Khalaf: Yes, I think we're in the same mode that we've been in for the last few quarters. We are preparing for the opportunity for something to occur, although macro factors are creating a wider bid-ask spread, having said that, there's still kind of a biased push to supply being greater. And so that could narrow the bid-ask over time. So I'd say we continue to maintain readiness, but interest rates, I would say, do present a headwind.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW.\nRyan Krueger: On the holding company cash, were there any meaningful timing considerations that influenced the increase in the quarter? Or would you expect a further build in the cash position in the second half of the year, depending on your uses of free cash flow?\nJohn McCallion: Ryan, yes, we did have some lower outflows in the second quarter. And we did receive some proceeds from the sale of Hong Kong. So it was another item, which we did not disclose, as you know. And so on the -- looking at the remainder of the year, I would say, I would not expect the same rate of increase that you're seeing here.\nRyan Krueger: Got it. And then could you provide some updates on what you're seeing in the commercial mortgage loan portfolio in terms of things like forbearance requests and grants and any other statistics that you could provide on what's going on there?\nSteven Goulart: Sure, Ryan, it's Steve Goulart. I'll take that. Let's step back and start with an overview of the portfolio again. It's nearly $51 billion now in commercial mortgages. And again, we continue to believe it's very conservatively positioned. The average loan-to-value is 57%. And the average debt service coverage ratio on the portfolio is 2.4x. It's very well diversified geographically and by property type. And we also feel it's concentrated in high-quality assets that are typically located in larger primary markets. So again, backdrop of a very strong fundamentally built diversified portfolio. That said, there clearly are signs of stress in sectors like hotel and retail. For us, that's less than 25% of the total. And not surprisingly, as I talked about on the previous earnings call, we have received requests for temporary debt service payment deferrals on the portfolio. We've reached a point where we're really not seeing much in the way of new requests, but we've granted about 9% on a principal balance outstanding of those. And again, they're heavily concentrated in hotel and retail. But again, these are payment deferrals. We don't expect losses, and we're not projecting losses from any of those today. It's just they're going to be delayed in receiving the principal and interest. And in addition to just those that we've granted deferrals on, we actually have received 100% of all other expected payments. In June. So this is something we'll deal with in this crisis. But again, given our long-term history of performance in commercial mortgages, and I'll remind you, from 2009 to '19, we have less than $120 million in cumulative losses, the portfolio, we believe, is well positioned, and we'll manage through this time period.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: My first question is on the expense side of things. You guys obviously seen a 12.3% for the full year. And Michel, I know since you took over your role, you've kind of put out the message that expense management is a core part of what's going on at met even beyond this year. So as we've been in this COVID environment, and we've heard companies talk about becoming more efficient. Have you guys learned anything or see anything within your expense base that perhaps could lead to more sustainable savings beyond 2020 into 2021 and beyond?\nMichel Khalaf: Yes, Elyse. So as you mentioned, we do believe that driving an efficiency mindset. And then just keep in mind, coming off our UCI initiative, where we've exceeded our target is very important, and the management team here is highly committed to this. And if anything, we're seeing an acceleration of this during the pandemic. If you consider that we do have some incremental costs related to the pandemic that we are managing to offset. If you take into account the fact that this quarter, we have about $500 million. Our top line is suppressed by about $500 million due to the dental credits and the UPR that we discussed earlier. We're seeing also some top line pressure just from the pandemic in general, yet we continue to be committed to our 12.3% expense ratio. I think that gives you a sense of just the urgency and the momentum that we're seeing in terms of the adoption of this efficiency mindset. And clearly, as we see further adoption of some of our digital tools, we think those trends are going to persist even coming out of this crisis as we continue to find ways of further simplifying the company. We feel good about sort of what we discussed during Investor Day about our ability to create additional capacity. That's also going to help us continue to invest in growth and innovation. So again, I cannot stress enough. In times of crisis, it's about the things that you control. And that's one area that we feel we do control. And as I said, we're very committed to maintain the 12.3% despite all the other things that I mentioned earlier.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then my second question on the investment spreads within RIS were compressed in the quarter, but that was really due to VII because away from that, they actually held up pretty well. Given your outlook, can you give us a sense of where spreads within RIS for the rest of the year, I guess, could come in relative to your 2020 guide.\nMichel Khalaf: Elise, yes. So Q2 spreads were certainly on an overall basis, depressed, driven by the negative returns on our private equity portfolio. And as just as a reminder, we have said that res typically takes about call it, 1/3 of the results from VII. And then excluding spreads, were 85 basis points, up slightly from Q1. And most of that is driven by the drop in LIBOR. This has helped us a little -- be resilient when it comes to our spreads, the shape of the curve against some headwinds. Lower rates do hurt ultimately, but the shape of the curve matters a lot, as we've said before. We also have seen some head, in particular around hotels. So -- but nonetheless, I think the spreads have been resilient. We expect them to VII, where the shape of the curve would help offset some of those other headwinds.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.\nJamminder Bhullar: First, I had a question for Steve Goulart. On -- if you think about the credit environment, obviously, things haven't ended up being as bad as was feared, but there's still uncertainty. So where do you see good value? And what are some of the areas that you might be avoiding? And then relatedly, can you talk about what your new money yields are that you're earning right now versus -- and the gap between that and the portfolio yields, so we get a better idea for where your core spreads are headed?\nSteven Goulart: Jimmy, let's step back and just talk about the current environment, though. And John made some comments on this, too, and then I'll pick up. But we're still dealing crisis in the markets. And in our mind, that's presented a fair amount of uncertainty around what the shape of the recovery would look like. And what long-term impacts could be. Now we all know, Fed came to the rescue and through really unprecedented intervention has calmed the markets. And in general, the market tone have certainly improved where we were a quarter ago. And when you look at things like a lot of the downgrade projections that were in the market, just about all those participants have reduced their projections however, we are still seeing defaults and bankruptcies, and that trend is going to continue. If you think back to our first quarter call, we talked about how we are looking at that, different scenarios and analyses we've made and what the potential impact would be on our portfolio and on our risk-based capital, and what we said was through all the analysis we've done, we think that all the risks are manageable. So put that in the context of today, things have improved. The risk that we saw a quarter ago have also modestly improved.  And therefore, I guess, I'd describe it as continuing to be very manageable. But all that said, we are still very cautious about the market because there is a disconnect, we think, between kind of technicals and fundamentals. So we continue to be cautious. We've continued to reposition the portfolio. When we see price and spread action like we've seen in some sectors and names that we are still cautious about, we're going to continue and have continued to reduce our exposure. At the same time, though, there are attractive opportunities, and we're going to take advantage of them when we can. Particularly we've seen over the last quarter, continued opportunities in private assets, and so we'll continue to invest there. So again, it's really one of balance about continuing to take advantage of what the market will give us to lighten up the portfolio in those sectors and names that we are so cautious about. But taking advantage of opportunities that we see, which, again, right now seem to be more heavily concentrated, again, no surprise in private assets, which, again, given our strong origination networks, our reputation of commitment to those sectors and our conservative underwriting really serve us well. And I think that's when you just look at our commitment to sound underwriting to asset liability management, and most importantly, to diversification across the portfolio that allows us to really continue to put up a long term positive, successful investing track record even in markets like this.\nJamminder Bhullar: And are you able to quantify this your new money yields? And where they stand relative to the gap between that and the portfolio?\nSteven Goulart: Yes. So our new money yield for the quarter was 3.41%. Our roll off was 3.72. And that reflects -- I think that's down a little bit from the last quarter, but it does reflect still being able to take advantage of opportunities that we do see. In the market. And again, we're obviously in a prolonged low interest rate and for now anyway, tighter spread environment. So that trend is likely to continue in the near term. But again, the diversification that we have available for us from an investing perspective will continue to serve us well.\nJamminder Bhullar: Okay. And then if I could just ask one more for John McCallion. On your annual actuarial review, in the past, you've brought your rate assumption down, but the adjustments have been fairly modest. Are you following a similar process as you're looking at your rate assumption? Or could we -- adjustments would be closer to what actual rates are?\nJohn McCallion: Jimmy. Yes. We have a process. We will follow our processes we typically have. And we'll go through that during the course of the third quarter and provide an update on next quarter's earnings call. I don't think there's reasons to change. I don't think it I would call the environment would require a change in process, process should dictate and drive the results. So I think we have a very healthy process, objective process. And we'll kind of manage through that over the course of the next several weeks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners.\nHumphrey Lee: I just have a follow-up question on group benefits to trend for the balance of the year. Clearly, this quarter, you mentioned you had the $500 million impact related to dental. Do you anticipate any of the unearned premium reserves are all kind of behind you? And since you go back to normal? Or do you anticipate there could still be a little bit of a headwind because not the entire country is still fully open?\nRamy Tadros: Humphrey, it's Ramy Tadros here. So as John mentioned, we are expecting the utilization of some of the services for dental to be elevated or more than -- above our normal expectations for the rest of the year. So think of that, our customers are making up services that were not provided in the second quarter. So there's that catch up effect. This additional catch-up effect will be offset by the release of the unearned premium reserve in the subsequent quarters. So we will get -- we will see that UPR, if you will, release into premiums as we see that catch-up effect happen with respect to utilization. More broadly, with respect to PFO growth in the third quarter, we did talk about employment levels being one of the key drivers that drives PFO here for the group benefits business. If you recall, we talked about a number of attributes on the last call, which somewhat mitigate that employment level impact in terms of the diversification of our book, the focus towards more larger accounts, national accounts, so in aggregate, if you think about the third quarter, we are still looking at PFO growth in the solid mid digits for group benefits.\nHumphrey Lee: Got it. And then in John's prepared remarks, you talked about the expecting some longevity benefits in the third quarter to offset some of the continued corporate-related underwriting impact. Is there any way to help us to think about the potential benefits from RIS and long-term care in the coming quarters?\nJohn McCallion: Humphrey. Yes. Look, I would probably put this in the context of just overall view. Of underwriting. So just as a reminder as to what Michelle mentioned, overall, for 2Q, we saw a modest impact in underwriting on a combined basis. We had higher claims in the U.S., and they were largely offset by auto claims, auto frequency claims. Also, we had some longevity impacts in the quarter. And then we had other claims and utilization benefits outside the U.S., particularly EMEA. As we look into the Q3 end of kind of a neutral impact on underwriting on a combined basis to still be the case even with death rising to 200,000 in the U.S. So a couple of things to highlight. We expect the mortality, as I said before, on my opening remarks for Group Life and MetLife Holdings to still be elevated, albeit migrating closer to the top end of our range. So not as severe as 2Q. And just particularly in Mexico, we expect COVID impact to rise in Q3. So we're forecasting about 40,000 deaths in Q3 for Mexico. And at this point, we'd estimate that would have roughly maybe a segment benefit ratio. And then going to your point around offsetting impacts. So offsetting these elevated losses, we do expect longevity offsets to increase in both R and long-term care as these typically are delayed by a quarter or are slower to emerge from a reporting perspective. And then as I said in my remarks, we also expect EMEA would migrate back to normal trends. So in summary, we think the net underwriting result would generally offset, and therefore, COVID impacts would remain modest in Q3.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nAndrew Kligerman: Maybe just kind of following up on the capital management question, taking more of the M&A stack. Do you think that if any opportunities were to arise in this environment that you'd be able to act pretty quickly? And do you have a desire to do so? And then finally, you mentioned the pet insurance acquisition. I've been hearing that, that's just a very tough line to underwrite as pets age, it becomes quite problematic in terms of the loss ratio. So I was wondering what the thinking was when you made that acquisition. So questions there.\nMichel Khalaf: Andrew, I'll take the first part on capital management, and then Ramy will question. So as I've said before, we view M&A as a strategic and that's an important tool, but 1 of the tools in our toolbar. We're very disciplined in our approach to M&A. I would just remind that we always look at strategic fit as a potential transaction going to help us grow revenues? Are there synergies involved? It would have to be accretive. Does it clear a minimum risk-adjusted return, hurdle rate or return? And we always also compare it to other potential uses of capital. So I would say that nothing changes here in terms of our approach. We are open for business. And -- but the discipline that I just described, we -- with these types of opportunities.\nAndrew Kligerman: Michel, any areas that I though that you kind of would like to add to the net life portfolio in terms of M&AS?\nMichel Khalaf: Yes. I mean, just taking you back, Andrew, to what we discussed during Investor Day, I think we talked about sort of certain lines of business markets where given the right opportunity, we'd certainly be open to doing something. And I think if just sort of to add to that, if you consider sort of the pet insurance acquisition, a smaller acquisition that we made in digital wells, which complement our legal plans offering again, adding or enhancing our group benefits offering, for example, group obviously is a business that we like here in the U.S. So those are the types of things that I would point you to in terms of going back to what we discussed during Investor Day and the businesses and the markets that we -- that we like and where we see opportunities to further grow revenues.\nRamy Tadros: Andrew, it's Ramy here. Just building on Michel's comment, the first acquisition was small, but important. It very much is aligned to our Investor Day strategy. And we're entering into a capital-light business, where we've identified a clear opportunity where we can bring value to customers, employers and employees. The pet insurance market, if you look at it more broadly, 2/3 of Americans have a path. They spend collectively $18 billion every year on vet care. But the penetration in the market is -- in the insurance market is just 2%. And it's seeing 20% CAGR year-on-year. And clearly, look, the -- we have -- we've purchased a company with immense data and history. We have our best actuaries working on this, and we're very much confident in our underwriting in this line of business going forward.\nOperator: And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back to Michel Khalaf for final comments.\nMichel Khalaf: Let me thank you all for participating in today's call. And I want to close today by reiterating how committed this leadership team has to controlling was in our power to control. We know that capital and liquidity, consistent execution and expense management are vital during times of uncertainty. Please stay safe, and have a great day.\nOperator: This will be available for replay.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Michel Khalaf",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and welcome, everyone. My focus this morning will be on how MetLife is successfully managing through the current crisis, financially, operationally and culturally. I'll begin with our financial performance in the second quarter, which demonstrates 3 key fundamentals about our business. First, we have become a simpler and more predictable company. On our last earnings call, we set the major pandemic related impact in the second quarter would be the loss in our private equity portfolio. The negative 8.2% return we reported fell squarely within the range provided. Second, our businesses are well diversified by both geography and product, providing meaningful offsets to increased claims from COVID-19. In aggregate, the second quarter was not an underwriting event.  And third, we remain a company that is committed to and generate strong free cash flow, providing us with significant liquidity and flexibility. In the quarter, we reported adjusted earnings of $758 million or $0.83 per share compared to $1.38 per share a year ago. Net income of $68 million fell below adjusted earnings primarily due to losses on derivatives helped to protect our balance sheet against declining equity markets. On a 2020 year-to-date basis, MetLife has generated $4.4 billion of net income. As you know, our private equity portfolio is reported on a one quarter lag, so the results reflect the extremely difficult first quarter equity market. The percentage decline in our private equity portfolio was much smaller than the 20% drop in the S&P 500, but still generated an after-tax quarterly loss of $0.48 per share, consistent with the expectations we shared with you. Given the substantial rebound in the equity market, we expect a significant recovery in our private equity portfolio when we next report our quarterly results. Our roughly $500 billion investment portfolio remains a key strength for MetLife.  We believe the diversity, quality and liquidity of our portfolio as well as our early actions to reduce risk position us well for a variety of market outcomes. Year-to-date, we have seen only modest realized investment losses. Our underwriting results in the quarter reflect the broad diversity of our businesses. For example, higher claims frequencies in the U.S. were largely balanced by fewer auto insurance claims of selling longevity impact and lower claims and utilization of other protection products globally. Our group benefits business is instructive. Higher mortality drove our group life benefit ratio beyond our annual target range, but this was offset in part by a decrease in dental utilization. Looking ahead, we expect group life mortality to improve but remain elevated in the third quarter. And while dental utilization should increase as we move through the year, with deferred recognition of dental premium given the significant decrease in the availability of dental services. This has the effect of limiting outsized results in any one quarter. Overall, we continue to expect that the diversity of our business mix will mitigate the global underwriting impact of COVID-19.  Turning to free cash flow. We have long spoken of a life insurers capacity to generate cash as one of the most critical measures of the strength and sustainability of its business model. In the second quarter, we were able to grow total cash and liquid assets at our holding companies to $6.6 billion. This is up from $5.3 billion sequentially and well above our cash buffer target of $3 billion to $4 billion. Our strong cash reserves provide us with significant financial flexibility to navigate an uncertain and changing economic landscape, including taking advantage of opportunities as well as managing potential impacts to our investment portfolio. Beyond our financial results, I would like to spend a few minutes on other ways we are managing the challenges presented by the pandemic. Operationally, our people continue to show grit and determination and not only stepping up to respond effectively to a challenging environment, but in accelerating some of the trends that will be critical to our long-term success. Enterprise-wide, 75% of our employees continue to work remotely. Throughout the crisis, we have been able to deliver for our customers without interruption. In our U.S. group business, for example, we continue to meet or exceed our service level agreements. The crisis is also causing us to fast forward the digitization of our company, which will produce lasting benefits.  Turning to the U.S. Group business again. We have expedited and now completed the rollout of an enhanced digital platform that makes it easier for customers to get benefit information, make payments and for a claim. Since the start of the year, the number of people eligible to access the platform has grown by more than 30 million. In addition to continuing to invest to improve the customer experience, we also provided our customers with significant premium relief in the second quarter. While this created some top line pressure, we remain committed to strong expense discipline. We moved quickly to find savings as part of our efficiency mindset and are still on track to achieve our full year direct expense ratio target of 12.3%. For the first 6 months of the year, the ratio is 12.2%. An essential part of being a high-performing company is having a strong culture and here, too, we are seeing improvements. One of the biggest concerns about the shift to working from home was that employee engagement would suffer.  We have been experiencing the opposite effect. In all 3 of our priority areas, collaboration across the enterprise, a strong focus on the customer and a spirit of experimentation, employee engagement has actually strengthened. Part of this is the deep sense of purpose that our employees feel at a time when what we do matters more than ever. Another factor is our commitment as a leadership team to communicating at unprecedented levels. For example, we have been holding interactive global town halls for all of our employees every other week. Our commitment to building momentum for our next Horizon strategy has a new urgency as well. More than 25,000 employees have participated in immersive virtual sessions to build a strong sense of ownership. The pillars of our strategy remain more relevant than ever, focus on deploying scarce capital to its highest use, simplify MetLife by driving operational efficiency and improving the customer experience and differentiate to drive competitive advantage in the marketplace.  Far from slowing us down, the current crisis is accelerating our efforts to find attractive opportunities. In June, we closed our first ever deal in the U.K. longevity reinsurance market. Longevity risk is a business that allows us to tap several competitive advantages, including our world-class actuarial talent. In addition, the underwriting and capital dynamics of this business fit well with our internal rate of return and payback period requirements. Another growth opportunity is the need of products we are adding to our market-leading employee benefits platform. In January, we closed on the acquisition of PetFirst to give us access to the fast-growing pet insurance market. Even though we will not launch the product on our platform until later this year, 25 large employers with approximately 250,000 eligible employees have already signed up to offer pet insurance as a voluntary benefit. Before I close, I would like to say a word about MetLife's commitment to diversity and inclusion, a topic that has taken on greater importance in light of recent protests across the United States. MetLife has taken a number of steps to contribute to a more just and equitable society. We have spoken out in the face of injustice.  We have committed to improving diversity within our own workforce, and we have contributed financially to organizations that advance rational equity. While we know there is more work to do, both as a company and as a society, our purpose is motivating us to help make forward progress. What I hope you will take away from today's call is that MetLife feels a tremendous sense of urgency about the future. Everyone has heard the expression, don't let a crisis go to waste. At MetLife, we are taking that to heart and doing the work now to position ourselves for long-term success. We're becoming more efficient. We're gaining new customer insights. We're strengthening our culture and we're remaining laser-focused on consistent execution. With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion to discuss our second quarter results in greater detail. Erek, we lost you there in the middle do you mind repeating the question? Sure. So as you know, last quarter, we put our share repurchase program on pause. And we felt that was prudent to build our cash and capital and to maintain -- in order to maintain financial flexibility. Our view is that there remains substantial uncertainty in the economy as well as with the pandemic, which is going to take more time to clear. Yet having said that, over the past 3 months, we've seen a resilient equity market and tighter credit spreads, as you reference, government and Fed reserve policy. And our cash position has grown to $6.6 million, which gives us greater financial flexibility and optionality. So if you take all of these factors together, we would not roll out capital management in the latter part of 20 but we remain on plus for the time being. So I hope that answers your question. Yes, I think we're in the same mode that we've been in for the last few quarters. We are preparing for the opportunity for something to occur, although macro factors are creating a wider bid-ask spread, having said that, there's still kind of a biased push to supply being greater. And so that could narrow the bid-ask over time. So I'd say we continue to maintain readiness, but interest rates, I would say, do present a headwind. Yes, Elyse. So as you mentioned, we do believe that driving an efficiency mindset. And then just keep in mind, coming off our UCI initiative, where we've exceeded our target is very important, and the management team here is highly committed to this. And if anything, we're seeing an acceleration of this during the pandemic. If you consider that we do have some incremental costs related to the pandemic that we are managing to offset. If you take into account the fact that this quarter, we have about $500 million. Our top line is suppressed by about $500 million due to the dental credits and the UPR that we discussed earlier. We're seeing also some top line pressure just from the pandemic in general, yet we continue to be committed to our 12.3% expense ratio. I think that gives you a sense of just the urgency and the momentum that we're seeing in terms of the adoption of this efficiency mindset. And clearly, as we see further adoption of some of our digital tools, we think those trends are going to persist even coming out of this crisis as we continue to find ways of further simplifying the company. We feel good about sort of what we discussed during Investor Day about our ability to create additional capacity. That's also going to help us continue to invest in growth and innovation. So again, I cannot stress enough. In times of crisis, it's about the things that you control. And that's one area that we feel we do control. And as I said, we're very committed to maintain the 12.3% despite all the other things that I mentioned earlier. Elise, yes. So Q2 spreads were certainly on an overall basis, depressed, driven by the negative returns on our private equity portfolio. And as just as a reminder, we have said that res typically takes about call it, 1/3 of the results from VII. And then excluding spreads, were 85 basis points, up slightly from Q1. And most of that is driven by the drop in LIBOR. This has helped us a little -- be resilient when it comes to our spreads, the shape of the curve against some headwinds. Lower rates do hurt ultimately, but the shape of the curve matters a lot, as we've said before. We also have seen some head, in particular around hotels. So -- but nonetheless, I think the spreads have been resilient. We expect them to VII, where the shape of the curve would help offset some of those other headwinds. Andrew, I'll take the first part on capital management, and then Ramy will question. So as I've said before, we view M&A as a strategic and that's an important tool, but 1 of the tools in our toolbar. We're very disciplined in our approach to M&A. I would just remind that we always look at strategic fit as a potential transaction going to help us grow revenues? Are there synergies involved? It would have to be accretive. Does it clear a minimum risk-adjusted return, hurdle rate or return? And we always also compare it to other potential uses of capital. So I would say that nothing changes here in terms of our approach. We are open for business. And -- but the discipline that I just described, we -- with these types of opportunities. Yes. I mean, just taking you back, Andrew, to what we discussed during Investor Day, I think we talked about sort of certain lines of business markets where given the right opportunity, we'd certainly be open to doing something. And I think if just sort of to add to that, if you consider sort of the pet insurance acquisition, a smaller acquisition that we made in digital wells, which complement our legal plans offering again, adding or enhancing our group benefits offering, for example, group obviously is a business that we like here in the U.S. So those are the types of things that I would point you to in terms of going back to what we discussed during Investor Day and the businesses and the markets that we -- that we like and where we see opportunities to further grow revenues. Let me thank you all for participating in today's call. And I want to close today by reiterating how committed this leadership team has to controlling was in our power to control. We know that capital and liquidity, consistent execution and expense management are vital during times of uncertainty. Please stay safe, and have a great day."

            "name": "Steven Goulart",
            "content": "Sure, Ryan, it's Steve Goulart. I'll take that. Let's step back and start with an overview of the portfolio again. It's nearly $51 billion now in commercial mortgages. And again, we continue to believe it's very conservatively positioned. The average loan-to-value is 57%. And the average debt service coverage ratio on the portfolio is 2.4x. It's very well diversified geographically and by property type. And we also feel it's concentrated in high-quality assets that are typically located in larger primary markets. So again, backdrop of a very strong fundamentally built diversified portfolio. That said, there clearly are signs of stress in sectors like hotel and retail. For us, that's less than 25% of the total. And not surprisingly, as I talked about on the previous earnings call, we have received requests for temporary debt service payment deferrals on the portfolio. We've reached a point where we're really not seeing much in the way of new requests, but we've granted about 9% on a principal balance outstanding of those. And again, they're heavily concentrated in hotel and retail. But again, these are payment deferrals. We don't expect losses, and we're not projecting losses from any of those today. It's just they're going to be delayed in receiving the principal and interest. And in addition to just those that we've granted deferrals on, we actually have received 100% of all other expected payments. In June. So this is something we'll deal with in this crisis. But again, given our long-term history of performance in commercial mortgages, and I'll remind you, from 2009 to '19, we have less than $120 million in cumulative losses, the portfolio, we believe, is well positioned, and we'll manage through this time period. Jimmy, let's step back and just talk about the current environment, though. And John made some comments on this, too, and then I'll pick up. But we're still dealing crisis in the markets. And in our mind, that's presented a fair amount of uncertainty around what the shape of the recovery would look like. And what long-term impacts could be. Now we all know, Fed came to the rescue and through really unprecedented intervention has calmed the markets. And in general, the market tone have certainly improved where we were a quarter ago. And when you look at things like a lot of the downgrade projections that were in the market, just about all those participants have reduced their projections however, we are still seeing defaults and bankruptcies, and that trend is going to continue. If you think back to our first quarter call, we talked about how we are looking at that, different scenarios and analyses we've made and what the potential impact would be on our portfolio and on our risk-based capital, and what we said was through all the analysis we've done, we think that all the risks are manageable. So put that in the context of today, things have improved. The risk that we saw a quarter ago have also modestly improved.  And therefore, I guess, I'd describe it as continuing to be very manageable. But all that said, we are still very cautious about the market because there is a disconnect, we think, between kind of technicals and fundamentals. So we continue to be cautious. We've continued to reposition the portfolio. When we see price and spread action like we've seen in some sectors and names that we are still cautious about, we're going to continue and have continued to reduce our exposure. At the same time, though, there are attractive opportunities, and we're going to take advantage of them when we can. Particularly we've seen over the last quarter, continued opportunities in private assets, and so we'll continue to invest there. So again, it's really one of balance about continuing to take advantage of what the market will give us to lighten up the portfolio in those sectors and names that we are so cautious about. But taking advantage of opportunities that we see, which, again, right now seem to be more heavily concentrated, again, no surprise in private assets, which, again, given our strong origination networks, our reputation of commitment to those sectors and our conservative underwriting really serve us well. And I think that's when you just look at our commitment to sound underwriting to asset liability management, and most importantly, to diversification across the portfolio that allows us to really continue to put up a long term positive, successful investing track record even in markets like this. Yes. So our new money yield for the quarter was 3.41%. Our roll off was 3.72. And that reflects -- I think that's down a little bit from the last quarter, but it does reflect still being able to take advantage of opportunities that we do see. In the market. And again, we're obviously in a prolonged low interest rate and for now anyway, tighter spread environment. So that trend is likely to continue in the near term. But again, the diversification that we have available for us from an investing perspective will continue to serve us well."

            "name": "John McCallion",
            "content": "Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I'll start with the 2Q '20 supplemental slides that we released last evening, which highlight information in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. In addition, the slide provides more detail on our outlook for the third quarter as well as an update on our cash and capital positions.  Starting on Page 3. The schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the second quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $68 million, were $690 million lower than adjusted earnings of $758 million. This variance is primarily due to net derivative losses resulting from the stronger equity markets as well as higher long-term interest rates in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $4.4 billion compared to net income of $3 billion in the first half of 2019. The investment portfolio and hedging program continue to perform as expected. Also, as highlighted on Page 3, adjusted earnings included a $438 million after-tax loss in Variable Investment Income, or VII. I will provide more details on this shortly. On Page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding total notable items. This quarter's results did not include any notable items, while the prior year quarter had $70 million associated with our recently completed unit cost initiative, which was accounted for in corporate and other. Excluding the UCI cost in the second quarter of '19, adjusted earnings were down 45% and down 44% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were down 43% and down 41% on a constant currency basis. Overall, Variable Investment Income was lower than second quarter of '19 by $702 million after tax. This decline in VII was more than the decline in total adjusted earnings year-over-year. Positive year-over-year drivers included solid volume growth, favorable expense margins and equity market strength in the quarter. This was partially offset by the lower recurring interest margins and less favorable taxes compared to 2Q of '19.  Turning to the performance of our businesses. Group benefits adjusted earnings were down 20% year-over-year. The Group Life mortality ratio was 95.9% due to elevated claims related to COVID-19. This is above our annual target range of 85% to 90% and less favorable to the prior year quarter of 85.3%. The interest adjusted benefit ratio for group nonmedical health was 58.5%, which is well below our annual target range of 72% to 77% and also favorable to the prior year quarter ratio of 75.4%. The primary driver was extremely low dental utilization, which I will discuss in more details shortly. In regards to the top line, Group benefits adjusted PFOs were down 5% year-over-year, primarily due to lower dental premiums from the deferral of revenues given a significant decrease in the availability of dental services and to account for a 25% premium credit to all fully insured customers, excluding these dental premium adjustments, which totaled approximately $500 million in the quarter. Group benefits PFOs would have been within its annual target range due to solid growth across all markets.  Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 45% year-over-year due to unfavorable investment margins related to the decline in variable investment income, which was partially offset by favorable underwriting margins. RIS investment spreads for the quarter were 25 basis points, down 94 basis points year-over-year. Spreads, excluding VII, were 85 basis points in the quarter, up 1 basis point year-over-year due to a decline in LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures grew 11% year-over-year, driven by strong volume across all products and separate account investment performance in the quarter. While liability exposures grew RIS adjusted PFOS, excluding pension risk transfers, were down 22% year-over-year due to lower structured settlement and institutional income booty sales. Property and Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings were up 19% versus the prior year period, driven by favorable underwriting margins, partially offset by unfavorable investment margins related to variable investment income. The overall combined ratio was 91.1%, which was more favorable than our annual target range of 92% to 97% and the prior year quarter ratio of 96.1%. P&C results benefited from lower auto claim frequencies due to a decline in miles driven in the quarter. This was partially offset by higher catastrophe losses of $89 million after-tax compared to $62 million after tax in 2Q of '19.  Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were down 29% and 27% on a constant currency basis due to lower investment margins resulting primarily from the decline in variable investment income in the quarter. This was partially offset by solid volume growth, which was driven by a 5% increase in general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis as well as favorable expense margins. Latin America adjusted earnings were down 17% as foreign exchange rates across the region dampened year-over-year results. If today's FX rates hold, we would expect the year-over-year impact to Latin America's third quarter earnings to be similar to the second quarter. On a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings were up 3%, driven by higher equity markets, favorably impacting our Chilean and Kahe returns, which were up 14% in the quarter as well as favorable underwriting margins. This was partially offset by unfavorable investment margins. EMEA adjusted earnings were up 51% and 59% on a constant currency basis. This was a record adjusted earnings quarter for EMEA, primarily due to favorable underwriting margins as a result of lower claims in group Medical and accident and health policies in the region as well as better expense margins. We would expect EMEA's underwriting results to be closer to historical levels in the third quarter. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down $279 million year-over-year. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income of $250 million after-tax, compared to the prior year. As well as lower recurring interest margins and unfavorable underwriting due to COVID-19 related claims. The Life Interest adjusted benefit ratio was 59.1% and which was above the prior year quarter of 53.9% and above our annual target range of 50% to 55%. Higher equity markets in the quarter were a partial offset to the year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings. The separate account return in the quarter was 14.8%, which resulted in a positive $13 million initial impact, which compares to a positive $5 million initial impact in 2Q '19. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $289 million. This result was less favorable to the prior year quarter, which had an adjusted loss of $237 million, excluding $70 million of UCI costs. The decline in variable investment income was the quarter. Looking ahead, we would expect corporate and other losses to be between $325 in the second half of the year. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 19.2%, modestly below our 2020 guidance range of 20% to 22%.  Now let's turn to Page 5. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income over the prior 5 quarters, including a loss of $555 million in the second quarter of 2020. The loss was entirely attributable to the private equity portfolio which had a negative 8.2% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equities are generally accounted for on a one quarter lag, and the negative marks included in our 2Q '20 financial results are in line with our disclosures from the last earnings call.  With regards to recurring investment income, our new money rate was 3.41% versus a roll-off rate of 3.72% in the quarter. This compares to a new money rate of 4.01% and a roll-off rate of 4.34% in 2Q '19. We have added a table on Page 6 that breaks out the second quarter negative VII of $438 million after-tax by segment. The largest VII impacts to adjusted earnings in the quarter were MetLife Holdings and Retirement and Income Solutions, followed by Asia and corporate and other.  In the quarter, certain timing adjustments have shifted the relative VII impact between Asia and corporate and other. Going forward, these timing adjustments will be eliminated and as such, we would expect Asia's adjusted earnings to have a larger contribution from VII and corporate and other to have less as compared to the second quarter.  Now let's turn to Page 7. This chart provides one approach to illustrate the impact of below trend VII on our reported earnings. The box in red reflects the adjusted EPS impact of $0.48 related to the negative VII experienced in the quarter. This was the first quarterly loss for VII since 2009. The $0.22 highlighted in the green box illustrates the adjusted EPS impact assuming VII at the quarterly midpoint of our 2020 annual target range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. To be clear, this chart should not be viewed as quarterly guidance, but rather as one approach to illustrate the below trend results.  Moving to Page 8. This walk provides more detail on the group non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio. As I noted earlier, the reported ratio of 58.5% was very favorable, driven by low dental utilization. However, 2 adjustments are needed for comparability to our annual target guidance of 72% to 77% and the sensitivities we provided on our outlook call last December. First, the ratio should be adjusted by 3.9 points for the 20th earlier. Second, the ratio should also be adjusted by 7.1 points related to the establishment of an unearned premium reserve. We established an unearned premium reserve recognition with the availability of dental service sources. As dental offices have begun to open across the U.S., we have seen utilization pick up in July for more involved treatments and procedures, which represent less than 20% of our typical overall dental claims. However, incidence remains low for more routine visits. We expect dental utilization to pick up in the second half of the year, pushing the ratio closer to the low end of our 72% to 77% target range.  Turning to Page 9. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2019 and the first two quarters of 2020. In 2020, our year-to-date direct expense ratio was 12.2%, while the ratio was elevated in 2Q at 12.4% due to top line pressure from premium credits in our dental and auto businesses, as well as the establishment of a dental premium reserve. We remain on track and committed to achieving our full year target of approximately 12.3% as we continue to deploy an efficiency mindset to increase capacity for needs of the firm. Now I'd like to spend some time reviewing several key considerations for the third quarter, given the continued uncertainty of the current environment. These considerations are summarized on Page 10.  Starting with investments. We expect a strong recovery in variable investment income in the third quarter with our best estimate for private equity returns to be a positive mid-single digit, which is based on a $7.2 billion PE balance at June 30. Regarding recurring investment income, we continue to experience downward pressure from lower rates. However, reinvestment rates have held up reasonably well during the first half of the year, given our diverse market-leading asset origination capabilities. Finally, we expect the short end of the yield curve to remain favorable, supporting investment spreads. Moving on to underwriting margins. We continue to anticipate modest underwriting impacts from COVID-19 on a combined basis. Assuming deaths rise in the U.S. to approximately 200,000 through the third quarter. We expect life insurance claims frequency in the U.S. to moderate. With life insurance benefit ratios and group benefits and MetLife Holdings moving closer to their respective annual target ranges. However, we do expect claims activity to significantly increase in Latin America in the third quarter, as the region is behind other parts of the world in COVID-19 emergence. Additionally, we would expect some level of offsets from businesses with longevity risks, most notably in Retirement and Income Solutions. So currently, we expect a limited overall impact to underwriting margins on a combined basis for 3Q.  Turning to top line metrics, we would expect global face-to-face sales to remain challenged, negatively impacting most of our segments. However, we do anticipate modest sequential sales improvement in Japan. We expect lower adjusted PFOs in most segments with the exception of group benefits, which we expect to have mid- single-digit growth year-over-year. While we expect to encounter volume and top line growth pressures, our efficiency mindset is a core tenet of our strategy to manage margin pressures across our business. As I noted earlier, we remain on track to meet our direct expense ratio full year target of approximately 12.3% despite the challenges of the current environment.  Now let's turn to Page 11. Given the persistent low interest rate environment, we decided to add this page on estimated impacts to our income statement and balance sheet. If we were to lower our long-term actuarial U.S. interest rate assumption of 3.75% by 25, 50, 100 or 150 basis points. For each hypothetical scenario, GAAP loss recognition is not triggered, and there would be a relatively modest impact to net income, specifically, with respect to the 150 basis point down scenario, which would bring our long-term mean reversion rate assumption to 2.25%. I would highlight 2 points. First, the approximate $425 million net income impact is consistent with the guidance range disclosed on our 1Q '20 earnings call. And second, we will continue to have a significant margin for purposes of GAAP loss recognition. Overall, I believe these sensitivities of test a MetLife significantly reduced risk profile. I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 12. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6.6 billion at June 30, which is up from $5.3 billion at March 31 and well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The $1.3 billion increase in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends payment of our common stock dividend as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows.  Next, I would like to provide you an update on our capital position. As a reminder, for our U.S. companies, our combined NAIC RBC ratio was 395% at year-end 2019 and comfortably above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, preliminary second quarter year-to-date 2020 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.8 billion, while net income was approximately $2.1 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by approximately $600 million from the first half of 2019, primarily due to higher VA rider reserves and the impact of a prior year dividend from an investment subsidiary. This was partially offset by lower operating expenses. Year-to-date net income was driven by derivative gains, partially offset by lower operating earnings. Our expected total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $21.1 billion as of June 30, up 13% compared to December 31, 2019. Derivative gains and operating income more than offset dividends paid and other investment losses.  Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 799% as of March 31, which is the latest public data. In summary, this quarter's adjusted earnings were dampened by the negative private equity returns which are based on a one quarter accounting lag. However, the underlying business fundamentals from our diverse market-leading businesses were evident in our results despite the challenging environment. Looking ahead, we expect our third quarter adjusted earnings to benefit from a strong recovery in private equity returns, while continuing to absorb modest underwriting impacts from COVID-19. In addition, we believe our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are strong, resilient and well positioned to manage through this unprecedented environment. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Erik, yes, it's very much about the availability of service. And so in the second quarter, dental offices were closed for quite a bit of time. Remind, part of that, we gave back a 25% premium credit to fully insured customers. And then as you said, we also then said we needed to defer some revenue so that it would be recognized when those services are available. And so those are -- that is a timing item. That's correct. Tom, I would just remind you, that was a scenario, not a guide. It was -- there's a lot of different factors. We had a 1- to 2-year assumption of how this may play out. It was based on macro factors as of March 31 when spreads were wide, our equity markets were worse, we'll say interest rates are modestly down. If you look at the 10 years since then. So things, as Michel said, there has been a somewhat resilient equity and credit market for the last 3 months. I'd still say we're in the mode of caution at this point in terms of what the outlook it will be and how this will play out. I also talked about last time that, that factors in some level of cash flow testing. It's a range of outcomes. And that some -- the estimates we provided were based on New York special consideration letter that we receive every year. The last one we got was a year ago, it was based on a certain macroeconomic environment. We'll work through hopefully constructively with them this time. But we wanted to just give a I'll say, a stress set of scenarios for what's a possible outcome. But it's -- I wouldn't call it a guide. I'd just say that's -- those are kind of possible outcomes-based on where but it depends on where macro factors are at the end of the year. Ryan, yes, we did have some lower outflows in the second quarter. And we did receive some proceeds from the sale of Hong Kong. So it was another item, which we did not disclose, as you know. And so on the -- looking at the remainder of the year, I would say, I would not expect the same rate of increase that you're seeing here. Jimmy. Yes. We have a process. We will follow our processes we typically have. And we'll go through that during the course of the third quarter and provide an update on next quarter's earnings call. I don't think there's reasons to change. I don't think it I would call the environment would require a change in process, process should dictate and drive the results. So I think we have a very healthy process, objective process. And we'll kind of manage through that over the course of the next several weeks. Humphrey. Yes. Look, I would probably put this in the context of just overall view. Of underwriting. So just as a reminder as to what Michelle mentioned, overall, for 2Q, we saw a modest impact in underwriting on a combined basis. We had higher claims in the U.S., and they were largely offset by auto claims, auto frequency claims. Also, we had some longevity impacts in the quarter. And then we had other claims and utilization benefits outside the U.S., particularly EMEA. As we look into the Q3 end of kind of a neutral impact on underwriting on a combined basis to still be the case even with death rising to 200,000 in the U.S. So a couple of things to highlight. We expect the mortality, as I said before, on my opening remarks for Group Life and MetLife Holdings to still be elevated, albeit migrating closer to the top end of our range. So not as severe as 2Q. And just particularly in Mexico, we expect COVID impact to rise in Q3. So we're forecasting about 40,000 deaths in Q3 for Mexico. And at this point, we'd estimate that would have roughly maybe a segment benefit ratio. And then going to your point around offsetting impacts. So offsetting these elevated losses, we do expect longevity offsets to increase in both R and long-term care as these typically are delayed by a quarter or are slower to emerge from a reporting perspective. And then as I said in my remarks, we also expect EMEA would migrate back to normal trends. So in summary, we think the net underwriting result would generally offset, and therefore, COVID impacts would remain modest in Q3."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's 8-K filed last night and its other SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Head of Investor Relations.\nJohn Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Now more than ever, we appreciate you joining us for MetLife's first quarter 2020 earnings call. Before we begin, I refer you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussions are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. An appendix to these slides features disclosures and GAAP reconciliations, which you should also review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session that will extend to the top of the hour. And fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Before I turn the call over to Michel, I have a quick scheduling update. As you might have concluded, given the environment, we will not be hosting an Investor Day in Tokyo this September. Now, over to Michel.\nMichel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I'd to begin by acknowledging the difficulties and challenges that so many people have injured as a result of the pandemic. What the world has been living through its tragic, yet it is also demonstrating the best of humanity. We see this every day as thousands of first responders, health care workers and other frontline employees risk their lives to care for others and provide essential services. And we see it at MetLife as our employees go above and beyond to deliver on our promises to customers. While we feel the effects of the crisis deeply, both the personal loss and the economic disruption, these are the moments that MetLife is built for. At our Investor Day last December, I led with the importance we place on being a purpose-driven company. Our purpose statement always with you, building a more confident future has taken on greater meaning in the current environment. People are counting on us like never before to provide the value, support and financial security they need. Our next horizon strategy is a road map for how the company will create value for all of its stakeholders: our people, our customers, our shareholders and our communities. As I have said before, it is our people who will deliver for our customers, and that in turn is how we will create value for our shareholders and communities. It starts with our people, which means making their health and well-being our top priority. We've done that in a variety of ways. We rapidly moved employees to a work-from-home environment, expanded benefit to help cover COVID-19 testing and treatment, enhanced mental health support to help employees cope with stress and deployed tools and resources to keep people connected. I am proud of the level of engagement and motivation our people are showing, they know they are making a difference. Since we do business in many markets, MetLife got an early look at how the pandemic could affect societies and our own operations. Our experience in Asia gave us a running start on the activation of our business continuity plan globally. Across our enterprise, 92% of our 38,000 non-agent employees are now working from home, including 98% in the United States. Of course, the true test of our business continuity plan was not merely whether employees could log on from home but whether they had full functionality to be able to deliver for our customers. On this front, we are very pleased that we've been able to maintain service levels with 95% of all customer calls, claims and other transactions successfully handled by employees working remotely. This includes our group insurance business, where even in this highly disrupted environment, MetLife still expects to meet or exceed its performance guarantees. For our customers, this moment is crucial. The way we show up now will resonate with them for years to come. Across the enterprise, we are acting to provide them with comprehensive and compassionate care. We are extending premium grace period, fast-tracking claims, crediting or adjusting auto and dental premiums and providing our digital financial wellness portal to small businesses and their employees at no cost. The shutdown of face-to-face distribution has also spurred us to innovate and accelerate the digital transformation of our business. In China, for example, sales of our medical reimbursement product rose sharply after we created a WeChat store for agents. In times of prices, we must do more for the communities where we work and live. MetLife Foundation has committed $25 million and MetLife has donated millions of dollars and thousands of masks, disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizers to the COVID-19 spike. We also had a unique opportunity to help. As a large commercial real estate investor, we were pleased to work with the State of New York to offer the Intercontinental Times Square as free housing for medical workers. Most impactful is the social and economic benefit MetLife create as a life insurance company. The heart of our business is a promise to pay when people need us most. For the power of risk putting, the premiums of the many become payment to those who need them. MetLife paid more than $24 billion in policyholder claims, benefits and dividends in the U.S. alone last year, an average of more than $65 million a day. At a time when peoples' jobs and income are at risk, life insurers form a vital part of the social safety net that sustains people financially. MetLife entered the current period of uncertainty from the position of strength. As you know, we've made substantial changes to our strategy and product portfolio. The biggest change is to the profile of our liabilities. We are now a less market-sensitive and capital-intensive company. At our Investor Day, we showed that approximately two thirds of our adjusted earnings came from protection and fee-based products and only one third from spread-related businesses. Within our investment portfolio, we took early action in anticipation of a recession. Beginning in 2018, we became concerned about certain lower-rated areas of the credit markets. We reduced our holdings in sectors and names that we thought would carry heightened risk in a downturn. Overall, our investment portfolio is marked by broad diversification, high quality and ample liquidity. Notably, at our operating insurance companies, we have nearly $100 billion of U.S. government and agency securities, Japan government bonds and other cash and short-term investments. MetLife has also further strengthened its already strong capital and liquidity position. As part of our planned capital actions, in late March, we accessed the bond market when few others could to raise $1 billion. For the quarter, this helped bring the company's total cash and liquid assets at our holding companies to $5.3 billion. Our combined U.S. NAIC risk-based capital ratio as of year-end 2019 was 395%, and we enjoy higher ratings from all major credit-rating agencies. Another proactive step we've taken is to increase our focus on expenses. MetLife remains committed to meeting the expense target we set as part of our unit cost initiative program. In the current environment, perhaps no area gives us greater opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to consistent execution than expense discipline. As we announced last week, our financial strength enabled us to increase our quarterly common stock dividend, which provides a steady and growing source of income to millions of people during this economically challenging time. We raised our second quarter 2020 common stock dividend by 4.5% which illustrates our confidence in MetLife's future. Given our strong starting position, we expect the impact of the pandemic to be an earnings event, not a balance sheet event. MetLife has a great set of globally diversified businesses, some of which may be pressured by today's unprecedented events while others act as offsets. Take our Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS, business. While we are seeing a slowdown in new pension risk transfer deals, we are also seeing a surge in demand for our stable value offerings as 401(k) sponsors and participants seek the safety of these book value products backed by MetLife. And although rollover reinvestment rates continue to be pressured for our long-tailed businesses in RIS, the current configuration of the yield curve, very low at the short hand and a positive slope, is favorable for our capital markets, investment products and securities lending activities. Similar balance exists across our global protection businesses, where mortality, morbidity, longevity and Property & Casualty risks serve as natural offsets. At the core, our scale, strong balance sheet and broad diversification are key strengths of our franchise. These trends enabled us to generate first quarter adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.58 per share, up 7% from a year ago. The direct impacts on our adjusted earnings from the pandemic and economic slowdown were limited. Adjusted earnings reflected strong underwriting margins and group benefits and favorable underwriting margins in Property & Casualty. Variable investment income was very strong mostly due to private equity, which is registered on a one quarter lag. These positives were offset in part by unfavorable market factors across interest rates, equities and foreign currency. Net income was $4.4 billion or $4.75 per share, up from $1.40 per year prior. Falling interest rates drove substantial gains in the derivatives we hold to protect our balance sheet. Book value per excluding AOCI, other than FCTA, was $52.36, up 7% sequentially from year-end while adjusted return on equity on the same basis totaled 12.6%. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate the greatest earnings impact will be felt within variable investment income, where we expect less favorable private equity returns for a time. The strong historical returns associated with our private equity portfolio and its role as a good match for our long-dated liabilities justify this asset class as an important ongoing component of the general account. In fact, the current economic turmoil is precisely the environment where the speeds of tomorrow's private equity returns are being planted. We believe our Next Horizon strategy was the right approach before the pandemic struck, and we are even more confident that the pillars of focus, simplify and differentiate are the right approach today. By focusing even more intently on where we deploy capital and by further simplifying the company, we will enable MetLife to emerge from the current environment in the best shape possible. If anything, we must accelerate our Next Horizon work. This is how we will truly differentiate MetLife and capture the opportunities that periods of disruptions always bring. MetLife has seen many such periods during this history, the 1918 flu pandemic, The Great Depression, World War II, 9/11, the financial crisis. Through all of them, we never faltered. We maintained our financial strength, kept our promises and provided people with the security and confidence they need. That's what we mean when we say, always with you, and it will be true throughout this pandemic and beyond. I will now turn the call over to John McCallion.\nJohn McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the first quarter 2020 supplemental slides that we released last evening, which highlight information on our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. In addition, the slides provide more detail on our investments, outlook for the second quarter as well as an update of our cash and capital positions. Starting on Page 3. This schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the first quarter. Net income in the first quarter was $4.4 billion, or approximately $3 billion higher than adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion. This variance is primarily due to net derivative gains resulting from the significant decline in interest rates during the quarter. The results in the investment portfolio and hedging program continue to perform as expected. Turning to Page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items. This quarter's results did not include any notable items, while the prior year quarter had $55 million associated with our unit cost initiative, which was accounted for in Corporate & Other. Excluding the unit cost in the first quarter of 2019, adjusted earnings were down 2% and essentially flat on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were up 3% and up 5% on a constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases. Overall, positive year-over-year drivers include strong variable investment income, solid volume growth, favorable expense margins and lower taxes. This was offset by equity market weakness, lower recurring interest margins and less favorable underwriting compared to first quarter of 2019. Turning to the performance of our businesses. Group benefits adjusted earnings were down 9% year-over-year. The group life mortality ratio was 87.9%, which is slightly above the midpoint of our annual target range of 85% to 90%, but less favorable to the exceptionally strong prior year quarter of 85.3%, which was the best first quarter mortality ratio in over 15 years. The interest adjusted benefit ratio for Non-Medical Health was 71.7%, which is below our annual target range of 72% to 77% and also favorable to the prior year quarter of 72.9%. The primary driver was strong disability results, which benefited from higher claim recoveries, lower incidents and lower severity. With regards to the top line, group benefits adjusted PFOs were up 7% due to solid growth across all markets. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 26% year-over-year. RIS investment spreads for the quarter were 114 basis points, up 18 basis points year-over-year and up 8 basis points sequentially. Spreads in the quarter benefited from higher private equity returns and a decline in LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures grew 9% driven by very strong growth in the second half of 2019 and exceptionally strong stable value sales in the quarter, which benefited from a flight-to-safety amid the turbulent equity markets as well as opportunistic issuances in our capital markets investment products. While liability exposures grew, RIS PFOs were down 32% due to the mix of sales in the quarter, driven by lower structured settlement and income annuity sales. Property & Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings were up 12% versus the prior year. The overall combined ratio is 91%, which was below our annual target range of 92% to 97% and the prior year quarter of 92.2%. P&C results benefited from favorable non-catastrophe weather in homeowners and auto. P&C auto also benefited from lower auto frequency over the last two weeks of the quarter due to the COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were down 2% and flat on a constant currency basis. Solid volume growth was driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 7% and 9% on a constant currency basis. This was offset by less favorable underwriting margins, unfavorable equity markets in Japan and Korea, and lower investment margins. Latin America adjusted earnings were down 29% and down 19% on a constant currency basis. The primary year-over-year driver was lower equity markets impacting our Chilean encaje returns, which was a negative 11% in the quarter versus a plus 5% return in 1Q of 2019. Excluding the impact from encaje, Latin America adjusted earnings were up 23% on a constant currency basis due to higher investment margins, solid volume growth and favorable underwriting. EMEA adjusted earnings were down 9% and down 6% on a constant currency basis as lower equity markets and less favorable underwriting margins were partially offset by better expense margins and solid volume growth across the region. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by adverse equity markets. The separate account return in the quarter was a negative 14.4%, which was better than the 20% decline in the S&P as roughly 30% of funds are allocated to fixed accounts. This resulted in a negative $20 million initial impact, which compares to an approximately $15 million positive initial impact in first quarter of 2019. With regards to underwriting, the life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 51%, which is near the bottom end of our annual target range of 50% to 55%. Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $131 million. This result compared favorably to the prior year quarter, which had an adjusted loss of $138 million, excluding $55 million of UCI costs. The company\u2019s effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 17.5% and 20.2% on a run rate basis when adjusting for a favorable $45 million tax benefit in the quarter. Now let\u2019s turn to Page 5 to discuss variable investment income in more detail. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income in 2019, including $351 million earned in the first quarter of 2020. Our private equity portfolio, which is generally accounted for on a one quarter lag, had another solid quarter. With regards to recurring investment income, our new money rate was 3.56% versus a roll-off rate of 3.92% in the quarter. This compares to a new money rate of 4.04% and a roll-off rate of 4.15% in first quarter of 2019. Lower interest rates have pressured this relationship, but wider credit spreads in the quarter have provided an offset. Now on Page 6, the chart on Page 6 highlights our strong historical private equity returns. Steve Goulart presented a version of this slide at Investor Day, showing private equity returns going back to 2016. Given the focus on our private equity in the current environment, we\u2019ve decided to expand this view showing returns going back to the financial crisis in 2008. Our private equity portfolio was $7.6 billion as of March 31, which represents less than 2% of the general account assets under management. It is well-diversified across strategy, geography and portfolio managers and provides a good fit against long-term liabilities. As you can see from the chart, our private equity investments have generated an average return of 12% since 2008, and only in 2009 the trough of the financial crisis that this portfolio failed to generate a positive return. These next two slides are shown \u2013 were shown at our Investor Day, but they\u2019re helpful reminders. On Page 7 you can see our portfolio loss history since 2008. The chart highlights a strong track record of performance as our cumulative impairment rate of 1.2% is roughly half that of the industry peer group. It also speaks to MetLife Investment Management\u2019s culture of disciplined underwriting, deep fundamental analysis and strong risk management, with a particular focus on private asset origination. Turning to Page 8, as we\u2019ve discussed previously, we have been proactive in improving the quality of our portfolio with a focus on significantly reducing our exposure to below-investment-grade credit and syndicated bank loans. We are also highly focused on our low BBB exposure given fallen angel risk. Our BBB minus credit exposure is roughly 4% of the general account AUM and 46% of this is private placements, which benefit from better financial covenants in place. I would also call to your attention, Page 14 in the appendix, which displays that we have relatively modest fixed maturity exposures to stress sectors. You can see our largest exposure on the chart is our energy portfolio of approximately $8.7 billion, of which 85% is investment grade. The energy portfolio is well diversified across subsectors and issuers. And we believe it is defensively positioned given the changes that we have made since the last downturn for the energy sector back in 2016. Turning to Page 9, this chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2019 and first quarter of 2020. Through year-end 2019, we have achieved 170 basis points improvement in our direct expense ratio. And while we expect top line pressure in 2020, we remain committed to achieving our 12.3% full year target as we continue to deploy an efficiency mindset, to increase capacity for reinvestment and to protect the margins of the firm. Now I\u2019d like to spend some time reviewing several key considerations for the second quarter, given the uncertainty of the current environment. These considerations are summarized on Page 10 with further detail offered by segment on Page 13 in the appendix. Starting with investments. As Michel indicated, we anticipate the largest impact of the current environment to manifest in variable investment income with the return on our private equity portfolio. While we received a limited number of PE reports to date, our best estimate for the second quarter is a negative high-single to low double-digit return. In thinking about our recurring investment income, we continue to experience downward pressure, but reinvestment rates held reasonably steady during the first quarter as credit spreads widened to offset falling treasury rates and also provided good reinvestment opportunities. During the last week of March, we were able to invest roughly $2 billion in high-quality investments that yielded on average 5.4%. Additionally, while interest rates remained low, the curve has steepened, which improves margins in our capital market products and RIS in our securities lending program. Moving on to underwriting margins. Broadly speaking, we anticipate modest underwriting impacts on a combined basis in the second quarter from COVID-19, but there are many moving parts. To date, while we\u2019ve seen limited impact from COVID-19 on life claims in the U.S., we do expect this to increase during the second quarter. However, claims activity in dental has declined and auto claims frequency is down with fewer miles driven. Additionally, we would expect some level of offsets from businesses with longevity risks. So currently, we expect a limited overall impact to underwriting margins on a combined basis in 2Q. Turning to top line metrics. We would expect 2Q sales to be challenged in most of our markets with risk of further pressure in future quarters. Additionally, as Michel mentioned, for April and May, we\u2019ve provided a 15% premium credit for MetLife personal auto customers and a 20% premium adjustment for our fully-insured dental business within group benefits for the two months. As far as variable product sensitivities to equity markets, our Investor Day guidance offered back in December still holds. While we expect to encounter volume and top line growth pressures, efficiency mindset continues to be a core tenet of our strategy and managing margin pressures across our business. And as I noted earlier, our plans include meeting our direct expense ratio, full year target of 12.3% despite the challenges of the current environment. I will now discuss cash and capital position on Page 11. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.3 billion at March 31, which is up from $4.2 billion at December 31 and well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The $1.1 billion increase in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, share repurchases, payment of our common dividend, preferred stock and debt issuances as well as holding company expenses. During the quarter, we repurchased $500 million of net common shares with $485 million remaining on our current authorization. We have not been in the market since early March, which we believe to be prudent at this time. Our cash balances are high. Our next debt maturity is December 2022, and we like the optionality and financial flexibility those balances provide us at this time. Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. Using market inputs at the end of the first quarter, interest rates following the observable forward yield curves as of March 31 and equity markets down 20% in 2020, we estimate that our average free cash flow ratio for the two-year period, 2019 and 2020, will hold within our target range of 65% to 75%. Looking forward to the two-year period of 2020 to 2021 and assuming the same March 31, 2020, forward yield curves and a return to normal 5% equity market growth in 2021, we estimate our free cash flow would be within a range of 40% to 60%. This range occurs as we estimate some level of credit losses due to the pandemic over the next 12 to 24 months and some level of additional reserves would be established under current New York cash flow testing requirements, which would impact dividend capacity at our New York domicile statutory company, metropolitan life insurance company, or MLIC. We would not expect such reserves to be required under NAIC standards, and therefore, would not impact our combined NAIC RBC levels. For our U.S. companies, our combined NAIC RBC ratio was 395% at year-end 2019 and comfortably above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, preliminary first quarter 2020 statutory operating losses were approximately $650 million and net income was approximately $260 million. Statutory operating earnings decreased by $1.9 billion from the prior year, primarily due to higher VA reserves. Net income was mostly driven by derivative gains in the quarter. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $21.4 billion as of March 31, 2020, up $2.8 billion from $18.6 billion at December 31, 2019. Derivative gains more than offset operating losses in the first quarter of 2020. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 931% as of December 31, which is the latest public data. Overall, MetLife delivered another solid quarter despite the significant volatility in the capital markets due to COVID-19. Looking ahead, we expect our second quarter adjusted earnings to be dampened by negative private equity returns, but our underlying business fundamentals from our diverse market-leading businesses to remain intact. In addition, we believe our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are resilient and well positioned to manage through this challenging environment. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Okay. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nTom Gallagher: Good morning. John, just to follow up on the updated free cash flow guidance. The \u2013 can you provide a little more color on how this works? How much of the impact would be related to interest rates and credit, because I know you mentioned both? And is it as simple as just thinking there would be AAT reserves of around $1 billion a year for 2020 and 2021. Is this the right way to think about this? And then just my follow-up would be, you had a competitor announce a big long-term care reserve charge recently after a regulatory review. Just want to see whether there\u2019s anything similar going on with New York regulators in MetLife. Thanks.\nJohn McCallion: Good morning, Tom. So on the first question, let me start by saying, I wouldn\u2019t call it guidance, right? This is \u2013 let\u2019s just be clear what our objective here is to provide a scenario. We anchored it on some data or market data as of March 31. So it was really to provide a scenario of free cash flow. And one, we\u2019re considering a level of credit losses and downgrades based on our bottom-up analysis that our investment team has been working through and monitoring and thinking it will play out over a 12- to 24-month period. And two, looking at the potential impact of New York cash flow testing requirements using last year\u2019s requirements. And remember, we get a special consideration letter every year and then considering any new requirements that we\u2019re aware of. And so there, we applied those factors to estimate some level of cash flow testing reserves, again, based on March 31 macro factors. And as I said, Steve and team put forth a bottoms-up review to a value to range of credit losses. And for cash flow testing, we picked a point more stressful than where we are today, that being March 31, where interest rates \u2013 while interest rates are similar, credit spreads were wider back then, equity markets were lower then. I would also point you to just directionally the shape of the curve is more favorable. Actually, it\u2019s more favorable than, I\u2019d say, a year-end base case we used at the outlook call, just given the shape of the curve, given the significant drop in the short end. And then also, as I said, credit spreads, they\u2019re important as well in this, and they have narrowed since March 31. So I think it\u2019s important that to also know that we get this letter every year. The letter we \u2013 the requirements were used from last year\u2019s letter was based on a different macroeconomic environment. So we\u2019re \u2013 every year, we work through with New York in a constructive way, and we\u2019re cautiously optimistic we\u2019ll come to a regional place, but we wanted to give some sensitivity. And I think the other thing I would just add \u2013 this is, I would say, consistent with the direction that we\u2019ve given in the past, right? We\u2019ve said that our free cash flow range of 65% to 75% holds with a 10-year treasury of 1.5% to 4.5%. And then as rates go below that, we would expect that to decline for a year or a two-year average, I should say. And I think that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re trying to share here. And then on LTC. So yes, look, I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not going to comment on someone else\u2019s situation. For us, we work with New York every year. So we \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s anything in particular for us. And we\u2019re always looking at our reserves, and there\u2019s nothing to point out different than what we\u2019re seeing every year.\nTom Gallagher: All right. Thanks, John. And just one quick follow-up, if I could. Is the plan to stay paused with buyback? Or any color you can give on what you\u2019re thinking about the buyback?\nMichel Khalaf: Hi, Tom, it\u2019s Michel. So as John mentioned, we completed $500 million in Q1, buybacks in Q1. We have $45 million left on our current authorization. Since early March, just given the stressed environment, we\u2019ve been prudent to preserve and maintain capital and maintain optionality. There\u2019s no change in our philosophy, I would say, in terms of \u2013 excess capital belongs to shareholders. We\u2019d expect to distribute all free cash flow in the form of dividends and share buybacks while maintaining sufficient liquidity for stress events. Also, if you think about our liquidity buffer $3 billion to $4 billion, and we\u2019re maintaining cash in excess of that, given the uncertain economic environment. And again, we believe that that\u2019s the prudent thing to do. So we\u2019re going to continue to evaluate the situation. We\u2019ll assess our liquidity position based on business and macro conditions. And we\u2019ll sort of \u2013 we\u2019re in a \u2013 I would say, we\u2019ve had the pause button for the time being, but we\u2019ll continue to monitor things and decide when would be an appropriate time to resume buybacks.\nTom Gallagher: All right. Thanks, Michel.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.\nRyan Krueger: Hi, good morning. Back to the free cash flow generation, I just want to maybe just clarify one thing. If rates remain low as in the scenario that you expressed, would that basically create one year of additional asset adequacy testing serves to account for that? And then after you made that reserve addition, you\u2019d go back more towards normal cash flow afterwards?\nJohn McCallion: Hey, Ryan, it\u2019s John. Yes, I think that\u2019s fair. As I said, again, those were off of March 31 rates. Rates are different today. It\u2019s an estimate. We haven\u2019t \u2013 that we apply. We go through a much more longer process to get to the final reserve number. So again, that\u2019s why there\u2019s a wide range there of outcomes. But I think directionally, the way to think of it is, it has an impact on one year\u2019s free cash flow.\nRyan Krueger: Got it. Thanks. And then on your commercial mortgage loan portfolio, can you give us any statistics on kind of forbearance requests and how much has been granted so far?\nSteve Goulart: Hey, Ryan, it\u2019s Steve Goulart. Sure. I mean, obviously, we\u2019ve been expecting to see elevated activity in this. I\u2019ll start by reminding you and everyone else, about the portfolio itself, $50 billion of commercial mortgages with a loan-to-value ratio of 55% for the entire portfolio, 2.4 times debt service coverage. So again, a very secure, low-risk portfolio in our mind. Obviously, in this time, we are seeing elevated requests, as you\u2019d expect, particularly in retail and hotels for forbearance request. We have been getting requests. We have a committee that deals with each and every one. Certainly, we believe that some of these make sense to grant and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing. 90% of the requests have come from hotel and retail. And they\u2019re typically for deferral of interest and/or principal, and typically, what we\u2019ve been granting is in the range of three to four months of forbearance. And remember, it\u2019s forbearance, not forgiveness. So we do expect that these will always be paid. And by the way, we saw virtually no impact on April payments for the portfolio overall. But basically, we\u2019ve granted forbearance on essentially sort of just less than 2% of the total premium balance outstanding at this point in time.\nRyan Krueger: Got it. And then in April, you had almost all of the loans pay?\nSteve Goulart: Correct.\nRyan Krueger: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nNigel Dally: Great. Thanks and good morning. A question on group insurance. Should we be taking some deterioration in the margins given this back-end unemployment? I know it\u2019s typically related to disability claims. And just wanted to get your perspective as to whether that\u2019s a headwind we should be watching out for?\nRamy Tadros: Hey, Nigel, it\u2019s Ramy here. Well, maybe just on underwriting, stepping back and giving you an overall context across the U.S. business. We do have significant diversification across the U.S. business. So think about mortality and longevity across the group and the RIS businesses. And then we also have diversification within each one of those businesses. So if you were to focus on group your question, the current environment is leading to various offsets and give and takes across the product lines. We are seeing favorable impacts in dental, given the lower utilization. We\u2019re seeing actually unfavorable impacts on the life block. And I would say, to date, on the short-term disability block, it\u2019s been a push. We\u2019ve seen an increased number of COVID-related incidents but that\u2019s been more than offset in a decrease in other short-term disability claims, so think issues like elective surgeries and the like. So at this stage, while there\u2019s still some uncertainty, I mean, relating to the overall number of deaths in the U.S. and the impact on the insured population versus the general population, it\u2019s very reasonable to expect at this stage that the overall impact would more or less offset each other on a full year basis.\nJohn McCallion: Maybe I\u2019ll just add to a couple of points to what Ramy mentioned. So because you referenced, I think, unemployment, Nigel. And so a couple of things to point out here. One is that the segment that\u2019s been hardest hit, which is small business. I think our total premiums there are at $1 billion. So it\u2019s not a major component of our current portfolio. And two, if you think about our disability business, it\u2019s 11%, as we showed on Investor Day of our total earnings. So \u2013 and obviously, there, we\u2019ve been also taking steps from a pricing perspective in terms of the guarantees that we provide on \u2013 from a rate perspective to make sure that we are also well positioned for a downturn scenario.\nNigel Dally: That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning, everyone. I had a couple of questions. First, your investment portfolio, can you discuss if you\u2019ve run any stress test on what would happen to your capital and/or your RBC ratio in sort of a mild recession, deep recession? I appreciate your comments in terms of qualitatively, but anything that you\u2019re able to share in terms of numbers on that.\nSteve Goulart: Hi, Jimmy, it\u2019s Steve Goulart again. Let me start by just reminding everybody, I know you probably think I sound like a broken record when I do this, but we\u2019ve been prepositioning this portfolio for a downturn since 2018. And that\u2019s been our outlook \u2013 remember what we talked about at Investor Day, John updated some of those slides. But even going back to Investor Day, we\u2019ve continued to reduce sectors that we were very concerned about below investment grade. We reduced by another $600 million since Investor Day, bank loans also another $600 million since Investor Day. And I think I would have to say, and I think anybody, as you talk to who are involved in investments, would say that we\u2019ve entered this crisis period in better shape than we probably ever have in the past. So we\u2019re very comfortable moving into it. John showed a slide about sensitive sectors and the like, we\u2019ve been analyzing the portfolio a number of different ways. We run it through a number of different tests and lenses. Frankly, many of you out there have actually conducted your own reviews. We actually go through every one of those in detail and just sort of compare to our own. We\u2019ve done longer-term analysis using external models from the rating agencies and other outside experts. We've done a portfolio, kind of, top-down approach comparing the portfolio now to previous crises and downturns, emphasizing the sensitive exposures and how the portfolio has changed since those crises and imputing our historical default and loss experiences in those time periods. But John mentioned what we've actually spent the most time on is the real specific bottom-up individual exposure analysis by our credit and real estate research teams. Again, our core strength is in credit and structured underwriting, and we've been using them to really go through the portfolio to help us assess this. And the result is a very granular assessment of our exposures, we think, are vulnerable to downgrades and losses. And in this analysis, particularly, we really thought of it in two ways. One is sort of a nearer-term recovery, does the economy start opening up, say, sometime in the summer, or really, is it kind of a year-end scenario before the economy starts reopening. And the bottom line assessment is based on what we foresee today, the impact of downgrades and possible losses on our capital in these scenarios is very manageable. That analysis put possible losses of up to $1.4 billion over time, as John said, likely to occur over kind of a 12 to 24 month period and the impact on RBC from downgrades, in that, we would estimate also up to about 25 basis points as well. So again what I would say again is we\u2019ve been preparing for this. In this environment, we expect losses and downgrades above normal. But based on the prepositioning we've done and based on what we noted that we feel very comfortable and think our position is very sound.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And just one on the retirement business. Normally, you'd assume in a low rate environment, your spreads would actually be going down, but they've held in pretty well. So \u2013 and I'm assuming some of that's because of the benefit of this steeper yield curve. So assuming rates stay around here and the yield curves as steep as it is, would you expect your spread to hold up or potentially improve from these levels?\nJohn McCallion: Yes, hi, Jimmy, it's John. Good morning. So yes, spreads were in line with what we've kind of been forecasting for the last few quarters as we said before and coming in at 114 basis points but ex-VII, 83 basis points. And we'll expect, given VII returns in Q2 that this will take our overall spread down and \u2013 in Q2. And just as a frame of reference for VII, 85% to 90% of our VII comes through three segments: it's RIS, MLH and Asia, and it's roughly third each. But let me focus on how the shape of the curve is improving spreads ex VII. And again, I think this highlights some of the diversification that we have in our business products and the tools that we have to deploy in different environments. And so we think for the remainder of this year, we would expect kind of 5 to 10 basis points improvement as a result of the \u2013 how the curve has changed, particularly even since March. I mean, if you just look at LIBOR, I think it's down 100 basis points since the end of the first quarter. And then maybe just to give you a quick update then on sensitivities because I know we gave those to you back at the outlook call. So now where LIBOR is, which is below 50 basis points, you know, our sensitivity would be for every 10-bit move, it would be a $10 million plus or minus depending on whether it goes up or down. The long-term sensitivity doesn\u2019t change but the near term one does. So it almost doubles. So anyway, I thought I'd just provide that color as well.\nJimmy Bhullar: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, in the past, you guys have been asked about potential transactions within MetLife Holdings. You've also done speculations surrounding some sales of certain overseas businesses. So what is the current environment, including lower rates kind of impact the potential for transactions? And would you guys just \u2013 are you guys looking and feel, like, I guess, that could potentially free up capital between either of those two routes?\nJohn McCallion: Good morning, Elyse. This is John. Yes, look we have said this before because I don't think we're necessarily \u2013 I know it's lower rates, but we've been in low rate environments for some time now, and they've gotten lower, certainly, over the last 12-plus months. And so it does put some pressure on that bid-ask spread as we talked about in holdings. And \u2013 but what we've said before is that these are complex blocks of business. And what we always urge the team to do is make sure we're continuing to take an external perspective, doing the work now because when things \u2013 if things were to change and those pricing points were to converge a little more, maybe supply gets even that much greater, there could be a various variety of things. We want to be ready and opportunistic if something makes sense for us. But I'd say, just all else equal, yes, lower rates puts pressure on doing something in holdings at this juncture.\nRamy Tadros: And just maybe more broadly, Elyse, I would sort of add that, obviously, a more challenging macro environment, we cannot ignore that. But it doesn't change our approach to sort of M&A in terms of how we view it. We continue to constantly look at our portfolio and also think through timing and what does \u2013 when does it make sense to maybe do something. So certainly, the environment makes M&A more challenging, I would say, broadly speaking, but it doesn't mean that we stop the work that we do in terms of assessing our businesses. And also, there might be opportunities coming out of this crisis that certainly will spend time also thinking through.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then on \u2013 in terms of PRT, can you just provide us on the outlook for that business? I would also think that there's probably been somewhat of an impact on deal flows, just given a low interest rate environment as well?\nRamy Tadros: Sure, and in terms of the overall pipeline, it has slowed due to the overall environment. A number of drivers within that, including the funding levels, the volatility in the capital markets, and frankly, the priorities of treasury and HR teams in the context of the pandemic. So we've seen a few deals that were pulled out or put on hold in the first quarter, and we're seeing a somewhat lighter pipeline. If activity were to kind of pick back up in the second half of the year, we expect to get our fair share. And I'd remind you that we were a top three player in that market last year. But when you think of RIS, again, remember, RIS has a lot more than PRT in it. PRT is one product line in the context of a diversified context. And as Michel and John referenced, we've seen a substantial pick up in our stable value business in the last quarter, and we're seeing very healthy over \u2013 year-over-year increase in the liability balances. And certainly for the full year in terms of liability balances, we'd expect to still be within the guidance range that we've talked about.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, thank you for the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nErik Bass: Hi, thank you. In the group business, can you help us think of the potential impact on premiums from the current environment? And how quickly would you start to see an impact? And does this differ materially by plan size?\nRamy Tadros: Sure, let me just maybe start by profiling the overall PFO mix and then talk about some of the dynamics coming out of that. So remember, 75% of our PFOs are coming from national accounts, so think large employers. And when you think about the headline unemployment numbers there that you're seeing in the economy, those have really disproportionately impact smaller employers, part-time workers and the like. And the other dynamic in our national accounts book that's important is that the ultimate impact that we would actually see is going to be also influenced by the benefit practices of certain large employers. So you've seen examples where employers have continued to provide benefits for furloughed workers. So that's kind of one just triangulation point for you. The other piece, when you think about top line for this business is that we have a diversified book by industry and geography. And just like what we do in the credit portfolio, we've done the same thing here in terms of looking at industries, which are most at risk in terms of unemployment levels and benefits being cut. And that percentage is just shy of 10% of our entire book. So as an example, hotels and leisure is less than 2%. So you put all of that together, you put the fact that we\u2019re getting strong persistency above our expectations, we\u2019re getting good renewal actions at expectations. You put all of that together, we'll see some headwinds to PFOs related to overall unemployment, but I would say we would still see some PFO growth for the full year, albeit modest and likely shy of the 4% to 6% range that we've talked about, but nevertheless, we will see growth. Two other points, just to bear in mind as you think about the timing, we have implemented a premium credit in our dental business for the months of April and May, given the significant drop in utilization of dental services. And we will align the dental premiums for the balance of 2020 with the expected utilization of services. So when you think about our Q2 number, we will be shifting some revenue recognition from Q2 to the second half of the year. And the second point to highlight here again in the context of $1 billion or so voluntary business that we talked about on our Investor Day, we talked about a 30% CAGR in that business, historically. We're still expecting for 2020 to still see double-digit CAGR in PFOs for voluntary. And while unemployment levels are a headwind, we have tailwinds here. We have increased awareness of the needs of \u2013 for this product, and we're starting from a place where there's relatively low penetration of these products with employee population.\nErik Bass: Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful color. And then one for John, as we think about your GAAP interest rate assumption, is the sensitivity to changes still in line with what you've discussed in the past of rough $50 million per 25 basis point change? And is there a level where that kind of linearity changes, and I guess, loss recognition could become an issue for any of the blocks?\nJohn McCallion: Good morning, Erik. So, I would say, to start, the answer \u2013 you kind of outlined it pretty well. In the beginning, the first few 25 bp reduction would be fairly consistent and then it would begin to grow. So if you said maybe the first \u2013 don't take this for like we've modeled it exactly, but let's say, the first two are roughly $50 million. And then if you move to another \u2013 the next 100 basis points, it would start to grow a little more each time. Look, we've actually done some sizing, rough sizing, and this isn't something that we're \u2013 there should be no indication of us making any change ahead of time or not. But we've looked at if it was 150 basis point move down, that would roughly be somewhere between $400 million and $450 million of an impact and no loss recognition testing impact still. So we have done some stress and sensitivities, but that's our best estimates at this time.\nErik Bass: Great, thank you. That\u2019s helpful.\nOperator: And at this time, I'd like to turn it back to Michel Khalaf for any closing comments.\nMichel Khalaf: Thank you operator. When I took the job of CEO just over a year ago, I envisioned a lot of things happening during my first year on the job, the coronavirus was not one of them. At a time when we all need silver linings, mine is how MetLife's employees have stepped up for our customers. It's fashionable for companies to say they are purpose driven. The team at MetLife really walks the talk. I'm so privileged to lead this company at a time when we're making such a critical difference in peoples\u2019 lives. Thank you for listening. Please stay safe, and have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michel Khalaf",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I'd to begin by acknowledging the difficulties and challenges that so many people have injured as a result of the pandemic. What the world has been living through its tragic, yet it is also demonstrating the best of humanity. We see this every day as thousands of first responders, health care workers and other frontline employees risk their lives to care for others and provide essential services. And we see it at MetLife as our employees go above and beyond to deliver on our promises to customers. While we feel the effects of the crisis deeply, both the personal loss and the economic disruption, these are the moments that MetLife is built for. At our Investor Day last December, I led with the importance we place on being a purpose-driven company. Our purpose statement always with you, building a more confident future has taken on greater meaning in the current environment. People are counting on us like never before to provide the value, support and financial security they need. Our next horizon strategy is a road map for how the company will create value for all of its stakeholders: our people, our customers, our shareholders and our communities. As I have said before, it is our people who will deliver for our customers, and that in turn is how we will create value for our shareholders and communities. It starts with our people, which means making their health and well-being our top priority. We've done that in a variety of ways. We rapidly moved employees to a work-from-home environment, expanded benefit to help cover COVID-19 testing and treatment, enhanced mental health support to help employees cope with stress and deployed tools and resources to keep people connected. I am proud of the level of engagement and motivation our people are showing, they know they are making a difference. Since we do business in many markets, MetLife got an early look at how the pandemic could affect societies and our own operations. Our experience in Asia gave us a running start on the activation of our business continuity plan globally. Across our enterprise, 92% of our 38,000 non-agent employees are now working from home, including 98% in the United States. Of course, the true test of our business continuity plan was not merely whether employees could log on from home but whether they had full functionality to be able to deliver for our customers. On this front, we are very pleased that we've been able to maintain service levels with 95% of all customer calls, claims and other transactions successfully handled by employees working remotely. This includes our group insurance business, where even in this highly disrupted environment, MetLife still expects to meet or exceed its performance guarantees. For our customers, this moment is crucial. The way we show up now will resonate with them for years to come. Across the enterprise, we are acting to provide them with comprehensive and compassionate care. We are extending premium grace period, fast-tracking claims, crediting or adjusting auto and dental premiums and providing our digital financial wellness portal to small businesses and their employees at no cost. The shutdown of face-to-face distribution has also spurred us to innovate and accelerate the digital transformation of our business. In China, for example, sales of our medical reimbursement product rose sharply after we created a WeChat store for agents. In times of prices, we must do more for the communities where we work and live. MetLife Foundation has committed $25 million and MetLife has donated millions of dollars and thousands of masks, disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizers to the COVID-19 spike. We also had a unique opportunity to help. As a large commercial real estate investor, we were pleased to work with the State of New York to offer the Intercontinental Times Square as free housing for medical workers. Most impactful is the social and economic benefit MetLife create as a life insurance company. The heart of our business is a promise to pay when people need us most. For the power of risk putting, the premiums of the many become payment to those who need them. MetLife paid more than $24 billion in policyholder claims, benefits and dividends in the U.S. alone last year, an average of more than $65 million a day. At a time when peoples' jobs and income are at risk, life insurers form a vital part of the social safety net that sustains people financially. MetLife entered the current period of uncertainty from the position of strength. As you know, we've made substantial changes to our strategy and product portfolio. The biggest change is to the profile of our liabilities. We are now a less market-sensitive and capital-intensive company. At our Investor Day, we showed that approximately two thirds of our adjusted earnings came from protection and fee-based products and only one third from spread-related businesses. Within our investment portfolio, we took early action in anticipation of a recession. Beginning in 2018, we became concerned about certain lower-rated areas of the credit markets. We reduced our holdings in sectors and names that we thought would carry heightened risk in a downturn. Overall, our investment portfolio is marked by broad diversification, high quality and ample liquidity. Notably, at our operating insurance companies, we have nearly $100 billion of U.S. government and agency securities, Japan government bonds and other cash and short-term investments. MetLife has also further strengthened its already strong capital and liquidity position. As part of our planned capital actions, in late March, we accessed the bond market when few others could to raise $1 billion. For the quarter, this helped bring the company's total cash and liquid assets at our holding companies to $5.3 billion. Our combined U.S. NAIC risk-based capital ratio as of year-end 2019 was 395%, and we enjoy higher ratings from all major credit-rating agencies. Another proactive step we've taken is to increase our focus on expenses. MetLife remains committed to meeting the expense target we set as part of our unit cost initiative program. In the current environment, perhaps no area gives us greater opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to consistent execution than expense discipline. As we announced last week, our financial strength enabled us to increase our quarterly common stock dividend, which provides a steady and growing source of income to millions of people during this economically challenging time. We raised our second quarter 2020 common stock dividend by 4.5% which illustrates our confidence in MetLife's future. Given our strong starting position, we expect the impact of the pandemic to be an earnings event, not a balance sheet event. MetLife has a great set of globally diversified businesses, some of which may be pressured by today's unprecedented events while others act as offsets. Take our Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS, business. While we are seeing a slowdown in new pension risk transfer deals, we are also seeing a surge in demand for our stable value offerings as 401(k) sponsors and participants seek the safety of these book value products backed by MetLife. And although rollover reinvestment rates continue to be pressured for our long-tailed businesses in RIS, the current configuration of the yield curve, very low at the short hand and a positive slope, is favorable for our capital markets, investment products and securities lending activities. Similar balance exists across our global protection businesses, where mortality, morbidity, longevity and Property & Casualty risks serve as natural offsets. At the core, our scale, strong balance sheet and broad diversification are key strengths of our franchise. These trends enabled us to generate first quarter adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.58 per share, up 7% from a year ago. The direct impacts on our adjusted earnings from the pandemic and economic slowdown were limited. Adjusted earnings reflected strong underwriting margins and group benefits and favorable underwriting margins in Property & Casualty. Variable investment income was very strong mostly due to private equity, which is registered on a one quarter lag. These positives were offset in part by unfavorable market factors across interest rates, equities and foreign currency. Net income was $4.4 billion or $4.75 per share, up from $1.40 per year prior. Falling interest rates drove substantial gains in the derivatives we hold to protect our balance sheet. Book value per excluding AOCI, other than FCTA, was $52.36, up 7% sequentially from year-end while adjusted return on equity on the same basis totaled 12.6%. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate the greatest earnings impact will be felt within variable investment income, where we expect less favorable private equity returns for a time. The strong historical returns associated with our private equity portfolio and its role as a good match for our long-dated liabilities justify this asset class as an important ongoing component of the general account. In fact, the current economic turmoil is precisely the environment where the speeds of tomorrow's private equity returns are being planted. We believe our Next Horizon strategy was the right approach before the pandemic struck, and we are even more confident that the pillars of focus, simplify and differentiate are the right approach today. By focusing even more intently on where we deploy capital and by further simplifying the company, we will enable MetLife to emerge from the current environment in the best shape possible. If anything, we must accelerate our Next Horizon work. This is how we will truly differentiate MetLife and capture the opportunities that periods of disruptions always bring. MetLife has seen many such periods during this history, the 1918 flu pandemic, The Great Depression, World War II, 9/11, the financial crisis. Through all of them, we never faltered. We maintained our financial strength, kept our promises and provided people with the security and confidence they need. That's what we mean when we say, always with you, and it will be true throughout this pandemic and beyond. I will now turn the call over to John McCallion. Hi, Tom, it's Michel. So as John mentioned, we completed $500 million in Q1, buybacks in Q1. We have $45 million left on our current authorization. Since early March, just given the stressed environment, we've been prudent to preserve and maintain capital and maintain optionality. There's no change in our philosophy, I would say, in terms of \u2013 excess capital belongs to shareholders. We'd expect to distribute all free cash flow in the form of dividends and share buybacks while maintaining sufficient liquidity for stress events. Also, if you think about our liquidity buffer $3 billion to $4 billion, and we're maintaining cash in excess of that, given the uncertain economic environment. And again, we believe that that's the prudent thing to do. So we're going to continue to evaluate the situation. We'll assess our liquidity position based on business and macro conditions. And we'll sort of \u2013 we're in a \u2013 I would say, we've had the pause button for the time being, but we'll continue to monitor things and decide when would be an appropriate time to resume buybacks. Thank you operator. When I took the job of CEO just over a year ago, I envisioned a lot of things happening during my first year on the job, the coronavirus was not one of them. At a time when we all need silver linings, mine is how MetLife's employees have stepped up for our customers. It's fashionable for companies to say they are purpose driven. The team at MetLife really walks the talk. I'm so privileged to lead this company at a time when we're making such a critical difference in peoples' lives. Thank you for listening.

            "name": "Ramy Tadros",
            "content": "Hey, Nigel, it's Ramy here. Well, maybe just on underwriting, stepping back and giving you an overall context across the U.S. business. We do have significant diversification across the U.S. business. So think about mortality and longevity across the group and the RIS businesses. And then we also have diversification within each one of those businesses. So if you were to focus on group your question, the current environment is leading to various offsets and give and takes across the product lines. We are seeing favorable impacts in dental, given the lower utilization. We're seeing actually unfavorable impacts on the life block. And I would say, to date, on the short-term disability block, it's been a push. We've seen an increased number of COVID-related incidents but that's been more than offset in a decrease in other short-term disability claims, so think issues like elective surgeries and the like. So at this stage, while there's still some uncertainty, I mean, relating to the overall number of deaths in the U.S. and the impact on the insured population versus the general population, it's very reasonable to expect at this stage that the overall impact would more or less offset each other on a full year basis. And just maybe more broadly, Elyse, I would sort of add that, obviously, a more challenging macro environment, we cannot ignore that. But it doesn't change our approach to sort of M&A in terms of how we view it. We continue to constantly look at our portfolio and also think through timing and what does \u2013 when does it make sense to maybe do something. So certainly, the environment makes M&A more challenging, I would say, broadly speaking, but it doesn't mean that we stop the work that we do in terms of assessing our businesses. And also, there might be opportunities coming out of this crisis that certainly will spend time also thinking through. Sure, and in terms of the overall pipeline, it has slowed due to the overall environment. A number of drivers within that, including the funding levels, the volatility in the capital markets, and frankly, the priorities of treasury and HR teams in the context of the pandemic.

So you put all of that together, you put the fact that we're getting strong persistency above our expectations, we're getting good renewal actions at expectations. You put all of that together, we'll see some headwinds to PFOs related to overall unemployment, but I would say we would still see some PFO growth for the full year, albeit modest and likely shy of the 4% to 6% range that we've talked about, but nevertheless, we will see growth. Two other points, just to bear in mind as you think about the timing, we have implemented a premium credit in our dental business for the months of April and May, given the significant drop in utilization of dental services. And we will align the dental premiums for the balance of 2020 with the expected utilization of services. So when you think about our Q2 number, we will be shifting some revenue recognition from Q2 to the second half of the year. And the second point to highlight here again in the context of $1 billion or so voluntary business that we talked about on our Investor Day, we talked about a 30% CAGR in that business, historically. We're still expecting for 2020 to still see double-digit CAGR in PFOs for voluntary. And while unemployment levels are a headwind, we have tailwinds here. We have increased awareness of the needs of \u2013 for this product, and we're starting from a place where there's relatively low penetration of these products with employee population."

            "content": "Thank you, Michel, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the first quarter 2020 supplemental slides that we released last evening, which highlight information on our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. In addition, the slides provide more detail on our investments, outlook for the second quarter as well as an update of our cash and capital positions. Starting on Page 3. This schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the first quarter. Net income in the first quarter was $4.4 billion, or approximately $3 billion higher than adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion. This variance is primarily due to net derivative gains resulting from the significant decline in interest rates during the quarter. The results in the investment portfolio and hedging program continue to perform as expected. Turning to Page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items. This quarter's results did not include any notable items, while the prior year quarter had $55 million associated with our unit cost initiative, which was accounted for in Corporate & Other. Excluding the unit cost in the first quarter of 2019, adjusted earnings were down 2% and essentially flat on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were up 3% and up 5% on a constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases. Overall, positive year-over-year drivers include strong variable investment income, solid volume growth, favorable expense margins and lower taxes. This was offset by equity market weakness, lower recurring interest margins and less favorable underwriting compared to first quarter of 2019. Turning to the performance of our businesses. Group benefits adjusted earnings were down 9% year-over-year. The group life mortality ratio was 87.9%, which is slightly above the midpoint of our annual target range of 85% to 90%, but less favorable to the exceptionally strong prior year quarter of 85.3%, which was the best first quarter mortality ratio in over 15 years. The interest adjusted benefit ratio for Non-Medical Health was 71.7%, which is below our annual target range of 72% to 77% and also favorable to the prior year quarter of 72.9%. The primary driver was strong disability results, which benefited from higher claim recoveries, lower incidents and lower severity. With regards to the top line, group benefits adjusted PFOs were up 7% due to solid growth across all markets. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 26% year-over-year. RIS investment spreads for the quarter were 114 basis points, up 18 basis points year-over-year and up 8 basis points sequentially. Spreads in the quarter benefited from higher private equity returns and a decline in LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures grew 9% driven by very strong growth in the second half of 2019 and exceptionally strong stable value sales in the quarter, which benefited from a flight-to-safety amid the turbulent equity markets as well as opportunistic issuances in our capital markets investment products. While liability exposures grew, RIS PFOs were down 32% due to the mix of sales in the quarter, driven by lower structured settlement and income annuity sales. Property & Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings were up 12% versus the prior year. The overall combined ratio is 91%, which was below our annual target range of 92% to 97% and the prior year quarter of 92.2%. P&C results benefited from favorable non-catastrophe weather in homeowners and auto. P&C auto also benefited from lower auto frequency over the last two weeks of the quarter due to the COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were down 2% and flat on a constant currency basis. Solid volume growth was driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 7% and 9% on a constant currency basis. This was offset by less favorable underwriting margins, unfavorable equity markets in Japan and Korea, and lower investment margins. Latin America adjusted earnings were down 29% and down 19% on a constant currency basis. The primary year-over-year driver was lower equity markets impacting our Chilean encaje returns, which was a negative 11% in the quarter versus a plus 5% return in 1Q of 2019. Excluding the impact from encaje, Latin America adjusted earnings were up 23% on a constant currency basis due to higher investment margins, solid volume growth and favorable underwriting. EMEA adjusted earnings were down 9% and down 6% on a constant currency basis as lower equity markets and less favorable underwriting margins were partially offset by better expense margins and solid volume growth across the region. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by adverse equity markets. The separate account return in the quarter was a negative 14.4%, which was better than the 20% decline in the S&P as roughly 30% of funds are allocated to fixed accounts. This resulted in a negative $20 million initial impact, which compares to an approximately $15 million positive initial impact in first quarter of 2019. With regards to underwriting, the life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 51%, which is near the bottom end of our annual target range of 50% to 55%. Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $131 million. This result compared favorably to the prior year quarter, which had an adjusted loss of $138 million, excluding $55 million of UCI costs. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 17.5% and 20.2% on a run rate basis when adjusting for a favorable $45 million tax benefit in the quarter. Now let's turn to Page 5 to discuss variable investment income in more detail. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income in 2019, including $351 million earned in the first quarter of 2020. Our private equity portfolio, which is generally accounted for on a one quarter lag, had another solid quarter. With regards to recurring investment income, our new money rate was 3.56% versus a roll-off rate of 3.92% in the quarter. This compares to a new money rate of 4.04% and a roll-off rate of 4.15% in first quarter of 2019. Lower interest rates have pressured this relationship, but wider credit spreads in the quarter have provided an offset. Now on Page 6, the chart on Page 6 highlights our strong historical private equity returns. Steve Goulart presented a version of this slide at Investor Day, showing private equity returns going back to 2016. Given the focus on our private equity in the current environment, we've decided to expand this view showing returns going back to the financial crisis in 2008. Our private equity portfolio was $7.6 billion as of March 31, which represents less than 2% of the general account assets under management. It is well-diversified across strategy, geography and portfolio managers and provides a good fit against long-term liabilities. As you can see from the chart, our private equity investments have generated an average return of 12% since 2008, and only in 2009 the trough of the financial crisis that this portfolio failed to generate a positive return. These next two slides are shown \u2013 were shown at our Investor Day, but they're helpful reminders. On Page 7 you can see our portfolio loss history since 2008. The chart highlights a strong track record of performance as our cumulative impairment rate of 1.2% is roughly half that of the industry peer group. It also speaks to MetLife Investment Management's culture of disciplined underwriting, deep fundamental analysis and strong risk management, with a particular focus on private asset origination. Turning to Page 8, as we've discussed previously, we have been proactive in improving the quality of our portfolio with a focus on significantly reducing our exposure to below-investment-grade credit and syndicated bank loans. We are also highly focused on our low BBB exposure given fallen angel risk. Our BBB minus credit exposure is roughly 4% of the general account AUM and 46% of this is private placements, which benefit from better financial covenants in place. I would also call to your attention, Page 14 in the appendix, which displays that we have relatively modest fixed maturity exposures to stress sectors. You can see our largest exposure on the chart is our energy portfolio of approximately $8.7 billion, of which 85% is investment grade. The energy portfolio is well diversified across subsectors and issuers. And we believe it is defensively positioned given the changes that we have made since the last downturn for the energy sector back in 2016. Turning to Page 9, this chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2019 and first quarter of 2020. Through year-end 2019, we have achieved 170 basis points improvement in our direct expense ratio. And while we expect top line pressure in 2020, we remain committed to achieving our 12.3% full year target as we continue to deploy an efficiency mindset, to increase capacity for reinvestment and to protect the margins of the firm. Now I'd like to spend some time reviewing several key considerations for the second quarter, given the uncertainty of the current environment. These considerations are summarized on Page 10 with further detail offered by segment on Page 13 in the appendix. Starting with investments. As Michel indicated, we anticipate the largest impact of the current environment to manifest in variable investment income with the return on our private equity portfolio. While we received a limited number of PE reports to date, our best estimate for the second quarter is a negative high-single to low double-digit return. In thinking about our recurring investment income, we continue to experience downward pressure, but reinvestment rates held reasonably steady during the first quarter as credit spreads widened to offset falling treasury rates and also provided good reinvestment opportunities. During the last week of March, we were able to invest roughly $2 billion in high-quality investments that yielded on average 5.4%. Additionally, while interest rates remained low, the curve has steepened, which improves margins in our capital market products and RIS in our securities lending program. Moving on to underwriting margins. Broadly speaking, we anticipate modest underwriting impacts on a combined basis in the second quarter from COVID-19, but there are many moving parts. To date, while we've seen limited impact from COVID-19 on life claims in the U.S., we do expect this to increase during the second quarter. However, claims activity in dental has declined and auto claims frequency is down with fewer miles driven. Additionally, we would expect some level of offsets from businesses with longevity risks. So currently, we expect a limited overall impact to underwriting margins on a combined basis in 2Q. Turning to top line metrics. We would expect 2Q sales to be challenged in most of our markets with risk of further pressure in future quarters. Additionally, as Michel mentioned, for April and May, we've provided a 15% premium credit for MetLife personal auto customers and a 20% premium adjustment for our fully-insured dental business within group benefits for the two months. As far as variable product sensitivities to equity markets, our Investor Day guidance offered back in December still holds. While we expect to encounter volume and top line growth pressures, efficiency mindset continues to be a core tenet of our strategy and managing margin pressures across our business. And as I noted earlier, our plans include meeting our direct expense ratio, full year target of 12.3% despite the challenges of the current environment. I will now discuss cash and capital position on Page 11. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.3 billion at March 31, which is up from $4.2 billion at December 31 and well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The $1.1 billion increase in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, share repurchases, payment of our common dividend, preferred stock and debt issuances as well as holding company expenses. During the quarter, we repurchased $500 million of net common shares with $485 million remaining on our current authorization. We have not been in the market since early March, which we believe to be prudent at this time. Our cash balances are high. Our next debt maturity is December 2022, and we like the optionality and financial flexibility those balances provide us at this time. Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. Using market inputs at the end of the first quarter, interest rates following the observable forward yield curves as of March 31 and equity markets down 20% in 2020, we estimate that our average free cash flow ratio for the two-year period, 2019 and 2020, will hold within our target range of 65% to 75%. Looking forward to the two-year period of 2020 to 2021 and assuming the same March 31, 2020, forward yield curves and a return to normal 5% equity market growth in 2021, we estimate our free cash flow would be within a range of 40% to 60%. This range occurs as we estimate some level of credit losses due to the pandemic over the next 12 to 24 months and some level of additional reserves would be established under current New York cash flow testing requirements, which would impact dividend capacity at our New York domicile statutory company, metropolitan life insurance company, or MLIC. We would not expect such reserves to be required under NAIC standards, and therefore, would not impact our combined NAIC RBC levels. For our U.S. companies, our combined NAIC RBC ratio was 395% at year-end 2019 and comfortably above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, preliminary first quarter 2020 statutory operating losses were approximately $650 million and net income was approximately $260 million. Statutory operating earnings decreased by $1.9 billion from the prior year, primarily due to higher VA reserves. Net income was mostly driven by derivative gains in the quarter. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $21.4 billion as of March 31, 2020, up $2.8 billion from $18.6 billion at December 31, 2019. Derivative gains more than offset operating losses in the first quarter of 2020. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 931% as of December 31, which is the latest public data. Overall, MetLife delivered another solid quarter despite the significant volatility in the capital markets due to COVID-19. Looking ahead, we expect our second quarter adjusted earnings to be dampened by negative private equity returns, but our underlying business fundamentals from our diverse market-leading businesses to remain intact. In addition, we believe our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are resilient and well positioned to manage through this challenging environment. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Good morning, Tom. So on the first question, let me start by saying, I wouldn't call it guidance, right? This is \u2013 let's just be clear what our objective here is to provide a scenario. We anchored it on some data or market data as of March 31. So it was really to provide a scenario of free cash flow. And one, we're considering a level of credit losses and downgrades based on our bottom-up analysis that our investment team has been working through and monitoring and thinking it will play out over a 12- to 24-month period. And two, looking at the potential impact of New York cash flow testing requirements using last year's requirements. And remember, we get a special consideration letter every year and then considering any new requirements that we're aware of. And so there, we applied those factors to estimate some level of cash flow testing reserves, again, based on March 31 macro factors. And as I said, Steve and team put forth a bottoms-up review to a value to range of credit losses. And for cash flow testing, we picked a point more stressful than where we are today, that being March 31, where interest rates \u2013 while interest rates are similar, credit spreads were wider back then, equity markets were lower then. I would also point you to just directionally the shape of the curve is more favorable. Actually, it's more favorable than, I'd say, a year-end base case we used at the outlook call, just given the shape of the curve, given the significant drop in the short end. And then also, as I said, credit spreads, they're important as well in this, and they have narrowed since March 31. So I think it's important that to also know that we get this letter every year. The letter we \u2013 the requirements were used from last year's letter was based on a different macroeconomic environment. So we're \u2013 every year, we work through with New York in a constructive way, and we're cautiously optimistic we'll come to a regional place, but we wanted to give some sensitivity. And I think the other thing I would just add \u2013 this is, I would say, consistent with the direction that we've given in the past, right? We've said that our free cash flow range of 65% to 75% holds with a 10-year treasury of 1.5% to 4.5%. And then as rates go below that, we would expect that to decline for a year or a two-year average, I should say. And I think that's kind of what we're trying to share here. And then on LTC. So yes, look, I don't \u2013 I'm not going to comment on someone else's situation. For us, we work with New York every year. So we \u2013 I wouldn't say there's anything in particular for us. And we're always looking at our reserves, and there's nothing to point out different than what we're seeing every year. Hey, Ryan, it's John. Yes, I think that's fair. As I said, again, those were off of March 31 rates. Rates are different today. It's an estimate. We haven't \u2013 that we apply. We go through a much more longer process to get to the final reserve number. So again, that's why there's a wide range there of outcomes. But I think directionally, the way to think of it is, it has an impact on one year's free cash flow. Maybe I'll just add to a couple of points to what Ramy mentioned. So because you referenced, I think, unemployment, Nigel. And so a couple of things to point out here. One is that the segment that's been hardest hit, which is small business. I think our total premiums there are at $1 billion. So it's not a major component of our current portfolio. And two, if you think about our disability business, it's 11%, as we showed on Investor Day of our total earnings. So \u2013 and obviously, there, we've been also taking steps from a pricing perspective in terms of the guarantees that we provide on \u2013 from a rate perspective to make sure that we are also well positioned for a downturn scenario. Yes, hi, Jimmy, it's John. Good morning. So yes, spreads were in line with what we've kind of been forecasting for the last few quarters as we said before and coming in at 114 basis points but ex-VII, 83 basis points. And we'll expect, given VII returns in Q2 that this will take our overall spread down and \u2013 in Q2. And just as a frame of reference for VII, 85% to 90% of our VII comes through three segments: it's RIS, MLH and Asia, and it's roughly third each. But let me focus on how the shape of the curve is improving spreads ex VII. And again, I think this highlights some of the diversification that we have in our business products and the tools that we have to deploy in different environments. And so we think for the remainder of this year, we would expect kind of 5 to 10 basis points improvement as a result of the \u2013 how the curve has changed, particularly even since March. I mean, if you just look at LIBOR, I think it's down 100 basis points since the end of the first quarter. And then maybe just to give you a quick update then on sensitivities because I know we gave those to you back at the outlook call. So now where LIBOR is, which is below 50 basis points, you know, our sensitivity would be for every 10-bit move, it would be a $10 million plus or minus depending on whether it goes up or down. The long-term sensitivity doesn't change but the near term one does. So it almost doubles. So anyway, I thought I'd just provide that color as well. Good morning, Elyse. This is John. Yes, look we have said this before because I don't think we're necessarily \u2013 I know it's lower rates, but we've been in low rate environments for some time now, and they've gotten lower, certainly, over the last 12-plus months. And so it does put some pressure on that bid-ask spread as we talked about in holdings. And \u2013 but what we've said before is that these are complex blocks of business. And what we always urge the team to do is make sure we're continuing to take an external perspective, doing the work now because when things \u2013 if things were to change and those pricing points were to converge a little more, maybe supply gets even that much greater, there could be a various variety of things. We want to be ready and opportunistic if something makes sense for us. But I'd say, just all else equal, yes, lower rates puts pressure on doing something in holdings at this juncture. Good morning, Erik. So, I would say, to start, the answer \u2013 you kind of outlined it pretty well. In the beginning, the first few 25 bp reduction would be fairly consistent and then it would begin to grow. So if you said maybe the first \u2013 don't take this for like we've modeled it exactly, but let's say, the first two are roughly $50 million. And then if you move to another \u2013 the next 100 basis points, it would start to grow a little more each time. Look, we've actually done some sizing, rough sizing, and this isn't something that we're \u2013 there should be no indication of us making any change ahead of time or not. But we've looked at if it was 150 basis point move down, that would roughly be somewhere between $400 million and $450 million of an impact and no loss recognition testing impact still. So we have done some stress and sensitivities, but that's our best estimates at this time."

            "name": "Steve Goulart",
            "content": "Hey, Ryan, it's Steve Goulart. Sure. I mean, obviously, we've been expecting to see elevated activity in this. I'll start by reminding you and everyone else, about the portfolio itself, $50 billion of commercial mortgages with a loan-to-value ratio of 55% for the entire portfolio, 2.4 times debt service coverage. So again, a very secure, low-risk portfolio in our mind. Obviously, in this time, we are seeing elevated requests, as you'd expect, particularly in retail and hotels for forbearance request. We have been getting requests. We have a committee that deals with each and every one. Certainly, we believe that some of these make sense to grant and that's what we've been doing. 90% of the requests have come from hotel and retail. And they're typically for deferral of interest and/or principal, and typically, what we've been granting is in the range of three to four months of forbearance. And remember, it's forbearance, not forgiveness. So we do expect that these will always be paid. And by the way, we saw virtually no impact on April payments for the portfolio overall. But basically, we've granted forbearance on essentially sort of just less than 2% of the total premium balance outstanding at this point in time. Correct. Hi, Jimmy, it's Steve Goulart again. Let me start by just reminding everybody, I know you probably think I sound like a broken record when I do this, but we've been prepositioning this portfolio for a downturn since 2018. And that's been our outlook \u2013 remember what we talked about at Investor Day, John updated some of those slides. But even going back to Investor Day, we've continued to reduce sectors that we were very concerned about below investment grade. We reduced by another $600 million since Investor Day, bank loans also another $600 million since Investor Day. And I think I would have to say, and I think anybody, as you talk to who are involved in investments, would say that we've entered this crisis period in better shape than we probably ever have in the past. So we're very comfortable moving into it. John showed a slide about sensitive sectors and the like, we've been analyzing the portfolio a number of different ways. We run it through a number of different tests and lenses. Frankly, many of you out there have actually conducted your own reviews. We actually go through every one of those in detail and just sort of compare to our own. We've done longer-term analysis using external models from the rating agencies and other outside experts. We've done a portfolio, kind of, top-down approach comparing the portfolio now to previous crises and downturns, emphasizing the sensitive exposures and how the portfolio has changed since those crises and imputing our historical default and loss experiences in those time periods. But John mentioned what we've actually spent the most time on is the real specific bottom-up individual exposure analysis by our credit and real estate research teams. Again, our core strength is in credit and structured underwriting, and we've been using them to really go through the portfolio to help us assess this. And the result is a very granular assessment of our exposures, we think, are vulnerable to downgrades and losses. And in this analysis, particularly, we really thought of it in two ways. One is sort of a nearer-term recovery, does the economy start opening up, say, sometime in the summer, or really, is it kind of a year-end scenario before the economy starts reopening. And the bottom line assessment is based on what we foresee today, the impact of downgrades and possible losses on our capital in these scenarios is very manageable. That analysis put possible losses of up to $1.4 billion over time, as John said, likely to occur over kind of a 12 to 24 month period and the impact on RBC from downgrades, in that, we would estimate also up to about 25 basis points as well. So again what I would say again is we've been preparing for this. In this environment, we expect losses and downgrades above normal. But based on the prepositioning we've done and based on what we noted that we feel very comfortable and think our position is very sound."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday\u2019s earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife\u2019s SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.\nJohn Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife\u2019s fourth quarter 2021 earnings and near-term outlook call. Before we begin, I\u2019d point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management. Last evening, we released a set of supplemental slides, which address the quarter as well as our near-term outlook. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. An appendix to these slides features outlook sensitivities, disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information, which you should also review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In light of the busy morning, Q&A will last no later than the top of the hour. In fairness to all, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michel.\nMichel Khalaf: Thank you, John and good morning everyone. MetLife\u2019s financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year of 2021 was outstanding. Our strategic decisions to diversify MetLife by product and geography allocate a prudent portion of our assets to private equity, balanced growth with cash generation and return excess capital to shareholders paid off in the form of banner adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share. In the fourth quarter of 2021, MetLife delivered adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion level with Q4 2020. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.17, up 7% year-over-year. Excluding the notable tax item in the quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $2.01. Heading into the quarter, one of the biggest questions facing life insurers was whether Q4 COVID-related impacts would be as challenging as they were in Q3. In the U.S. group business, that remains the case as lower severity was offset by higher frequency to keep the group life ratio well above normal, yet MetLife\u2019s diversity remained evident and the continued outperformance of our investment portfolio. Variable investment income contributed $1.3 billion in the quarter. Our private equity holdings returned 7.9%, with venture capital once again the standout at 13%. As we noted last quarter, PE generates significant cash for MetLife. Over the last 6 years, cash distributions from the portfolio have totaled $8.6 billion. Looking at 2021 as a whole, it was a year of performance, purpose and progress. MetLife delivered strong performance across the board. Despite the divestiture of P&C and other businesses, adjusted PFOs, excluding PRTs were still up 2% to $45.5 billion. Full year sales were up 40% in U.S. group, 19% in Latin America and 11% in Asia. The return on our private equity portfolio was above 40%. Our direct expense ratio was down 40 basis points to 11.6% and we reported adjusted earnings of $8 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $9.15, both the highest amount ever posted by MetLife. We believe our growing track record of consistent execution even in the face of adversity has reinforced the narrative of MetLife as a resilient company. MetLife\u2019s purpose is to be there for our customers, always helping them build a more confident future. Nowhere is a life insurance company\u2019s purpose more evident than in the grips of a pandemic. Over the course of 2021, COVID claims totaled $2 billion globally and $3 billion since the beginning of the pandemic. We cannot heal the pain of losing a loved one, but we can and do help families recover from the financial damage so that they can move forward. We are honored to be part of an industry that makes such a positive difference in people\u2019s lives. Finally, 2021 was a year in which we continued to make progress on the pillars of our Next Horizon strategy. We remain focused on deploying capital to its most productive use. In the absence of attractive M&A opportunities, we returned significant capital to shareholders. We continued to simplify the company through strategic divestitures and further strengthening our operating leverage. Despite higher inflation, we still expect our direct expense ratio to be below 12.3% for the full year 2022. And we further differentiated MetLife with an entry into the financial wellness space called Upwise that allows us to connect directly with consumers and help them build the habits of financial success. MetLife continues to invest billions of dollars every year in organic growth with attractive payback periods and internal rates of return. But as we have said many times, we will not pursue growth for growth\u2019s sake. When growth is attractive, whether organic or by acquisition, we will invest. When it is not, we will return capital to shareholders to redeploy elsewhere in the economy. We were pleased in 2021 to return a record of nearly $6 billion of capital to MetLife\u2019s shareholders. We paid $1.6 billion in common stock dividends and repurchased $4.3 billion worth of common shares. Even after these significant distributions, we ended 2021 with $5.4 billion of cash and liquid assets on our balance sheet, well above the top end of our $3 billion to $4 billion target buffer. We repurchased $1.2 billion of common shares in the fourth quarter and we have $1.5 billion left on the repurchase authorization, our Board of Directors approved in August. As a management team, we have no higher obligation to shareholders than to be responsible stewards of the capital they have entrusted us with. As we look ahead, we see a landscape marked with both opportunities and risks. But on balance, we are more optimistic than we were a year ago. John McCallion will provide our detailed outlook expectations shortly. I would like to discuss the road ahead at a more thematic level. While we are always cautious about the external environment, which consists of many factors we cannot control, we do see a unique confluence of tailwinds that should provide positive momentum to our business. Rising interest rates are an obvious one provided the yield curve cooperates and we are pleased that the Federal Reserve has signaled a return to more normal monetary policy. Our U.S. group benefits business should benefit from rising overall employment and compensation levels. The war for talent is as intense as we have ever seen it and we believe that benefits will remain a powerful tool to help companies compete. As our most recent employee benefit trend study found, this applies across the spectrum. Baby-boomers are placing higher value on their physical health. For example, 71% say vision insurance is a must have, up from 53% the prior year. And Gen Z is showing heightened interest in benefits such as legal services, student debt relief and life insurance. In Asia and Latin America, consumer demand for insurance products is strong and Latin America, our sales are back to pre-pandemic levels. And in Asia, especially Japan, the business is benefiting from new offerings and the positive impact of rising U.S. interest rates on foreign currency-denominated products. None of this is to deny the uncertainty we still face from COVID. We have seen false dawns before only to be hit with new waves of the virus. Our view is that the wisest call on the pandemic is not to make a call. We are steadfastly making good on our promises, while continuing to evaluate and reflect the new reality in our pricing. I will close this morning by emphasizing what we believe makes MetLife unique. We have significantly reduced the capital intensity and market sensitivity of our business. We have built some of the premier insurance franchises in the world. We remain vetted to the true economics of the life insurance business, which is cash. And finally, we have cultivated a culture of relentless focus on efficiency and execution. We recognize that MetLife\u2019s success has set a new higher baseline against which we will be judged. The next 10 yards will not be as easy to gain as the last 10, but we are up for the challenge. Now, I will turn it over to John to cover our performance and outlook in detail.\nJohn McCallion: Thank you, Michel and good morning. I will start with the 4Q \u201821 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and update on our cash and capital positions and more detail on our near-term outlook. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year. Net income in the quarter was $1.2 billion or $662 million lower than adjusted earnings. Net derivative losses were primarily due to the stronger equity markets and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter. For the full year, net derivative losses of $1.8 billion primarily due to higher interest rates in 2021 accounted for most of the variance between net income and adjusted earnings. On Page 4, you can see the fourth quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding $140 million of notable tax items that were favorable in the fourth quarter of \u201821 and accounted for in Corporate & Other. Adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were $1.7 billion, down 8% and down 7% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted earnings per share excluding notable items, was $2.01, down 1% year-over-year on a reported basis and essentially flat on a constant currency basis, aided by capital management. Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were down 95% year-over-year due to unfavorable underwriting margins. I will discuss group life underwriting in more detail shortly. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 74.2% in 4Q of \u201821 at the upper end of its annual target range of 70% to 75%, but generally in line given fourth quarter seasonality for dental utilization. That said the ratio was higher than the prior year quarter ratio of 61.7%, which benefited from low dental utilization and favorable disability incidences. Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 15% versus 4Q of \u201820 and up 18% for the full year. The strong full year PFO growth of 18% included 6 percentage points, mostly related to higher premiums from participating contracts, which can fluctuate with claim experience. The balance of PFO growth of 12% was at the top end of our low double-digit annual guidance in 2021. This was equally attributable to the addition of Versant Health and solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 18% year-over-year. The primary driver was higher variable investment income largely due to strong private equity returns. Favorable volume growth also contributed to year-over-year performance. RIS investment spreads were 202 basis points, driven by another strong quarter of variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 91 basis points, down 13 basis points versus 4Q \u201820, primarily due to lower pay-downs in our portfolios of residential mortgage-backed securities and residential mortgage loans. RIS liability exposures increased 3% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in UK longevity reinsurance. With regards to pension risk transfers, we completed 5 transactions worth $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter and continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia, adjusted earnings were up 19% and 21% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income as well as favorable expense margins and volume growth. This was partially offset by lower recurring interest margins and unfavorable underwriting margin due to higher COVID-19-related claims. Asia\u2019s solid volume growth was driven by higher general account assets under management, on an amortized cost basis, which were up 7% on a constant currency basis. In addition, sales were up 13% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by growth across most markets. Latin America adjusted earnings were $125 million versus $14 million in the prior year quarter. While COVID-19-related claims remain elevated in 4Q \u201821 at roughly $37 million after tax, they were down significantly versus the prior year quarter and sequentially. In addition, higher recurring interest margins, favorable tax items and volume growth also contributed. Lower Chilean and Kahe returns were a partial offset. Top line continues to demonstrate strength as adjusted PFOs were up 13% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and sales were up 35% on a constant currency basis driven by solid growth across the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were down 48% and 45% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting from COVID-19 related claims as well as higher expenses and the exclusion of divested businesses in the current year period. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 13%. This increase was primarily driven by higher variable investment income as well as a reduction in policyholder dividend levels. This was partially offset by lower recurring interest margins and less favorable underwriting. Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $177 million, excluding favorable notable items in the quarter versus an adjusted loss of $198 million in the prior year quarter. Higher net investment income and lower taxes were partially offset by higher expenses in the quarter. The company\u2019s effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 12% due to several favorable tax items. These include an IRS audit settlement, a release of a deferred tax liability and a true-up associated with the filing of our 2020 corporate tax return. Adjusting for these items, the effective tax rate was within our 2021 guidance range of 20% to 22%. Now, I will provide more detail on Group Benefits mortality results on Page 5. This chart reflects our Group Life mortality ratio for the four quarters of 2021, including the COVID-19 impact on the ratio and on Group Benefits adjusted earnings. The Group Life mortality ratio was 106.3% in the fourth quarter of 2021, which is well above our annual target range of 85% to 90%. COVID reported claims in 4Q of \u201821 were roughly 18 percentage points, which reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $300 million. While U.S. COVID deaths were higher in 4Q versus 3Q, we did see a favorable shift in the percentage of deaths under age 65, declining from approximately 40% in 3Q to roughly 33% in 4Q. As a result, these two competing factors essentially offset. In regard to non-COVID deaths, they were within our normal expected quarterly fluctuations. On Page 6, this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the four quarters and full year of 2021. VII was $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. This strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio, which had a 7.9% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equity is generally accounted for on a one-quarter lag, while all private equity classes performed well in the quarter. Our venture capital funds, which accounted for roughly 25% of our PE account balance of $14 billion were the strongest performer across sub-sectors, with a roughly 13% quarterly return. For the full year, VII was $5.7 billion, more than 4x above the top end of our 2021 target range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. On Page 7, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the four quarters and full year 2021. As we had previously noted, RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia generally account for 90% or more of the total VII and are split roughly one-third each. For the full year, these three businesses accounted for 92% of the total VII with RIS and MetLife Holdings benefiting from the outperformance from venture capital funds relative to Asia. Turning to Page 8, this chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior eight quarters and full year 2020 and 2021. As expected, our direct expense ratio in 4Q of \u201821 was elevated at 12.9%, reflecting the impact from seasonal enrollment costs and Group Benefits, timing of certain technology investments and employee costs. That said, as we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. For the full year of 2021, our direct expense ratio was 11.6%, well below our annual target of less than 12.3%, clearly demonstrating our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.4 billion at December 31, which was up from $5.1 billion at September 30 and remains above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential increase in cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In 2021, we returned approximately $6 billion to shareholders, the most in any year through share repurchases and common stock dividends. For the 2-year period 2020 and 2021, our average free cash flow ratio excluding notable items, totaled 59%, while the ratio was below our 65% to 75% target range, due to the strength of our adjusted earnings in 2021. Our statutory free cash flow in absolute dollar terms remains strong. In terms of statutory capital for our U.S. companies, we expect our combined 2021 NAIC RBC ratio will be above our 360% target. Preliminary 2021 statutory operating earnings for our U.S. companies were approximately $5 billion, while net income was approximately $3.8 billion. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was $19.1 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of 12% year-over-year. Favorable operating earnings and net investment gains were partially offset by derivative losses and dividends paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 911% as of September 30, which is the latest public data. Before I shift to our near-term outlook on Page 11, a few points on what we included in the appendix. The chart on Page 16 reflects new business value metrics for MetLife\u2019s major segments from 2016 through 2020. This is the same chart that we showed as part of our 3Q \u201821 supplemental slides, but we felt it was worth including again for the sake of completeness. Consistent with our Next Horizon strategy, this chart demonstrates that we continue to have a relentless focus on deploying capital and resources to the highest value opportunities. Also Pages 17 through 20 provide interest rate assumptions and key outlook sensitivities by line of business. Turning back to Page 11, we expect COVID-19 to remain with us in 2022. But given the uncertainty of the environment, we are not going to speculate on the magnitude or timing. Therefore, our near-term targets do not reflect COVID impacts. Based on 12/31 forward curve, interest rates are expected to rise. However, we would expect favorable impacts to be offset in part by higher LIBOR rates, resulting in a flatter yield curve. FX rates based on the forward curve indicate the U.S. dollar is expected to remain strong, which will be a headwind for our businesses outside the U.S. As a result, we would expect adjusted earnings in 2022 versus 2021, will be reduced by roughly $50 million in Asia, roughly $25 million for both Latin America and EMEA. Finally, we assume a 5% annual return for the S&P 500 and a 12% annual return for private equity. This is consistent with our historical returns for PE. Moving to near-term targets, we are maintaining our adjusted ROE range of 12% to 14%. We also expect to maintain our 2-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75% of adjusted earnings. Given the strong adjusted earnings in 2021, we would expect to be closer to the bottom end of the range in 2021 and 2022 before moving higher in 2022 through 2024. This is just a function of math, given the outsized earnings in 2021 as well as the lagging nature of statutory dividend payments to the holding company. In addition, we remain committed to maintaining a full year direct expense ratio below 12.3%. We are raising our VII guidance in 2022 to $1.8 billion to $2 billion. After applying our historical average returns on higher asset balances, I\u2019ll provide more detail on VII in a moment. Our Corporate & Other adjusted loss is expected to remain at $650 million to $750 million after tax but we are increasing our expected effective tax rate by 1 point to 21% to 23% to reflect our expectation for higher earnings in foreign markets and lower tax credits in the U.S. At the bottom of the page, you\u2019ll see expected key interest rate sensitivities relative to our base case, which incorporates the forward curve as of December 31. The takeaway is that changes in interest rates are expected to have a relatively modest impact on adjusted earnings over the near-term. Now I\u2019d like to provide you with more detail on what informed our 2022 VII guidance range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion, as highlighted on Page 12. The chart reflects the growth in our VII average asset balances from $8.4 billion in 2020 to nearly double at $16.5 billion expected in 2022. This growth is due to both the strong private equity returns in 2021 as well as the inclusion of over $2.6 billion of real estate and other funds in 2021. These were previously part of the recurring investment income portfolio and were reclassed to VII beginning in 2021 as we\u2019ve begun to partially shift the form of our investment in certain asset classes, such as real estate equity investments through participation in funds. In addition, our 2022 average VII asset balance also factors in, our expected sale of $1 billion of private equity in the secondary market in 2022. Finally, in addition to the asset balances, we are applying our historical annual returns for each asset class within VII. In addition to the PE return of 12%, which I previously discussed, we expect 6.5% return for hedge funds and a 7% return for real estate and other funds. So now I will discuss our near-term outlook for our business segments. Our comments will be anchored our full year 2021 reported results in our QFS, unless otherwise noted. Let\u2019s start with the U.S. on Page 13. For Group Benefits, excluding the excess premium from participating Group Life contracts of $1.1 billion in 2021, adjusted PFOs are expected to resume their historical target range of 4% to 6% annually, albeit from a higher base. Regarding underwriting, we expect the annual Group Life mortality ratio to be between 85% to 90% excluding COVID impacts. We are also maintaining the expected group non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio at 70% to 75%. For RIS, we are maintaining our 2% to 4% expected annual growth for total liability exposures across our general account spread and fee-based businesses. However, we are increasing our expected annual RIS investment spread by 5 basis points to 95 to 120 basis points in 2022, consistent with our higher VII range. Overall, we would expect a significant decline in RIS adjusted earnings in 2022, given the exceptional private equity returns in 2021 as well as 2021 benefiting from higher mortgage pay-downs and excess mortality gains, we believe were likely due to COVID. For MetLife Holdings, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to decline between 6% to 8% annually higher than our prior guidance of 5% to 7%. We are lowering the life interest adjusted benefit ratio to 45% to 50% in 2022 from the prior 50% to 55% in 2021 to reflect the impact of lowering the policyholder dividend levels. Finally, we are maintaining the adjusted earnings guidance of $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2022. Now let\u2019s look at the near-term guidance for our businesses outside the U.S. on Page 14. For Asia, we expect the recent sales momentum to continue and generate mid to high single-digit growth over the near-term. In addition, we expect journal account AUM to maintain mid-single-digit growth. We are expecting mid-single-digit adjusted earnings growth when excluding the excess VII over plan of approximately $800 million post tax in 2021. In Latin America, we expect adjusted PFOs to grow by high single digits over the near-term. Relative to its 2021 reported adjusted earnings, we expect Latin America adjusted earnings to double in 2022, excluding COVID impacts, and then grow by high single to low double digits in 2023 and 2024. Finally, for EMEA, we expect sales to grow mid to high single-digits over the near-term. We expect adjusted earnings and PFOs to decline in 2022 due to the impact from the stronger U.S. dollar and divestitures in the region. For 2023 and 2024, we expect to me adjusted earnings and PFOs to grow to mid to high single-digits on a constant currency basis. Let me conclude by saying MetLife delivered another strong quarter to close out a very strong year, highlighted by outstanding private equity returns, solid top line growth, ongoing expense discipline and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities. In addition, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio remains strong and position us for further success. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And first, we go to Suneet Kamath with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSuneet Kamath: Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to start off on the VII, can you give us a sense of how much of the VII or excess VII came from marks as opposed to realized gains in 2021 and maybe how that would compare to prior years?\nMichel Khalaf: Suneet, in general, think about what Michelle said, I mean, over the last \u2013 since 2016, basically, we\u2019ve had equal amounts of cash distribution as well as marks. Last year was a little bit more heavily weighted toward marks just given, I think, market returns, but that\u2019s still been the trend. I mean we get a significant amount of cash distributions that I think we wanted to really sort of emphasize that this just isn\u2019t marks.\nSuneet Kamath: Got it. Sorry, I missed that. I got on late. And then I guess, for John, on the direct expense ratio, I mean, less than $12.3 million guide. Can we look at 2021, the 11.6% is sort of a reasonable place for this year? And can you talk a little bit about inflationary pressures on your cost base?\nJohn McCallion: Sure, and good morning, Suneet, welcome back. So now overall, I would just say and as we said in prior meetings, I think the in general, the team continues to execute here and it\u2019s really been embedded in our culture from an efficiency mindset perspective. And fourth quarter was elevated. It\u2019s in line with what we expected. We have those seasonal enrollment costs. We had some timing on some investments in technology. And then we did see a creep up in employee costs occur in the quarter. That was that was offset from a ratio perspective by the fact that we did have some elevated participating claims, which impacts PFOs in the group business. And full year, that\u2019s a little over $1 billion, as we mentioned earlier. So you need to \u2013 if you think about the full year ratio, you almost need to adjust for that, so maybe 30 basis points normalization. So nonetheless, I mean, still a very healthy margin relative to our 12.3%. And I think as we look forward, we continue to target 12.3%. I mean we do see an inflationary environment ahead of us. We think our \u2013 we believe and we expect to still manage within our 12.3%. We think it\u2019s the right target for us. And I think it allows us to utilize our expense leverage to fund investment in growth and technology. If circumstances dictate, we can let some of that leverage fall to the bottom line. And manage the firm that way. But ultimately, this kind of mentality helps us to build our efficiency muscles in the firm. It keeps us away from those disruptive often fleeting big bang expense program. So all in all, we\u2019re still committed to the 12.3% at this point.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. Thanks, John. \nOperator: And next, we have a question from Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nTom Gallagher: Thanks. A couple of questions on Group for me. On \u2013 first, just on the elevated non-medical health benefit ratio. John, you mentioned, it was mainly dental utilization being higher. How is disability trending also? And taking these together, would you expect 2022 to more likely stay towards the high end of the 70 to 75 guidance range or do you think midpoint is still a good base case?\nRamy Tadros: Hi, Tom, it\u2019s Ramy here. So first of all, with respect to the range, the guidance still remains between 70 to 75. So we\u2019re not changing that range. And as you correctly pointed out, the uptick in this quarter for the ratio was largely driven by the seasonality of the dental claims. I would point out that this is kind of entirely expected as we typically see an increase in the utilization in the fourth quarter was participants and providers look to the annual maximums in mind and essentially look to utilize the benefit. So we typically see that uptick in the fourth quarter with Dental. With respect to disability, I\u2019ll maybe break it down for you into two pieces. First is the long-term disability piece. We did see slightly higher incident rates this quarter compared to historical pre-pandemic norms. This is a slight tick up and well within the range of the normal variations we\u2019ve seen around these claims. At the same time, for long-term disability, we continue to see pretty strong offsets with respect to recoveries, which are also trending higher than the historical norms. So that\u2019s kind of the long-term piece on this ability. The short-term disability piece, we have seen a rise in COVID claims in the quarter. And we\u2019ve also seen a rise in some non-covered incidents, which rise in pregnancies as an example. But however, the financial impact on our bottom line from the STD block is really small, and that\u2019s driven by the relative size of the STD block. It\u2019s about third of our overall disability block as well as the mix of our STD business, where half of the block by live is ASO business where we\u2019re not on the hook for the claims. So all in all, when you just step back from a disability perspective, while we\u2019ve seen that small increase in the LTD levels, we are not seeing any evidence of a trend here at this point, but we clearly continue to watch this very carefully.\nTom Gallagher: Got it. Thanks, Ramy. And just a follow-up, so a number of peers are showing weak group sales this quarter, Met seems to be holding up better. Can you talk a little bit about pricing and what you\u2019re seeing competitive-wise right now, whether are you getting rate in low of recent results or are you holding the line on pricing and opting for growth?\nRamy Tadros: Tom. I\u2019ll start off with sales and then give you some color on the pricing side. So first of all, I would say we\u2019re extremely pleased with the sales in \u201821. They\u2019re record sales for us, and that\u2019s something we\u2019re very happy about. If you look at the composition of those sales, we\u2019ve had positive momentum across all of our products and markets. But what really stood out in \u201821 is the main driver of the increase in sales was the jumbo end of the market. And remember, this is the higher end of our national accounts business. So different companies define that differently, but our national accounts business comprise employers with 5,000-plus employees, and this is at the higher end of that segment. Those sales came from across the entire portfolio of products across core and voluntary. The other kind of color I\u2019d give you here is that almost 90% of those jumbo sales came from our existing customers. So these are customers who have been with us for years and in some instances, decades. And the other thing I\u2019d point out on sales here, and we\u2019ve discussed this in the past, this jumbo end of the market is a part of the market where price is not the sole determining factor for winning the business. There are a lot of non-price elements here, such as service, administration, capabilities, etcetera, that are an important part of the decision-making. And then maybe the last piece on sales is those jumbo sales can be lumpy. And as we look forward into \u201822, we are seeing less movement in the jumbo market. And so we are expecting that activity to come down in \u201822 from a jumbo perspective. So, that\u2019s kind of a bit of a color on sales. With respect to pricing, I would make a few points. One is that we have had an approach that\u2019s been disciplined and consistent in the market. We have had a very long track record of being disciplined. And a big part of that is working closely with our customers and intermediaries to ensure that they understand our actions and they are transparent and understood in the marketplace. And that\u2019s been true over the last year. So, we have been implementing a range of price increases across life and disability blocks commensurate with our profitability target and commensurate with our views on near and medium-term mortality as well as their views on employment and rates. And the data point I would give you here with respect to pricing, if you look at the 1/1 renewal season, we have been able to achieve our desired margin for those renewals, and we have maintained strong persistency in our book. And so our view is that the market is generally absorbing those price increases, and you do see that in the PFO number that we have posted. And at the end of the day, another kind of point for you on the discipline is our guidance ranges for both mortality and non-medical health ratios, which kind of remain unchanged into \u201822.\nTom Gallagher: Okay. Thanks for all that color.\nOperator: And next, we have a question from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJimmy Bhullar: Yes. Good morning. So, just a question on interest rates, and you touched on this a little bit in your comments as well. But how do you think about the benefit of rising interest rates based on what the forward yield curve is predicting right now being sort of negated by and just a likely flatter yield curve. And if you could just discuss what are the businesses that would be most affected by that dynamic. But how much of the benefit of rates would actually be taken away by a flatter yield curve?\nJohn McCallion: Good morning Jimmy, it\u2019s John. So, I think the \u2013 and you can see it in our sensitivities at the bottom of the first page and the outlook. We are generally still a net positive to rising rates and the curve is flattening in the base case, right. And that\u2019s based on the forward curve as of 12/31. But it\u2019s \u2013 as we talked about, our sensitivity is much less these days. So, it\u2019s a modest benefit. And then you have to kind of look deeper into why rates are rising. I think there is a number of things around like inflationary pressures, is that it and what the other drivers are. So, just on an interest rate perspective, as we \u2013 as I said in my opening remarks, the higher rates are positive, and they are partially offset by the fact that the curve is flattening. And partly \u2013 you can see that a little bit in, say, the RIS spreads as they emerge in 2022. That\u2019s one of the drivers for why they would come down. The ex-VII spreads would come down off of \u201821, not the only one, but one of them. And then I think just holistically on \u2013 as you think about what could drive if it\u2019s inflationary pressures, and that could be another thing for consideration. I think again, we are probably a net neutral to positive on inflationary pressures. If you think about our businesses and certainly the group business and is probably a net positive, what also could it be a GDP growth along with that. So, a number of different factors that go into it. But all-in-all, I would say just the short answer to the question would be kind of a modest positive for rising rates.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And if I just ask one more on just dental usage, when COVID had initially hit obviously dental usage had dropped a lot. It doesn\u2019t seem like this anecdotally, that that\u2019s happening with the Omicron surge that we have seen recently, which if it was happening, obviously, I think it would show up in 1Q. But have you seen a similar decline in usage in dental with the surge in claims that we have seen or surge in cases that we have seen over the past 1.5 months?\nRamy Tadros: Jimmy, it\u2019s Ramy. I think the big driver in the beginning of the pandemic was the actual closure of the dental offices. So, you have got \u2013 that was \u2013 just the offices were not open. Now clearly, there was also some sort of hesitancy on the part of people to go out as well. I would say at this point, the dental offices are open, and it\u2019s pretty much a return to normal kind of outcome in terms of the utilization patterns that we are seeing in dental.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And next, we have a question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on holdings. You guys provided pretty stable earnings outlook this year with what you had expected at the start of last year. And I know in the past, you guys have mentioned the cash flow being generated by the business is a reason that you kind of counterbalance against potentially entering into a risk transfer transaction. Can you just provide an update on your thoughts relative to transactions within the blocks within holdings? And if perhaps the rising rate environment increases your prospects of entering into a deal?\nJohn McCallion: Good morning Elyse, it\u2019s John. I think in terms of the kind of the back end of your question and risk transfers, I would say nothing has really changed. I think from the comments we gave in the third quarter, we are continuing to kind of stick with our primary objectives of optimizing the business, meeting customer obligations and continuing to look for further efficiencies as the block runs off. And at the same time, we are taking a third-party perspective of this block. I would say \u2013 and I think I mentioned this in the third quarter. I think the environment has continued to be robust. Interest rates rising would be another positive factor, I think in doing a transaction like that, that would be value creative and maybe helps close the bid-ask spread. So, that\u2019s probably a consideration. I think as you pointed out in the kind of the first part of your question around MetLife Holdings. It\u2019s been a resilient runoff. It\u2019s probably a way to comment on that maybe better than we thought. And obviously, I think that\u2019s hats off to the team and the efforts that they have made on different actions on optimizing the business and really doing well on expenses. And in addition, we did \u2013 I did comment on lower policyholder dividend levels that does have an impact. It\u2019s impacting the ratio and that\u2019s helping kind of keep earnings up as well as just the higher equity market. So, there is just a variety of factors that have allowed for a stable outlook in terms of earnings range. But \u2013 so we feel very good about it, but it\u2019s just a number of items that\u2019s kind of getting us there. I think that\u2019s how I would summarize it.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my second question, you guys called out \u2013 you guys said you didn\u2019t see any excess mortality within getaway from COVID. I was just hoping to just get some more color there. I know we have seen some companies that flagged elevated mortality. I just wanted to get additional color on what you are seeing in your book? Thank you.\nRamy Tadros: Hi Elyse, it\u2019s Ramy here. So, as you heard in our prepared remarks, the COVID-specific impact was 18 points and just to be really clear about the definition of that, these are deaths where COVID is marked as the actual cause of death. What we do every quarter as part of our analysis is we look at additional excess mortality, which appears to be COVID-driven. And so what I mean by that are increases in death reasons that kind of are related to perhaps heart or lung disease. And for this quarter, that appears to be about another point as well. Now that has come down from prior quarters, where it was hovering in the kind of 2%, 2.5% range. So, there is, call it, another point of what appears to be COVID in the results for this quarter.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nErik Bass: Hi. Thank you. Can you talk a little bit more about the free cash flow outlook? And given the lagged impact of statutory ordinary dividends that you mentioned, should we expect a higher level of cash flow coming through in 2022 on a dollar basis?\nJohn McCallion: Good morning Erik, it\u2019s John. Thanks for the question. Yes, I think that\u2019s a good way to put it. Certainly, this year, as I mentioned earlier, it\u2019s simply math, outsized earnings. Free cash flow was at or above actually expectations for us. And then \u2013 but the ratio is a bit down. But the expectation \u2013 and you can think of it, it\u2019s $1 billion roughly, give or take, right. If you think about the middle of the range and we would expect that to come in over the next year or 2 years. So all-in-all, we would expect a higher level in \u201822 and \u201823.\nErik Bass: Great. Thank you. And then just a question on VII and I guess as you are thinking about the sizing of your alternatives portfolio over time. And certainly, it\u2019s been an important contributor to results and the portfolio continues to grow, but is there just kind of a limit on kind of where you would want that to get to as a percentage of investments and how are you thinking about managing that and the ability to grow it further?\nSteven Goulart: Hi, it\u2019s Steve. And I will refer to John\u2019s comment during the outlook about the sale of $1 billion of PE interest. What I would say on it is this is part of our normal investment process. And part of that was a consideration of the size of the alternatives portfolio as well. It does have a valuable position in the portfolio from an ALM perspective. As far as hedging long-term tails go equity is very valuable in that respect. But again, we have seen a run up, obviously, in the last couple of years in the PE portfolio, particularly. And so part of our overall process is continuing to evaluate the exposures, and that\u2019s what\u2019s led to the decision to go forward with that sale. So, I think that\u2019s reflective of how our process works and how we \u2013 how we will continue to look at our overall asset allocation and particularly the VII and alternatives.\nErik Bass: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And next, we have a question from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.\nRyan Krueger: Hi. Good morning. Could you give a little bit more color on how you expect the RIS spread, excluding VII to trend in 2022?\nJohn McCallion: Hi Ryan, it\u2019s John. Good morning. So yes, I would say, so full year \u201821 spreads were 229. And with excess VII spread around 93 bps, so 136 bps contribution from VII. And so as we talked about focusing on the ex-VII spread, it\u2019s been elevated pay-down activity on our residential mortgage loans and securities portfolio. We also saw a pretty sizable drop during the course of the year in LIBOR, right. And so when you look forward, we are assuming holistically, obviously, private equity returns get more in line with our historical average. The pay-down activity continues to moderate, LIBOR rises. And so therefore, all-in, we would expect that RIS spread, as we talked about to be $95 million to $120 million. And then just on \u2013 going back to the ex-VII, we should expect like sequentially because of the last two factors I mentioned, it lead to like a 5 basis point to 7 basis point drop sequentially from where we are today, and maybe for full year, so call it a 7 basis points to 9 basis point drop versus \u201821.\nRyan Krueger: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlex Scott: Hi. One of the things that caught my eye in the outlook was just a pretty strong anticipated recovery in LatAm and pretty strong growth in the out years. So, I was just interested if you could talk about what some of the drivers are there and some of the things you are doing as part of that horizon strategy to give you the confidence in that growth?\nEric Clurfain: Yes. Sure, Alex. Hi, this is Eric. Thanks for the question. Let me focus on a couple of things. If you think about our top line and what we have seen in 2021, we have achieved really a great momentum across the region. Sales reached a pre-pandemic level \u2013 levels in the third quarter. And then again, in the fourth quarter, our persistency has also been very resilient and above expectations across most markets. And coupled with the strong sales has really delivered a strong and solid PFO growth in 2021. And when we are seeing this, we are confident to see this moving forward, that momentum to continue. And that demonstrates really the strength, the diversity and the resiliency of our distribution channels and product mix, right. So, if you combine this with the swift implementation of several digital capabilities in our largest markets. That allows us to service our customers faster and better and to be more efficient. So, all-in-all, this highlights the underlying fundamentals of the franchise and the strength and the view in the view that once the pandemic returns to normal, and the pandemic recedes, our earnings run rate also will return to normal. And to John\u2019s point on outlook, we expect earnings to double, excluding COVID next year.\nAlex Scott: Thank you.\nOperator: And next, we will move on to Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.\nHumphrey Lee: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. I have a follow-up question on VII. Just looking at the outperformance to-date and just this year alone, you had over $4 billion above your plan. How should we think about the impact of the strong appreciation on your capital going forward? You talked about doing a secondary sales this year for $1 billion, which would be one way to monetize it. But if I were to think about the increasing carrying value of these assets on a statutory basis, it should help your capital base even with the high risk charge. So, maybe just can you talk about the capital implication of the strong VII to-date?\nJohn McCallion: Hi, good morning Humphrey, it\u2019s John. So, I think you have articulated it well that we are getting a benefit of the strong appreciation in our capital levels. I mean we talked about \u2013 we expect to be above 360%. I mean I would say, yes, that will definitely be the case. And I think you can see that in some of the statistics I gave in the earlier part around just growth in TAC. In terms of how you monetize that from a dividend perspective, I would say the sale doesn\u2019t really change that, right? Just kind of monetizes the unrealized to realized, if you think about that $1 billion. And then the way this gets monetized through status is through growth in earnings, which comes through in cash just if we are going to get into a little bit of accounting. It\u2019s the cash distributions that come through as well as we have kind of a greater of test with regards to a percent of surplus versus earnings. So, just if surplus is greater than \u2013 and that apply that percentage that will be another way you can kind of realize that through dividends.\nHumphrey Lee: Got it. And then just to follow-up your earlier comment about the free cash flow conversion should trend higher kind of in \u201822 through \u201824. As I think about these kind of VII cash flow come through on a LACT basis. Like should we actually think about the free cash flow conversion could be towards the upper end or even maybe above your guided range kind of over the next several years as some of these cash flows come through?\nMichel Khalaf: Yes. So we \u2013 remember, we give our guidance ranges on a 2-year average. And just because of this lumpiness as we were basically talking about, right. And so I think you are referencing kind of on a 1-year basis. And so certainly, that\u2019s why we use an average. When we think about that 65% incentive, so it\u2019s a little lower this quarter, I mean this year, on an annual basis, we would expect it to be higher next year. And then on average, get us back into the range, maybe at the low end as we do our math. But I think you have articulated the direction correctly.\nHumphrey Lee: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for no further questions. I will now turn the call back to the CEO, Michel Khalaf. Please go ahead.\nMichel Khalaf: Thank you, operator. At our Investor Day in December 2019, we said and I quote, MetLife is a simpler and more focused company with a great set of businesses that generate strong free cash flow. That is more true than ever. And as we enter 2022, we do so with a high degree of confidence that we will continue to create value for our stakeholders. Thank you for joining us this morning, and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Michel Khalaf",
            "content": "Thank you, John and good morning everyone. MetLife's financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year of 2021 was outstanding. Our strategic decisions to diversify MetLife by product and geography allocate a prudent portion of our assets to private equity, balanced growth with cash generation and return excess capital to shareholders paid off in the form of banner adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share. In the fourth quarter of 2021, MetLife delivered adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion level with Q4 2020. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.17, up 7% year-over-year. Excluding the notable tax item in the quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $2.01. Heading into the quarter, one of the biggest questions facing life insurers was whether Q4 COVID-related impacts would be as challenging as they were in Q3. In the U.S. group business, that remains the case as lower severity was offset by higher frequency to keep the group life ratio well above normal, yet MetLife's diversity remained evident and the continued outperformance of our investment portfolio. Variable investment income contributed $1.3 billion in the quarter. Our private equity holdings returned 7.9%, with venture capital once again the standout at 13%. As we noted last quarter, PE generates significant cash for MetLife. Over the last 6 years, cash distributions from the portfolio have totaled $8.6 billion. Looking at 2021 as a whole, it was a year of performance, purpose and progress. MetLife delivered strong performance across the board. Despite the divestiture of P&C and other businesses, adjusted PFOs, excluding PRTs were still up 2% to $45.5 billion. Full year sales were up 40% in U.S. group, 19% in Latin America and 11% in Asia. The return on our private equity portfolio was above 40%. Our direct expense ratio was down 40 basis points to 11.6% and we reported adjusted earnings of $8 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $9.15, both the highest amount ever posted by MetLife. We believe our growing track record of consistent execution even in the face of adversity has reinforced the narrative of MetLife as a resilient company. MetLife's purpose is to be there for our customers, always helping them build a more confident future. Nowhere is a life insurance company's purpose more evident than in the grips of a pandemic. Over the course of 2021, COVID claims totaled $2 billion globally and $3 billion since the beginning of the pandemic. We cannot heal the pain of losing a loved one, but we can and do help families recover from the financial damage so that they can move forward. We are honored to be part of an industry that makes such a positive difference in people's lives. Finally, 2021 was a year in which we continued to make progress on the pillars of our Next Horizon strategy. We remain focused on deploying capital to its most productive use. In the absence of attractive M&A opportunities, we returned significant capital to shareholders. We continued to simplify the company through strategic divestitures and further strengthening our operating leverage. Despite higher inflation, we still expect our direct expense ratio to be below 12.3% for the full year 2022. And we further differentiated MetLife with an entry into the financial wellness space called Upwise that allows us to connect directly with consumers and help them build the habits of financial success. MetLife continues to invest billions of dollars every year in organic growth with attractive payback periods and internal rates of return. But as we have said many times, we will not pursue growth for growth's sake. When growth is attractive, whether organic or by acquisition, we will invest. When it is not, we will return capital to shareholders to redeploy elsewhere in the economy. We were pleased in 2021 to return a record of nearly $6 billion of capital to MetLife's shareholders. We paid $1.6 billion in common stock dividends and repurchased $4.3 billion worth of common shares. Even after these significant distributions, we ended 2021 with $5.4 billion of cash and liquid assets on our balance sheet, well above the top end of our $3 billion to $4 billion target buffer. We repurchased $1.2 billion of common shares in the fourth quarter and we have $1.5 billion left on the repurchase authorization, our Board of Directors approved in August. As a management team, we have no higher obligation to shareholders than to be responsible stewards of the capital they have entrusted us with. As we look ahead, we see a landscape marked with both opportunities and risks. But on balance, we are more optimistic than we were a year ago. John McCallion will provide our detailed outlook expectations shortly. I would like to discuss the road ahead at a more thematic level. While we are always cautious about the external environment, which consists of many factors we cannot control, we do see a unique confluence of tailwinds that should provide positive momentum to our business. Rising interest rates are an obvious one provided the yield curve cooperates and we are pleased that the Federal Reserve has signaled a return to more normal monetary policy. Our U.S. group benefits business should benefit from rising overall employment and compensation levels. The war for talent is as intense as we have ever seen it and we believe that benefits will remain a powerful tool to help companies compete. As our most recent employee benefit trend study found, this applies across the spectrum. Baby-boomers are placing higher value on their physical health. For example, 71% say vision insurance is a must have, up from 53% the prior year. And Gen Z is showing heightened interest in benefits such as legal services, student debt relief and life insurance. In Asia and Latin America, consumer demand for insurance products is strong and Latin America, our sales are back to pre-pandemic levels. And in Asia, especially Japan, the business is benefiting from new offerings and the positive impact of rising U.S. interest rates on foreign currency-denominated products. None of this is to deny the uncertainty we still face from COVID. We have seen false dawns before only to be hit with new waves of the virus. Our view is that the wisest call on the pandemic is not to make a call. We are steadfastly making good on our promises, while continuing to evaluate and reflect the new reality in our pricing. I will close this morning by emphasizing what we believe makes MetLife unique. We have significantly reduced the capital intensity and market sensitivity of our business. We have built some of the premier insurance franchises in the world. We remain vetted to the true economics of the life insurance business, which is cash. And finally, we have cultivated a culture of relentless focus on efficiency and execution. We recognize that MetLife's success has set a new higher baseline against which we will be judged. The next 10 yards will not be as easy to gain as the last 10, but we are up for the challenge. Now, I will turn it over to John to cover our performance and outlook in detail. Suneet, in general, think about what Michelle said, I mean, over the last \u2013 since 2016, basically, we've had equal amounts of cash distribution as well as marks. Last year was a little bit more heavily weighted toward marks just given, I think, market returns, but that's still been the trend. I mean we get a significant amount of cash distributions that I think we wanted to really sort of emphasize that this just isn't marks. Yes. So we \u2013 remember, we give our guidance ranges on a 2-year average. And just because of this lumpiness as we were basically talking about, right. And so I think you are referencing kind of on a 1-year basis. And so certainly, that's why we use an average. When we think about that 65% incentive, so it's a little lower this quarter, I mean this year, on an annual basis, we would expect it to be higher next year. And then on average, get us back into the range, maybe at the low end as we do our math. But I think you have articulated the direction correctly. Thank you, operator. At our Investor Day in December 2019, we said and I quote, MetLife is a simpler and more focused company with a great set of businesses that generate strong free cash flow. That is more true than ever. And as we enter 2022, we do so with a high degree of confidence that we will continue to create value for our stakeholders. Thank you for joining us this morning, and have a great day."

            "name": "Ramy Tadros",
            "content": "Hi, Tom, it's Ramy here. So first of all, with respect to the range, the guidance still remains between 70 to 75. So we're not changing that range. And as you correctly pointed out, the uptick in this quarter for the ratio was largely driven by the seasonality of the dental claims. I would point out that this is kind of entirely expected as we typically see an increase in the utilization in the fourth quarter was participants and providers look to the annual maximums in mind and essentially look to utilize the benefit. So we typically see that uptick in the fourth quarter with Dental. With respect to disability, I'll maybe break it down for you into two pieces. First is the long-term disability piece. We did see slightly higher incident rates this quarter compared to historical pre-pandemic norms. This is a slight tick up and well within the range of the normal variations we've seen around these claims. At the same time, for long-term disability, we continue to see pretty strong offsets with respect to recoveries, which are also trending higher than the historical norms. So that's kind of the long-term piece on this ability. The short-term disability piece, we have seen a rise in COVID claims in the quarter. And we've also seen a rise in some non-covered incidents, which rise in pregnancies as an example. But however, the financial impact on our bottom line from the STD block is really small, and that's driven by the relative size of the STD block. It's about third of our overall disability block as well as the mix of our STD business, where half of the block by live is ASO business where we're not on the hook for the claims. So all in all, when you just step back from a disability perspective, while we've seen that small increase in the LTD levels, we are not seeing any evidence of a trend here at this point, but we clearly continue to watch this very carefully. Tom. I'll start off with sales and then give you some color on the pricing side. So first of all, I would say we're extremely pleased with the sales in \u201821. They're record sales for us, and that's something we're very happy about. If you look at the composition of those sales, we've had positive momentum across all of our products and markets. But what really stood out in \u201821 is the main driver of the increase in sales was the jumbo end of the market. And remember, this is the higher end of our national accounts business. So different companies define that differently, but our national accounts business comprise employers with 5,000-plus employees, and this is at the higher end of that segment. Those sales came from across the entire portfolio of products across core and voluntary. The other kind of color I'd give you here is that almost 90% of those jumbo sales came from our existing customers. So these are customers who have been with us for years and in some instances, decades. And the other thing I'd point out on sales here, and we've discussed this in the past, this jumbo end of the market is a part of the market where price is not the sole determining factor for winning the business. There are a lot of non-price elements here, such as service, administration, capabilities, etcetera, that are an important part of the decision-making. And then maybe the last piece on sales is those jumbo sales can be lumpy. And as we look forward into \u201822, we are seeing less movement in the jumbo market. And so we are expecting that activity to come down in \u201822 from a jumbo perspective. So, that's kind of a bit of a color on sales. With respect to pricing, I would make a few points. One is that we have had an approach that's been disciplined and consistent in the market. We have had a very long track record of being disciplined. And a big part of that is working closely with our customers and intermediaries to ensure that they understand our actions and they are transparent and understood in the marketplace. And that's been true over the last year. So, we have been implementing a range of price increases across life and disability blocks commensurate with our profitability target and commensurate with our views on near and medium-term mortality as well as their views on employment and rates. And the data point I would give you here with respect to pricing, if you look at the 1/1 renewal season, we have been able to achieve our desired margin for those renewals, and we have maintained strong persistency in our book. And so our view is that the market is generally absorbing those price increases, and you do see that in the PFO number that we have posted. And at the end of the day, another kind of point for you on the discipline is our guidance ranges for both mortality and non-medical health ratios, which kind of remain unchanged into \u201822. Jimmy, it's Ramy. I think the big driver in the beginning of the pandemic was the actual closure of the dental offices. So, you have got \u2013 that was \u2013 just the offices were not open. Now clearly, there was also some sort of hesitancy on the part of people to go out as well. I would say at this point, the dental offices are open, and it's pretty much a return to normal kind of outcome in terms of the utilization patterns that we are seeing in dental. Hi Elyse, it's Ramy here. So, as you heard in our prepared remarks, the COVID-specific impact was 18 points and just to be really clear about the definition of that, these are deaths where COVID is marked as the actual cause of death. What we do every quarter as part of our analysis is we look at additional excess mortality, which appears to be COVID-driven. And so what I mean by that are increases in death reasons that kind of are related to perhaps heart or lung disease. And for this quarter, that appears to be about another point as well. Now that has come down from prior quarters, where it was hovering in the kind of 2%, 2.5% range. So, there is, call it, another point of what appears to be COVID in the results for this quarter."

            "name": "John McCallion",
            "content": "Thank you, Michel and good morning. I will start with the 4Q \u201821 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and update on our cash and capital positions and more detail on our near-term outlook. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year. Net income in the quarter was $1.2 billion or $662 million lower than adjusted earnings. Net derivative losses were primarily due to the stronger equity markets and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter. For the full year, net derivative losses of $1.8 billion primarily due to higher interest rates in 2021 accounted for most of the variance between net income and adjusted earnings. On Page 4, you can see the fourth quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding $140 million of notable tax items that were favorable in the fourth quarter of \u201821 and accounted for in Corporate & Other. Adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were $1.7 billion, down 8% and down 7% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted earnings per share excluding notable items, was $2.01, down 1% year-over-year on a reported basis and essentially flat on a constant currency basis, aided by capital management. Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were down 95% year-over-year due to unfavorable underwriting margins. I will discuss group life underwriting in more detail shortly. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 74.2% in 4Q of \u201821 at the upper end of its annual target range of 70% to 75%, but generally in line given fourth quarter seasonality for dental utilization. That said the ratio was higher than the prior year quarter ratio of 61.7%, which benefited from low dental utilization and favorable disability incidences. Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 15% versus 4Q of \u201820 and up 18% for the full year. The strong full year PFO growth of 18% included 6 percentage points, mostly related to higher premiums from participating contracts, which can fluctuate with claim experience. The balance of PFO growth of 12% was at the top end of our low double-digit annual guidance in 2021. This was equally attributable to the addition of Versant Health and solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 18% year-over-year. The primary driver was higher variable investment income largely due to strong private equity returns. Favorable volume growth also contributed to year-over-year performance. RIS investment spreads were 202 basis points, driven by another strong quarter of variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 91 basis points, down 13 basis points versus 4Q \u201820, primarily due to lower pay-downs in our portfolios of residential mortgage-backed securities and residential mortgage loans. RIS liability exposures increased 3% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in UK longevity reinsurance. With regards to pension risk transfers, we completed 5 transactions worth $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter and continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia, adjusted earnings were up 19% and 21% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income as well as favorable expense margins and volume growth. This was partially offset by lower recurring interest margins and unfavorable underwriting margin due to higher COVID-19-related claims. Asia's solid volume growth was driven by higher general account assets under management, on an amortized cost basis, which were up 7% on a constant currency basis. In addition, sales were up 13% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by growth across most markets. Latin America adjusted earnings were $125 million versus $14 million in the prior year quarter. While COVID-19-related claims remain elevated in 4Q \u201821 at roughly $37 million after tax, they were down significantly versus the prior year quarter and sequentially. In addition, higher recurring interest margins, favorable tax items and volume growth also contributed. Lower Chilean and Kahe returns were a partial offset. Top line continues to demonstrate strength as adjusted PFOs were up 13% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and sales were up 35% on a constant currency basis driven by solid growth across the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were down 48% and 45% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting from COVID-19 related claims as well as higher expenses and the exclusion of divested businesses in the current year period. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 13%. This increase was primarily driven by higher variable investment income as well as a reduction in policyholder dividend levels. This was partially offset by lower recurring interest margins and less favorable underwriting. Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $177 million, excluding favorable notable items in the quarter versus an adjusted loss of $198 million in the prior year quarter. Higher net investment income and lower taxes were partially offset by higher expenses in the quarter. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 12% due to several favorable tax items. These include an IRS audit settlement, a release of a deferred tax liability and a true-up associated with the filing of our 2020 corporate tax return. Adjusting for these items, the effective tax rate was within our 2021 guidance range of 20% to 22%. Now, I will provide more detail on Group Benefits mortality results on Page 5. This chart reflects our Group Life mortality ratio for the four quarters of 2021, including the COVID-19 impact on the ratio and on Group Benefits adjusted earnings. The Group Life mortality ratio was 106.3% in the fourth quarter of 2021, which is well above our annual target range of 85% to 90%. COVID reported claims in 4Q of \u201821 were roughly 18 percentage points, which reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $300 million. While U.S. COVID deaths were higher in 4Q versus 3Q, we did see a favorable shift in the percentage of deaths under age 65, declining from approximately 40% in 3Q to roughly 33% in 4Q. As a result, these two competing factors essentially offset. In regard to non-COVID deaths, they were within our normal expected quarterly fluctuations. On Page 6, this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the four quarters and full year of 2021. VII was $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. This strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio, which had a 7.9% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equity is generally accounted for on a one-quarter lag, while all private equity classes performed well in the quarter. Our venture capital funds, which accounted for roughly 25% of our PE account balance of $14 billion were the strongest performer across sub-sectors, with a roughly 13% quarterly return. For the full year, VII was $5.7 billion, more than 4x above the top end of our 2021 target range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. On Page 7, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the four quarters and full year 2021. As we had previously noted, RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia generally account for 90% or more of the total VII and are split roughly one-third each. For the full year, these three businesses accounted for 92% of the total VII with RIS and MetLife Holdings benefiting from the outperformance from venture capital funds relative to Asia. Turning to Page 8, this chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior eight quarters and full year 2020 and 2021. As expected, our direct expense ratio in 4Q of \u201821 was elevated at 12.9%, reflecting the impact from seasonal enrollment costs and Group Benefits, timing of certain technology investments and employee costs. That said, as we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. For the full year of 2021, our direct expense ratio was 11.6%, well below our annual target of less than 12.3%, clearly demonstrating our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.4 billion at December 31, which was up from $5.1 billion at September 30 and remains above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential increase in cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In 2021, we returned approximately $6 billion to shareholders, the most in any year through share repurchases and common stock dividends. For the 2-year period 2020 and 2021, our average free cash flow ratio excluding notable items, totaled 59%, while the ratio was below our 65% to 75% target range, due to the strength of our adjusted earnings in 2021. Our statutory free cash flow in absolute dollar terms remains strong. In terms of statutory capital for our U.S. companies, we expect our combined 2021 NAIC RBC ratio will be above our 360% target. Preliminary 2021 statutory operating earnings for our U.S. companies were approximately $5 billion, while net income was approximately $3.8 billion. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was $19.1 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of 12% year-over-year. Favorable operating earnings and net investment gains were partially offset by derivative losses and dividends paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 911% as of September 30, which is the latest public data. Before I shift to our near-term outlook on Page 11, a few points on what we included in the appendix. The chart on Page 16 reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments from 2016 through 2020. This is the same chart that we showed as part of our 3Q \u201821 supplemental slides, but we felt it was worth including again for the sake of completeness. Consistent with our Next Horizon strategy, this chart demonstrates that we continue to have a relentless focus on deploying capital and resources to the highest value opportunities. Also Pages 17 through 20 provide interest rate assumptions and key outlook sensitivities by line of business. Turning back to Page 11, we expect COVID-19 to remain with us in 2022. But given the uncertainty of the environment, we are not going to speculate on the magnitude or timing. Therefore, our near-term targets do not reflect COVID impacts. Based on 12/31 forward curve, interest rates are expected to rise. However, we would expect favorable impacts to be offset in part by higher LIBOR rates, resulting in a flatter yield curve. FX rates based on the forward curve indicate the U.S. dollar is expected to remain strong, which will be a headwind for our businesses outside the U.S. As a result, we would expect adjusted earnings in 2022 versus 2021, will be reduced by roughly $50 million in Asia, roughly $25 million for both Latin America and EMEA. Finally, we assume a 5% annual return for the S&P 500 and a 12% annual return for private equity. This is consistent with our historical returns for PE. Moving to near-term targets, we are maintaining our adjusted ROE range of 12% to 14%. We also expect to maintain our 2-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75% of adjusted earnings. Given the strong adjusted earnings in 2021, we would expect to be closer to the bottom end of the range in 2021 and 2022 before moving higher in 2022 through 2024. This is just a function of math, given the outsized earnings in 2021 as well as the lagging nature of statutory dividend payments to the holding company. In addition, we remain committed to maintaining a full year direct expense ratio below 12.3%. We are raising our VII guidance in 2022 to $1.8 billion to $2 billion. After applying our historical average returns on higher asset balances, I'll provide more detail on VII in a moment. Our Corporate & Other adjusted loss is expected to remain at $650 million to $750 million after tax but we are increasing our expected effective tax rate by 1 point to 21% to 23% to reflect our expectation for higher earnings in foreign markets and lower tax credits in the U.S. At the bottom of the page, you'll see expected key interest rate sensitivities relative to our base case, which incorporates the forward curve as of December 31. The takeaway is that changes in interest rates are expected to have a relatively modest impact on adjusted earnings over the near-term. Now I'd like to provide you with more detail on what informed our 2022 VII guidance range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion, as highlighted on Page 12. The chart reflects the growth in our VII average asset balances from $8.4 billion in 2020 to nearly double at $16.5 billion expected in 2022. This growth is due to both the strong private equity returns in 2021 as well as the inclusion of over $2.6 billion of real estate and other funds in 2021. These were previously part of the recurring investment income portfolio and were reclassed to VII beginning in 2021 as we've begun to partially shift the form of our investment in certain asset classes, such as real estate equity investments through participation in funds. In addition, our 2022 average VII asset balance also factors in, our expected sale of $1 billion of private equity in the secondary market in 2022. Finally, in addition to the asset balances, we are applying our historical annual returns for each asset class within VII. In addition to the PE return of 12%, which I previously discussed, we expect 6.5% return for hedge funds and a 7% return for real estate and other funds. So now I will discuss our near-term outlook for our business segments. Our comments will be anchored our full year 2021 reported results in our QFS, unless otherwise noted. Let's start with the U.S. on Page 13. For Group Benefits, excluding the excess premium from participating Group Life contracts of $1.1 billion in 2021, adjusted PFOs are expected to resume their historical target range of 4% to 6% annually, albeit from a higher base. Regarding underwriting, we expect the annual Group Life mortality ratio to be between 85% to 90% excluding COVID impacts. We are also maintaining the expected group non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio at 70% to 75%. For RIS, we are maintaining our 2% to 4% expected annual growth for total liability exposures across our general account spread and fee-based businesses. However, we are increasing our expected annual RIS investment spread by 5 basis points to 95 to 120 basis points in 2022, consistent with our higher VII range. Overall, we would expect a significant decline in RIS adjusted earnings in 2022, given the exceptional private equity returns in 2021 as well as 2021 benefiting from higher mortgage pay-downs and excess mortality gains, we believe were likely due to COVID. For MetLife Holdings, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to decline between 6% to 8% annually higher than our prior guidance of 5% to 7%. We are lowering the life interest adjusted benefit ratio to 45% to 50% in 2022 from the prior 50% to 55% in 2021 to reflect the impact of lowering the policyholder dividend levels. Finally, we are maintaining the adjusted earnings guidance of $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2022. Now let's look at the near-term guidance for our businesses outside the U.S. on Page 14. For Asia, we expect the recent sales momentum to continue and generate mid to high single-digit growth over the near-term. In addition, we expect journal account AUM to maintain mid-single-digit growth. We are expecting mid-single-digit adjusted earnings growth when excluding the excess VII over plan of approximately $800 million post tax in 2021. In Latin America, we expect adjusted PFOs to grow by high single digits over the near-term. Relative to its 2021 reported adjusted earnings, we expect Latin America adjusted earnings to double in 2022, excluding COVID impacts, and then grow by high single to low double digits in 2023 and 2024. Finally, for EMEA, we expect sales to grow mid to high single-digits over the near-term. We expect adjusted earnings and PFOs to decline in 2022 due to the impact from the stronger U.S. dollar and divestitures in the region. For 2023 and 2024, we expect to me adjusted earnings and PFOs to grow to mid to high single-digits on a constant currency basis. Let me conclude by saying MetLife delivered another strong quarter to close out a very strong year, highlighted by outstanding private equity returns, solid top line growth, ongoing expense discipline and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities. In addition, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio remains strong and position us for further success. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Sure, and good morning, Suneet, welcome back. So now overall, I would just say and as we said in prior meetings, I think the in general, the team continues to execute here and it's really been embedded in our culture from an efficiency mindset perspective. And fourth quarter was elevated. It's in line with what we expected. We have those seasonal enrollment costs. We had some timing on some investments in technology. And then we did see a creep up in employee costs occur in the quarter. That was that was offset from a ratio perspective by the fact that we did have some elevated participating claims, which impacts PFOs in the group business. And full year, that's a little over $1 billion, as we mentioned earlier. So you need to \u2013 if you think about the full year ratio, you almost need to adjust for that, so maybe 30 basis points normalization. So nonetheless, I mean, still a very healthy margin relative to our 12.3%. And I think as we look forward, we continue to target 12.3%. I mean we do see an inflationary environment ahead of us. We think our \u2013 we believe and we expect to still manage within our 12.3%. We think it's the right target for us. And I think it allows us to utilize our expense leverage to fund investment in growth and technology. If circumstances dictate, we can let some of that leverage fall to the bottom line. And manage the firm that way. But ultimately, this kind of mentality helps us to build our efficiency muscles in the firm. It keeps us away from those disruptive often fleeting big bang expense program. So all in all, we're still committed to the 12.3% at this point. Good morning Jimmy, it's John. So, I think the \u2013 and you can see it in our sensitivities at the bottom of the first page and the outlook. We are generally still a net positive to rising rates and the curve is flattening in the base case, right. And that's based on the forward curve as of 12/31. But it's \u2013 as we talked about, our sensitivity is much less these days. So, it's a modest benefit. And then you have to kind of look deeper into why rates are rising. I think there is a number of things around like inflationary pressures, is that it and what the other drivers are. So, just on an interest rate perspective, as we \u2013 as I said in my opening remarks, the higher rates are positive, and they are partially offset by the fact that the curve is flattening. And partly \u2013 you can see that a little bit in, say, the RIS spreads as they emerge in 2022. That's one of the drivers for why they would come down. The ex-VII spreads would come down off of \u201821, not the only one, but one of them. And then I think just holistically on \u2013 as you think about what could drive if it's inflationary pressures, and that could be another thing for consideration. I think again, we are probably a net neutral to positive on inflationary pressures. If you think about our businesses and certainly the group business and is probably a net positive, what also could it be a GDP growth along with that. So, a number of different factors that go into it. But all-in-all, I would say just the short answer to the question would be kind of a modest positive for rising rates. Good morning Elyse, it's John. I think in terms of the kind of the back end of your question and risk transfers, I would say nothing has really changed. I think from the comments we gave in the third quarter, we are continuing to kind of stick with our primary objectives of optimizing the business, meeting customer obligations and continuing to look for further efficiencies as the block runs off. And at the same time, we are taking a third-party perspective of this block. I would say \u2013 and I think I mentioned this in the third quarter. I think the environment has continued to be robust. Interest rates rising would be another positive factor, I think in doing a transaction like that, that would be value creative and maybe helps close the bid-ask spread. So, that's probably a consideration. I think as you pointed out in the kind of the first part of your question around MetLife Holdings. It's been a resilient runoff. It's probably a way to comment on that maybe better than we thought. And obviously, I think that's hats off to the team and the efforts that they have made on different actions on optimizing the business and really doing well on expenses. And in addition, we did \u2013 I did comment on lower policyholder dividend levels that does have an impact. It's impacting the ratio and that's helping kind of keep earnings up as well as just the higher equity market. So, there is just a variety of factors that have allowed for a stable outlook in terms of earnings range. But \u2013 so we feel very good about it, but it's just a number of items that's kind of getting us there. I think that's how I would summarize it. Good morning Erik, it's John. Thanks for the question. Yes, I think that's a good way to put it. Certainly, this year, as I mentioned earlier, it's simply math, outsized earnings. Free cash flow was at or above actually expectations for us. And then \u2013 but the ratio is a bit down. But the expectation \u2013 and you can think of it, it's $1 billion roughly, give or take, right. If you think about the middle of the range and we would expect that to come in over the next year or 2 years. So all-in-all, we would expect a higher level in \u201822 and \u201823. Hi Ryan, it's John. Good morning. So yes, I would say, so full year \u201821 spreads were 229. And with excess VII spread around 93 bps, so 136 bps contribution from VII. And so as we talked about focusing on the ex-VII spread, it's been elevated pay-down activity on our residential mortgage loans and securities portfolio. We also saw a pretty sizable drop during the course of the year in LIBOR, right. And so when you look forward, we are assuming holistically, obviously, private equity returns get more in line with our historical average. The pay-down activity continues to moderate, LIBOR rises. And so therefore, all-in, we would expect that RIS spread, as we talked about to be $95 million to $120 million. And then just on \u2013 going back to the ex-VII, we should expect like sequentially because of the last two factors I mentioned, it lead to like a 5 basis point to 7 basis point drop sequentially from where we are today, and maybe for full year, so call it a 7 basis points to 9 basis point drop versus \u201821. Hi, good morning Humphrey, it's John. So, I think you have articulated it well that we are getting a benefit of the strong appreciation in our capital levels. I mean we talked about \u2013 we expect to be above 360%. I mean I would say, yes, that will definitely be the case. And I think you can see that in some of the statistics I gave in the earlier part around just growth in TAC. In terms of how you monetize that from a dividend perspective, I would say the sale doesn't really change that, right? Just kind of monetizes the unrealized to realized, if you think about that $1 billion. And then the way this gets monetized through status is through growth in earnings, which comes through in cash just if we are going to get into a little bit of accounting. It's the cash distributions that come through as well as we have kind of a greater of test with regards to a percent of surplus versus earnings. So, just if surplus is greater than \u2013 and that apply that percentage that will be another way you can kind of realize that through dividends."

What I would say on it is this is part of our normal investment process. And part of that was a consideration of the size of the alternatives portfolio as well. It does have a valuable position in the portfolio from an ALM perspective. As far as hedging long-term tails go equity is very valuable in that respect. But again, we have seen a run up, obviously, in the last couple of years in the PE portfolio, particularly. And so part of our overall process is continuing to evaluate the exposures, and that's what's led to the decision to go forward with that sale. So, I think that's reflective of how our process works and how we \u2013 how we will continue to look at our overall asset allocation and particularly the VII and alternatives."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to thank you for standing by, and welcome to the MetLife Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I would refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday\u2019s earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife\u2019s SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations. The floor is yours, sir.\nJohn Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I refer you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussions are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides which address third quarter results. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. An appendix to these slides features additional disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information which you should also review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session that will extend to the top of the hour. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michel.\nMichel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As I reflect on the journey MetLife has been on these past two years, I am more convinced than ever that we are focused on what matters most. We are a purpose-driven company at a time when stakeholders will accept nothing less. We have the right strategy to see us through even the most turbulent environments, and we have a strong culture of execution that gives our shareholders confidence. All of these attributes were on display in the third quarter of 2021. Starting with our financial results. Adjusted earnings were $2.1 billion, up 31% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.39, up 38% year-over-year. Excluding total notable items in both periods, adjusted earnings were up 24% and adjusted EPS was up 31%. Looking at the quarterly performance of the enterprise as a whole, variable investment income was outstanding, underlying PFOs were strong and expense disciplined held firm. The main area where we have seen headwinds is from elevated COVID claims. In key respects, the third quarter of 2021 looks very much like the first quarter with exceptionally strong VII more than offsetting excess mortality. On the investment side, our private equity portfolio returned $1.5 billion in Q3, its highest quarterly contribution in 2021 and the major contributor to VII, which was well above the top end of our implied quarterly guidance range. On underwriting in our U.S. business, the Group Life mortality ratio was elevated at 106.2% in Q3 on higher claim severity and frequency due to a shift younger in the age distribution of COVID deaths. Our Latin America business incurred COVID losses of $137 million in Q3. Two aspects of our underwriting results are noteworthy. From a social perspective, paying COVID claims is precisely how life insurance companies make a positive difference in the world. The human toll of the pandemic on families is catastrophic but where life insurance is present, the financial burden is eased. This is our purpose to help prepare the financial damage after lives most destabilizing moments. Pandemic to date, in our U.S. group business, we've incurred U.S. life claims of around $2.1 billion. Life insurance is not like other businesses where losses are just losses. Every underwriting claim represents a beneficiary who is receiving the financial help they were promised. From a financial perspective, even though our Life businesses have been hit with the most severe pandemic in more than 100 years, they remain profitable. MetLife has actually paid out more in COVID-related claims in 2021 than we did in 2020. And yet, our adjusted earnings per share are higher this year than last year, as is our adjusted return on equity. What has enhanced MetLife's capacity to pay outsized claims while still generating exceptional earnings is our of our strategic decision to allocate a prudent portion of our investment portfolio to private equity. While not a direct COVID offset, the valuation of our PE and VC funds with significant technology exposure has benefited from global capital flows to this growth sector. The return on our PE portfolio in the quarter was an outstanding 12.6% and stands at approximately 36% year-to-date. The gains on our well-seasoned portfolio are not mere accounting marks. Year-to-date, we have received $1.9 billion in cash distributions from RPE funds. Since 2016, the figure is $7.6 billion. While we often reinvest the e-cash proceeds as funds mature and terminate, the cash generated is steady and significant. Turning to the underlying performance of MetLife's businesses, we are seeing solid momentum. In U.S. Group Benefits, adjusted PFOs grew 13% year-over-year, excluding Versant Health PFO growth was 6.2% on strong jumbo sales and persistency, and we expect to end the year near the top end of our guidance range. In voluntary benefits, which for us consists of accident and health, legal plans and pet insurance, we saw strong double-digit PFO growth in the third quarter. The trend in sales is even stronger. Year-to-date, sales are up 40% over the prior period, and we remain on track for a record sales year. While group sales can fluctuate from year-to-year due to jumbo cases, we believe the robust U.S. job market and the competition for talent are creating a strong tailwind. In connection with open enrollment season this fall, we conducted consumer research on benefit preferences among millennials, who are now the largest age group cohort in the U.S. with more than 70 million members. Millennials are expressing strong interest in both traditional benefits such as life insurance and dental and involuntary benefits such as legal plans and pet insurance. Another top desire is for help with financial planning. MetLife entered the space in late September with a digital financial wellness tool called Upwise, which helps us connect with employees directly. The app is designed to address the emotional barriers to financial progress and help people tackle death, save more or even create a digital will. Within our RIS business, after a quiet first three quarters, we have already booked four cases totaling $3.5 billion of pension risk transfer deals in the first month of the fourth quarter. Next Tuesday marks the 100th anniversary of the first group annuity contract MetLife ever wrote with the William Rodge printing company. We are pleased to be a leader in the business of helping companies honor the retirement promises they have made to their workers. Last month, MetLife released the results of our annual pension risk transfer pull. We only survey companies that want to derisk. Of the 253 respondents, nearly 7 in 10 have pension plan assets of $5 00 million or more and 93% intend to divest all of the defined benefit pension liabilities at some point in the future, up from 76% in 2019. Elsewhere in RIS, excluding PRTs from both periods, adjusted PFOs were up 70% year-over-year. There were two main drivers. The first was longevity reinsurance, a market we entered in the UK last year. The second was post-retirement benefits, where we take on blocks of retiree life insurance from employers. This is an attractive adjacency to our group business that plays to MetLife's competitive advantages. In Latin America, we delivered exceptional sales growth in the quarter, up 45% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. In fact, sales were higher in Q3 2021 than they were in Q3 2019 before the COVID pandemic began. In most markets across the region, we saw double-digit growth in both sales and PFOs. Moving to cash and capital, MetLife ended the third quarter with $5.1 billion of cash at its holding companies. During the quarter, we paid $400 million in common stock dividends and repurchased $1 billion worth of outstanding common shares with another 233 million repurchased so far in Q4. We have $2.5 billion remaining on the $3 billion share repurchase authorization we announced in August. We are on track to return more than $5.5 billion of capital to shareholders in 2021, and we continue to strive for a balanced mix between business investment and capital return. In 2020, for example, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders and invested approximately $5 billion in organic growth and M&A. Our test for capital deployment remains consistent. Does it clear our risk-adjusted hurdle rate? As John will describe in greater detail, the new business we wrote in 2020, a period when interest rates were at all-time lows, was the most attractive of the past five years. It had the shortest payback period, the highest internal rate of return and the highest value of new business relative to the amount of capital deployed. This was the natural outgrowth of our Accelerating Value initiative. By optimizing our portfolio of businesses, shifting our product mix to be more capital efficient and fully embracing an efficiency mindset, we have consistently improved VNB over time, and it is now an integral part of our capital allocation process. This year, in addition to organic growth, we increased the stake in our India joint venture, PNB MetLife to 47% from 32%. India is one of the five secular growth markets we identified in our Next Horizon strategy. Consistent with that strategy, we are increasing our exposure to a market where PNB MetLife has access to more than 200 million customers across 15,000 sales locations. In September, we held an in-depth session with our Board of Directors to pressure test every aspect of our Next Horizon strategy. We've done this each year of my tenure as CEO. As representatives of our shareholders and shareholders themselves, our Board challenged us to make sure we are positioned and on track to deliver on our goals. I believe the alignment between the Board and management is as strong as it's ever been, and our shared commitments remain clear, focus on deploying capital to its best use, simplify the company to improve efficiency and the customer experience and truly differentiate ourselves in the marketplace. Now I'll turn it over to John for a detailed review of our quarterly performance.\nJohn McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I'll start with the 3Q 2021 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, details of our annual global actuarial assumption review and updates on our value of new business metrics and our cash and capital positions. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings. Net income in the third quarter was $1.5 billion or $541 million lower than adjusted earnings. Net derivative losses of $172 million were primarily driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter. In addition, our actuarial assumption review accounted for $76 million of the variance between net income and adjusted earnings. In total, the assumption review reduced net income by $216 million, including a notable item to adjusted earnings of $140 million. The table on Page 4 provides highlights of the actuarial assumption review with the breakdown of the adjusted earnings and net income impact by business segment. We have kept our U.S. mean reversion interest rate unchanged at 2.75% and maintain our long-term mortality assumptions despite the near-term impacts from COVID-19. Most of the net income impact was in MetLife Holdings and Asia. For MetLife Holdings, the primary driver was a refinement to the variable annuity lapse rate function to better reflect policyholder behavior based on withdrawal status. In Asia, the largest impact was due to the lowering of the earned rate assumption in Japan, where we assume current earned rates for our long-term rate assumption. On Page 5, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items in both periods. Adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were $2.2 billion, up 24% and up 23% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by strong returns in our private equity portfolio. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding notable items, was $2.56, up 31% year-over-year on both a reported and constant currency basis, aided by capital management. Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S.. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were down 72% year-over-year, driven by unfavorable underwriting margins in Group Life, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 70.7% in 3Q of 2021 at the low-end of its annual target range of 70% to 75% but higher than the prior year quarter of 67.4%, which benefited from extremely low dental utilization and favorable disability incidents. Volume growth, the addition of Versant Health and favorable expense margins were partial offsets to the decline in year-over-year results. Group Benefits continues to have strong top line growth. Year-to-date sales were up 40%, primarily due to higher jumbo case activity. Adjusted PFOs in the quarter were up 13% year-over-year, driven by solid volume growth across most products, including voluntary and the addition of Versant Health. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings, were up 60% year-over-year. The primary driver was higher variable investment income, largely due to strong private equity returns. Favorable underwriting margins and volume growth also contributed to year-over-year performance. RIS investment spreads were 256 basis points, up 100 basis points year-over-year due to higher variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 93 basis points, down 5 basis points year-over-year and sequentially, primarily due to lower paydowns in our portfolios of residential mortgage-backed securities and residential mortgage loans. RIS liability exposures including UK longevity reinsurance increased 4% year-over-year due to solid volume growth across the product portfolio. With regards to pension risk transfers, as Michelle noted, we have already completed $3.5 billion of transactions in the fourth quarter and continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 31% on both a reported and constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Asia's solid volume growth also contributed to the strong performance, driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 7% on a constant currency basis. Lower accident and health utilization in the prior period was a partial offset. Asia sales were down 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, reflecting pressure from COVID-related lockdowns in the region. Asia year-to-date sales were up 10% on a constant currency basis and remain on target to achieve double-digit growth in 2021. Latin America adjusted earnings were down 35% and down 38% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting margins due to elevated COVID-19-related claims, mainly in Mexico. The impact to Latin America's third quarter adjusted earnings was approximately $137 million. While the situation remains fluid, we have seen COVID-related hospitalizations and deaths in Latin America significantly declined in October. Favorable investment in expense margins as well as lower taxes versus the prior year quarter were partial offsets. While Latin America's adjusted earnings have been pressured by elevated COVID-19-related claims, sales and persistency throughout the region remains strong. Latin America adjusted PFOs were up 22% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 45% on a constant currency basis, driven by solid growth across most markets. EMEA adjusted earnings were up 20% on both a reported and constant currency basis primarily driven by volume growth across the region and favorable underwriting margins, primarily in the Gulf. We expect EMEA adjusted earnings to decline in the fourth quarter due to the timing of certain technology investments across the region. EMEA adjusted PFOs were down 2% on a constant currency basis and sales were down 5% on a constant currency basis, reflecting divested businesses, partially offset by growth in Turkey and Europe. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings, excluding notable items in both periods, were up $271 million year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by strong private equity returns. Underwriting margins did reflect higher life claims severity than expected during the third quarter of 2021. However, the Life interest adjusted benefit ratio of 53.3% was within our annual target range of 50% to 55%. In addition, LTC new claims returned to more normal levels in the quarter versus very low new claims submissions in the prior year quarter. Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $131 million in both periods. Lower tax benefits were mostly offset by higher net investment income year-over-year. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 20.6% and within our 2021 guidance range of 20% to 22%. Now I'll provide more detail on Group Benefits mortality results on Page 6. This chart reflects our Group Life mortality ratio for the first three quarters of 2021, including the COVID-19 impact on the ratio and on Group Benefits adjusted earnings. Group Life mortality ratio is 106.2% in the third quarter of 2021, which is well above our annual target range of 85% to 90%. COVID reported claims in 3Q of 2021 were roughly 18 percentage points which reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $290 million. The primary drivers were higher claim frequency and severity. Approximately 40% of U.S. COVID deaths in the quarter were under age 65, about double the rate of the first quarter of this year and the highest percentage in any quarter since the pandemic began and therefore, having a greater proportional impact on the working age population. In addition, we estimate that the quarter included roughly 1 to 2 incremental percentage points impact on the mortality ratio from claims that appear to be COVID-related but were not specifically identified as COVID on the death certificate. Despite the impact from COVID, Group Benefits remains a profitable and growing business for MetLife. Group Benefits reported adjusted earnings of roughly $450 million year-to-date and adjusted PFO growth of 13%. Now let's turn to Page 7. This chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income over the last five quarters, including approximately $1.8 billion in the third quarter. This very strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio which had a 12.6% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, the private equities are generally accounted for on a one quarter lag. While all private equity asset classes performed well in the quarter, our venture capital funds, which account for roughly 23% of our PE account balance of $12.8 billion. We're the strongest performer across subsectors with a roughly 18% quarterly return. Page 8 highlights VII by segment for the first three quarters of 2021, including $1.4 billion post tax in the third quarter. The attribution of VII by business is based on the quarterly returns for each segment's individual portfolio. As we have previously noted, RIS, MetLife Holdings, and Asia generally account for 90% or more of the total VII and are split roughly one-third each, although it can vary from quarter to quarter. The VII results in the quarter were more heavily weighted towards RIS and MetLife Holdings, as Asia's private equity portfolio is less mature and has a smaller proportion of venture capital funds I referenced earlier. Turning to Page 9, this chart shows our direct expense ratio over the prior five quarters and full year 2020, including 11.1% in the third quarter of 2021. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our third quarter direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline. This did include approximately 20 basis points from premiums that relate to participating cases and 20 basis points from a single premium Group Life sale in RIS. In addition, the impact from seasonal enrollment costs and timing of certain technology investments are expected to be more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. Therefore, we do expect the direct expense ratio to be elevated in 4Q. Now, let's turn to Page 10. This chart reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments for the past five years, including an update for 2020. Consistent with our Next Horizon strategy, we continue to have a relentless focus on deploying capital and resources to the highest value opportunities. As evidence of that commitment, MetLife invested $3.2 billion of capital in 2020 to support new business, which was deployed at an average unlevered IRR of approximately 17% with a payback period of six years. New business written in 2020 reflects our disciplined approach to building profitable growth, while creating value, generating cash, and mitigating risk. Despite the sales challenges in 2020 associated with lockdowns related to the pandemic, we were able to increase our value of new business and IRR, while lowering our cash payback period versus 2019. Now, I'll discuss our cash and capital position on Page 11. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were $5.1 billion as of September 30th, which is down from $6.5 billion at June 30th, but still well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential decrease in cash at the holding companies include the net effects of share repurchases of $1 billion, payment of our common stock dividend of roughly $400 million, subsidiary dividends, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, we had a long-term debt repayment of $500 million in the third quarter. Our next long-term debt maturity is not until September 2023. Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, preliminary third quarter year-to-date 2021 statutory operating earnings were approximately $4 billion, while net income was approximately $3 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by approximately $1 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by higher variable investment income and lower variable annuity right of reserves. Year-to-date 2021 net income increased by, roughly $400 million as compared to the first nine months of 2020. The primary drivers were higher operating earnings and net investment gains which was partially offset by derivative losses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $19.7 billion as of September 30th, 2021, up 16% compared to December 31st, 2020. Favorable operating earnings and net investment gains were partially offset by derivative losses and dividends paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 960%, as of June 30th, which is the latest public data. In summary, MetLife delivered another very strong quarter, driven by exceptional private equity returns, solid top line growth, ongoing expense discipline and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities. While earnings power of our group benefits in Latin America businesses, has been dampened by COVID-19 excess mortality. We are pleased with the momentum behind these market-leading franchises. In addition, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio remains strong and position us for further success. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ryan Krueger of KBW. Please go ahead.\nRyan Krueger: I was hoping you could provide a little bit more detail on your group non-medical health claim trends in the quarter. I guess, in particular, and I know disability is a bit smaller for you, but some companies have had weaker disability results and it sounds like yours held up pretty well. So I appreciate any detail you could provide here.\nRamy Tadros: Good morning Ryan. It's Ramy here. So on the disability front, as you noted, it's - relative to our premium, it's about 12% of our overall PFOs in group. And I can give you some color based on both the LTD and the STD portions of the book. So for the LTD side, what we saw is an incidence rate this quarter that's much more in line with our historical norms. It was higher than last year but last year was a favorable incidence here from a disability perspective. So we're seeing it tick back to where it was historically from a frequency perspective. And then, the recoveries continue to be pretty strong. The other thing I would add there on the LTD side is so far, we have not seen any significant impact on the business from kind of COVID or non-COVID effect, neither have we seen any material impacts from the overall economy. So it's been pretty much a return to, call it, a pre-pandemic levels as far as the LTD book. For the STD side, it's a bit different. So think about that 12% of disability premium, two-thirds of it is sitting in the LTD only a third of it sits in the STD. And then for that one-third that's in STD, about half of those employees are comprised of ASO only business. So we are administering the disability claims but not on the hook for the actual claims themselves. So while for the STD portion, we have seen and continue to see elevated STD COVID claims. The actual impact on the non-medical health ratio is pretty de minimis given the composition of our book and the ASO exposure.\nRyan Krueger: Great. That was helpful. Thank you. And then you've had some benefit from RMBS paydowns in RIS. How should we think about the ongoing impact of that? Or what's left of it from here?\nJohn McCallion: Good morning, Ryan. It's John. Yes, obviously, RIS spreads, I think, overall, have been just a beneficiary of just the excellent performance here in private equity portfolio. So we saw that continue in this quarter. You're referencing, after excluding VII, that spreads have remained resilient at 93 basis points, although a 5 basis point decline from second quarter. But pretty much in line with what we what we set back 90 days ago. So you're referencing that continued alleviated levels paydown activity on the residential mortgage book, and that accelerates the income from those securities or loans that we purchased at a discount. But as we said, we believe we've seen the peak of that. And so that 5 basis point run-off was generally expected. We would expect that to continue into 4Q and kind of start to make its way down. And - but I think kind of a similar trajectory seems reasonable at this point.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Erik Bass of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nErik Bass: So we've seen more in-force block transactions over the past quarter with sellers getting pretty attractive multiples. And it seems like there's plenty of buyer interest in the types of liabilities you have, and now there are some potential counterparties that have New York entities. So I'm curious if you're getting more optimistic about finding a transaction that could potentially unlock value in portions of your MetLife Holdings blocks?\nJohn McCallion: Eric, it's John. I'd say the short answer is, yes. If the question is, are we getting more optimistic? Yes. We are seeing what you're referencing as well. I think the supplier and buyer base is continuing to remain, I'd say, robust. And I think our team continues to work and take a third-party view and do the analytics around our portfolio. And as we've - I've talked about before, quite a bit of it is thinking about what are of interest of different buyers. It differs. Not everyone is thinking the same way or have they - buyers have different tools for creating value. And so we have to think through that and think about our situation as well and how we would optimize from our end. And I think there is a puzzle to put together there to think through how to best optimize a situation like that. As we've talked about before, we're not going to do something at any cost. But we are continuing to look at things to optimize and accelerate the release of reserves and capital appropriately. And I think that's - we're still on track with that.\nErik Bass: Great, thank you. And then second, I was hoping you could give some perspective on what's going on in Chile and the potential implications for your business. I guess specifically, what are the different proposals that are out there for the AFP system from the leading presidential candidates. And do you see risk of significant change to that business following the election? And also hoping you could talk about the early annuity payouts issues that's been covered in the press and whether that's material for you at all.\nMichel Khalaf: Yes. Hi, Erik. It's Michel here. So let me give you some comments and then we'll see if Eric would want to add anything. The pension system in Chile has been subject to public debate for a number of years now, I would say, and that debate tends to heat up around elections. One thing I would say is that despite the general perception, to the contrary, if you think about the pension system, I mean, it's functioned quite well and the returns have been quite good as well for the industry as a whole. The problem with the system is that due to inconsistent contributions, the fact that you have widespread and formal labor in Chile and contribution rates are low. That's led to sort of low projected replacement rates at retirement. The debate is continuing now with presidential elections, round one is in late November and then you'll have the second round in December, and different candidates are taking very different views. Some are supportive of the system, others are in favor of radical reform. So we'd have to see how that plays out. The other thing that's happening in Chile is that there is a re-drafting of the constitution that's taking place that's going to play out next year as well. So we'll see what comes out of that. We are very much engaged with the local authorities. We have great relationships in Chile, we are a leading player there, as you know. We're also in collaboration with the industry, making sure that our point of view is being heard, and hopefully, addressed as well. And look, we are - we are not - we in favor of reform that makes sense for the participants in the system, that protects them, their retirement. But we are also cautioning against any measures that ultimately would do - would damage today's capital markets, as well as investor perceptions of the Chilean - Chile as an investment destination. So we continue to be engaged. As you know, there has been three rounds of withdrawals already. There is another proposal for a fourth round of pension withdrawals. We'll see whether that gets surpassed or not. Clearly, if it does, whereas these withdrawals don't have a material impact on earnings, the damage sort of the viability of the system, if you like, which is something that we advocate against. And then on the annuities front that you referenced, this - there's been one withdrawal there. Again, we don't know if there'll be another one. I think probably our view is that the likelihood of that is not very high, but we'll have to wait and see. All-in-all, our pension business is 2% of MetLife's overall earnings. But our view is that we continue to engage, we continue to keep a close eye on the situation, and we'll have to see how this plays out over the coming weeks and months. Anything to add, Eric?\nEric Clurfain: No. I think you covered it.\nMichel Khalaf: So I hope that gives you sort of - that answer to the question, Erik.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \nJimmy Bhullar: Just had a question on the group business. If you can talk about what you're seeing in terms of claims utilization, both frequency and severity in your dental book?\nRamy Tadros: Sure, Jimmy. It's Ramy here. I would say the dental story is very much a return to pre-pandemic utilization. So if you look at the quarter-over-quarter results, 2020 was exceptionally low in terms of dental utilization. We've seen that come back to normal levels. Q3 tends to be seasonally lower. So Q4 tends to kind of slightly tick up typically in terms of the dental business. So very much kind of a return to normal. And I would say if you look at the overall ratio, our non-medical health ratio. And our expectation right now is that for the full year, we're going to get a ratio that's very close to the midpoint of our range.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then on the accounting changes, can you talk about where you are internally on sort of the process of figuring out what the impact will be on MetLife? And then relatedly, when do you think you'll start quantifying the impact and sharing it with the investment community?\nJohn McCallion: Good morning, Jimmy, it's John. We are well underway on our implementation work, progress continues. And I'd say, continue to be on target for implementation come 11/23. We're going to - we're in the process of evaluating transition amounts and ongoing impacts of the new guidance. And I'd say our plan is still intact, which would be kind of a mid-2022 timeframe, give or take, for disclosing and kind of sharing how to think about the transition and the insights you should draw upon this. Again, I'd remind everyone that ultimately economics, cash flow, pricing product does not change. And I think we're working well with the industry to think through how we collectively transition ourselves and kind of explain the results. And I think that's going well. So at this point, I'd say nothing has caused us to feel the need to change the time line.\nJimmy Bhullar: And have you had conversations with the rating agencies on how they would view, obviously, they focus on cash flows and stat as well but they do look at cap also. But do you think there will be changes because a lot of your GAAP ratios would obviously end up changing once the rules are implemented.\nJohn McCallion: Yes. We've had periodic discussions with them over time. I think the rating agencies get it, and not everything is changing. So when you say ratios, not all ratios are changing. I mean our group business ratios won't change. So I think it's not all businesses. It's not all products. And I think it's - there will be certain unique circumstances that will arise in certain books. But in general, I think my assessment is that - they have a very balanced methodical way of thinking about it, and they recognize the fact that economics, cash flow and pricing of products is not changing.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Tom Gallagher of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nTom Gallagher: Good morning, John. Just a follow-up on Erik's question on risk transfer. Would you say is - are variable annuities the priority or you're looking broader that might include life insurance and fixed annuities. And just a related question, does your New York domicile limit the types of counterparties that you might transact with? Or would you say it's still a pretty robust list as you're thinking about things that would be in a potential auction bidding situation?\nJohn McCallion: Good morning, Tom. I would say the answer to the first question would be would be, we're open to all blocks of business that create value for us. So I think a lot of different aspects go into value creation when it comes to that question. So I don't think it's one focus there or another. I'd say probably the only one that could probably scope out or say is less likely as LTC just given where bid spreads are at these days. But I'd say markets are evolving on all the other ones. And then you have to look at your own kind of situation to think about the benefits we get from having them in our New York domiciled entity. And so that's how we would kind of frame it. I wouldn't exclude anything outside of, let's say, LTC just given where I think pricing is, there's a pretty big divergence in what people think at this point. On the other aspect of counterparty, I would say, we come at it probably the same way that our New York domicile partners would come at it as well. So I don't know if it changes who or how we would do transaction. I think we probably take somewhat of a similar construct because at the end of the day, our situation would be a reinsurance transaction from the New York domiciled entity. And so credit risk would matter. And so structure can help with that as well. But I don't think it excludes anything per se, but that would be a strong consideration.\nTom Gallagher: Okay. Thanks. And then just one quick one. Long-term care claims, you said, returned to more normal levels this quarter. Was that on both claim frequency and severity? And the reason I ask is, there's clearly, from what we've heard from other has been a shift away from facility care to home health care, which has lowered severity. I'm just curious, if you have that level of detail for how that's trending right now?\nJohn McCallion: Yes, sure. Good question, Tom, because you're right. It has shifted. I mean, quite honestly, every metric has shifted back to pre-pandemic levels. I mean maybe we're off slightly on the relationship of in-home versus kind of external care, but it's very close. It's much - it's very close to being pre-pandemic.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Humphrey Lee of Dowling Partners. Please go ahead.\nHumphrey Lee: Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Related to EMEA, you talked about there are some favorable items in the quarter and expect fourth quarter to trend down along with some of the high expenses. Is there any way to help us think about what would be the kind of the run rate earnings for EMEA? \nJohn McCallion: Yes. Good morning, Humphrey. So yes, we had a very strong Q3, I'd say, a number of items went in one direction that caused us to have a very strong result in Q3. As we think about quantification of that, you could put it in the area of, call it, $20 million, $25 million, give or take. And then as I said on - in my prepared remarks, we'd expect some elevated technology investments in the in the fourth quarter. So I'll give you some data point from this sure I give you anything outside of that, but that probably should help you kind of frame for your modeling.\nHumphrey Lee: And then in terms of the overall expenses for company, is the 12.3% for the full year still the appropriate way to think about the expenses for 2021?\nJohn McCallion: Yes. So I would say we continue to focus on the full year that's our target to be under 12 3%. Full year obviously we've been running well below that. I mentioned that we would expect to have elevated expenses in the fourth quarter. Quite honestly, it's not much different than the trend you saw a year ago, in terms of how things transpired for most of the year, and then we saw an uptick. And so that, if we're above 12.3% in the fourth quarter by a bit that would that would not be a surprise, per se, but that's not our focus. Just using that as an example when you talk about the 12.3% what's important to us is the 12.3% for the full year. And so, that's kind of our mindset when we think about our expense ratio, and we continue to anticipate to be under that on a full year basis.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of John Barnidge of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead\nJohn Barnidge: An increase COVID impact on the group Life business is there a need to increase administrative expenses to deal with him during nature the pandemic at all?\nRamy Tadros: John, it's Rami here. The expense ratio on the Life business is pretty small. So the real the real issue is not operations or expenses, the real issue and the challenge you're seeing is just the claims front. So it's not really an expense issue at all this point.\nJohn Barnidge: And then, would it be fair to say, if the seasonal increase in the direct expense ratio overall, obviously about 12.3% seems fair to come in well below 12% for the year, would there be a reevaluation of it longer term possibly? Thank you.\nRamy Tadros: John, it's Rami again here. I just want to maybe also further clarify our issue with the intent of your question with respect to what's going to change and what is changing on the life side is pricing. So we did talk about this, the last quarter we have and we continue to make rate adjustments in the group life business, in line with our perspective view of the pandemics. It's not operations related is related to the underwriting and the mortality. And as you look at the upcoming renewal season, we have been able to achieve rate adjustments and rate increases in line with our perspective view of mortality, while maintaining pretty strong persistency in our book. So and that's going to be an ongoing process that we're undertaking. So that's kind of what's changing, if you will, with respect to the group life piece.\nJohn McCallion: And then I can take the second question you had John. This is John as well. Yes, our target is under 12.3% you said is it possible. Sure, anything is possible I guess, but ultimately, we are steadfast on being at or below 12.3%. Again, what we're trying to do is shift the mix of expenses that are within our expense base, and continue to drive savings and capacity for reinvestment. So we want to maintain being at or below 12.3% on a persistent basis every year. But at the same time, we want to continue to drive efficiencies that free up the allocation of resources to invest in the customer, invest in our processes, and to continue to drive growth for the firm. And so, at the same time, if we see headwinds in an economy, we can use that capacity as a protection for profit margin. So that's kind of our philosophy when it comes to our efficiency mindset. And I'd say nothing would kind of take us off that track at this point.\nOperator: There are no further questions in queue at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back over to our CEO, Michel Khalaf for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir.\nMichel Khalaf: Great. Thank you, Operator. While the third quarter had outsized PE returns and COVID claims, we believe the underlying performance of our business, demonstrates the enduring strength and growth potential of the MetLife global insurance franchise. Although the pandemic continues to create uncertainty, I am confident in our ability to continue to execute and create long-term shareholder value for shareholders. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, it does conclude your conference call for today. ON behalf of today's panel we like to thank you for your participation in today's earnings call and thank you for using our service. Have a wonderful day. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Michel Khalaf",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As I reflect on the journey MetLife has been on these past two years, I am more convinced than ever that we are focused on what matters most. We are a purpose-driven company at a time when stakeholders will accept nothing less. We have the right strategy to see us through even the most turbulent environments, and we have a strong culture of execution that gives our shareholders confidence. All of these attributes were on display in the third quarter of 2021. Starting with our financial results. Adjusted earnings were $2.1 billion, up 31% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.39, up 38% year-over-year. Excluding total notable items in both periods, adjusted earnings were up 24% and adjusted EPS was up 31%. Looking at the quarterly performance of the enterprise as a whole, variable investment income was outstanding, underlying PFOs were strong and expense disciplined held firm. The main area where we have seen headwinds is from elevated COVID claims. In key respects, the third quarter of 2021 looks very much like the first quarter with exceptionally strong VII more than offsetting excess mortality. On the investment side, our private equity portfolio returned $1.5 billion in Q3, its highest quarterly contribution in 2021 and the major contributor to VII, which was well above the top end of our implied quarterly guidance range. On underwriting in our U.S. business, the Group Life mortality ratio was elevated at 106.2% in Q3 on higher claim severity and frequency due to a shift younger in the age distribution of COVID deaths. Our Latin America business incurred COVID losses of $137 million in Q3. Two aspects of our underwriting results are noteworthy. From a social perspective, paying COVID claims is precisely how life insurance companies make a positive difference in the world. The human toll of the pandemic on families is catastrophic but where life insurance is present, the financial burden is eased. This is our purpose to help prepare the financial damage after lives most destabilizing moments. Pandemic to date, in our U.S. group business, we've incurred U.S. life claims of around $2.1 billion. Life insurance is not like other businesses where losses are just losses. Every underwriting claim represents a beneficiary who is receiving the financial help they were promised. From a financial perspective, even though our Life businesses have been hit with the most severe pandemic in more than 100 years, they remain profitable. MetLife has actually paid out more in COVID-related claims in 2021 than we did in 2020. And yet, our adjusted earnings per share are higher this year than last year, as is our adjusted return on equity. What has enhanced MetLife's capacity to pay outsized claims while still generating exceptional earnings is our of our strategic decision to allocate a prudent portion of our investment portfolio to private equity. While not a direct COVID offset, the valuation of our PE and VC funds with significant technology exposure has benefited from global capital flows to this growth sector. The return on our PE portfolio in the quarter was an outstanding 12.6% and stands at approximately 36% year-to-date. The gains on our well-seasoned portfolio are not mere accounting marks. Year-to-date, we have received $1.9 billion in cash distributions from RPE funds. Since 2016, the figure is $7.6 billion. While we often reinvest the e-cash proceeds as funds mature and terminate, the cash generated is steady and significant. Turning to the underlying performance of MetLife's businesses, we are seeing solid momentum. In U.S. Group Benefits, adjusted PFOs grew 13% year-over-year, excluding Versant Health PFO growth was 6.2% on strong jumbo sales and persistency, and we expect to end the year near the top end of our guidance range. In voluntary benefits, which for us consists of accident and health, legal plans and pet insurance, we saw strong double-digit PFO growth in the third quarter. The trend in sales is even stronger. Year-to-date, sales are up 40% over the prior period, and we remain on track for a record sales year. While group sales can fluctuate from year-to-year due to jumbo cases, we believe the robust U.S. job market and the competition for talent are creating a strong tailwind. In connection with open enrollment season this fall, we conducted consumer research on benefit preferences among millennials, who are now the largest age group cohort in the U.S. with more than 70 million members. Millennials are expressing strong interest in both traditional benefits such as life insurance and dental and involuntary benefits such as legal plans and pet insurance. Another top desire is for help with financial planning. MetLife entered the space in late September with a digital financial wellness tool called Upwise, which helps us connect with employees directly. The app is designed to address the emotional barriers to financial progress and help people tackle death, save more or even create a digital will. Within our RIS business, after a quiet first three quarters, we have already booked four cases totaling $3.5 billion of pension risk transfer deals in the first month of the fourth quarter. Next Tuesday marks the 100th anniversary of the first group annuity contract MetLife ever wrote with the William Rodge printing company. We are pleased to be a leader in the business of helping companies honor the retirement promises they have made to their workers. Last month, MetLife released the results of our annual pension risk transfer pull. We only survey companies that want to derisk. Of the 253 respondents, nearly 7 in 10 have pension plan assets of $5 00 million or more and 93% intend to divest all of the defined benefit pension liabilities at some point in the future, up from 76% in 2019. Elsewhere in RIS, excluding PRTs from both periods, adjusted PFOs were up 70% year-over-year. There were two main drivers. The first was longevity reinsurance, a market we entered in the UK last year. The second was post-retirement benefits, where we take on blocks of retiree life insurance from employers. This is an attractive adjacency to our group business that plays to MetLife's competitive advantages. In Latin America, we delivered exceptional sales growth in the quarter, up 45% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. In fact, sales were higher in Q3 2021 than they were in Q3 2019 before the COVID pandemic began. In most markets across the region, we saw double-digit growth in both sales and PFOs. Moving to cash and capital, MetLife ended the third quarter with $5.1 billion of cash at its holding companies. During the quarter, we paid $400 million in common stock dividends and repurchased $1 billion worth of outstanding common shares with another 233 million repurchased so far in Q4. We have $2.5 billion remaining on the $3 billion share repurchase authorization we announced in August. We are on track to return more than $5.5 billion of capital to shareholders in 2021, and we continue to strive for a balanced mix between business investment and capital return. In 2020, for example, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders and invested approximately $5 billion in organic growth and M&A. Our test for capital deployment remains consistent. Does it clear our risk-adjusted hurdle rate? As John will describe in greater detail, the new business we wrote in 2020, a period when interest rates were at all-time lows, was the most attractive of the past five years. It had the shortest payback period, the highest internal rate of return and the highest value of new business relative to the amount of capital deployed. This was the natural outgrowth of our Accelerating Value initiative. By optimizing our portfolio of businesses, shifting our product mix to be more capital efficient and fully embracing an efficiency mindset, we have consistently improved VNB over time, and it is now an integral part of our capital allocation process. This year, in addition to organic growth, we increased the stake in our India joint venture, PNB MetLife to 47% from 32%. India is one of the five secular growth markets we identified in our Next Horizon strategy. Consistent with that strategy, we are increasing our exposure to a market where PNB MetLife has access to more than 200 million customers across 15,000 sales locations. In September, we held an in-depth session with our Board of Directors to pressure test every aspect of our Next Horizon strategy. We've done this each year of my tenure as CEO. As representatives of our shareholders and shareholders themselves, our Board challenged us to make sure we are positioned and on track to deliver on our goals. I believe the alignment between the Board and management is as strong as it's ever been, and our shared commitments remain clear, focus on deploying capital to its best use, simplify the company to improve efficiency and the customer experience and truly differentiate ourselves in the marketplace. Now I'll turn it over to John for a detailed review of our quarterly performance. Yes. Hi, Erik. It's Michel here. So let me give you some comments and then we'll see if Eric would want to add anything. The pension system in Chile has been subject to public debate for a number of years now, I would say, and that debate tends to heat up around elections. One thing I would say is that despite the general perception, to the contrary, if you think about the pension system, I mean, it's functioned quite well and the returns have been quite good as well for the industry as a whole. The problem with the system is that due to inconsistent contributions, the fact that you have widespread and formal labor in Chile and contribution rates are low. That's led to sort of low projected replacement rates at retirement. The debate is continuing now with presidential elections, round one is in late November and then you'll have the second round in December, and different candidates are taking very different views. Some are supportive of the system, others are in favor of radical reform. So we'd have to see how that plays out. The other thing that's happening in Chile is that there is a re-drafting of the constitution that's taking place that's going to play out next year as well. So we'll see what comes out of that. We are very much engaged with the local authorities. We have great relationships in Chile, we are a leading player there, as you know. We're also in collaboration with the industry, making sure that our point of view is being heard, and hopefully, addressed as well. And look, we are - we are not - we in favor of reform that makes sense for the participants in the system, that protects them, their retirement. But we are also cautioning against any measures that ultimately would do - would damage today's capital markets, as well as investor perceptions of the Chilean - Chile as an investment destination. So we continue to be engaged. As you know, there has been three rounds of withdrawals already. There is another proposal for a fourth round of pension withdrawals. We'll see whether that gets surpassed or not. Clearly, if it does, whereas these withdrawals don't have a material impact on earnings, the damage sort of the viability of the system, if you like, which is something that we advocate against. And then on the annuities front that you referenced, this - there's been one withdrawal there. Again, we don't know if there'll be another one. I think probably our view is that the likelihood of that is not very high, but we'll have to wait and see. All-in-all, our pension business is 2% of MetLife's overall earnings. But our view is that we continue to engage, we continue to keep a close eye on the situation, and we'll have to see how this plays out over the coming weeks and months. Anything to add, Eric? So I hope that gives you sort of - that answer to the question, Erik. Great. Thank you, Operator. While the third quarter had outsized PE returns and COVID claims, we believe the underlying performance of our business, demonstrates the enduring strength and growth potential of the MetLife global insurance franchise. Although the pandemic continues to create uncertainty, I am confident in our ability to continue to execute and create long-term shareholder value for shareholders. Have a great day."

            "name": "Ramy Tadros",
            "content": "Good morning Ryan. It's Ramy here. So on the disability front, as you noted, it's - relative to our premium, it's about 12% of our overall PFOs in group. And I can give you some color based on both the LTD and the STD portions of the book. So for the LTD side, what we saw is an incidence rate this quarter that's much more in line with our historical norms. It was higher than last year but last year was a favorable incidence here from a disability perspective. So we're seeing it tick back to where it was historically from a frequency perspective. And then, the recoveries continue to be pretty strong. The other thing I would add there on the LTD side is so far, we have not seen any significant impact on the business from kind of COVID or non-COVID effect, neither have we seen any material impacts from the overall economy. So it's been pretty much a return to, call it, a pre-pandemic levels as far as the LTD book. For the STD side, it's a bit different. So think about that 12% of disability premium, two-thirds of it is sitting in the LTD only a third of it sits in the STD. And then for that one-third that's in STD, about half of those employees are comprised of ASO only business. So we are administering the disability claims but not on the hook for the actual claims themselves. So while for the STD portion, we have seen and continue to see elevated STD COVID claims. The actual impact on the non-medical health ratio is pretty de minimis given the composition of our book and the ASO exposure. Sure, Jimmy. It's Ramy here. I would say the dental story is very much a return to pre-pandemic utilization. So if you look at the quarter-over-quarter results, 2020 was exceptionally low in terms of dental utilization. We've seen that come back to normal levels. Q3 tends to be seasonally lower. So Q4 tends to kind of slightly tick up typically in terms of the dental business. So very much kind of a return to normal. And I would say if you look at the overall ratio, our non-medical health ratio. And our expectation right now is that for the full year, we're going to get a ratio that's very close to the midpoint of our range. John, it's Rami here. The expense ratio on the Life business is pretty small. So the real the real issue is not operations or expenses, the real issue and the challenge you're seeing is just the claims front. So it's not really an expense issue at all this point. John, it's Rami again here. I just want to maybe also further clarify our issue with the intent of your question with respect to what's going to change and what is changing on the life side is pricing. So we did talk about this, the last quarter we have and we continue to make rate adjustments in the group life business, in line with our perspective view of the pandemics. It's not operations related is related to the underwriting and the mortality. And as you look at the upcoming renewal season, we have been able to achieve rate adjustments and rate increases in line with our perspective view of mortality, while maintaining pretty strong persistency in our book. So and that's going to be an ongoing process that we're undertaking. So that's kind of what's changing, if you will, with respect to the group life piece."

            "name": "John McCallion",
            "content": "Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I'll start with the 3Q 2021 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, details of our annual global actuarial assumption review and updates on our value of new business metrics and our cash and capital positions. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings. Net income in the third quarter was $1.5 billion or $541 million lower than adjusted earnings. Net derivative losses of $172 million were primarily driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter. In addition, our actuarial assumption review accounted for $76 million of the variance between net income and adjusted earnings. In total, the assumption review reduced net income by $216 million, including a notable item to adjusted earnings of $140 million. The table on Page 4 provides highlights of the actuarial assumption review with the breakdown of the adjusted earnings and net income impact by business segment. We have kept our U.S. mean reversion interest rate unchanged at 2.75% and maintain our long-term mortality assumptions despite the near-term impacts from COVID-19. Most of the net income impact was in MetLife Holdings and Asia. For MetLife Holdings, the primary driver was a refinement to the variable annuity lapse rate function to better reflect policyholder behavior based on withdrawal status. In Asia, the largest impact was due to the lowering of the earned rate assumption in Japan, where we assume current earned rates for our long-term rate assumption. On Page 5, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items in both periods. Adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were $2.2 billion, up 24% and up 23% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by strong returns in our private equity portfolio. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding notable items, was $2.56, up 31% year-over-year on both a reported and constant currency basis, aided by capital management. Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S.. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were down 72% year-over-year, driven by unfavorable underwriting margins in Group Life, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 70.7% in 3Q of 2021 at the low-end of its annual target range of 70% to 75% but higher than the prior year quarter of 67.4%, which benefited from extremely low dental utilization and favorable disability incidents. Volume growth, the addition of Versant Health and favorable expense margins were partial offsets to the decline in year-over-year results. Group Benefits continues to have strong top line growth. Year-to-date sales were up 40%, primarily due to higher jumbo case activity. Adjusted PFOs in the quarter were up 13% year-over-year, driven by solid volume growth across most products, including voluntary and the addition of Versant Health. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings, were up 60% year-over-year. The primary driver was higher variable investment income, largely due to strong private equity returns. Favorable underwriting margins and volume growth also contributed to year-over-year performance. RIS investment spreads were 256 basis points, up 100 basis points year-over-year due to higher variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 93 basis points, down 5 basis points year-over-year and sequentially, primarily due to lower paydowns in our portfolios of residential mortgage-backed securities and residential mortgage loans. RIS liability exposures including UK longevity reinsurance increased 4% year-over-year due to solid volume growth across the product portfolio. With regards to pension risk transfers, as Michelle noted, we have already completed $3.5 billion of transactions in the fourth quarter and continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 31% on both a reported and constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Asia's solid volume growth also contributed to the strong performance, driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 7% on a constant currency basis. Lower accident and health utilization in the prior period was a partial offset. Asia sales were down 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, reflecting pressure from COVID-related lockdowns in the region. Asia year-to-date sales were up 10% on a constant currency basis and remain on target to achieve double-digit growth in 2021. Latin America adjusted earnings were down 35% and down 38% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting margins due to elevated COVID-19-related claims, mainly in Mexico. The impact to Latin America's third quarter adjusted earnings was approximately $137 million. While the situation remains fluid, we have seen COVID-related hospitalizations and deaths in Latin America significantly declined in October. Favorable investment in expense margins as well as lower taxes versus the prior year quarter were partial offsets. While Latin America's adjusted earnings have been pressured by elevated COVID-19-related claims, sales and persistency throughout the region remains strong. Latin America adjusted PFOs were up 22% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 45% on a constant currency basis, driven by solid growth across most markets. EMEA adjusted earnings were up 20% on both a reported and constant currency basis primarily driven by volume growth across the region and favorable underwriting margins, primarily in the Gulf. We expect EMEA adjusted earnings to decline in the fourth quarter due to the timing of certain technology investments across the region. EMEA adjusted PFOs were down 2% on a constant currency basis and sales were down 5% on a constant currency basis, reflecting divested businesses, partially offset by growth in Turkey and Europe. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings, excluding notable items in both periods, were up $271 million year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by strong private equity returns. Underwriting margins did reflect higher life claims severity than expected during the third quarter of 2021. However, the Life interest adjusted benefit ratio of 53.3% was within our annual target range of 50% to 55%. In addition, LTC new claims returned to more normal levels in the quarter versus very low new claims submissions in the prior year quarter. Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $131 million in both periods. Lower tax benefits were mostly offset by higher net investment income year-over-year. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 20.6% and within our 2021 guidance range of 20% to 22%. Now I'll provide more detail on Group Benefits mortality results on Page 6. This chart reflects our Group Life mortality ratio for the first three quarters of 2021, including the COVID-19 impact on the ratio and on Group Benefits adjusted earnings. Group Life mortality ratio is 106.2% in the third quarter of 2021, which is well above our annual target range of 85% to 90%. COVID reported claims in 3Q of 2021 were roughly 18 percentage points which reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $290 million. The primary drivers were higher claim frequency and severity. Approximately 40% of U.S. COVID deaths in the quarter were under age 65, about double the rate of the first quarter of this year and the highest percentage in any quarter since the pandemic began and therefore, having a greater proportional impact on the working age population. In addition, we estimate that the quarter included roughly 1 to 2 incremental percentage points impact on the mortality ratio from claims that appear to be COVID-related but were not specifically identified as COVID on the death certificate. Despite the impact from COVID, Group Benefits remains a profitable and growing business for MetLife. Group Benefits reported adjusted earnings of roughly $450 million year-to-date and adjusted PFO growth of 13%. Now let's turn to Page 7. This chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income over the last five quarters, including approximately $1.8 billion in the third quarter. This very strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio which had a 12.6% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, the private equities are generally accounted for on a one quarter lag. While all private equity asset classes performed well in the quarter, our venture capital funds, which account for roughly 23% of our PE account balance of $12.8 billion. We're the strongest performer across subsectors with a roughly 18% quarterly return. Page 8 highlights VII by segment for the first three quarters of 2021, including $1.4 billion post tax in the third quarter. The attribution of VII by business is based on the quarterly returns for each segment's individual portfolio. As we have previously noted, RIS, MetLife Holdings, and Asia generally account for 90% or more of the total VII and are split roughly one-third each, although it can vary from quarter to quarter. The VII results in the quarter were more heavily weighted towards RIS and MetLife Holdings, as Asia's private equity portfolio is less mature and has a smaller proportion of venture capital funds I referenced earlier. Turning to Page 9, this chart shows our direct expense ratio over the prior five quarters and full year 2020, including 11.1% in the third quarter of 2021. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our third quarter direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline. This did include approximately 20 basis points from premiums that relate to participating cases and 20 basis points from a single premium Group Life sale in RIS. In addition, the impact from seasonal enrollment costs and timing of certain technology investments are expected to be more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. Therefore, we do expect the direct expense ratio to be elevated in 4Q. Now, let's turn to Page 10. This chart reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments for the past five years, including an update for 2020. Consistent with our Next Horizon strategy, we continue to have a relentless focus on deploying capital and resources to the highest value opportunities. As evidence of that commitment, MetLife invested $3.2 billion of capital in 2020 to support new business, which was deployed at an average unlevered IRR of approximately 17% with a payback period of six years. New business written in 2020 reflects our disciplined approach to building profitable growth, while creating value, generating cash, and mitigating risk. Despite the sales challenges in 2020 associated with lockdowns related to the pandemic, we were able to increase our value of new business and IRR, while lowering our cash payback period versus 2019. Now, I'll discuss our cash and capital position on Page 11. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were $5.1 billion as of September 30th, which is down from $6.5 billion at June 30th, but still well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential decrease in cash at the holding companies include the net effects of share repurchases of $1 billion, payment of our common stock dividend of roughly $400 million, subsidiary dividends, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, we had a long-term debt repayment of $500 million in the third quarter. Our next long-term debt maturity is not until September 2023. Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, preliminary third quarter year-to-date 2021 statutory operating earnings were approximately $4 billion, while net income was approximately $3 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by approximately $1 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by higher variable investment income and lower variable annuity right of reserves. Year-to-date 2021 net income increased by, roughly $400 million as compared to the first nine months of 2020. The primary drivers were higher operating earnings and net investment gains which was partially offset by derivative losses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $19.7 billion as of September 30th, 2021, up 16% compared to December 31st, 2020. Favorable operating earnings and net investment gains were partially offset by derivative losses and dividends paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 960%, as of June 30th, which is the latest public data. In summary, MetLife delivered another very strong quarter, driven by exceptional private equity returns, solid top line growth, ongoing expense discipline and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities. While earnings power of our group benefits in Latin America businesses, has been dampened by COVID-19 excess mortality. We are pleased with the momentum behind these market-leading franchises. In addition, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio remains strong and position us for further success. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Good morning, Ryan. It's John. Yes, obviously, RIS spreads, I think, overall, have been just a beneficiary of just the excellent performance here in private equity portfolio. So we saw that continue in this quarter. You're referencing, after excluding VII, that spreads have remained resilient at 93 basis points, although a 5 basis point decline from second quarter. But pretty much in line with what we what we set back 90 days ago. So you're referencing that continued alleviated levels paydown activity on the residential mortgage book, and that accelerates the income from those securities or loans that we purchased at a discount. But as we said, we believe we've seen the peak of that. And so that 5 basis point run-off was generally expected. We would expect that to continue into 4Q and kind of start to make its way down. And - but I think kind of a similar trajectory seems reasonable at this point. Eric, it's John. I'd say the short answer is, yes. If the question is, are we getting more optimistic? Yes. We are seeing what you're referencing as well. I think the supplier and buyer base is continuing to remain, I'd say, robust. And I think our team continues to work and take a third-party view and do the analytics around our portfolio. And as we've - I've talked about before, quite a bit of it is thinking about what are of interest of different buyers. It differs. Not everyone is thinking the same way or have they - buyers have different tools for creating value. And so we have to think through that and think about our situation as well and how we would optimize from our end. And I think there is a puzzle to put together there to think through how to best optimize a situation like that. As we've talked about before, we're not going to do something at any cost. But we are continuing to look at things to optimize and accelerate the release of reserves and capital appropriately. And I think that's - we're still on track with that. Good morning, Jimmy, it's John. We are well underway on our implementation work, progress continues. And I'd say, continue to be on target for implementation come 11/23. We're going to - we're in the process of evaluating transition amounts and ongoing impacts of the new guidance. And I'd say our plan is still intact, which would be kind of a mid-2022 timeframe, give or take, for disclosing and kind of sharing how to think about the transition and the insights you should draw upon this. Again, I'd remind everyone that ultimately economics, cash flow, pricing product does not change. And I think we're working well with the industry to think through how we collectively transition ourselves and kind of explain the results. And I think that's going well. So at this point, I'd say nothing has caused us to feel the need to change the time line. Yes. We've had periodic discussions with them over time. I think the rating agencies get it, and not everything is changing. So when you say ratios, not all ratios are changing. I mean our group business ratios won't change. So I think it's not all businesses. It's not all products. And I think it's - there will be certain unique circumstances that will arise in certain books. But in general, I think my assessment is that - they have a very balanced methodical way of thinking about it, and they recognize the fact that economics, cash flow and pricing of products is not changing. Good morning, Tom. I would say the answer to the first question would be would be, we're open to all blocks of business that create value for us. So I think a lot of different aspects go into value creation when it comes to that question. So I don't think it's one focus there or another. I'd say probably the only one that could probably scope out or say is less likely as LTC just given where bid spreads are at these days. But I'd say markets are evolving on all the other ones. And then you have to look at your own kind of situation to think about the benefits we get from having them in our New York domiciled entity. And so that's how we would kind of frame it. I wouldn't exclude anything outside of, let's say, LTC just given where I think pricing is, there's a pretty big divergence in what people think at this point. On the other aspect of counterparty, I would say, we come at it probably the same way that our New York domicile partners would come at it as well. So I don't know if it changes who or how we would do transaction. I think we probably take somewhat of a similar construct because at the end of the day, our situation would be a reinsurance transaction from the New York domiciled entity. And so credit risk would matter. And so structure can help with that as well. But I don't think it excludes anything per se, but that would be a strong consideration. Yes, sure. Good question, Tom, because you're right. It has shifted. I mean, quite honestly, every metric has shifted back to pre-pandemic levels. I mean maybe we're off slightly on the relationship of in-home versus kind of external care, but it's very close. It's much - it's very close to being pre-pandemic. Yes. Good morning, Humphrey. So yes, we had a very strong Q3, I'd say, a number of items went in one direction that caused us to have a very strong result in Q3. As we think about quantification of that, you could put it in the area of, call it, $20 million, $25 million, give or take. And then as I said on - in my prepared remarks, we'd expect some elevated technology investments in the in the fourth quarter. So I'll give you some data point from this sure I give you anything outside of that, but that probably should help you kind of frame for your modeling. Yes. So I would say we continue to focus on the full year that's our target to be under 12 3%. Full year obviously we've been running well below that. I mentioned that we would expect to have elevated expenses in the fourth quarter. Quite honestly, it's not much different than the trend you saw a year ago, in terms of how things transpired for most of the year, and then we saw an uptick. And so that, if we're above 12.3% in the fourth quarter by a bit that would that would not be a surprise, per se, but that's not our focus. Just using that as an example when you talk about the 12.3% what's important to us is the 12.3% for the full year. And so, that's kind of our mindset when we think about our expense ratio, and we continue to anticipate to be under that on a full year basis. And then I can take the second question you had John. This is John as well. Yes, our target is under 12.3% you said is it possible. Sure, anything is possible I guess, but ultimately, we are steadfast on being at or below 12.3%. Again, what we're trying to do is shift the mix of expenses that are within our expense base, and continue to drive savings and capacity for reinvestment. So we want to maintain being at or below 12.3% on a persistent basis every year. But at the same time, we want to continue to drive efficiencies that free up the allocation of resources to invest in the customer, invest in our processes, and to continue to drive growth for the firm. And so, at the same time, if we see headwinds in an economy, we can use that capacity as a protection for profit margin. So that's kind of our philosophy when it comes to our efficiency mindset. And I'd say nothing would kind of take us off that track at this point."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.\nJohn Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's second quarter 2021 earnings call. Before we begin, I refer you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussions are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides, which address second quarter results. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. An appendix to these slides features additional disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information, which you should also review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session that will extend to the top of the hour. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michel.\nMichel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. MetLife's outstanding financial results in the second quarter provide further evidence of the tremendous progress we're making on the pillars of our Next Horizon strategy. We're continuing to focus with the right capital allocation and investment decisions. We're continuing to simplify with exceptional expense discipline. And we're continuing to differentiate with enhancements to our platform that are helping to drive record sales. When it comes to our strategy, we've transitioned from a period of execution risk to one of additional opportunity. Net income in the second quarter was $3.4 billion, up from $68 million a year ago. The primary drivers were growth in adjusted earnings, the gain we booked on the sale of our Auto & Home business and derivative gains in the current quarter relative to derivative losses a year ago. Strong net income drove book value per share, excluding AOCI, other than FCTA growth of 8%. Adjusted earnings in the second quarter were $2.1 billion or $2.37 per share, up 186% from $0.83 per share a year ago. As in the first quarter, our investment portfolio generated exceptionally strong variable investment income. Private equity remains the key driver of VII. As you know, private equity returns are reported on a one-quarter lag, so the strong Q2 performance reflected gains from Q1. We reported private equity gains of 9. 7% in the second quarter compared with a negative 8.2% a year ago. Equity markets continued to perform well from April through June, which we anticipate being reflected in our Q3 earnings. When we unveiled our Next Horizon strategy at Investor Day in December 2019, we pointed to the scale and expertise that we have in investments as a competitive advantage for MetLife. The strategic approach we have taken on private equity is a case in point. Our decision to sell most of our $2.5 billion hedge fund portfolio and increase the allocation to private equity has provided a better match for our long-dated liabilities while creating significant value for our shareholders. This was no accident, but the latest in a series of successful investment decisions from derisking our portfolio ahead of the financial crisis to selling Peter Cooper Village Stuyvesant Town near a market top. Turning to our reporting segments. John McCallion will provide a complete overview shortly. I would like to focus on how our results show that COVID-19 is both still with us but lessening in its impact. From an underwriting perspective, we've seen a sizable improvement, but we are still experiencing excess mortality. In the quarter, the Group Life mortality ratio was 94.3%, below the 106.3% from last quarter but still above the top end of our guidance range. In Latin America, we had $66 million of COVID losses, again, below the $150 million of COVID losses from Q1, but still above normal. Yet at the same time, COVID-19's economic group is easing somewhat. At MetLife, we see this emerging in sales trends. In the US group business, sales through the first half of 2021 are 39% higher than they were in the first half of 2020. And if current trends hold, 2021 will be a record sales year. In Latin America, sales are up 55% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, Asia sales are up 42%, while EMEA sales are up 20%. By their nature, claims are a backward-looking indicator and sales are a forward-looking indicator. So while we are not out of the woods, we are starting to see a clearing in the trees ahead. The path of the pandemic is something outside of our control. But as we have demonstrated over the past 1.5 years, we are not standing still. We are moving ahead with urgency to accelerate our strategy. To further differentiate our Group Benefits business, we acquired Versant Health and immediately became the third largest vision care provider in the United States. Versant has now been part of our results for two quarters. And in Q2, it contributed 6 points of year-over-year growth in US group premiums, fees and other revenues consistent with our expectations. Year-over-year, requests for vision care proposals are up more than 20% among our national account customers. We are pleased with how our new vision care offering is performing in the marketplace and expect it to contribute meaningfully to growth going forward. Similarly, we have enhanced our pet insurance offering to make it even more attractive to customers. We now offer telehealth -- care services, rollover benefits from the prior year and family plans covering multiple paths. And what we believe is the first for the industry, we also cover preexisting conditions when an employee switches to MetLife pet insurance from another carrier as long as the condition was covered by the prior plan. More than 500 employers now offer MetLife pet insurance as a voluntary benefit to their employees, and we believe our best-in-class product will continue to make gains in this highly attractive and underpenetrated market. To strengthen our focus, we made a decision to sell our businesses in Poland and Greece to an end group. This was another promise we made at Investor Day, to continue to look at our portfolio through the lens of strategic fit and ability to achieve scale and clear our hurdle rate. Since that time, we have sold or reached agreement to sell our businesses in four markets, and we will continue to apply this disciplined approach. In early April, we also closed on the sale of our Auto & Home business to Farmers Insurance for $3.94 billion in cash. The 10-year strategic partnership we forged allows each company to focus on its core strength. Farmers 90 years of P&C underwriting and service excellence and MetLife's unrivaled distribution reach in the US group benefits space. The simplified pillar of our strategy was evident in our exceptional expense management. In the quarter, we delivered a direct expense ratio of 11.4% and we now expect to beat our 12.3% target ratio, not only for all of 2021, but for 2022 as well. We are making this commitment despite selling our Auto & Home business, which operated at a lower expense ratio than the overall enterprise. As we have said many times, we are embedding an efficiency mindset across everything we do. It is central to our ability to deliver continuous improvement. At MetLife, we no longer have expense reduction programs. We do not need them. What we have instead is a publicly disclosed direct expense ratio target that we have brought down by 200 basis points over the past five years and promise to keep there. This is how we hold ourselves accountable, and this is how investors can hold us accountable as well. Our strategic decision to sell Auto & Home contributed to a $6.5 billion cash buffer as of June 30, well above our target range. We repurchased $1.1 billion of common shares in the second quarter and another $248 million of common shares so far in the third. And yesterday, our Board approved a new $3 billion share repurchase authorization. This is on top of the $475 million we have remaining on our December 2020 authorization. We believe that investing in responsible growth, steadily increasing our common dividend and buying back common stock are all vital parts of a balanced approach to creating long-term shareholder value. COVID-19 continues to present MetLife with the opportunity and the obligation to step-up for our employees, our customers and our communities. That work is ongoing. We are in a new phase of the pandemic. The primary focus now is on vaccinating as many people as possible. Nothing will do more to prevent needless death and a potential resurgence of the lockdown measures that caused so much economic harm. As we did over 100 years ago with our visiting nurses program, MetLife has mobilized to make a positive contribution to advance public health. First and foremost, this means doing all we can to give our own employees and their families access to the vaccines. Examples from our markets include giving employees paid leave to get vaccinated, covering vaccine-related expenses such as travel and childcare and holding free vaccine clinics for employees and their families in locations as varied as Ruskin, New York and Osaka, Japan, but it also means helping to vaccinate the broader population as well. In Nagasaki, Japan, we've opened 6,500 square feet of our headquarters as a free vaccination site. MetLife Foundation has committed $500,000 to delivering vaccines to underserved communities across the U.S., and our medically trained staff, are volunteering to administer doses at vaccine sites. In closing, to perform as well as we have through a pandemic, highlights some fundamental truth about MetLife. We have an all-weather strategy that holds up well to stress. We have an investment portfolio that captures meaningful upside. We have competitive advantages that enable us to grow in the most attractive markets, and we have a relentless focus on execution. At our 2019 Investor Day, we said our Next Horizon strategy would generate tangible benefits for shareholders, a 12% to 14% adjusted ROE, $20 billion of distributable cash over five years and an additional $1 billion of operating leverage to self-fund growth. We are on track to meet every one of those commitments. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to John.\nJohn McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 2Q 2021 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our cash and capital positions. Please note in the appendix, we have also provided an, updated 25 basis point sensitivity for our U.S. long-term interest rate assumption. Starting on page three, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the second quarter. Net income in the quarter was $3.4 billion, or approximately $1.3 billion higher than adjusted earnings. This variance was primarily due to net investment gains of $1.3 billion, of which $1.1 billion relates to the sale of our Property and Casualty business to Farmers Insurance. Our investment portfolio and our hedging program continued to perform as expected. Additionally, adjusted earnings include one notable item of $66 million related to a legal reserve release. On page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items. As I previously noted, there was one notable item of $66 million in 2Q of 2021 and no notable items for the prior year period. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding the notable item was $2.30, benefiting from strong returns in our private equity portfolio, which drove most of the year-over-year variance. Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were flat year-over-year as volume growth and the Versant Health acquisition largely offset unfavorable underwriting margins. Group Life mortality improved sequentially but remains elevated in the quarter. I will discuss in more detail, shortly. Regarding non-medical health, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 73.8% in 2Q of 2021, within its annual target range of 70% to 75% but higher than the prior year quarter of 58.5%, which benefited from extremely low dental utilization and favorable disability incidents. We've seen a return to more normal utilization rates for non-medical health and expect this trend to continue. Therefore, we expect the interest-adjusted benefit ratio to remain within its annual target range for the remainder of the year. Overall, business fundamentals for group benefits remain healthy, highlighted by strong top line growth and persistency. Group Benefit sales were up 39% year-to-date, primarily due to higher general case activity. And remain on track to deliver a record sales year in 2021. Adjusted PFOs were $5.6 billion, up 29% year-over-year. Several factors contributed to the strong year-over-year growth, including a $500 million impact relating to dental premium credits and the establishment of a dental unearned premium reserve both reducing premiums in the second quarter of 2020, which collectively contributed 13 percentage points to the year-over-year growth rate. In addition, four percentage points were related to higher premiums in the current quarter from participating contracts, which can fluctuate with claim experience. After considering these factors, underlying PFO growth for Group Benefits was roughly 12% and driven by solid volume growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary and the addition of Versant Health. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, while Group Benefits reported PFO growth rates will be impacted by the dental unearned premium reserve release in Q3 and Q4, we expect the underlying PFO growth to maintain its strength and resilience for the remainder of 2021. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were $654 million, up $462 million year-over-year. The primary driver was higher variable investment income largely due to strong private equity returns. This was partially offset by less favorable underwriting margins compared to 2Q of 2020. RIS investment spreads were 224 basis points, up 199 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 98 basis points, up 13 basis points year-over-year due in part to sustained pay downs in our portfolios of residential mortgage loans and residential mortgage-backed securities, a partial recovery in real estate equities, and lower LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures, including UK longevity reinsurance, grew 8% year-over-year due to strong volume growth across the product portfolio as well as separate account investment performance. With regards to pension risk transfers, we continue to see a robust PRT pipeline. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 103% and 91% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Asia's solid volume growth also contributed to the strong performance driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 7% and 6% on a constant currency basis. Additionally, while against a weak 2Q of 2020, Asia sales were up 42% year-over-year on a constant currency basis demonstrating the resiliency in the business. Latin America adjusted earnings were down 27% and 38% on a constant currency basis primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting and unfavorable equity markets related to the Chilean encaje, which had a negative 1.5% return in the quarter versus a positive 14% in 2Q of 2020. This was partially offset by favorable investment margins. COVID-19-related claims improved sequentially. The impact on Latin America's second quarter adjusted earnings was approximately $66 million after tax. While Latin America's bottom line has been dampened by the elevated COVID-19-related claims, the underlying fundamentals of the business remain robust as evidenced by strong sales and persistency throughout the region. Latin America adjusted PFOs were up 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 55% driven by solid growth in all markets. EMEA adjusted earnings were down 19% and 23% on a constant currency basis primarily driven by higher COVID-19-related claims in the current period compared to low utilization in the prior year period. Solid volume growth was a partial offset. The current quarter has also benefited from a favorable refinement to an unearned premium reserve positively impacting adjusted PFOs and adjusted earnings by approximately $15 million after tax. In addition, Poland and Greece contribute roughly 10% to run rate earnings that will be reported in divested businesses beginning in the third quarter. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 8% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 20% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher credit life sales in Turkey and solid growth in UK Employee Benefits. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up $516 million year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by strong private equity returns. In addition, Life underwriting margins were favorable. The life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 47.1%, lower than the prior year quarter of 59.1% and below our annual target range of 50% to 55%. Corporate & Other adjusted loss, excluding the favorable notable item of $66 million related to a legal reserve release was $126 million. This result compared favorably to the adjusted loss of $289 million in 2Q of 2020 due to higher net investment income, lower expenses and lower preferred stock dividends. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 21.6% and within our 2021 guidance range of 20% to 22%. Now I will provide more detail on Group Benefits mortality results on Page 5. The Group Life mortality ratio was 94.3% in the second quarter of 2021, which is above our annual target range of 85% to 90%. COVID reported claims in 2Q of 2021 were roughly 4.5 percentage points, which reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $75 million after tax. Additionally, the quarter included a higher level of life claims above $2.5 million and an additional level of excess mortality that appears to be COVID related. These collectively impacted the ratio by an additional 2.7 percentage points or $40 million after-tax. There were approximately 50,000 COVID-19-related deaths in the US in the second quarter of 2021. While still elevated, total deaths have moderated versus the prior year and sequential quarters. Looking ahead, we expect COVID-19-related deaths and group benefits to continue to trend lower. Now let's turn to Page 6. This chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income over the last five quarters, including approximately $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2021. This very strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio, which had a 9.7% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equities are generally accounted for on a one-quarter lag. Our second quarter results are essentially in line with PE industry benchmarks. While all private equity asset classes performed well in the quarter, our venture capital funds, which account for roughly 22% of our PE account balance of $11.3 billion, were the strongest performer across subsectors with a roughly 19% quarterly return. On Page 7, second quarter VII of $950 million post tax is shown by segment. The attribution of VII by business is based on the quarterly returns for each segment's individual portfolio. As we have previously noted, RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia, generally account for approximately 90% or more of the total VII and are split roughly one-third each, although it can vary from quarter-to-quarter. VII results in 2Q of '21 were more heavily weighted towards RIS and MetLife Holdings, as Asia's private equity portfolio is less mature and has a smaller proportion of the venture capital funds that I referenced earlier. Turning to Page 8. This chart shows our direct expense ratio over the prior five quarters and full year 2020, including 11.4% in the second quarter of '21. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. In 2Q of '21, our favorable direct expense ratio benefited from solid topline growth and ongoing expense discipline, as well as lower employee-related benefits in the quarter. We expect the direct expense ratio for the remainder of 2021 to be elevated compared to the first half of 2021, due to timing of investments and seasonality. But as Michel noted, we expect full year '21 and '22 direct expense ratio to beat our 12.3% guidance. Now, I'll discuss our cash and capital position on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6.5 billion at June 30, which is up from $3.8 billion at March 31 and well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential increase in cash at the holding companies was primarily due to the proceeds received from our P&C sale to Farmers Insurance of $3.9 billion. In addition, HoldCo cash includes the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, a $500 million redemption of preferred stock, share repurchases of $1.1 share repurchases of $1.1 billion, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our US companies, preliminary second quarter year-to-date 2021 statutory operating earnings were approximately $2.8 billion, while net income was approximately $1.6 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by approximately $1.2 billion year-over-year, driven by lower variable annuity rider reserves and an increase in investment margin. Year-to-date 2021 net income decreased by $286 million, as compared to the first half of 2020. The primary drivers were derivative losses, mostly offset by increases in operating earnings and net investment gains in the current six-month period, compared to large derivative gains in the prior year six-month period. We estimate that our total US statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.5 billion as of June 30, 2021, up 9% compared to December 31, 2020, when excluding our P&C business sold to farmers. Favorable operating earnings and net investment gains were partially offset by derivative losses and dividends paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 873% as of March 31, which is the latest public data. The sequential decline in the Japan SMR from 967% at December 31st reflects seasonal dividends and the rise in US interest rates in the quarter ending March 31st. In summary, MetLife delivered another strong quarter driven by exceptional private equity returns, good business fundamentals, ongoing expense discipline, and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities. While higher mortality due to COVID-19 has masked the earnings power of Group Benefits in Latin America, the strength of these franchises remain healthy and intact. In addition, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are strong, resilient and position us for success. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nErik Bass: Hi, thank you. I was hoping you could provide some more details on your expense ratio outlook and the drivers of the improved guidance there? And how are you thinking about expenses in the second half of 2021 and the longer term target level for the expense ratio?\nJohn McCallion: Good morning Eric. So, I'll just start out by saying we're very pleased with the result and the execution by everyone in the firm. And I think as Michel said in his opening remarks, this has really become part of our culture and it's a cultural shift that we've made, our efficiency mindset is built into our strategy. It's built into our everyday activities, and I think the results are -- kind of speak for themselves. As I mentioned, in this quarter, there's a few timing-related items. So, we do see an uptick in expenses in the second half of the year relative to the first half. We did have some benefit from some employee-related costs, particularly as they relate to the impact of how markets move. And so that came -- that was a benefit this quarter. And then there's seasonality with regards to preferred stock dividends. So, the second and the fourth quarter typically are low quarters for those dividends. As we look to the second half of this year, directionally speaking, we would see -- just typically do see seasonally higher expenses in the second half. Some of that's related, obviously, to our group business and the enrollment activities we go through. And oftentimes, too, there's been some delays just as a result of a number of activities going on in some of the investments. So, we do see kind of an uptick. Having said that, one of the things that we both pointed out is our expectation, which is different than where we were on our outlook call in February, is to now be under our 12.3% guidance despite the removal of our Property & Casualty business, which had a lower expense ratio. So, all-in-all, I think our efficiency mindset just built into the culture, it's all working. And we expect that to continue as we look forward. I think I would probably stop there on your last question and probably leave that for another day.\nErik Bass: Got it. Appreciate that. And then secondly, can you expand a bit on the Group Life mortality results given vaccination trends? Are you seeing more of the COVID impact shifting to group? I think as you mentioned, the benefits ratio, even taking out the $75 million was still at the high end of the target range. So, do you think these other excess claims relate directly to the pandemic, but just more recorded as COVID deaths? Or are you seeing any increase in non-COVID mortality?\nRamy Tadros: Very good morning Erik, it's Ramy here. So let me just start by giving you a bit more color on the results. And I'll essentially just give you a bit of a walk from the headline number of 94.3% in terms of the major drivers of that. So the first is COVID-related \u2013 COVID deaths in the quarter. That's the $50,000 population -- 50,000 population death number impacting our portfolio. And that's worth about 4.5 points, as John pointed out. There's another piece in the quarter, which is that from time to time, we do experience higher volume of claims with larger face amounts, which does impact our mortality ratio. This is non-COVID related, and that was about \u2013 worth about a 0.1 to our loss ratio in this quarter. And then the third piece of this is when we look at our claims data, we did see an increase in certain death codes, which are highly correlated to COVID. So, while the cause of death for those claims is not explicitly stated as COVID, the excess mortality does appear to be COVID related, and that was worth another 1.7% on our ratio. So, if I think about the quarter and looking forward, there are probably 2 headlines I'd leave you with. One is that, if you strip out those 3 factors, our loss ratio is very close to the midpoint of our range. And the second headline is that, we have seen significant declines in deaths in Q2 versus Q1. We've also seen sequential declines in deaths month-on-month continuing into July. So, despite the current uncertainty with the Delta variant, we're also encouraged by the increase in the pace of vaccination. We're encouraged by the actions undertaken by many large employers, which are impacting the vaccination rates for that insured population. So, sitting here in August on a go-forward basis, we do think that the impact of the pandemic will gradually subside and you should expect from a run rate perspective, our loss ratio to return back to pre-pandemic levels.\nErik Bass: Great. Thank you. Appreciate the color.\nOperator: And our next question is from Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. \nTom Gallagher: Thanks. John, just a question on the comment you made on base spreads in RIS, which came back nicely this quarter. You highlighted the mortgage prepays. How should we think about that from a timing standpoint? Because tell me, if I'm thinking about this right. It definitely creates near-term gains. And I presume with rates remaining low, that's going to remain strong. So probably the base spread in that business will remain strong, assuming mortgage prepaid remain high. But then there's sort of the back-end question, which is as we kind of go -- as this levels off and diminishes then there's the reinvestment pressure that kind of emerges. So would you ultimately expect this to be a negative for base spreads? And if so, when would we likely see that?\nMichel Khalaf: Good morning, Tom. So, as you said, we have had a uptick there in the spreads ex-VII. And as I mentioned in my remarks, a plus 13% year-over-year and then you see a plus 10 sequentially. So, it's a number of factors, right? We got lower LIBOR year-over-year. You have a partial recovery in real estate equity returns we saw -- we've had very good, strong new business spreads as particularly -- or I should say, in RIS there. And then as you said, the last thing is we've seen elevated levels of the residential mortgage paydown activity. I would use the word paydown just to not confuse that with prepayment fees that we categorize in VII. And so what that really is, is that that acceleration of the recognition of income on those securities that were purchased at a discount previously. So we do think this will stay elevated. I think it's a combination of low rates coupled with the home price appreciation that we've seen in a lot of markets. So that has spurred others. And I think also, if you think of it in combination with more remote work opportunities, there's been probably some movement in terms of the residential housing market. So we do see that continuing particularly although they've probably peaked, the time between when action occurs and when it hits our securities or mortgage loans is usually a two to five month lag. So we think the second half of the year, we'll still see an elevated level, maybe not to this level that we saw in the second quarter. We expect it to probably be somewhat less than that. But -- so that's kind of our expectation. As you look forward, look, this is all just part of our broader portfolio. And I wouldn't say this in and of itself is going to change the trajectory. I think what it's done is it's changed the trajectory upwards. We don't consider that to be a long-term trend, probably remains a trend for the remainder of this year but probably goes back to more baseline run rate in 2022.\nTom Gallagher: That makes sense. Thanks. And then just a follow-up. Non-Japan Asia sales declined a lot sequentially. Any color on what regions drove that and what happened there?\nMichel Khalaf: Yeah, Tom. So certainly, we have to think about sequential in the context of overall sales environment in which we're in. So if I take a step back, if you don't mind me and think about this in the overall Asia context, Overall, Asia, we did well this quarter, 42% up year-over-year, 71% in Japan, 11% in Asia ex-Japan, still positive in Asia ex-Japan as well. And this is despite COVID spurts in many of our markets. And if you take the first half, all in total, we have a 25% year-over-year collectively for the first half. And so there are a number of reasons which certainly drove that strong performance. On a sequential basis -- and if you look at Japan, and I'll come to other Asia very quickly. And if you look at the sequentially both on the life side and as well as the A&H sales, we were up, right? And that speaks to the resilience of our face-to-face channels in our markets in Japan, in particular. And the pressure on a sequential basis came in from the annuities because the banker channel is certainly -- they have a March end. And so therefore, they're much stronger on the banker side and that's what the annuity shows drop sequentially. On other Asia, if you think about it, this is -- COVID is playing out significantly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. There's a fair amount of pressure in all these markets. And we're very much a face-to-face sales business, and that certainly is weighing in despite, by the way, all our efforts in terms of strong execution, our success of our new products and certainly, our digitization efforts are paying off as well. Now as I said, this COVID uncertainty is continuing on. And a vast majority of our market significantly lagged the US, say, for example, in terms of vaccination rate. And right now, because of the resurgence of COVID in some of our markets, social distancing measures are being reintroduced, right? So while we did well year-over-year in other Asia, sequentially, we've been impacted. And both in Japan and other Asia, we expect to see Q3 sales to be sequentially flat to Q2 as well. But considering everything at this point, if you think about our guidance for the full year, we expect to be on track to meet the double-digit guidance that we provided in February. I hope that helps.\nTom Gallagher: That does. Thank you.\nOperator: And next, we go to the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi. Good morning. First, I just had a question on MetLife Holdings. If you look at earnings in the business, they've been pretty high the last couple of quarters. And I think this quarter you had alternative investment income that helped and also lower life mortality. But I'm wondering to what extent long-term care was a tailwind and just what you're seeing in terms of claim submission in the LTC business. Has that gotten back to normal as the \u2013 versus what it was last year?\nJohn McCallion: Good morning, Jimmy, it's John. Yes. So I'll just break it up. In the Life side, as you saw in our interest-adjusted benefit ratio, we had a strong result really for this block of business, minimal, actually de minimis COVID impact this quarter. So it actually, I would say, declined faster. The impact declined faster than we had probably expected. But I think a number of factors that you can probably come to probably makes that \u2013 makes sense, whether it's the average age, and the percent of vaccinations at the older age, things like that. On the LTC side metrics, there was \u2013 it was really \u2013 there was no material positive from LTC. It was in line with expectations. What we're seeing is that \u2013 and I'd say, in line with, I'll say, pre-pandemic expectations. And so what we're seeing is metrics and results really trending back towards those pre-COVID levels. New claims are, I'd say, marginally below trend, but all indications are showing that we'll be back to trend very soon. The only metric that's lagging \u2013 but again, I will say, trending back to pre-pandemic is the relationship of home care versus nursing home claims. So it's still probably a little elevated in the home care side, but that's \u2013 it's trending down. It's trending back to the pre-pandemic ratios.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then on Group Life, how are you thinking \u2013 it doesn't seem like anybody sort of assumed COVID in their pricing this year and obviously, not all of the business prices \u2013 re-prices each year. But how are you thinking about renewals in the Group Life side? If we still -- if the pandemic is still ongoing, do you think you'll try to get higher prices in part of the book? Or would you just have to -- would the market not bear that given that most companies are not really making many adjustments? And should we assume margins will remain weak until the pandemic is done?\nMichel Khalaf: Hi, Jimmy. Look, when we price our business, be it new business and/or renewals, we take a whole number of factors into account. Many of them are case specific factors. But clearly, the outlook, both near-term and medium-term for mortality is a component of that. So as the pandemic unfolded, we certainly did take into account with respect to near-term mortality in our pricing. And again, it does vary by case, and it depends on the length of the guarantee period and the size of the case and a number of other factors. But certainly, that has been taken into account as we look to renew business or price for new business. The other point I would just point you to here as you think about our business in particular and our SKU towards the larger end of the market, is we have a very consistent track record over many, many years of taking appropriate renewal actions, while maintaining very high persistency on that book to -- from the mid to the high 90s. So that's another factor that I would point you to as well.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question is from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.\nRyan Krueger: Hi, good morning. Could you provide some additional detail on non-medical health trends you saw in the quarter, I guess, particularly on dental utilization and severity and how you'd expect that to trend towards -- throughout the rest of the year?\nRamy Tadros: Hi, Ryan, it's Ramy here again. I think the -- overhead line that I'll leave you with for both dental and disability is that we are seeing our results normalize back to pre-pandemic levels. And so specifically to your question on dental, if you look at the entirety of the first half, the overall results certainly reflects that return to pre-pandemic utilization levels, albeit there was some, if you will, Q1 versus Q2 dynamics with respect to the utilization of certain services that others have spoken about, and we've seen that to be pretty consistent with our book. But in aggregate, the first half is trending towards the pre-pandemic utilization level. And we're certainly seeing that normalization continue into July as we look at it. So in aggregate, if you want to take a really big step back and look at our non-medical health ratio, we expect that for the full year to be close to the midpoint of our guidance. And that's inclusive clearly of the various products that we have in there.\nRyan Krueger: Thanks. And then for LATAM COVID impact, can you give us a sense of how those trended throughout the quarter? And did they continue to decline -- did they decline throughout the quarter and into July?\nEric Clurfain: Yes. Ryan, this is Eric. So with regards to COVID, we noticed a significant sequential improvement this quarter with month-to-month positive trend. But as you know, the delta variant and the slow pace of vaccination, obviously, creates some uncertainty moving forward. Nevertheless, overall, we expect the second half of the year to be better than the first half. Now as John referenced, this quarter has also highlighted again the strength of our business fundamentals and our franchise across the region. And we expect overall revenues to continue to grow, supported by a strong persistency and recovery in sales. We've had good momentum in sales we created since the beginning of this year. We reported $222 million for the quarter, back in line with the levels of pre-pandemic. And this really demonstrates the strength, diversity and resiliency of our distribution channel and product mix. Our persistency, as I mentioned earlier, has been also very resilient and above expectations, and that's true across the region. So, in summary, from an outlook perspective, for the year remains unchanged, and we expect 2022 earnings to return to the normal run rate levels once the pandemic recedes.\nRyan Krueger: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Mike Ward with UBS. Please go ahead.\nMike Ward: Thanks. Good morning. So I think the buybacks in the quarter and the new authorization are pretty well received. I'm just curious, should we go forward with the assumption, absent any other opportunities for deployment? Should we expect to continue at this $1 billion or $1 billion-plus buyback rate quarterly?\nMichel Khalaf: Yes. Hi, Mike. Thank you for the question. So let me start by saying that we continue to be comfortable with the $3 billion to $4 billion buffer and over time, we expect to return to these levels. We're very deliberate and disciplined in how we deploy capital. One of our highest priorities on how we use capital is to fund responsible growth. And we continue to deploy capital in support of organic growth and attractive IRRs and payback periods. We're also opportunistic when it comes to M&A. Any M&A transaction must be supported strategically. We look forward add to the top line, clearly a number of important financial metrics, including accretion. So -- but if we're not able to deploy excess capital to fund business growth, then we have a commitment to return it to shareholders. And I think that our recent buyback activity should give you a sense of our pacing and the fact that our Board has just issued a new authorization, should also provide you a sense of its sustainability. So I hope this helps.\nMike Ward: It does. Thanks. And then, I was just wondering if you might be able to comment on the bid-ask spread in terms of any further derisking, perhaps, in areas like Holdings or RIS. And I don't want to downplay the efforts and success you've had so far, but it just seems like M&A in this industry continues to pick up, specifically in some capital intensive areas. And it feels like that's going to continue. Just trying to gauge your willingness or ability to further derisk anywhere. And given your excess capital position, is it sort of within the realm of possibility that you could utilize any of that within anything for further derisking?\nJohn McCallion: Hey. Good morning, Mike, it's John. So, look, I think the trend that you're referencing, our belief is the trend is going to continue. It's not going anywhere. I don't think that changes what -- how we're addressing and focusing on MetLife Holdings. It, as you said, has performed very well. Our focus is on optimization, whether a diversified block with a number of natural offsets, the team has done a great job managing it. But at the same time, as I said, the team's mandate is to kind of take a third-party view, an external view and make sure that we're continuing to look at different ways to be prepared for the opportunity in what I'd say is a new market within the industry, which is this kind of block acquisition or transfer or risk transfer. So nothing's changed on our end. In terms of bid ask, I don't know if I've seen any, I'll say, clear signs that it's changed at this point. But this is a dynamic, I'd say, area right now, and our focus is to be ready, if it does change. So\nMike Ward: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Please go ahead. \nTracy Benguigui: Thank you. Good morning. Some of my questions were already asked, so I only have one. When looking at your group benefit since you operate in a larger segment, I'm wondering if you could contextualize the life cycle of sales. Would it take longer as we anticipate a rebound when the economy reopens?\nMichel Khalaf: Yes. I think there are a few things I'd point you to. We have seen -- from a life cycle perspective, we've seen less of an impact on the large employers during the pandemic. You see we're on track for a record year in terms of sales in 2021. And a lot of that activity happened in 2020, if you think about this in terms of when these cases came to market and our dialogue with the employers. So from that perspective, we have not seen a real disruption, and we're very, very pleased with our sales results the year. And as John and Michel referenced, we're on track for a record year in group sales and our national account segment is an important driver of that. And so is our momentum in voluntary, where we're less reliant on face-to-face distribution given the digital capabilities that we have and that has continued to drive our sales momentum there. The last thing I would just say is if you just really take a big step back, think about the impact that COVID had on the environment. We've seen a significant increase in awareness on the part of employees for needs of protection for obvious reasons. But we've also seen employers be really, really focused on benefits as a key lever in terms of engaging with their talent. So we're seeing very high receptivity and more strategic dialogue, I would say, with some of the large employers on how to utilize those benefits to attract, retain and motivate talent.\nTracy Benguigui: Yes, I fully recognize that. I was just thinking about further upside. And I've heard you speak at another event, where you were saying basically that folks working from home care a little bit more about some of these voluntary offerings as they're thinking about their families. So fully recognized where you were in the pandemic and just thinking about the possibility of future sales and when that would flow through.\nMichel Khalaf: Yes. I mean those were -- the fundamental trends is the employers kind of perspective on the benefit, as you just described. And they're more keen to engage with their employees -- the employees' awareness of the need for protection. So, those two trends, I think, have clearly kind of emerged in the pandemic and they're going to drive momentum going forward. With respect to the sales numbers, I would also just remind you that the sales in the jumbo market can be lumpy from year to year. So, you saw a dip in 2020. You saw a spike in 2021. So, some of those can be lumpy year-over-year from a jumbo perspective. But the secular trends on employer and employee I think we're seeing and we're seeing providing overall tailwinds for our business here.\nTracy Benguigui: Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Suneet Kamath with Citi. Please go ahead.\nSuneet Kamath: Thanks. Good morning. Just in terms of EMEA, can you give us a sense, are there other countries that may not be kind of at scale kind of like, I think, Greece and Poland? And can you give us some color in terms of like the M&A environment in EMEA as it relates to interest from third parties and just consolidating the European insurance market?\nMichel Khalaf: Yes. Hi Suneet, this is Michel. So, we're -- first of all, I would say we're happy with our EMEA business. As I sort of referenced before, it's predominantly a protection business with high free cash flow generation. So, it plays a role in terms of -- and how it contributes to the enterprise. Since the -- acquisition, we've reduced our footprint globally in terms of the markets that we're in. We were in 66 markets, we're now in 40. And so this sort of -- the process that we are committed to, which is to continue to look at our businesses through the lens of strategic fit in terms of whether they clear our risk-adjusted hurdle rate. Whether we see a path to them achieving that and achieving scale, I think that applies sort of across the board, and I expect us to continue to look at our portfolio through that lens. But nothing in particular that I would point to in terms of EMEA. I think if you think about Poland and Greece, those were two businesses that sat outside of our European super carrier. As you know, we have an efficient operating model in EMEA, especially in Europe, where we -- all of our businesses are branches of our Irish entity. Poland and Greece were both subsidiaries that sat outside of that. So, in a way, this transaction helps us simplify the region and the business operationally. But I think in terms of the market environment, I mean we continue to see sort of -- we were not the first company to divest from Poland. There was -- Aviva was -- had a transaction prior to that. So, there continues to be interest by mainly European players in terms of opportunities in those markets. That's what I would sort of point to there.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay, got it. And then just last one for John, on free cash flow. It seems based on the commentary in the buyback press release that maybe free cash flow in 2020 was below your 65% to 75% target. So, just wanted to see, if that was a fair characterization. And then are we still thinking about 65% to 75% as kind of the range that you guys would like to be in kind of going forward?\nJohn McCallion: Yes. I mean the quick answer is no. It was -- I don't think -- that wasn't our intention, if that was the takeaway, but it was definitely within the 65% to 75%, if not higher. And yes, I think the go-forward is the range is intact.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. We will now turn the conference, back over to Chairman, Michel Khalaf for final comments. Please go ahead.\nMichel Khalaf: Thank you, operator. As many of you prepared to spend time with family and loved ones this summer, I want to wish everyone well. I also want to express my thanks to our employees who have done so much to help MetLife live our purpose, to our customers who trust us to safeguard their financial future and to our shareholders who provide us with the capital to keep this great company forging ahead. Thank you again, and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, your conference is available for digitized replay after 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time today through August 12 at midnight.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Michel Khalaf",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. MetLife's outstanding financial results in the second quarter provide further evidence of the tremendous progress we're making on the pillars of our Next Horizon strategy. We're continuing to focus with the right capital allocation and investment decisions. We're continuing to simplify with exceptional expense discipline. And we're continuing to differentiate with enhancements to our platform that are helping to drive record sales. When it comes to our strategy, we've transitioned from a period of execution risk to one of additional opportunity. Net income in the second quarter was $3.4 billion, up from $68 million a year ago. The primary drivers were growth in adjusted earnings, the gain we booked on the sale of our Auto & Home business and derivative gains in the current quarter relative to derivative losses a year ago. Strong net income drove book value per share, excluding AOCI, other than FCTA growth of 8%. Adjusted earnings in the second quarter were $2.1 billion or $2.37 per share, up 186% from $0.83 per share a year ago. As in the first quarter, our investment portfolio generated exceptionally strong variable investment income. Private equity remains the key driver of VII. As you know, private equity returns are reported on a one-quarter lag, so the strong Q2 performance reflected gains from Q1. We reported private equity gains of 9. 7% in the second quarter compared with a negative 8.2% a year ago. Equity markets continued to perform well from April through June, which we anticipate being reflected in our Q3 earnings. When we unveiled our Next Horizon strategy at Investor Day in December 2019, we pointed to the scale and expertise that we have in investments as a competitive advantage for MetLife. The strategic approach we have taken on private equity is a case in point. Our decision to sell most of our $2.5 billion hedge fund portfolio and increase the allocation to private equity has provided a better match for our long-dated liabilities while creating significant value for our shareholders. This was no accident, but the latest in a series of successful investment decisions from derisking our portfolio ahead of the financial crisis to selling Peter Cooper Village Stuyvesant Town near a market top. Turning to our reporting segments. John McCallion will provide a complete overview shortly. I would like to focus on how our results show that COVID-19 is both still with us but lessening in its impact. From an underwriting perspective, we've seen a sizable improvement, but we are still experiencing excess mortality. In the quarter, the Group Life mortality ratio was 94.3%, below the 106.3% from last quarter but still above the top end of our guidance range. In Latin America, we had $66 million of COVID losses, again, below the $150 million of COVID losses from Q1, but still above normal. Yet at the same time, COVID-19's economic group is easing somewhat. At MetLife, we see this emerging in sales trends. In the US group business, sales through the first half of 2021 are 39% higher than they were in the first half of 2020. And if current trends hold, 2021 will be a record sales year. In Latin America, sales are up 55% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, Asia sales are up 42%, while EMEA sales are up 20%. By their nature, claims are a backward-looking indicator and sales are a forward-looking indicator. So while we are not out of the woods, we are starting to see a clearing in the trees ahead. The path of the pandemic is something outside of our control. But as we have demonstrated over the past 1.5 years, we are not standing still. We are moving ahead with urgency to accelerate our strategy. To further differentiate our Group Benefits business, we acquired Versant Health and immediately became the third largest vision care provider in the United States. Versant has now been part of our results for two quarters. And in Q2, it contributed 6 points of year-over-year growth in US group premiums, fees and other revenues consistent with our expectations. Year-over-year, requests for vision care proposals are up more than 20% among our national account customers. We are pleased with how our new vision care offering is performing in the marketplace and expect it to contribute meaningfully to growth going forward. Similarly, we have enhanced our pet insurance offering to make it even more attractive to customers. We now offer telehealth -- care services, rollover benefits from the prior year and family plans covering multiple paths. And what we believe is the first for the industry, we also cover preexisting conditions when an employee switches to MetLife pet insurance from another carrier as long as the condition was covered by the prior plan. More than 500 employers now offer MetLife pet insurance as a voluntary benefit to their employees, and we believe our best-in-class product will continue to make gains in this highly attractive and underpenetrated market. To strengthen our focus, we made a decision to sell our businesses in Poland and Greece to an end group. This was another promise we made at Investor Day, to continue to look at our portfolio through the lens of strategic fit and ability to achieve scale and clear our hurdle rate. Since that time, we have sold or reached agreement to sell our businesses in four markets, and we will continue to apply this disciplined approach. In early April, we also closed on the sale of our Auto & Home business to Farmers Insurance for $3.94 billion in cash. The 10-year strategic partnership we forged allows each company to focus on its core strength. Farmers 90 years of P&C underwriting and service excellence and MetLife's unrivaled distribution reach in the US group benefits space. The simplified pillar of our strategy was evident in our exceptional expense management. In the quarter, we delivered a direct expense ratio of 11.4% and we now expect to beat our 12.3% target ratio, not only for all of 2021, but for 2022 as well. We are making this commitment despite selling our Auto & Home business, which operated at a lower expense ratio than the overall enterprise. As we have said many times, we are embedding an efficiency mindset across everything we do. It is central to our ability to deliver continuous improvement. At MetLife, we no longer have expense reduction programs. We do not need them. What we have instead is a publicly disclosed direct expense ratio target that we have brought down by 200 basis points over the past five years and promise to keep there. This is how we hold ourselves accountable, and this is how investors can hold us accountable as well. Our strategic decision to sell Auto & Home contributed to a $6.5 billion cash buffer as of June 30, well above our target range. We repurchased $1.1 billion of common shares in the second quarter and another $248 million of common shares so far in the third. And yesterday, our Board approved a new $3 billion share repurchase authorization. This is on top of the $475 million we have remaining on our December 2020 authorization. We believe that investing in responsible growth, steadily increasing our common dividend and buying back common stock are all vital parts of a balanced approach to creating long-term shareholder value. COVID-19 continues to present MetLife with the opportunity and the obligation to step-up for our employees, our customers and our communities. That work is ongoing. We are in a new phase of the pandemic. The primary focus now is on vaccinating as many people as possible. Nothing will do more to prevent needless death and a potential resurgence of the lockdown measures that caused so much economic harm. As we did over 100 years ago with our visiting nurses program, MetLife has mobilized to make a positive contribution to advance public health. First and foremost, this means doing all we can to give our own employees and their families access to the vaccines. Examples from our markets include giving employees paid leave to get vaccinated, covering vaccine-related expenses such as travel and childcare and holding free vaccine clinics for employees and their families in locations as varied as Ruskin, New York and Osaka, Japan, but it also means helping to vaccinate the broader population as well. In Nagasaki, Japan, we've opened 6,500 square feet of our headquarters as a free vaccination site. MetLife Foundation has committed $500,000 to delivering vaccines to underserved communities across the U.S., and our medically trained staff, are volunteering to administer doses at vaccine sites. In closing, to perform as well as we have through a pandemic, highlights some fundamental truth about MetLife. We have an all-weather strategy that holds up well to stress. We have an investment portfolio that captures meaningful upside. We have competitive advantages that enable us to grow in the most attractive markets, and we have a relentless focus on execution. At our 2019 Investor Day, we said our Next Horizon strategy would generate tangible benefits for shareholders, a 12% to 14% adjusted ROE, $20 billion of distributable cash over five years and an additional $1 billion of operating leverage to self-fund growth. We are on track to meet every one of those commitments. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to John. Good morning, Tom. So, as you said, we have had a uptick there in the spreads ex-VII. And as I mentioned in my remarks, a plus 13% year-over-year and then you see a plus 10 sequentially. So, it's a number of factors, right? We got lower LIBOR year-over-year. You have a partial recovery in real estate equity returns we saw -- we've had very good, strong new business spreads as particularly -- or I should say, in RIS there. And then as you said, the last thing is we've seen elevated levels of the residential mortgage paydown activity. I would use the word paydown just to not confuse that with prepayment fees that we categorize in VII. And so what that really is, is that that acceleration of the recognition of income on those securities that were purchased at a discount previously. So we do think this will stay elevated. I think it's a combination of low rates coupled with the home price appreciation that we've seen in a lot of markets. So that has spurred others. And I think also, if you think of it in combination with more remote work opportunities, there's been probably some movement in terms of the residential housing market. So we do see that continuing particularly although they've probably peaked, the time between when action occurs and when it hits our securities or mortgage loans is usually a two to five month lag. So we think the second half of the year, we'll still see an elevated level, maybe not to this level that we saw in the second quarter. We expect it to probably be somewhat less than that. But -- so that's kind of our expectation. As you look forward, look, this is all just part of our broader portfolio. And I wouldn't say this in and of itself is going to change the trajectory. I think what it's done is it's changed the trajectory upwards. We don't consider that to be a long-term trend, probably remains a trend for the remainder of this year but probably goes back to more baseline run rate in 2022. Yeah, Tom. So certainly, we have to think about sequential in the context of overall sales environment in which we're in. So if I take a step back, if you don't mind me and think about this in the overall Asia context, Overall, Asia, we did well this quarter, 42% up year-over-year, 71% in Japan, 11% in Asia ex-Japan, still positive in Asia ex-Japan as well. And this is despite COVID spurts in many of our markets. And if you take the first half, all in total, we have a 25% year-over-year collectively for the first half. And so there are a number of reasons which certainly drove that strong performance. On a sequential basis -- and if you look at Japan, and I'll come to other Asia very quickly. And if you look at the sequentially both on the life side and as well as the A&H sales, we were up, right? And that speaks to the resilience of our face-to-face channels in our markets in Japan, in particular. And the pressure on a sequential basis came in from the annuities because the banker channel is certainly -- they have a March end. And so therefore, they're much stronger on the banker side and that's what the annuity shows drop sequentially. On other Asia, if you think about it, this is -- COVID is playing out significantly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. There's a fair amount of pressure in all these markets. And we're very much a face-to-face sales business, and that certainly is weighing in despite, by the way, all our efforts in terms of strong execution, our success of our new products and certainly, our digitization efforts are paying off as well. Now as I said, this COVID uncertainty is continuing on. And a vast majority of our market significantly lagged the US, say, for example, in terms of vaccination rate. And right now, because of the resurgence of COVID in some of our markets, social distancing measures are being reintroduced, right? So while we did well year-over-year in other Asia, sequentially, we've been impacted. And both in Japan and other Asia, we expect to see Q3 sales to be sequentially flat to Q2 as well. But considering everything at this point, if you think about our guidance for the full year, we expect to be on track to meet the double-digit guidance that we provided in February. I hope that helps. Hi, Jimmy. Look, when we price our business, be it new business and/or renewals, we take a whole number of factors into account. Many of them are case specific factors. But clearly, the outlook, both near-term and medium-term for mortality is a component of that. So as the pandemic unfolded, we certainly did take into account with respect to near-term mortality in our pricing. And again, it does vary by case, and it depends on the length of the guarantee period and the size of the case and a number of other factors. But certainly, that has been taken into account as we look to renew business or price for new business. The other point I would just point you to here as you think about our business in particular and our SKU towards the larger end of the market, is we have a very consistent track record over many, many years of taking appropriate renewal actions, while maintaining very high persistency on that book to -- from the mid to the high 90s. So that's another factor that I would point you to as well. Yes. Hi, Mike. Thank you for the question. So let me start by saying that we continue to be comfortable with the $3 billion to $4 billion buffer and over time, we expect to return to these levels. We're very deliberate and disciplined in how we deploy capital. One of our highest priorities on how we use capital is to fund responsible growth. And we continue to deploy capital in support of organic growth and attractive IRRs and payback periods. We're also opportunistic when it comes to M&A. Any M&A transaction must be supported strategically. We look forward add to the top line, clearly a number of important financial metrics, including accretion. So -- but if we're not able to deploy excess capital to fund business growth, then we have a commitment to return it to shareholders. And I think that our recent buyback activity should give you a sense of our pacing and the fact that our Board has just issued a new authorization, should also provide you a sense of its sustainability. So I hope this helps. Yes. I think there are a few things I'd point you to. We have seen -- from a life cycle perspective, we've seen less of an impact on the large employers during the pandemic. You see we're on track for a record year in terms of sales in 2021. And a lot of that activity happened in 2020, if you think about this in terms of when these cases came to market and our dialogue with the employers. So from that perspective, we have not seen a real disruption, and we're very, very pleased with our sales results the year. And as John and Michel referenced, we're on track for a record year in group sales and our national account segment is an important driver of that. And so is our momentum in voluntary, where we're less reliant on face-to-face distribution given the digital capabilities that we have and that has continued to drive our sales momentum there. The last thing I would just say is if you just really take a big step back, think about the impact that COVID had on the environment. We've seen a significant increase in awareness on the part of employees for needs of protection for obvious reasons. But we've also seen employers be really, really focused on benefits as a key lever in terms of engaging with their talent. So we're seeing very high receptivity and more strategic dialogue, I would say, with some of the large employers on how to utilize those benefits to attract, retain and motivate talent. Yes. I mean those were -- the fundamental trends is the employers kind of perspective on the benefit, as you just described. And they're more keen to engage with their employees -- the employees' awareness of the need for protection. So, those two trends, I think, have clearly kind of emerged in the pandemic and they're going to drive momentum going forward. With respect to the sales numbers, I would also just remind you that the sales in the jumbo market can be lumpy from year to year. So, you saw a dip in 2020. You saw a spike in 2021. So, some of those can be lumpy year-over-year from a jumbo perspective. But the secular trends on employer and employee I think we're seeing and we're seeing providing overall tailwinds for our business here. Yes. Hi Suneet, this is Michel. So, we're -- first of all, I would say we're happy with our EMEA business. As I sort of referenced before, it's predominantly a protection business with high free cash flow generation. So, it plays a role in terms of -- and how it contributes to the enterprise. Since the -- acquisition, we've reduced our footprint globally in terms of the markets that we're in. We were in 66 markets, we're now in 40. And so this sort of -- the process that we are committed to, which is to continue to look at our businesses through the lens of strategic fit in terms of whether they clear our risk-adjusted hurdle rate. Whether we see a path to them achieving that and achieving scale, I think that applies sort of across the board, and I expect us to continue to look at our portfolio through that lens. But nothing in particular that I would point to in terms of EMEA. I think if you think about Poland and Greece, those were two businesses that sat outside of our European super carrier. As you know, we have an efficient operating model in EMEA, especially in Europe, where we -- all of our businesses are branches of our Irish entity. Poland and Greece were both subsidiaries that sat outside of that. So, in a way, this transaction helps us simplify the region and the business operationally. But I think in terms of the market environment, I mean we continue to see sort of -- we were not the first company to divest from Poland. There was -- Aviva was -- had a transaction prior to that. So, there continues to be interest by mainly European players in terms of opportunities in those markets. That's what I would sort of point to there. Thank you, operator. As many of you prepared to spend time with family and loved ones this summer, I want to wish everyone well. I also want to express my thanks to our employees who have done so much to help MetLife live our purpose, to our customers who trust us to safeguard their financial future and to our shareholders who provide us with the capital to keep this great company forging ahead. Thank you again, and have a great day."

            "name": "Ramy Tadros",
            "content": "Very good morning Erik, it's Ramy here. So let me just start by giving you a bit more color on the results. And I'll essentially just give you a bit of a walk from the headline number of 94.3% in terms of the major drivers of that. So the first is COVID-related \u2013 COVID deaths in the quarter. That's the $50,000 population -- 50,000 population death number impacting our portfolio. And that's worth about 4.5 points, as John pointed out. There's another piece in the quarter, which is that from time to time, we do experience higher volume of claims with larger face amounts, which does impact our mortality ratio. This is non-COVID related, and that was about \u2013 worth about a 0.1 to our loss ratio in this quarter. And then the third piece of this is when we look at our claims data, we did see an increase in certain death codes, which are highly correlated to COVID. So, while the cause of death for those claims is not explicitly stated as COVID, the excess mortality does appear to be COVID related, and that was worth another 1.7% on our ratio. So, if I think about the quarter and looking forward, there are probably 2 headlines I'd leave you with. One is that, if you strip out those 3 factors, our loss ratio is very close to the midpoint of our range. And the second headline is that, we have seen significant declines in deaths in Q2 versus Q1. We've also seen sequential declines in deaths month-on-month continuing into July. So, despite the current uncertainty with the Delta variant, we're also encouraged by the increase in the pace of vaccination. We're encouraged by the actions undertaken by many large employers, which are impacting the vaccination rates for that insured population. So, sitting here in August on a go-forward basis, we do think that the impact of the pandemic will gradually subside and you should expect from a run rate perspective, our loss ratio to return back to pre-pandemic levels. Hi, Ryan, it's Ramy here again. I think the -- overhead line that I'll leave you with for both dental and disability is that we are seeing our results normalize back to pre-pandemic levels. And so specifically to your question on dental, if you look at the entirety of the first half, the overall results certainly reflects that return to pre-pandemic utilization levels, albeit there was some, if you will, Q1 versus Q2 dynamics with respect to the utilization of certain services that others have spoken about, and we've seen that to be pretty consistent with our book. But in aggregate, the first half is trending towards the pre-pandemic utilization level. And we're certainly seeing that normalization continue into July as we look at it. So in aggregate, if you want to take a really big step back and look at our non-medical health ratio, we expect that for the full year to be close to the midpoint of our guidance. And that's inclusive clearly of the various products that we have in there."

            "name": "John McCallion",
            "content": "Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 2Q 2021 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our cash and capital positions. Please note in the appendix, we have also provided an, updated 25 basis point sensitivity for our U.S. long-term interest rate assumption. Starting on page three, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the second quarter. Net income in the quarter was $3.4 billion, or approximately $1.3 billion higher than adjusted earnings. This variance was primarily due to net investment gains of $1.3 billion, of which $1.1 billion relates to the sale of our Property and Casualty business to Farmers Insurance. Our investment portfolio and our hedging program continued to perform as expected. Additionally, adjusted earnings include one notable item of $66 million related to a legal reserve release. On page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items. As I previously noted, there was one notable item of $66 million in 2Q of 2021 and no notable items for the prior year period. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding the notable item was $2.30, benefiting from strong returns in our private equity portfolio, which drove most of the year-over-year variance. Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were flat year-over-year as volume growth and the Versant Health acquisition largely offset unfavorable underwriting margins. Group Life mortality improved sequentially but remains elevated in the quarter. I will discuss in more detail, shortly. Regarding non-medical health, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 73.8% in 2Q of 2021, within its annual target range of 70% to 75% but higher than the prior year quarter of 58.5%, which benefited from extremely low dental utilization and favorable disability incidents. We've seen a return to more normal utilization rates for non-medical health and expect this trend to continue. Therefore, we expect the interest-adjusted benefit ratio to remain within its annual target range for the remainder of the year. Overall, business fundamentals for group benefits remain healthy, highlighted by strong top line growth and persistency. Group Benefit sales were up 39% year-to-date, primarily due to higher general case activity. And remain on track to deliver a record sales year in 2021. Adjusted PFOs were $5.6 billion, up 29% year-over-year. Several factors contributed to the strong year-over-year growth, including a $500 million impact relating to dental premium credits and the establishment of a dental unearned premium reserve both reducing premiums in the second quarter of 2020, which collectively contributed 13 percentage points to the year-over-year growth rate. In addition, four percentage points were related to higher premiums in the current quarter from participating contracts, which can fluctuate with claim experience. After considering these factors, underlying PFO growth for Group Benefits was roughly 12% and driven by solid volume growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary and the addition of Versant Health. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, while Group Benefits reported PFO growth rates will be impacted by the dental unearned premium reserve release in Q3 and Q4, we expect the underlying PFO growth to maintain its strength and resilience for the remainder of 2021. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were $654 million, up $462 million year-over-year. The primary driver was higher variable investment income largely due to strong private equity returns. This was partially offset by less favorable underwriting margins compared to 2Q of 2020. RIS investment spreads were 224 basis points, up 199 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 98 basis points, up 13 basis points year-over-year due in part to sustained pay downs in our portfolios of residential mortgage loans and residential mortgage-backed securities, a partial recovery in real estate equities, and lower LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures, including UK longevity reinsurance, grew 8% year-over-year due to strong volume growth across the product portfolio as well as separate account investment performance. With regards to pension risk transfers, we continue to see a robust PRT pipeline. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 103% and 91% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Asia's solid volume growth also contributed to the strong performance driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 7% and 6% on a constant currency basis. Additionally, while against a weak 2Q of 2020, Asia sales were up 42% year-over-year on a constant currency basis demonstrating the resiliency in the business. Latin America adjusted earnings were down 27% and 38% on a constant currency basis primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting and unfavorable equity markets related to the Chilean encaje, which had a negative 1.5% return in the quarter versus a positive 14% in 2Q of 2020. This was partially offset by favorable investment margins. COVID-19-related claims improved sequentially. The impact on Latin America's second quarter adjusted earnings was approximately $66 million after tax. While Latin America's bottom line has been dampened by the elevated COVID-19-related claims, the underlying fundamentals of the business remain robust as evidenced by strong sales and persistency throughout the region. Latin America adjusted PFOs were up 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 55% driven by solid growth in all markets. EMEA adjusted earnings were down 19% and 23% on a constant currency basis primarily driven by higher COVID-19-related claims in the current period compared to low utilization in the prior year period. Solid volume growth was a partial offset. The current quarter has also benefited from a favorable refinement to an unearned premium reserve positively impacting adjusted PFOs and adjusted earnings by approximately $15 million after tax. In addition, Poland and Greece contribute roughly 10% to run rate earnings that will be reported in divested businesses beginning in the third quarter. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 8% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 20% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher credit life sales in Turkey and solid growth in UK Employee Benefits. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up $516 million year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by strong private equity returns. In addition, Life underwriting margins were favorable. The life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 47.1%, lower than the prior year quarter of 59.1% and below our annual target range of 50% to 55%. Corporate & Other adjusted loss, excluding the favorable notable item of $66 million related to a legal reserve release was $126 million. This result compared favorably to the adjusted loss of $289 million in 2Q of 2020 due to higher net investment income, lower expenses and lower preferred stock dividends. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 21.6% and within our 2021 guidance range of 20% to 22%. Now I will provide more detail on Group Benefits mortality results on Page 5. The Group Life mortality ratio was 94.3% in the second quarter of 2021, which is above our annual target range of 85% to 90%. COVID reported claims in 2Q of 2021 were roughly 4.5 percentage points, which reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $75 million after tax. Additionally, the quarter included a higher level of life claims above $2.5 million and an additional level of excess mortality that appears to be COVID related. These collectively impacted the ratio by an additional 2.7 percentage points or $40 million after-tax. There were approximately 50,000 COVID-19-related deaths in the US in the second quarter of 2021. While still elevated, total deaths have moderated versus the prior year and sequential quarters. Looking ahead, we expect COVID-19-related deaths and group benefits to continue to trend lower. Now let's turn to Page 6. This chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income over the last five quarters, including approximately $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2021. This very strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio, which had a 9.7% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equities are generally accounted for on a one-quarter lag. Our second quarter results are essentially in line with PE industry benchmarks. While all private equity asset classes performed well in the quarter, our venture capital funds, which account for roughly 22% of our PE account balance of $11.3 billion, were the strongest performer across subsectors with a roughly 19% quarterly return. On Page 7, second quarter VII of $950 million post tax is shown by segment. The attribution of VII by business is based on the quarterly returns for each segment's individual portfolio. As we have previously noted, RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia, generally account for approximately 90% or more of the total VII and are split roughly one-third each, although it can vary from quarter-to-quarter. VII results in 2Q of '21 were more heavily weighted towards RIS and MetLife Holdings, as Asia's private equity portfolio is less mature and has a smaller proportion of the venture capital funds that I referenced earlier. Turning to Page 8. This chart shows our direct expense ratio over the prior five quarters and full year 2020, including 11.4% in the second quarter of '21. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. In 2Q of '21, our favorable direct expense ratio benefited from solid topline growth and ongoing expense discipline, as well as lower employee-related benefits in the quarter. We expect the direct expense ratio for the remainder of 2021 to be elevated compared to the first half of 2021, due to timing of investments and seasonality. But as Michel noted, we expect full year '21 and '22 direct expense ratio to beat our 12.3% guidance. Now, I'll discuss our cash and capital position on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6.5 billion at June 30, which is up from $3.8 billion at March 31 and well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential increase in cash at the holding companies was primarily due to the proceeds received from our P&C sale to Farmers Insurance of $3.9 billion. In addition, HoldCo cash includes the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, a $500 million redemption of preferred stock, share repurchases of $1.1 share repurchases of $1.1 billion, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our US companies, preliminary second quarter year-to-date 2021 statutory operating earnings were approximately $2.8 billion, while net income was approximately $1.6 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by approximately $1.2 billion year-over-year, driven by lower variable annuity rider reserves and an increase in investment margin. Year-to-date 2021 net income decreased by $286 million, as compared to the first half of 2020. The primary drivers were derivative losses, mostly offset by increases in operating earnings and net investment gains in the current six-month period, compared to large derivative gains in the prior year six-month period. We estimate that our total US statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.5 billion as of June 30, 2021, up 9% compared to December 31, 2020, when excluding our P&C business sold to farmers. Favorable operating earnings and net investment gains were partially offset by derivative losses and dividends paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 873% as of March 31, which is the latest public data. The sequential decline in the Japan SMR from 967% at December 31st reflects seasonal dividends and the rise in US interest rates in the quarter ending March 31st. In summary, MetLife delivered another strong quarter driven by exceptional private equity returns, good business fundamentals, ongoing expense discipline, and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities. While higher mortality due to COVID-19 has masked the earnings power of Group Benefits in Latin America, the strength of these franchises remain healthy and intact. In addition, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are strong, resilient and position us for success. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Good morning Eric. So, I'll just start out by saying we're very pleased with the result and the execution by everyone in the firm. And I think as Michel said in his opening remarks, this has really become part of our culture and it's a cultural shift that we've made, our efficiency mindset is built into our strategy. It's built into our everyday activities, and I think the results are -- kind of speak for themselves. As I mentioned, in this quarter, there's a few timing-related items. So, we do see an uptick in expenses in the second half of the year relative to the first half. We did have some benefit from some employee-related costs, particularly as they relate to the impact of how markets move. And so that came -- that was a benefit this quarter. And then there's seasonality with regards to preferred stock dividends. So, the second and the fourth quarter typically are low quarters for those dividends. As we look to the second half of this year, directionally speaking, we would see -- just typically do see seasonally higher expenses in the second half. Some of that's related, obviously, to our group business and the enrollment activities we go through. And oftentimes, too, there's been some delays just as a result of a number of activities going on in some of the investments. So, we do see kind of an uptick. Having said that, one of the things that we both pointed out is our expectation, which is different than where we were on our outlook call in February, is to now be under our 12.3% guidance despite the removal of our Property & Casualty business, which had a lower expense ratio. So, all-in-all, I think our efficiency mindset just built into the culture, it's all working. And we expect that to continue as we look forward. I think I would probably stop there on your last question and probably leave that for another day. Good morning, Jimmy, it's John. Yes. So I'll just break it up. In the Life side, as you saw in our interest-adjusted benefit ratio, we had a strong result really for this block of business, minimal, actually de minimis COVID impact this quarter. So it actually, I would say, declined faster. The impact declined faster than we had probably expected. But I think a number of factors that you can probably come to probably makes that \u2013 makes sense, whether it's the average age, and the percent of vaccinations at the older age, things like that. On the LTC side metrics, there was \u2013 it was really \u2013 there was no material positive from LTC. It was in line with expectations. What we're seeing is that \u2013 and I'd say, in line with, I'll say, pre-pandemic expectations. And so what we're seeing is metrics and results really trending back towards those pre-COVID levels. New claims are, I'd say, marginally below trend, but all indications are showing that we'll be back to trend very soon. The only metric that's lagging \u2013 but again, I will say, trending back to pre-pandemic is the relationship of home care versus nursing home claims. So it's still probably a little elevated in the home care side, but that's \u2013 it's trending down. It's trending back to the pre-pandemic ratios. Hey. Good morning, Mike, it's John. So, look, I think the trend that you're referencing, our belief is the trend is going to continue. It's not going anywhere. I don't think that changes what -- how we're addressing and focusing on MetLife Holdings. It, as you said, has performed very well. Our focus is on optimization, whether a diversified block with a number of natural offsets, the team has done a great job managing it. But at the same time, as I said, the team's mandate is to kind of take a third-party view, an external view and make sure that we're continuing to look at different ways to be prepared for the opportunity in what I'd say is a new market within the industry, which is this kind of block acquisition or transfer or risk transfer. So nothing's changed on our end. In terms of bid ask, I don't know if I've seen any, I'll say, clear signs that it's changed at this point. But this is a dynamic, I'd say, area right now, and our focus is to be ready, if it does change. So Yes. I mean the quick answer is no. It was -- I don't think -- that wasn't our intention, if that was the takeaway, but it was definitely within the 65% to 75%, if not higher. And yes, I think the go-forward is the range is intact."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.\nJohn Hall: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife\u2019s first quarter 2021 earnings call. Before we begin, I refer you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer is on the call this morning, along with other members of senior management, who will be available to participate in the discussion. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides, which address the quarter. They are available on our website. John McCallion is under the weather today. We are going to let him rest his voice, and I will speak to the supplemental slides following Michel's remarks. An appendix to the supplemental slides features outlook sensitivities, disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information, all of which you should also review. After our prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session that will extend to the top of the hour. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michel.\nMichel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As we reported last evening, MetLife delivered very strong financial results for the first quarter of 2021. Our diverse business mix, sound investment strategy and strong expense discipline combined to generate earnings well above consensus expectations. By the numbers, we reported first quarter 2021 adjusted earnings of $2 billion or $2.20 per share, up 39% from $1.58 a year ago. The primary driver was exceptionally strong variable investment income, or VII, partially offset by elevated COVID-19 related claims. Net income for the quarter was $290 million, down from $4.4 billion a year ago, primarily due to losses on derivatives that protect our balance sheet from declines in equity markets and interest rates. Such gains and losses are the result of GAAP accounting rules that require us to mark certain of our derivative hedges to market through net income without similar treatment for the assets and liabilities being hedged. We believe the economics and the free cash flow of our business are captured in adjusted earnings. Regarding variable investment income, the key driver of gains in the first quarter was our private equity portfolio, which delivered returns of 13.3%. Recall that private equity returns are reported on a one quarter lag. The strong performance in the fourth quarter was driven primarily by three private equity sectors: domestic leveraged buyout funds, European LBOs and venture capital. In the second half of 2020, IPOs from U.S.-based LBOs and venture capital firms more than doubled over the prior year, and the market rewarded many entrants with strong valuation. Venture capital our best performer across the three sub sectors, largely due to the markets appetite for tech companies received will volumes had a record in 2020 and the increase in digital activity, spurred by the pandemic drove attractive valuations for early stage tech firms positioned to capitalize on that trend. While our private equity portfolio return and the quarter was robust. It was in line with industry benchmarks, most notably Cambridge Associates Private Equity Index. We are confident this asset class will continue to be a significant source of alpha format life in the future. Turning to the performance of our business segments, I\u2019ll begin with our U.S. Group Benefits results. Adjusted earnings were down 70% year-over-year on elevated COVID-19 life claims. In the U.S., overall, COVID-19 related deaths are 40% higher in the first quarter of 2021 than they were in the fourth quarter of 2020. For MetLife, our group life mortality ratio was 106.3%, well above the high end of our target range of 85% to 90%, with approximately 17 percentage points attributable to COVID-19 claims. The top line performance of the Group Benefits business was strong, with sales up 45% year-over-year. We are doing especially well with national accounts. And if trends hold, we expect the group business to deliver a record sales year. Adjusted PFO growth was also solid at 16% with the addition of Versant Health being a large contributor. In Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 92% year-over-year, driven by higher VII. Beyond VII, adjusted earnings were still strong on favorable underwriting and volume growth. Looking ahead, we continue to see a robust pension risk transfer pipeline. Rising equity markets and interest rates have improved pension plan funding levels and lowered the cost for plan sponsors to transact with an insurer. Within Asia, we saw a similar earnings pattern to RIS. Adjusted earnings were up 70% year-over-year on a constant currency basis driven by higher VII. However, even allowing for VII, adjusted earnings were strong driven by favorable foreign exchange rates, volume growth and underwriting. Sales in the region were up 12% on a constant currency basis, even with the COVID resurgence in certain markets. In Latin America, adjusted earnings were down 57% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily due to the pandemic. COVID related claims in the quarter totaled approximately $150 million, mainly in Mexico. In EMEA, adjusted earnings of $71 million were down 11% on a constant currency basis on higher coverage related claims as well as higher expenses compared to the favorable prior year quarter. Sales were up 4% on a constant currency basis, with strong momentum in the U.K. employee benefits space. To finish my business segment discussion, I think a theme is clear. If you look past higher VII and mortality in the quarter, the underlying performance of the business was very solid. On the fundamentals, we continue to demonstrate consistent execution with strong earnings power across a range of different economic scenarios. Turning to cash and capital management. MetLife ended the first quarter with cash at the holding company of $3.8 billion, near the top end of our $3 billion to $4 billion target buffer. Our two-year average free cash flow ratio remains within our guidance range of 65% to 75%. Currently, our cash balances are much higher following the receipt of $3.94 billion of proceeds on the sale of our U.S. P&C business. During the quarter, we were pleased to return $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders, $1 billion in share repurchases and approximately $400 million in common stock dividends. So far in Q2, we have bought back an additional $210 million of common shares, and we have roughly $1.6 billion remaining under our current repurchase authorization. Last week, our Board of Directors approved a second quarter 2021 common stock dividend of $0.48 per share, up 4.3% from the first quarter. Over the last decade, we have increased our common dividend at a 10% compound annual growth rate. Our consistent execution continues to generate strong free cash flow that allows us to invest in growth and return capital to our shareholders, all with the goal of driving long-term value creation. As we look ahead, we see a path to a brighter future from both an economic and health perspective. In the United States, conditions look promising for a period of employment growth, which is always good for our group business. On the pandemic front, we believe the worst of the underwriting effects on our company are behind us as the vaccine rollout continues to advance. The progress is not yet uniform across the world, and certain areas are still struggling, but the trend line is clear, a slow but steady return to something we can call normalcy. While we welcome an improving external environment, we also remain laser-focused on executing our strategy to ensure we are prepared for the post pandemic world. For our customers, we continue to accelerate our digital transformation to meet their evolving needs. In Japan, for example, 95% of our policy submissions are now done digitally. For our employees, we will be implementing a more flexible workplace model in Q3, which for most will be a hybrid approach. While our people have performed exceptionally well, working from home during the pandemic, we believe the office will continue to play a critical role in fostering collaboration, innovation and career development. We are equally confident that by incorporating more virtual work into our model, we will enhance productivity gain access to a broader talent pool and strengthen employee engagement. To close this morning, I want to emphasize the urgency we are filling up MetLife to keep raising our game. As I said in my annual letter to shareholders, consistent execution is our new baseline. Continuous improvement is our new aspiration and expectation. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to John.\nJohn McCallion: Thank you, Michel. I will start with the 1Q 2021 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our cash and capital positions. Starting on Page 3. We provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the first quarter. Net income in the quarter was $290 million or approximately $1.7 billion lower than adjusted earnings. This variance was primarily due to net derivative losses as a result of the significant rise in long-term interest rates as well as stronger equity markets in 1Q 2021. Our investment portfolio and our hedging program continue to perform as expected. On Page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment. There were no notable items for either period. Adjusted earnings per share benefited from exceptionally strong returns in our private equity portfolio and were up 39% and 38% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. Group Benefits, adjusted earnings were down 70% year-over-year, largely driven by unfavorable group life mortality due to elevated COVID-19 related life claims. Favorable non-medical health underwriting and volume growth were partial offsets. Overall, results for Group Benefits were mixed. Adjusted earnings were down, but underlying fundamentals, including top line growth and persistency were strong. Group Benefits sales were up 45% year-over-year, primarily due to higher jumbo case activity. We believe that we are on track to deliver a record sales year in 2021. Adjusted PFOs were $5.6 billion, up 16% year-over-year due to solid volume growth across most products, the addition of Versant Health and roughly 5 percentage points related to higher premiums from participating contracts, which can fluctuate with claims experience. I will discuss Group Benefits underwriting in more detail shortly. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 92% year-over-year. The primary driver was higher variable investment income, largely due to strong private equity returns. In addition, elevated COVID-19 mortality and volume growth were positive contributors. RIS investment spreads were 234 basis points up 120 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 88 basis points, up 5 basis points year-over-year primarily due to the decline in LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures, including U.K. longevity reinsurance, grew 12% year-over-year due to strong volume growth across the product portfolio as well as separate account investment performance. With regard to U.K. longevity reinsurance, we have continued to see strong growth since completing our initial transaction in 2Q 2020. The notional balance stands at $8.8 billion at March 31, up nearly $5 billion from year-end 2020. And as previously announced, first quarter results for Property & Casualty are reflected as a divested business in our quarterly financial statements. The sale of the auto and home business to farmers insurance closed on April 7, and we expect to record an after-tax gain of approximately $1 billion in 2Q 2021 Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 78% and 70% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income as well as volume growth and favorable underwriting margins. Asia's solid volume growth was driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 6% and 4% on a constant currency basis. Asia sales were up 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, with growth across most markets. Latin America adjusted earnings were down 58% and 57% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting, partially offset by the improvement in equity markets. Elevated COVID-19 related claims, primarily in Mexico, impacted Latin America's adjusted earnings by approximately $150 million after-tax. Looking ahead, we expect COVID-19 claims to decrease throughout the year, more significantly in the second half, and adjusted earnings to return to 2019 levels in 2022, which is consistent with our outlook. Latin America adjusted PFOs were down 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis due to lower single premium immediate annuities sales in Chile. EMEA adjusted earnings were down 9% and 11% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by higher COVID-19 related claims as well as higher expenses compared to the favorable prior year quarter. EMEA adjusted PFOs were down 5% on a constant currency basis, but sales were up 4% on a constant currency basis, due to strong growth in U.K. employee benefits. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 123%. This increase was primarily driven by higher variable investment income, largely due to private equity returns. Also, favorable equity markets and long-term care underwriting were positive drivers. Long-term care benefited from higher policy and claim terminations as well as lower claim incidences. The life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 54.8%, higher than the prior year quarter of 51% and at the top end of our annual target range of 50% to 55% due to elevated COVID-19 mortality. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $171 million. This result is consistent with our 2021 adjusted loss guidance range of $650 million to $750 million. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 20.8% and within our 2021 guidance range of 20% to 22%. Now I will provide more detail on Group Benefits 1Q 2021 underwriting performance on Page 5. There were approximately 200,000 COVID-19 related deaths in the U.S. in the first quarter, the highest single quarter since the pandemic began and up nearly 40% versus the fourth quarter of 2020. In addition to the higher number of claims, there were more deaths at younger ages below 65, which resulted in increased claim severity. Apart from COVID-19, the number of life insurance claims of greater than $2 million nearly doubled versus a typical quarter. The group life mortality ratio was 106.3% in the first quarter, which included roughly 17 percentage points related to COVID-19 life claims. This reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $280 million after-tax. For group non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 71.1% in the first quarter, with favorable experience across most products. The 1Q 2021 ratio was below the prior year quarter of 71.7% and at the low end of our annual target range of 70% to 75%. Now let's turn to VII in the quarter on Page 6. This chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income over the last five quarters, including approximately $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2021. This very strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio, which had a 13.3% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equities are generally accounted for on a one quarter lag. Our first quarter results were essentially in line with private equity industry benchmarks, while all private equity classes performed well in the quarter, our venture capital funds, which account for roughly 20% of our PE account balance of $10.3 billion were strongest performer across sub-sectors with a roughly 25% quarterly return due to a broad increase in tech company valuations. On Page 7, first quarter VII of $1.1 billion post-tax is shown by segment. The attribution of VII by business is based on the quarterly returns for each segment's individual portfolio. As noted previously, RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia generally account for approximately 90% or more of the total VII and are split roughly one-third each although it can vary from quarter-to-quarter. VII results in 1Q 2021 were more heavily weighted toward RIS and MetLife Holdings, as Asia's portfolio has a smaller proportion of the venture capital funds that I referenced earlier. Turning to Page 8. This chart shows our direct expense ratio over the prior five quarters and full year 2020, including 11% in the first quarter of 2021. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. In 1Q 2021, our favorable direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline as well as delayed investment spending in the quarter. We expect the direct expense ratio for the remainder of 2021 to be consistent with our full year outlook. Now I will discuss our cash and capital position on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $3.8 billion at March 31, which is down from $4.5 billion at December 31, but well within our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential decrease in cash at the holding companies was primarily due to the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of approximately $1 billion in the first quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. Looking ahead, we expect holdco cash will be significantly higher in the second quarter as a result of the sale of our auto and home business to farmers insurance. Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, our combined NAIC RBC ratio was 392% at year-end 2020 and comfortably above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, excluding our Property & Casualty business, preliminary first quarter 2021 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.5 billion, while statutory net income was approximately $570 million. Statutory operating earnings increased by roughly $2.3 billion year-over-year driven by lower VA rider reserves, an increase in interest margins, higher net investment income and lower operating expenses. Statutory net income, excluding our P&C business, increased by roughly $430 million year-over-year driven by higher operating earnings, partially offset by an increase in after-tax derivative losses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital, excluding P&C was approximately $16.7 billion as of March 31, down 2% compared to December 31. Favorable operating earnings were more than offset by after-tax derivative losses and dividends paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 967% as of December 31, which is the latest public data. In summary, MetLife delivered another strong quarter, which benefited from exceptional private equity returns, solid business fundamentals and ongoing expense discipline. While higher mortality in the U.S. and Mexico dampened adjusted earnings in Group Benefits in Latin America, our financial performance demonstrates the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities. In addition, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are strong, resilient and position us for success. We are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler, more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nErik Bass: Just to start, can you go into a bit more detail on the group life claims trends this quarter and the implications of population that's skewing younger, which it sounds like could mean higher severity? Is this something we should expect to have continued impact in the second quarter?\nRamy Tadros: Erik, it's Ramy here. As we've discussed in John's remarks, the group results this quarter were primarily a frequency effect. So we saw the significant increase in the total number of population deaths. And that was accompanied by a secondary effect, which is a severity effect, whereby we did see an increase in the percentage of claims under 65. And those claims, which tend to be for working employees, do have a higher face amount. So if you think about it and if you think about the outlook going forward, we're watching that composition very carefully. But I would say that the primary driver in the second quarter is still going to be the frequency, right? So as you know, with the rollout of the vaccine, the COVID related deaths in the population have been declining. If you do any comparison between, say, January average death number to April has been a significant decline. So while we still have a substantial number of deaths coming through, therefore, expect to see an elevated mortality ratio in the second quarter. We do expect the underwriting ratio to come down from its Q1 highs.\nErik Bass: And then maybe if we could turn to Asia? I was hoping you can provide some more color on the underlying growth dynamics there, where it seems like your sales and account value growth are both trending a bit stronger than many peers. Just wondering where you're seeing the best opportunities?\nKishore Ponnavolu: Erik, this is Kishore. So we did have a pretty strong quarter in terms of sales growth, 7% sequentially and 12% compared to prior year. This is certainly a good performance, especially given the COVID environment. Even in Japan, we had several prefectures under the state of emergency there during much of Q1. And then the other Asia markets had varying degrees of social distancing measures in place. Clearly, COVID and the resurgence here in Asia is a significant headwind given that the vast majority of our sales are face-to-face. However, as I mentioned earlier, the diversity of our channels and products, the strength of our bank partnerships and the strong execution focus of our businesses, that's what powers MetLife sales resiliency even in this tough environment. In addition, we've been making significant investments in digitizing our sales processes, all the way from video conferencing, co-browsing, remote closing and they've certainly aided our performance as well. As Michel mentioned in his opening remarks, 95% of our new sales application submissions in Japan are digital. And the other markets are in a similar range as well. For example, in China, almost all our agent onboarding and new business submissions are done digitally. Specifically with regards to Japan, it's, again, 8% up sequentially. And even after taking seasonality into account, our face-to-face channels that sell life and A&H products were quite resilient, while we recorded strong annuity sales growth to the bank channel. Clearly, we have strengthened the FX-denominated products and our bank relationships, and that strength shows. Other Asia, 8% up, sequentially up 30% year-over-year. Again, this speaks to, I think, the strength of our market presence across these markets and strong execution across the board. And our digital solutions are also helping us in a big way. With regards to the outlook for the rest of the year, we're very comfortable and on track to meet the full guidance of double-digit sales growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nElyse Greenspan: My first question is on capital. So you guys bought that $1 billion in the quarter. Just want to get a sense, any color that you can give in terms of how we should think about the quarterly run rate, given that you guys closed the Property & Casualty transaction in the second quarter. And given that you guys will have a good amount of capital coming from that deal, is there a certain level that we should think about you guys looking to have at the holdco above the normal buffer as you put those proceeds to work?\nMichel Khalaf: Yes, hi, good morning Elyse, it's Michel. So let me start at a high level by just reiterating our philosophy and our approach, which is that beyond supporting organic growth and in the absence of strategic accretive risk-adjusted hurdle rate clearing M&A, excess capital belongs to our shareholders. And we define excess capital as cash or cash equivalents at our holding companies above our liquidity buffer, which is still the $3 billion to $4 billion that we've discussed. As you know, we bought back $1 billion in the first quarter. We ended the quarter with $3.8 billion in cash at our holding companies. So that's within our $3 billion to $4 billion buffer. And we did so with the full knowledge that we would close shortly on the sale of our P&C company and substantially boost our cash and excess capital position. We have $1.6 billion remaining on our repurchase authorization, which we will extinguish in 2021. And historically, we've managed our authorization deliberately and expeditiously, particularly in the wake of major divestments. So expect us to do the same here.\nElyse Greenspan: And then maybe my follow-up will build upon that. You guys announced this transaction, the P&C sale, late last year. And you've put it right that you'll balance capital return as well as, I think, looking at what M&A is potentially out there. So as you guys have kind of thought through kind of M&A plan, it's kind of five or so months since you announced the transaction, you guys have a sense of what type of businesses you would look to pursue deals? And as you look at transactions, multiples or anything may be more or less likely to go down the route of M&A?\nMichel Khalaf: Yes. Again, here, I would just maybe start with sort of our approach and philosophy, which again, is - has been very consistent and no change there. So we will always look for M&A opportunities that fit our strategy that are accretive over time for our shareholders. We have a constant basis globally through which we evaluate opportunities based on value and cash generation. All M&A opportunities will need to earn more than their cost of capital. And we determine what we're willing to pay for a business by evaluating capital markets, the cost of raising capital and synergies. And acquisition opportunities will need to be more attractive than share repurchases. So what we do is we try to achieve a healthy balance between returning cash to our shareholders and investing in attractive future growth through M&A. And I think some of the sort of recent transactions that we've done, such as Versant Health last year, but first acquisition prior to that, Logan Circle a couple of years back, I think those give you a sense of sort of what that - sort of approach or strategy that I outlined. So no change here.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead. \nAndrew Kligerman: Just a question on the private equity portfolio, which I think John cited venture capital is 20% of $10.3 billion and generated a 25% return in the first quarter. Met has always seemed in the last years like a prominent name in venture capital. Could you flesh out that story a little bit more? How much does Met invest each year in venture capital? Are there particular areas of VC that are strengths? Just very interested in that area and the prospects at MetLife?\nSteve Goulart: Andrew, it's Steve Goulart. Good morning. Let me talk a little bit about the overall strategy because we've been investing in private equity for a number of years and have always felt it to be a very strong component of our overall strategy. Venture capital, of course, is a significant portion of the portfolio. But basically, we take a look at this portfolio the same way we look at our credit portfolio, our real estate portfolio. It's about diversification, and that's what we've really tried to build in this. Again, just sort of recapping some of the numbers. Our PE portfolio produced income of almost $1.3 billion or 13.3% return. Again, Venture capital was - led the way as far as its total return. But think about what was happening in the market, too, with a lot of IPO activity and the like of things that Michel cited in his comments. So the important thing is that our returns were attractive across the portfolio, and I'd look at things like our LBO portfolio both domestically and in Europe. And again, this reflects the diversity that's in the entire portfolio and when we look to invest, we continue to invest in a diverse way across all the different sectors as well. I mean, just to give you a little bit more flavor on it. We have over 600 funds that we've invested in. We have almost 200 managers. So, again, very broad, very deep exposure across all the sectors of private equity. And again, I think you have to take into consideration what was happening in the environment, and when we think about it, despite the pandemic, equity valuations continued decline in the fourth quarter. The combination of fiscal and monetary stimulus continued to be major contributors that led to strong equity performance really across all sectors. And so I would think about it in that respect that we really think of this as a diversified private equity portfolio. Now that all said, we do think that the past quarter was probably something of an anomaly because when we look at our historical experience, at least until this quarter. Now, it has been that our PE returns have always been moderated versus the S&P 500, particularly in high market return quarters. So this was an unusual quarter in that respect. And when we think about future returns or relationships, we still think that what we've been saying for the last couple of years as far as our plans go, the kind of low single - or low double-digits 12% is still the right way for us to think about these returns. Again, it's going to be vary quarter-by-quarter, but that's how we think about this on a long-term basis and again, it just reflects our continued efforts to have a very diversified portfolio across all sectors.\nAndrew Kligerman: Sounds like it's a real area of excellence in we see though but I'll move on from that. And then Erik was asking a question earlier about Asian - sales in the Asia region, and I'm still trying to reconcile those numbers with what we've been seeing as other companies, which is sales pressures flattish premium growth, and MET being - having a very large proportion of its business in Japan, which is a more mature market. It's just kind of striking to see 12% year-over-year sales growth and then a target of double-digit. So, if you could flesh that out a little bit more specifically, is it the banks that are driving the sales growth in Japan, and what particular other countries are kind of driving growth in other parts of Asia.\nJohn McCallion: Sure, Andrew. So, if you - if we parse out the total Asia sales into Japan and other Asia, they will pretend for a minute. While sequentially and even on the previous calls right, we've been making steady progress in Japan sales since Q2, right? Q3 was better than Q2, last year Q4 was better than Q3. And Q1 is a build off of Q4 from last year. And if you then say, okay, where is this coming from? A couple of things. We have three broad product lines, life, A&H and annuities. And then we have a couple of channels, right? We've got essentially what I would broadly classify as face-to-face channels. We can go further breakdown of that, but that's not needed for this call and - the good news for us is even in this tough environment, our face-to-face channels were pretty resilient from a year-over-year perspective. There's a little bit of pressure on A&H, but our life segment pretty much held flat. And then much of the growth came in from the annuities, which are primarily sold through banks. And in the previous calls, I talked a lot about our advantages in the annuity space on the FX because these are all foreign currency or dollar denominated. And we have many advantages that we bring to the table on that and also the strength of the bank partnerships that we bring to the table as well. So because of that, because of this diversification of products and diversification of channels and our lean in on our strengths that's basically contributed to the resiliency of our sales in Japan. Now with regards to - and by the way, this has not been easy. I have to tell you that. But our teams on the ground have done, I think, a fantastic job with regards to that. Now again, this is playing out, right? I can't sit here and say, this is definitive because COVID is a factor that's an ongoing concern across Asia. With regards to other Asia, again, very strong sales growth. But remember, last year, the pressure started early outside of Japan, in China, right, because of COVID. And so the year-over-year comparisons look very favorable on the other Asia segment. But again, I think I'd lean more on the strength of our businesses and our market presence in terms of how we've executed this quarter. Korea was very strong in terms of performance. India was also strong in performance from a sales perspective. We've recovered nicely in China, which is a major factor. Again, COVID is still a factor in all these markets. And we continue to stay focused on execution. At the end, that's what it boils down to. I hope that helps. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nTom Gallagher: Just a question on RIS spreads declining excluding VII. I think John McCallion, I know you mentioned last quarter that the over 100 basis point spread level was probably not sustainable. But I guess, the big drop back into the high 80s seemed a bit surprising to me. Question is, is that now a good level to run rate? Or would you expect to trend up or down? And any color as to why such a large sequential drop?\nJohn McCallion: Good morning, Tom, sorry for the voice. Just overcoming little COVID recovery here. So all right, let me try to take that. Look, it's probably not going to go too far back because that was the whole reason we gave you in guidance, right? But look, we talked about some pretty large one-time items in the third and fourth quarter last year from prepayments and other things like that. And we knew those things weren't going to recur. And so those - that's probably one item. Second is we did reference that new re-class and real estate funds up into VII. And that probably cost another four points of shift. So we really kind of migrate back to the range. I mean I wouldn't go backwards so much as I would think about how we look relative to the guidance we gave in February. And I think we're right in line, I mean, maybe even slightly above this quarter. But honestly, the 80s is probably a little above. And I think the outlook, putting aside yet VII, is intact. \nTom Gallagher: Appreciate it, John. Hope you recover soon. Sorry to draw you into the call, too. But the - I guess my only follow-up is maybe for Steve Goulart. The - just a reminder, VII, does that no longer include prepayment income? Or does prepayment income still included in that number? \nSteve Goulart: Prepayment income is still in that number. It's just dwarfed by our alternative income. They're fairly modest on the prepayments. \nJohn McCallion: Yes. Let me clarify where you're going. So, that - I'm not talking about prepayment income when I said that there were prepayment activities impacting the non-VII spread in the third and fourth quarter. What happened was we saw just a real jump in refinancing, and that was impacting the RMBS securities and how they were running off. And that was having a jump in our non-VII spread. So, hopefully, that helps. \nTom Gallagher: That does. And Steve, just to clarify, could you quantify, of the $1.4 billion of VII, how much is prepayment income?\nJohn Hall: Yes. Tom, this is John Hall. We typically haven't broken out that number, but if you got your ruler out and you took a real careful measurement of that table in the supplemental slides, you could probably reasonably get close. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi. Please go ahead.\nSuneet Kamath: Thanks. I wanted to start with the direct expense ratio guide, just so I understand it, obviously came in much better in the first quarter. In terms of your comments about the next couple of quarters, is the expectation that you'll be sort of above your 12.3% BRIC, get the full year to land around 12.3%? Or is it the expectation over the next few quarters that you'll be somewhere around 12.3%, so you could end up with a lower full year number? I just didn't quite get the guide there.\nMichel Khalaf: Yes. I'm not sure - hi Suneet, Michel. I'm not sure we provided a guide, but let me just remind of what we said on the outlook, which is that this year's expense ratio will be pressured because of the sale of P&C, which has a lower direct expense ratio and that we would expect to get back to at or below the 12.3% by 2022. Now, obviously, we came in at 11% in Q1. A few factors that contributed to this. One is the PFO growth, obviously. And I think there were - in John's comments, we mentioned some of the impact of participating group life contracts, for example, on that PFO growth. Versant was an important also factor there. Then we had really good expense discipline across our businesses. And we did have also some, I would say, timing related expenses that maybe benefited us by about 25 basis points. So our expectation for the second to fourth quarter is that the expense ratio will be consistent with our full year outlook guidance. And as I said, we believe that 12.3% is the right level for us, because that allows us to continue to make important investments in our business. So no change in terms of how you should look at the balance of the year.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. Got it. And then just - sorry. Go ahead.\nJohn McCallion: Suneet, I'll just add that, like, just to the point on the guide, we give an annual guide. This quarter came in much better than we thought. But if you adjust for this quarter and think about the rest, we're expecting to be slightly above this year, but trending well. \nSuneet Kamath: And then just on the Group Benefits business, I was just wondering if you could unpack some of the growth rates that we're seeing. PFOs, I think, were up 16%. How much of that was Versant versus the other parts of the business? And then on the sales growth, up 45%, can you just give a little color in terms of what's behind that? How much of it is sort of new clients, headcount increases or new products? Just so we get a sense of where the growth is coming from.\nRamy Tadros: Hi, Suneet, it's Ramy here. So I'll start off with the sales. We're really pleased with our performance this quarter. And as John mentioned, 2021 is shaping up to be a record year for us in terms of Group Benefits. I would say the three drivers of sales; the first one is a significant uptick in the jumbo activity in national accounts. Now that's coming off a low in 2020, but this is our sweet spot. This is where we excel, and we've done exceptionally well this quarter there. I would also remind you, just for jumbo accounts, these sales can be lumpy from year-to-year. Beyond that, if you look at products and markets, we've just seen, I would say, strength across the board from a product perspective, as well as increased sales in both regional and small. So it's pretty even. And then, the last driver of sales I would point to is, we continue to successfully execute on our enrollment and reenrollment strategy at the worksite that we've talked about on prior occasions. So we're seeing pretty strong underlying sales growth there.  When it comes to PFO growth, which we think is the actual measure that best captures the top line of this business; you really need to peel back from that 16%, 5 points due to these participating contracts. So think about 11 as the underlying growth there, and that is in line with our expectations and in line with our outlook. So we're very pleased with that result as well. And the PFO drivers, in addition to sales, would be strong persistency. We continue to see very high persistency with our customers. And our value proposition is resonating with those customers, and they're doing more business with us. We're getting all of our rate actions at renewals also in line with our expectations. And then also what's driving the PFO number, coming back to that reenrollment strategy, is very disciplined execution of our voluntary strategy in the work site. And so, we continue to see those double-digit growth in voluntary in that PFO number.\nSuneet Kamath: Great. How much of that 11% was Versant? Are you able to spike that out?\nRamy Tadros: We don't break that out. At the transaction, we did indicate that we that we expected to add about $1.3 billion of PFO from Versant in the year. So you can use that as a framework.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ward from UBS. Please go ahead.\nMike Ward: Thank you, guys. Good morning. I just had a higher-level question on holdings. Interest rates have come up a bit this year, they're still pretty low, but COVID is kind of subsiding. Would you say there's an uptick in conversations on potential derisking there? If and when the time comes, just curious if you could comment at all maybe on which lines there that you're thinking you might want to work on first.\nJohn McCallion: Hi Mike. Good to hear you. Yeah. So, I'd say things are trending positively in the space. It's still slow. Rates are still low. Spreads are wide. But things are emerging. And I think our philosophy has been to just continue to be ready. But it's - there's a lot of activity and we're just going to make sure we're ready to act if something is value accretive. So I don't think there's any material change from the last call. \nMike Ward: Thanks, John. I appreciate that. And then just on the P&C proceeds, I know you said going to be thoughtful and balanced. And you've got a solid track record, but this is a solid amount of capital there. So I was just wondering if there was any more detail you could give around if there's nothing inorganic out there, what the buyback run rate might look like as we move forward. Thanks.\nMichel Khalaf: Hi, Mike. I mean, I would just refer you back to our overall sort of approach and philosophy and the track record also post divestment. And I think that should give you a good sense of how we would sort of move forward here.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead. \nRyan Krueger: Ramy, can you provide some more underlying details on the non-medical health underwriting trends you saw in the quarter, both in dental and vision utilization and disability experience? \nRamy Tadros: Sure. So I'll keep this brief. In the quarter, the two I'll point out to, one is dental. We did see some benefit from lower utilization early in the quarter. But as we expected, the utilization normalized back in line with historical levels as the quarter progressed. And then in disability, we're still seeing very favorable results. We saw a slight uptick in incidence rates from years ago, but we continue to see positive trends on recoverability there.\nOperator: And it seems we have no time for any further questions, I would like to now turn the call back to Michel Khalaf for any closing remarks.\nMichel Khalaf: Great, thank you. So let me close by saying that we're very pleased with our first quarter financial results. While they were puts and takes with variable investment income and mortality, our underlying results showed both strength and positive momentum across our business segment. We consider the quarter's results and other installment on our commitment to consistent execution and we look forward to continuing to generate long term value for all our stakeholders. Thank you for joining us this morning and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Michel Khalaf",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As we reported last evening, MetLife delivered very strong financial results for the first quarter of 2021. Our diverse business mix, sound investment strategy and strong expense discipline combined to generate earnings well above consensus expectations. By the numbers, we reported first quarter 2021 adjusted earnings of $2 billion or $2.20 per share, up 39% from $1.58 a year ago. The primary driver was exceptionally strong variable investment income, or VII, partially offset by elevated COVID-19 related claims. Net income for the quarter was $290 million, down from $4.4 billion a year ago, primarily due to losses on derivatives that protect our balance sheet from declines in equity markets and interest rates. Such gains and losses are the result of GAAP accounting rules that require us to mark certain of our derivative hedges to market through net income without similar treatment for the assets and liabilities being hedged. We believe the economics and the free cash flow of our business are captured in adjusted earnings. Regarding variable investment income, the key driver of gains in the first quarter was our private equity portfolio, which delivered returns of 13.3%. Recall that private equity returns are reported on a one quarter lag. The strong performance in the fourth quarter was driven primarily by three private equity sectors: domestic leveraged buyout funds, European LBOs and venture capital. In the second half of 2020, IPOs from U.S.-based LBOs and venture capital firms more than doubled over the prior year, and the market rewarded many entrants with strong valuation. Venture capital our best performer across the three sub sectors, largely due to the markets appetite for tech companies received will volumes had a record in 2020 and the increase in digital activity, spurred by the pandemic drove attractive valuations for early stage tech firms positioned to capitalize on that trend. While our private equity portfolio return and the quarter was robust. It was in line with industry benchmarks, most notably Cambridge Associates Private Equity Index. We are confident this asset class will continue to be a significant source of alpha format life in the future. Turning to the performance of our business segments, I'll begin with our U.S. Group Benefits results. Adjusted earnings were down 70% year-over-year on elevated COVID-19 life claims. In the U.S., overall, COVID-19 related deaths are 40% higher in the first quarter of 2021 than they were in the fourth quarter of 2020. For MetLife, our group life mortality ratio was 106.3%, well above the high end of our target range of 85% to 90%, with approximately 17 percentage points attributable to COVID-19 claims. The top line performance of the Group Benefits business was strong, with sales up 45% year-over-year. We are doing especially well with national accounts. And if trends hold, we expect the group business to deliver a record sales year. Adjusted PFO growth was also solid at 16% with the addition of Versant Health being a large contributor. In Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 92% year-over-year, driven by higher VII. Beyond VII, adjusted earnings were still strong on favorable underwriting and volume growth. Looking ahead, we continue to see a robust pension risk transfer pipeline. Rising equity markets and interest rates have improved pension plan funding levels and lowered the cost for plan sponsors to transact with an insurer. Within Asia, we saw a similar earnings pattern to RIS. Adjusted earnings were up 70% year-over-year on a constant currency basis driven by higher VII. However, even allowing for VII, adjusted earnings were strong driven by favorable foreign exchange rates, volume growth and underwriting. Sales in the region were up 12% on a constant currency basis, even with the COVID resurgence in certain markets. In Latin America, adjusted earnings were down 57% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily due to the pandemic. COVID related claims in the quarter totaled approximately $150 million, mainly in Mexico. In EMEA, adjusted earnings of $71 million were down 11% on a constant currency basis on higher coverage related claims as well as higher expenses compared to the favorable prior year quarter. Sales were up 4% on a constant currency basis, with strong momentum in the U.K. employee benefits space. To finish my business segment discussion, I think a theme is clear. If you look past higher VII and mortality in the quarter, the underlying performance of the business was very solid. On the fundamentals, we continue to demonstrate consistent execution with strong earnings power across a range of different economic scenarios. Turning to cash and capital management. MetLife ended the first quarter with cash at the holding company of $3.8 billion, near the top end of our $3 billion to $4 billion target buffer. Our two-year average free cash flow ratio remains within our guidance range of 65% to 75%. Currently, our cash balances are much higher following the receipt of $3.94 billion of proceeds on the sale of our U.S. P&C business. During the quarter, we were pleased to return $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders, $1 billion in share repurchases and approximately $400 million in common stock dividends. So far in Q2, we have bought back an additional $210 million of common shares, and we have roughly $1.6 billion remaining under our current repurchase authorization. Last week, our Board of Directors approved a second quarter 2021 common stock dividend of $0.48 per share, up 4.3% from the first quarter. Over the last decade, we have increased our common dividend at a 10% compound annual growth rate. Our consistent execution continues to generate strong free cash flow that allows us to invest in growth and return capital to our shareholders, all with the goal of driving long-term value creation. As we look ahead, we see a path to a brighter future from both an economic and health perspective. In the United States, conditions look promising for a period of employment growth, which is always good for our group business. On the pandemic front, we believe the worst of the underwriting effects on our company are behind us as the vaccine rollout continues to advance. The progress is not yet uniform across the world, and certain areas are still struggling, but the trend line is clear, a slow but steady return to something we can call normalcy. While we welcome an improving external environment, we also remain laser-focused on executing our strategy to ensure we are prepared for the post pandemic world. For our customers, we continue to accelerate our digital transformation to meet their evolving needs. In Japan, for example, 95% of our policy submissions are now done digitally. For our employees, we will be implementing a more flexible workplace model in Q3, which for most will be a hybrid approach. While our people have performed exceptionally well, working from home during the pandemic, we believe the office will continue to play a critical role in fostering collaboration, innovation and career development. We are equally confident that by incorporating more virtual work into our model, we will enhance productivity gain access to a broader talent pool and strengthen employee engagement. To close this morning, I want to emphasize the urgency we are filling up MetLife to keep raising our game. As I said in my annual letter to shareholders, consistent execution is our new baseline. Continuous improvement is our new aspiration and expectation. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to John. Yes, hi, good morning Elyse, it's Michel. So let me start at a high level by just reiterating our philosophy and our approach, which is that beyond supporting organic growth and in the absence of strategic accretive risk-adjusted hurdle rate clearing M&A, excess capital belongs to our shareholders. And we define excess capital as cash or cash equivalents at our holding companies above our liquidity buffer, which is still the $3 billion to $4 billion that we've discussed. As you know, we bought back $1 billion in the first quarter. We ended the quarter with $3.8 billion in cash at our holding companies. So that's within our $3 billion to $4 billion buffer. And we did so with the full knowledge that we would close shortly on the sale of our P&C company and substantially boost our cash and excess capital position. We have $1.6 billion remaining on our repurchase authorization, which we will extinguish in 2021. And historically, we've managed our authorization deliberately and expeditiously, particularly in the wake of major divestments. So expect us to do the same here. Yes. Again, here, I would just maybe start with sort of our approach and philosophy, which again, is - has been very consistent and no change there. So we will always look for M&A opportunities that fit our strategy that are accretive over time for our shareholders. We have a constant basis globally through which we evaluate opportunities based on value and cash generation. All M&A opportunities will need to earn more than their cost of capital. And we determine what we're willing to pay for a business by evaluating capital markets, the cost of raising capital and synergies. And acquisition opportunities will need to be more attractive than share repurchases. So what we do is we try to achieve a healthy balance between returning cash to our shareholders and investing in attractive future growth through M&A. And I think some of the sort of recent transactions that we've done, such as Versant Health last year, but first acquisition prior to that, Logan Circle a couple of years back, I think those give you a sense of sort of what that - sort of approach or strategy that I outlined. So no change here. Yes. I'm not sure - hi Suneet, Michel. I'm not sure we provided a guide, but let me just remind of what we said on the outlook, which is that this year's expense ratio will be pressured because of the sale of P&C, which has a lower direct expense ratio and that we would expect to get back to at or below the 12.3% by 2022. Now, obviously, we came in at 11% in Q1. A few factors that contributed to this. One is the PFO growth, obviously. And I think there were - in John's comments, we mentioned some of the impact of participating group life contracts, for example, on that PFO growth. Versant was an important also factor there. Then we had really good expense discipline across our businesses. And we did have also some, I would say, timing related expenses that maybe benefited us by about 25 basis points. So our expectation for the second to fourth quarter is that the expense ratio will be consistent with our full year outlook guidance. And as I said, we believe that 12.3% is the right level for us, because that allows us to continue to make important investments in our business. So no change in terms of how you should look at the balance of the year. Hi, Mike. I mean, I would just refer you back to our overall sort of approach and philosophy and the track record also post divestment. And I think that should give you a good sense of how we would sort of move forward here. Great, thank you. So let me close by saying that we're very pleased with our first quarter financial results. While they were puts and takes with variable investment income and mortality, our underlying results showed both strength and positive momentum across our business segment. We consider the quarter's results and other installment on our commitment to consistent execution and we look forward to continuing to generate long term value for all our stakeholders. Thank you for joining us this morning and have a great day."

            "name": "Ramy Tadros",
            "content": "Erik, it's Ramy here. As we've discussed in John's remarks, the group results this quarter were primarily a frequency effect. So we saw the significant increase in the total number of population deaths. And that was accompanied by a secondary effect, which is a severity effect, whereby we did see an increase in the percentage of claims under 65. And those claims, which tend to be for working employees, do have a higher face amount. So if you think about it and if you think about the outlook going forward, we're watching that composition very carefully. But I would say that the primary driver in the second quarter is still going to be the frequency, right? So as you know, with the rollout of the vaccine, the COVID related deaths in the population have been declining. If you do any comparison between, say, January average death number to April has been a significant decline. So while we still have a substantial number of deaths coming through, therefore, expect to see an elevated mortality ratio in the second quarter. We do expect the underwriting ratio to come down from its Q1 highs. Hi, Suneet, it's Ramy here. So I'll start off with the sales. We're really pleased with our performance this quarter. And as John mentioned, 2021 is shaping up to be a record year for us in terms of Group Benefits. I would say the three drivers of sales; the first one is a significant uptick in the jumbo activity in national accounts. Now that's coming off a low in 2020, but this is our sweet spot. This is where we excel, and we've done exceptionally well this quarter there. I would also remind you, just for jumbo accounts, these sales can be lumpy from year-to-year. Beyond that, if you look at products and markets, we've just seen, I would say, strength across the board from a product perspective, as well as increased sales in both regional and small. So it's pretty even. And then, the last driver of sales I would point to is, we continue to successfully execute on our enrollment and reenrollment strategy at the worksite that we've talked about on prior occasions. So we're seeing pretty strong underlying sales growth there.  When it comes to PFO growth, which we think is the actual measure that best captures the top line of this business; you really need to peel back from that 16%, 5 points due to these participating contracts. So think about 11 as the underlying growth there, and that is in line with our expectations and in line with our outlook. So we're very pleased with that result as well. And the PFO drivers, in addition to sales, would be strong persistency. We continue to see very high persistency with our customers. And our value proposition is resonating with those customers, and they're doing more business with us. We're getting all of our rate actions at renewals also in line with our expectations. And then also what's driving the PFO number, coming back to that reenrollment strategy, is very disciplined execution of our voluntary strategy in the work site. And so, we continue to see those double-digit growth in voluntary in that PFO number. We don't break that out. At the transaction, we did indicate that we that we expected to add about $1.3 billion of PFO from Versant in the year. So you can use that as a framework. Sure. So I'll keep this brief. In the quarter, the two I'll point out to, one is dental. We did see some benefit from lower utilization early in the quarter. But as we expected, the utilization normalized back in line with historical levels as the quarter progressed. And then in disability, we're still seeing very favorable results. We saw a slight uptick in incidence rates from years ago, but we continue to see positive trends on recoverability there."

            "name": "Kishore Ponnavolu",
            "content": "Erik, this is Kishore. So we did have a pretty strong quarter in terms of sales growth, 7% sequentially and 12% compared to prior year. This is certainly a good performance, especially given the COVID environment. Even in Japan, we had several prefectures under the state of emergency there during much of Q1. And then the other Asia markets had varying degrees of social distancing measures in place. Clearly, COVID and the resurgence here in Asia is a significant headwind given that the vast majority of our sales are face-to-face. However, as I mentioned earlier, the diversity of our channels and products, the strength of our bank partnerships and the strong execution focus of our businesses, that's what powers MetLife sales resiliency even in this tough environment. In addition, we've been making significant investments in digitizing our sales processes, all the way from video conferencing, co-browsing, remote closing and they've certainly aided our performance as well. As Michel mentioned in his opening remarks, 95% of our new sales application submissions in Japan are digital. And the other markets are in a similar range as well. For example, in China, almost all our agent onboarding and new business submissions are done digitally. Specifically with regards to Japan, it's, again, 8% up sequentially. And even after taking seasonality into account, our face-to-face channels that sell life and A&H products were quite resilient, while we recorded strong annuity sales growth to the bank channel. Clearly, we have strengthened the FX-denominated products and our bank relationships, and that strength shows. Other Asia, 8% up, sequentially up 30% year-over-year. Again, this speaks to, I think, the strength of our market presence across these markets and strong execution across the board. And our digital solutions are also helping us in a big way. With regards to the outlook for the rest of the year, we're very comfortable and on track to meet the full guidance of double-digit sales growth."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "John McCallion",
            "content": "Thank you, Michel. I will start with the 1Q 2021 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our cash and capital positions. Starting on Page 3. We provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the first quarter. Net income in the quarter was $290 million or approximately $1.7 billion lower than adjusted earnings. This variance was primarily due to net derivative losses as a result of the significant rise in long-term interest rates as well as stronger equity markets in 1Q 2021. Our investment portfolio and our hedging program continue to perform as expected. On Page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment. There were no notable items for either period. Adjusted earnings per share benefited from exceptionally strong returns in our private equity portfolio and were up 39% and 38% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. Group Benefits, adjusted earnings were down 70% year-over-year, largely driven by unfavorable group life mortality due to elevated COVID-19 related life claims. Favorable non-medical health underwriting and volume growth were partial offsets. Overall, results for Group Benefits were mixed. Adjusted earnings were down, but underlying fundamentals, including top line growth and persistency were strong. Group Benefits sales were up 45% year-over-year, primarily due to higher jumbo case activity. We believe that we are on track to deliver a record sales year in 2021. Adjusted PFOs were $5.6 billion, up 16% year-over-year due to solid volume growth across most products, the addition of Versant Health and roughly 5 percentage points related to higher premiums from participating contracts, which can fluctuate with claims experience. I will discuss Group Benefits underwriting in more detail shortly. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 92% year-over-year. The primary driver was higher variable investment income, largely due to strong private equity returns. In addition, elevated COVID-19 mortality and volume growth were positive contributors. RIS investment spreads were 234 basis points up 120 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 88 basis points, up 5 basis points year-over-year primarily due to the decline in LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures, including U.K. longevity reinsurance, grew 12% year-over-year due to strong volume growth across the product portfolio as well as separate account investment performance. With regard to U.K. longevity reinsurance, we have continued to see strong growth since completing our initial transaction in 2Q 2020. The notional balance stands at $8.8 billion at March 31, up nearly $5 billion from year-end 2020. And as previously announced, first quarter results for Property & Casualty are reflected as a divested business in our quarterly financial statements. The sale of the auto and home business to farmers insurance closed on April 7, and we expect to record an after-tax gain of approximately $1 billion in 2Q 2021 Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 78% and 70% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income as well as volume growth and favorable underwriting margins. Asia's solid volume growth was driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 6% and 4% on a constant currency basis. Asia sales were up 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, with growth across most markets. Latin America adjusted earnings were down 58% and 57% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting, partially offset by the improvement in equity markets. Elevated COVID-19 related claims, primarily in Mexico, impacted Latin America's adjusted earnings by approximately $150 million after-tax. Looking ahead, we expect COVID-19 claims to decrease throughout the year, more significantly in the second half, and adjusted earnings to return to 2019 levels in 2022, which is consistent with our outlook. Latin America adjusted PFOs were down 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis due to lower single premium immediate annuities sales in Chile. EMEA adjusted earnings were down 9% and 11% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by higher COVID-19 related claims as well as higher expenses compared to the favorable prior year quarter. EMEA adjusted PFOs were down 5% on a constant currency basis, but sales were up 4% on a constant currency basis, due to strong growth in U.K. employee benefits. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 123%. This increase was primarily driven by higher variable investment income, largely due to private equity returns. Also, favorable equity markets and long-term care underwriting were positive drivers. Long-term care benefited from higher policy and claim terminations as well as lower claim incidences. The life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 54.8%, higher than the prior year quarter of 51% and at the top end of our annual target range of 50% to 55% due to elevated COVID-19 mortality. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $171 million. This result is consistent with our 2021 adjusted loss guidance range of $650 million to $750 million. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 20.8% and within our 2021 guidance range of 20% to 22%. Now I will provide more detail on Group Benefits 1Q 2021 underwriting performance on Page 5. There were approximately 200,000 COVID-19 related deaths in the U.S. in the first quarter, the highest single quarter since the pandemic began and up nearly 40% versus the fourth quarter of 2020. In addition to the higher number of claims, there were more deaths at younger ages below 65, which resulted in increased claim severity. Apart from COVID-19, the number of life insurance claims of greater than $2 million nearly doubled versus a typical quarter. The group life mortality ratio was 106.3% in the first quarter, which included roughly 17 percentage points related to COVID-19 life claims. This reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $280 million after-tax. For group non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 71.1% in the first quarter, with favorable experience across most products. The 1Q 2021 ratio was below the prior year quarter of 71.7% and at the low end of our annual target range of 70% to 75%. Now let's turn to VII in the quarter on Page 6. This chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income over the last five quarters, including approximately $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2021. This very strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio, which had a 13.3% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equities are generally accounted for on a one quarter lag. Our first quarter results were essentially in line with private equity industry benchmarks, while all private equity classes performed well in the quarter, our venture capital funds, which account for roughly 20% of our PE account balance of $10.3 billion were strongest performer across sub-sectors with a roughly 25% quarterly return due to a broad increase in tech company valuations. On Page 7, first quarter VII of $1.1 billion post-tax is shown by segment. The attribution of VII by business is based on the quarterly returns for each segment's individual portfolio. As noted previously, RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia generally account for approximately 90% or more of the total VII and are split roughly one-third each although it can vary from quarter-to-quarter. VII results in 1Q 2021 were more heavily weighted toward RIS and MetLife Holdings, as Asia's portfolio has a smaller proportion of the venture capital funds that I referenced earlier. Turning to Page 8. This chart shows our direct expense ratio over the prior five quarters and full year 2020, including 11% in the first quarter of 2021. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. In 1Q 2021, our favorable direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline as well as delayed investment spending in the quarter. We expect the direct expense ratio for the remainder of 2021 to be consistent with our full year outlook. Now I will discuss our cash and capital position on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $3.8 billion at March 31, which is down from $4.5 billion at December 31, but well within our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential decrease in cash at the holding companies was primarily due to the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of approximately $1 billion in the first quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. Looking ahead, we expect holdco cash will be significantly higher in the second quarter as a result of the sale of our auto and home business to farmers insurance. Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, our combined NAIC RBC ratio was 392% at year-end 2020 and comfortably above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, excluding our Property & Casualty business, preliminary first quarter 2021 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.5 billion, while statutory net income was approximately $570 million. Statutory operating earnings increased by roughly $2.3 billion year-over-year driven by lower VA rider reserves, an increase in interest margins, higher net investment income and lower operating expenses. Statutory net income, excluding our P&C business, increased by roughly $430 million year-over-year driven by higher operating earnings, partially offset by an increase in after-tax derivative losses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital, excluding P&C was approximately $16.7 billion as of March 31, down 2% compared to December 31. Favorable operating earnings were more than offset by after-tax derivative losses and dividends paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 967% as of December 31, which is the latest public data. In summary, MetLife delivered another strong quarter, which benefited from exceptional private equity returns, solid business fundamentals and ongoing expense discipline. While higher mortality in the U.S. and Mexico dampened adjusted earnings in Group Benefits in Latin America, our financial performance demonstrates the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities. In addition, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are strong, resilient and position us for success. We are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler, more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Sure, Andrew. So, if you - if we parse out the total Asia sales into Japan and other Asia, they will pretend for a minute. While sequentially and even on the previous calls right, we've been making steady progress in Japan sales since Q2, right? Q3 was better than Q2, last year Q4 was better than Q3. And Q1 is a build off of Q4 from last year. And if you then say, okay, where is this coming from? A couple of things. We have three broad product lines, life, A&H and annuities. And then we have a couple of channels, right? We've got essentially what I would broadly classify as face-to-face channels. We can go further breakdown of that, but that's not needed for this call and - the good news for us is even in this tough environment, our face-to-face channels were pretty resilient from a year-over-year perspective. There's a little bit of pressure on A&H, but our life segment pretty much held flat. And then much of the growth came in from the annuities, which are primarily sold through banks. And in the previous calls, I talked a lot about our advantages in the annuity space on the FX because these are all foreign currency or dollar denominated. And we have many advantages that we bring to the table on that and also the strength of the bank partnerships that we bring to the table as well. So because of that, because of this diversification of products and diversification of channels and our lean in on our strengths that's basically contributed to the resiliency of our sales in Japan. Now with regards to - and by the way, this has not been easy. I have to tell you that. But our teams on the ground have done, I think, a fantastic job with regards to that. Now again, this is playing out, right? I can't sit here and say, this is definitive because COVID is a factor that's an ongoing concern across Asia. With regards to other Asia, again, very strong sales growth. But remember, last year, the pressure started early outside of Japan, in China, right, because of COVID. And so the year-over-year comparisons look very favorable on the other Asia segment. But again, I think I'd lean more on the strength of our businesses and our market presence in terms of how we've executed this quarter. Korea was very strong in terms of performance. India was also strong in performance from a sales perspective. We've recovered nicely in China, which is a major factor. Again, COVID is still a factor in all these markets. And we continue to stay focused on execution. At the end, that's what it boils down to. I hope that helps. Good morning, Tom, sorry for the voice. Just overcoming little COVID recovery here. So all right, let me try to take that. Look, it's probably not going to go too far back because that was the whole reason we gave you in guidance, right? But look, we talked about some pretty large one-time items in the third and fourth quarter last year from prepayments and other things like that. And we knew those things weren't going to recur. And so those - that's probably one item. Second is we did reference that new re-class and real estate funds up into VII. And that probably cost another four points of shift. So we really kind of migrate back to the range. I mean I wouldn't go backwards so much as I would think about how we look relative to the guidance we gave in February. And I think we're right in line, I mean, maybe even slightly above this quarter. But honestly, the 80s is probably a little above. And I think the outlook, putting aside yet VII, is intact. Yes. Let me clarify where you're going. So, that - I'm not talking about prepayment income when I said that there were prepayment activities impacting the non-VII spread in the third and fourth quarter. What happened was we saw just a real jump in refinancing, and that was impacting the RMBS securities and how they were running off. And that was having a jump in our non-VII spread. So, hopefully, that helps. Suneet, I'll just add that, like, just to the point on the guide, we give an annual guide. This quarter came in much better than we thought. But if you adjust for this quarter and think about the rest, we're expecting to be slightly above this year, but trending well. Hi Mike. Good to hear you. Yeah. So, I'd say things are trending positively in the space. It's still slow. Rates are still low. Spreads are wide. But things are emerging. And I think our philosophy has been to just continue to be ready. But it's - there's a lot of activity and we're just going to make sure we're ready to act if something is value accretive. So I don't think there's any material change from the last call."

            "name": "Steve Goulart",
            "content": "Andrew, it's Steve Goulart. Good morning. Let me talk a little bit about the overall strategy because we've been investing in private equity for a number of years and have always felt it to be a very strong component of our overall strategy. Venture capital, of course, is a significant portion of the portfolio. But basically, we take a look at this portfolio the same way we look at our credit portfolio, our real estate portfolio. It's about diversification, and that's what we've really tried to build in this. Again, just sort of recapping some of the numbers. Our PE portfolio produced income of almost $1.3 billion or 13.3% return. Again, Venture capital was - led the way as far as its total return. But think about what was happening in the market, too, with a lot of IPO activity and the like of things that Michel cited in his comments. So the important thing is that our returns were attractive across the portfolio, and I'd look at things like our LBO portfolio both domestically and in Europe. And again, this reflects the diversity that's in the entire portfolio and when we look to invest, we continue to invest in a diverse way across all the different sectors as well. I mean, just to give you a little bit more flavor on it. We have over 600 funds that we've invested in. We have almost 200 managers. So, again, very broad, very deep exposure across all the sectors of private equity. And again, I think you have to take into consideration what was happening in the environment, and when we think about it, despite the pandemic, equity valuations continued decline in the fourth quarter. The combination of fiscal and monetary stimulus continued to be major contributors that led to strong equity performance really across all sectors. And so I would think about it in that respect that we really think of this as a diversified private equity portfolio. Now that all said, we do think that the past quarter was probably something of an anomaly because when we look at our historical experience, at least until this quarter. Now, it has been that our PE returns have always been moderated versus the S&P 500, particularly in high market return quarters. So this was an unusual quarter in that respect. And when we think about future returns or relationships, we still think that what we've been saying for the last couple of years as far as our plans go, the kind of low single - or low double-digits 12% is still the right way for us to think about these returns. Again, it's going to be vary quarter-by-quarter, but that's how we think about this on a long-term basis and again, it just reflects our continued efforts to have a very diversified portfolio across all sectors. Prepayment income is still in that number. It's just dwarfed by our alternative income. They're fairly modest on the prepayments."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings and Outlook Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about the forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.\nJohn Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife's fourth quarter 2022 earnings and near-term outlook call. Before we begin, I'd point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides which address the quarter as well as our near term outlook. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. An appendix to the slides features outlook sensitivities, disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information, which you should also review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In light of the busy morning, Q&A will promptly end at the top of the hour. [Operator Instructions] With that, over to Michel.\nMichel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As I look back on 2022, I am pleased with the relevance of our Next Horizon strategy and how it positioned us to absorb the challenges presented in the year and to succeed going forward. 2022 was a year still affected by COVID, and we incurred an impact of more than $650 million pretax. For the year, we saw pretax variable investment income come in 19% lower than our outlook expectation on lower returns in our private equity portfolio. And from a macroeconomic perspective, we felt pressure from rising inflation, a falling equity market and a stronger dollar. Yet despite these hurdles, MetLife performed. Our strategy proved its resilience and our consistent execution driven by discipline and determination paid off in 2022. We delivered an adjusted return on equity of 12.3% for the year, meeting our target for this important metric. We pushed ourselves, driven by our efficiency mindset and succeeded in posting a full year direct expense ratio of 12.2%. Our strong 2022 free cash flow generation enabled us to hit our 2 year free cash flow ratio target of 65% to 75%. This fueled the return of $4.9 billion of cash to our shareholders. And finally, we ended the year with $5.4 billion of cash and liquid assets at our holding companies, arming us with ample financial flexibility. With our great set of market-leading businesses, good growth prospects around the world and the strength of our balance sheet and our free cash flow generation, I believe MetLife is very well positioned for the future. When we established our Next Horizon strategy at the end of 2019, we made several 5 year commitments against which we measure ourselves and, more importantly, hold ourselves accountable. I am pleased with our success to date in meeting those commitments. Even more, I am confident that we will beat each one. We committed to an adjusted return on equity of 12% to 14%. Today, we are boosting our target adjusted ROE range to 13% to 15%. This reflects, in part, our growth combined with our sustained discipline in pricing our products and in managing our capital. We said we would generate $20 billion over 5 years of free cash flow. We expect to exceed this target. We committed to freeing up an additional $1 billion over a 5 year period to invest in growth and innovation. Again, we are on track to overachieve against this target, and we are reaping the benefit of these investments. When we made these commitments, we did not expect U.S. interest rates to approach the lowest level in history, neither did we contemplate a global pandemic. While the environment may change, our accountability does not. We are also not content to maintain the status quo. We seek to challenge ourselves and push for more to raise the bar. Now let's turn to our fourth quarter 2022 results. Last night, we reported quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.2 billion or $1.55 per share, which compares to $1.8 billion or $2.17 per share a year ago. We generated strong underwriting results as COVID losses retreated further, while our recurring investment income continues to grow on higher new money rates. This was offset by variable investment income falling below our quarterly outlook expectation and a stronger dollar. Shifting to the full year 2022, the diversification of MetLife's portfolio of market-leading businesses once again proved its value. Most of our businesses and segments have returned to underlying levels of earnings equal to or greater than prior to the pandemic. Our U.S. Group Benefits business is a clear leader in this attractive segment of the life insurance industry. During the year, we grew our Group Benefits PFOs roughly 5% on top of double-digit growth the year prior. Our growth in Group Benefits represents more than $1 billion of new PFOs, bringing full year Group Benefit PFOs to approximately $23 billion. These numbers matter. First, we bring the broader set of products to our customers, life, dental, disability, vision, A&H, legal and pet insurance among many others, more than any other carrier. Second, Group Benefits is a business where you have to make significant investments to keep up with evolving customer and employer expectations. Our scale enables us to make those investments, to add products and capabilities and to further digitize and enhance the customer experience. All of this adds up to drive the growth and persistency we've achieved in our Group Benefits business over the last several years as well as the growth we expect to achieve in the future. Moving to highlights from other segments and businesses. Our Retirement and Income Solutions business produced its strongest year of pension risk transfer volume in our history, more than $12 billion, including our largest ever single deal. Our Asia segment continued to generate strong sales growth, topping 11% on a constant currency basis in a market that remained in COVID's grip for much of the year. And our Latin America segment enjoyed both strong top and bottom line results, particularly in Mexico, as a heightened awareness of the importance of the products we offer, coupled with a flight to quality, drove sales up 26% on a constant currency basis, pushed persistency higher and added to adjusted earnings. Moving to capital and cash. MetLife is well capitalized and has plenty of liquidity, well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. Our U.S. and international insurance businesses are self-funding. Our strong capital and liquidity position allows us to meet our commitments and obligations, but also equips us with the financial flexibility to seize attractive opportunities that may present an unsettled environment. We have built a clear track record in terms of how we deploy capital to its highest use. If we have opportunities to put capital to work organically or via mergers and acquisitions at appropriate risk-adjusted hurdle rates, we will do so. Case in point, we deployed approximately $3.8 billion of capital to support organic new business in 2022. Absent such opportunities, we will return capital to shareholders. In 2022, we paid to MetLife shareholders $1.6 billion of common stock dividends, and we repurchased $3.3 billion of common stock. In January, we purchased roughly an additional $250 million of common stock, and we have around $900 million remaining on our current authorization. Before I close, I would like to take a moment to recognize a true visionary in the history of MetLife. Harry Cayman, MetLife's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer from 1993 to 1998, passed away on December 20 at the age of 89. Harry spent nearly his entire career at MetLife, starting as a junior attorney. As Chairman and CEO, Harry infused MetLife with a new corporate vision and an emphasis on profitable growth, something very much in line with our current focus on responsible growth. Harry's passing reminds us of the debt we owe at MetLife to those that went before us and building this great company since its founding in 1868. In closing, our Next Horizon strategy continues to prove its resilience in a changing and shifting environment. Our total shareholder return of more than 19% in 2022 underscores the significant value we created for our shareholders against this backdrop. As we look ahead, our work is not done. We are raising the bar and setting our standards higher. As much as we have accomplished in recent years, I believe there is still much ahead for us to achieve. As the world has opened up, I was able to spend more time on the road than the last half of 2022 since the start of the pandemic. I'm more invigorated than ever to get out and meet face-to-face with our customers, our distribution partners, our employees and our shareholders. I look forward to updating some and introducing others to what we're building up MetLife, a company capable of being a quality compounder across a range of economic cycles. Now I'll turn it over to John to cover our performance and outlook in detail.\nJohn McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 4Q '22 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and update on our cash and capital positions and more detail on our near-term outlook. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year. Net income in 4Q of '22 was $1.3 billion or $88 million higher than adjusted earnings. Net investment gains in the fourth quarter were primarily driven by real estate sales, which were partially offset by losses on the fixed maturity portfolio due to normal trading activity in a rising rate environment. Credit losses in the portfolio remain modest. In addition, we had net derivative gains primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter. For the full year, net derivative losses accounted for most of the variance between net income and adjusted earnings, primarily due to higher interest rates in 2022. Overall, our hedging program continues to perform as expected. On Page 4, you can see the fourth quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding $140 million of notable tax items that were favorable in the fourth quarter of '21 and accounted for in Corporate and Other. Adjusted earnings in 4Q of '22 were $1.2 billion, down 28% and down 26% on a constant currency basis. Lower variable investment income drove the year-over-year decline, while higher recurring interest margins and favorable underwriting were partial offsets. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.55, down 23% year-over-year and down 21% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were $400 million versus $20 million in 4Q of '21, primarily due to significant improvement in underwriting margins aided by lower COVID-19 life claims, as well as higher volume growth. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins year-over-year. Group Life mortality ratio was 87.6% in the fourth quarter of '22, in the middle of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 69.4% in Q4 of '22, slightly below its annual target range of 70% to 75% and below the prior year quarter of 74.2%. The non-medical health ratio benefited from favorable disability severity, while dental was in line with expectations. Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were essentially flat year-over-year. As we discussed in prior quarters, excess mortality can result in higher premiums from participating life contracts in the period. The higher excess mortality in Q4 '21 versus Q4 of '22 resulted in year-over-year decline in premiums from participating contracts, which dampened growth by roughly 6 percentage points. The underlying PFO increase of approximately 6% was primarily due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. For the full year, Group Benefits adjusted PFO growth was 3%, while underlying growth, excluding excess premiums from participating contracts in 2021 versus 2022 was up 5% and within the 2022 target range of 4% to 6%. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 40% year-over-year. The primary driver was lower variable investment income, mostly due to weaker private equity returns. This was partially offset by favorable recurring interest margins year-over-year. RIS investment spreads were 96 basis points and 112 basis points excluding VII, up 21 basis points versus Q4 of '21 and up 11 basis points sequentially, primarily due to income from in-the-money interest rate caps. RIS liability exposures were down 1% year-over-year due to certain accounting adjustments that do not impact fees or spread income. That said, RIS had strong volume growth driven by sales up 23% in 2022. This was primarily driven by pension risk transfers and stable value products. In addition, we had a record sales quarter for structured settlements, demonstrating the strength of product diversification within RIS. With regards to PRT, we completed 6 transactions worth $12.2 billion in 2022, a record year for MetLife, and we continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were down 63% and down 62% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower variable investment income. In addition, we had a write-down of a deferred tax asset in China as it was determined that the accumulated tax losses were unlikely to be utilized within the required 5 year statutory period. The write-down of the DTA reduced Asia's adjusted earnings in Q4 of 2022 by $34 million after tax and was accounted for in net investment income due to the equity method of accounting treatment for our China joint venture. While Asia's underwriting was modestly unfavorable versus Q4 of '21, we saw a significant sequential improvement due to lower COVID claims in Japan. Asia's key growth metrics remained solid as general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 4% on a constant currency basis. And sales were up 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by FX annuities sold through face-to-face channels in Japan. For the full year, Asia sales were up 11%, exceeding its 2022 guidance of mid to high-single digits. Latin America adjusted earnings were $181 million, up 45% and up 51% on a constant currency basis. This strong performance was primarily driven by favorable underwriting and solid volume growth. Overall, COVID-19related deaths in Mexico were down significantly year-over-year. In addition, the Chilean encaje, which had a positive 6% return in 4Q '22 versus 4% in the prior year and higher recurring interest margins, were positive contributors. These two favorable items were partially offset by lower variable investment income year-over-year. LatAm's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs are up 20% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 22% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were $70 million, up 67% and up 112% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by favorable underwriting versus Q4 of '21, which had elevated COVID-19-related claims, particularly in the U.K. This was partially offset by less favorable expenses year-over-year. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 2% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 13% on a constant currency basis, reflecting solid growth across the region. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $208 million, down 57%. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income. In addition, less favorable expense margins and adverse equity market performance also reduced adjusted earnings year-over-year. Corporate and Other adjusted loss was $219 million versus an adjusted loss of $177 million in the prior year, which excludes favorable notable tax items of $140 million. Higher taxes and lower net investment income were partially offset by lower expenses year-over-year. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 19%, which includes favorable tax benefits primarily related to the settlement of an IRS audit. Excluding these favorable items, the company's effective tax rate was approximately 22%, within our 2022 guidance range of 21% to 23%. On Page 5, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the four quarters and full year of 2022. VII was $24 million in the fourth quarter. The private equity portfolio, which makes up the bulk of the VII asset balances, had a negative 0.3% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equities generally accounted for on a one quarter lag. For the full year, VII was $1.5 billion, below our 2022 target range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. Our private equity portfolio had a positive 7% return in 2022, a solid performance in comparison to the public equity markets with the S&P 500 down 19%. While VII underperformed in 4Q '22, our new money rate increased to 5.66%, which was 150 basis points above our roll-off yield of 4.16%. On Page 6, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the four quarters and full year 2022. On a full year basis, you will note RIS MetLife Holdings in Asia continue to earn the vast majority of variable investment income, consistent with the higher VII assets in their respective investment portfolios. VII assets are primarily owned to match longer-dated liabilities, which are mostly in these three businesses. Turning to Page 7. This chart shows the comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior eight quarters and full year 2021 and 2022. Our direct expense ratio in 4Q of '22 was elevated at 13.1%, reflecting the impact from seasonal enrollment costs in Group Benefits, as well as higher employee-related costs and timing of certain projects. That said, as we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. For the full year of 2022, our direct expense ratio was 12.2%, below our annual target of 12.3%. We believe this result once again demonstrates our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset in a challenging inflationary environment while continuing to make investments in our businesses. I will now discuss our cash and capital positions on Page 8. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.4 billion at December 31, which was up from $5.2 billion at September 30 and remained above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential increase in cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of approximately $600 million in the fourth quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. For the 2 year period, 2021 to 2022, our average free cash flow ratio, excluding notable items, totaled 68% and was within our 65% to 75% target range. In terms of statutory capital for our U.S. companies, we expect our combined 2022 NAIC RBC ratio will be above our 360% target. Preliminary 2022 statutory operating earnings for our U.S. companies were approximately $2.6 billion, while net income was approximately $3 billion. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was $18.3 billion as of December 31, 2022, a decrease of 3% sequentially, primarily due to derivative losses and dividends paid, partially offset by operating earnings and investment gains. Finally, while our Japan solvency margin ratio dipped below 500% as of September 30, we expect the Japan SMR to be approximately 700% as of December 31, which will be based on statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks. As we have discussed on prior calls, our Japan business as well as MetLife overall does better economically in a higher interest rate environment. However, given the asymmetrical nature of how the SMR is calculated, the ratio declines in a rising rate environment as assets are mark-to-market, but not the corresponding liabilities. As a result, we executed an internal reinsurance transaction in December with our Bermuda entity, which has an economic-based solvency regime. This transaction improved the Japan SMR ratio by approximately 250 percentage points. Before I shift to our near-term outlook, starting on Page 9, a few points on what we included in the appendix. The chart on Page 15 reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments from 2017 through 2021. This is the same chart that we showed as part of our 3Q '22 supplemental slides, but we felt it was worth including again for the sake of completeness. Also, Pages 16 through 19 provide interest rate assumptions and key outlook sensitivities by line of business. Turning back to Page 9, our 2023 to 2025 outlook reflects the impacts of the new accounting requirements of long-duration targeted improvement or LDTI. While 2022 actually used for growth rate calculations remain as previously reported on a pre-LDTI basis. In mid-April or roughly two to three weeks prior to the reporting of our 1Q '23 earnings, we plan to provide you with a recasted QFS based on LDTI for each of the quarters in 2022. While there would be certain positive and negative effects depending on product and segment, we do not expect the underlying run rate of adjusted earnings for the firm overall to change materially. Now let's turn to Page 10 for further details on our near-term outlook. We assume COVID-19 to be endemic, consistent with the recent trends that we have been experiencing. We expect continued uncertainty to persist around inflation and a potential recession in 2023. Based on the 12/31/22 forward curve, we expect interest rates to rise in 2023. Finally, for purposes of the near-term outlook, we assume a 5% annual return for the S&P 500 and a 12% annual return for private equity. This is consistent with our long-term historical returns for PE. Moving to near-term targets. We are increasing our adjusted ROE range to 13% to 15%. This increase of 100 basis points from our prior 12% to 14% ROE range is a function of the growing impact of our mix of business and higher new business returns over the last several years as well as the impact of LDTI. We expect to maintain our 2 year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75% of adjusted earnings, excluding total notable items. Our direct expense ratio guidance for 2023 is being recalibrated to reflect LDTI by approximately 30 basis points to 12.6%. This captures an approximate $1 billion reduction in adjusted PFOs, excluding PRTs, due to the change in accounting. This is primarily related to certain annuity contracts within RIS as well as shifting certain variable annuity fees to market risk benefits, which are reported outside adjusted earnings. Since this change in accounting to LDTI will be retroactively applied back to the beginning of 2021, our previously reported direct expense ratios will likewise be recalibrated to put 2021 and 2022 on the same basis as 2023 and beyond. Our VII for 2023 is expected to be approximately $2 billion after applying our historical average returns on asset balances. I'll provide more detail on VII in a moment. Our Corporate and Other adjusted loss target is expected to remain at $650 million to $750 million after tax in 2023. We are increasing our expected effective tax rate range by 1 point to 22% to 24% to reflect our expectation for higher earnings in foreign markets and lower tax credits in the U.S. At the bottom of the page, you'll see certain interest rate sensitivities relative to our base case, reflecting a relatively modest impact on adjusted earnings over the near term. On Page 11, the chart reflects our VII average asset balances from $14.7 billion in 2021 to $19 billion expected in 2023. Private equities will continue to hold the vast majority of our VII asset balances. We are applying our historical annual returns for each asset class within VII. In addition to the PE annual return of 12%, we expect an annual 7% return for real estate and other funds. Finally, as a reminder, we include prepayment fees on fixed maturities and mortgage loans in VII. So now I will discuss our near term outlook for our business segments. Let's start with the U.S. on Page 12. For Group Benefits, excluding the excess premium from participating group life contracts of approximately $750 million in 2022, adjusted PFOs are expected to grow at 4% to 6% annually. Regarding underwriting, we expect the Group Life mortality ratio to be between 85% to 90%. We are also maintaining the expected group non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio at 70% to 75%. Keep in mind, these are annual ratios and are typically higher in the first quarter for both Group Life and Non-Medical Health given the seasonality of the business. For RIS, we are maintaining our 2% to 4% expected annual growth for total liability exposures across our general account spread and fee-based businesses. We are increasing the range of our expected annual RIS investment spread by 40 basis points to 135 to 160 basis points in 2023. The majority of this increase is driven by continued expectations of rising interest rates on the short end of the curve and the resulting benefit of interest rate cap income, which we expect to peak in the first half of 2023. In addition, LDTI will contribute approximately 10 basis points to the investment spread calculation while not increasing adjusted earnings. Upon transition to LDTI, the unlocking of future cash flow assumptions to current best estimate increased our deferred profit liability, which is amortized into earnings and will now be included in the spread calculation, reducing other sources of earnings. Overall, the conversion to LDTI will not significantly change RIS run rate adjusted earnings. For MetLife Holdings, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to decline 12% to 14% in 2023, driven by the normal runoff of the business, market declines and the transition to LDTI. Beyond 2023, we expect annual PFOs to decline 6% to 8%. We are lowering the life interest adjusted benefit ratio target to 40% to 45% in 2023 from the prior 45% to 50% target to reflect the impact of lowering policyholder dividend levels. Finally, we are maintaining the adjusted earnings guidance of $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2023. Now let's look at the near-term guidance of our businesses outside the U.S. on Page 13. For Asia, we expect the recent sales momentum to continue and generate mid to high-single-digit growth on a constant currency basis over the near term. In addition, we expect general account AUM to maintain mid-single-digit growth on a constant currency basis. We expect Asia's adjusted earnings, excluding $270 million of COVID-19 claims in 2022, to grow at mid-single digits over the near term. For Latin America, we expect adjusted PFOs to grow by low double digits over the near term. We expect our adjusted earnings to grow high single digits over the near term, excluding roughly $80 million due to favorable market-related factors in 2022. Finally, for EMEA, we are expecting sales and adjusted PFOs to grow mid to high single digits on a constant currency basis over the near term. We expect EMEA run rate adjusted earnings to be roughly $55 million per quarter in 2023, reflecting the impact of currency headwinds and then grow by high single digits in 2024 and 2025. Let me conclude by saying that MetLife delivered a good quarter to close out another strong year, reflecting the strength of our business fundamentals, solid top line growth, favorable underwriting and ongoing expense discipline. While private equity returns were down this quarter, core spreads remained robust. In addition, results in our market-leading franchises, Group Benefits and Latin America continued their strong growth and recovery. Finally, our commitment to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth positions MetLife to build sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\nQ - Erik Bass: Hi. Thank you. So we've recently seen an increase in the number of layoffs announcements, particularly from larger employers. So I was just hoping you could talk about what you're seeing from your clients, particularly in the group business and then what you're assuming for employment and wage inflation in your 4% to 6% PFO growth outlook?\nRamy Tadros: Thanks, Erik. It's Ramy here. So the short answer is we're not seeing any impacts across our group business today; in fact, quite the opposite. So maybe let me give you just a couple of overall points before I get into the specifics of our business. So if you think about a recession and a potential recession, as you know, no two recessions are the same, so sitting here, it's really difficult to speculate how a potential recession scenario could play out in terms of the employment levels and particularly as to which segment of the economy that would impact. And the second point, before I get into the specifics of the business, we've all seen the headlines. But overall, we're still sitting in a pretty tight labor market with pretty - with low unemployment levels. And you also have to remember when you look at group benefits, their underlying long-term trends with respect to the dynamics in the workplace, which really favor benefits, and we see those trends continuing thought out [ph] in the future. So if you think about specifically our franchise, while we're certainly not immune to a downturn, there are a number of important mitigants in our business which make us fairly resilient from a top line and a bottom line perspective and, I would say, give us real confidence sitting here today with respect to our guidance ratios in terms of PFO growth. So let me just give you kind of a bit of a sense of what gives us that confidence. From a top line perspective, our book is highly diversified by industry and by size of employer, which limits our diversification, our exposure to any single segment. So really diversification is our friend here and is crucial to our ability to perform. As we stand here in January, we're off to a great start in '23. We're seeing excellent sales momentum across the business. And we had an in-force book that has performed exceptionally well, both with respect to the 1/1 persistency and renewal as well as the rate actions. And we still see significant growth opportunities in our market, and those are direct results of the investments which Michel referenced. So we've spoken about those in the past, be they be the voluntary opportunity with respect to enrollment strategies in the workplace, be it the market-leading national accounts business that we have or be it growth in regional markets where we see a fragmented marketplace that's consolidating. So all in all, you put all of this thing - all of this picture together in terms of our starting point and the profile of our business, and that gives us a pretty high degree of confidence with respect to the guidance range. The underlying assumptions, specific to your second question, really I'll guide you back to the assumptions that John mentioned in the outlook assumptions with respect to an uncertain environment with the potential for a recession. But despite that, we feel pretty good about our guidance ranges.\nErik Bass: Great. Thanks, Ramy. And then my second question was just on what's enabling the earnings for MetLife Holdings to be so resilient despite the decline in PFOs and then the lower equity markets that we saw last year? I guess related, at what point should earnings start to follow the PFOs lower?\nJohn McCallion: Good morning, Erik. It's John. Great question. We have had some resiliency in our runoff business here. So we did provide a guidance raise of 1 to 1.2. Let me start with just PFO decline versus earnings. So as I referenced in my opening remarks, one aspect of LDTI is for our VAs, we do move some of the fees down below the line. That's a revenue decline, but it's not an earnings decline. The way we have - our policy has been that we've attributed fees to the guarantees. And to the extent that they're below the line, we would put 100% of those fees below the line. So as you move, we have a number of SOP 03-1, which is kind of the accrual-based accounting, as you move them down below the line, so does the claims. So you see this like this kind of breakage between revenue decline but earnings staying flat. And then we did have - this is probably one of the businesses with a marginal positive from LDTI. And so that's probably another item. And then thirdly, I think it's the optimization efforts. Now the team has done a great job and continue to look for ways to find improvements around expenses, around contracts. And I think, all in all, we think with the guidance in terms of equity outlook, 1 to 1.2 is a good range.\nErik Bass: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nTom Gallagher: Good morning. Hey, sticking with Holdings, been a few of your peers like Aegon and Ameriprise saying they're going to pass on doing VA risk transfer deals because the pricing didn't work. I'm wondering whether your view has changed at all or maybe just give an update on what are you thinking about a potential risk transfer deal for Holdings. Has the environment changed there or pricing changed at all?\nJohn McCallion: Good morning, Tom. It's John. Yes, I don't think any update or change for us. I think we've been pretty transparent about this. This is not an easy solution, particularly when you're talking about a reinsurance arrangement. It is complex. I think particularly when it's a reinsurance, you're looking for a good partner and you're looking for to ensure that not only is it beneficial for us, but beneficial for them. And so there is a - you do have to look for ways for common ground. And sometimes that works out, and sometimes it doesn't. It hasn't changed our perspective on optimization. And so I think things are the same for us, so which is we continue to look for ways to optimize internally and we are, and I just referenced that on the previous comment, and that's helped us be resilient in terms of our earnings. And at the same time, we're still going to look and speak and converse with third parties and look for ways to see if we can accelerate the release and runoff of that block in an appropriate way. And if we can, we would do a deal, if we can't, then we'll continue to optimize internally.\nTom Gallagher: Okay. Thanks. And just a follow-up on, if I look at your group life and individual life mortality experience within Holdings, are you seeing worse experience versus pre-pandemic levels right now? Or are you more or less back to those types of levels? The reason I ask is if you look at the broader CDC data for all-cause mortality, it still looks to me like it's running around 5% to 10% worse. Yet I look at your guidance, I look at the results you've had for the last three quarters, you're kind of back to your targets. So I'm just curious what you're seeing. Maybe it's the insured population experience is better than general population, but any way you can kind of reconcile that? Thanks.\nRamy Tadros: Yes, I mean it's - you've got to really factor in a lot of different, call it, lenses as you go from an aggregate data to an insured population or a specific book of business. I would say in terms of what we're seeing this quarter, it's very much a shift to an endemic. With respect to COVID, we see continued reduction in the number of deaths below 65, which also reduces the severity of any potential impacts from COVID. But overall, you really should think about this moving to an endemic environment, one that we've priced for and, therefore, we feel pretty good about our guidance range and going back to the midpoint of the range on an annual basis. You'll still see some of the seasonality we've historically seen. So think about Q1 as typically being mortality heavy, which is - was the same dynamic that played out pre-COVID from a mortality perspective.\nTom Gallagher: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Next, we go on to Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.\nRyan Krueger: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I had a question on the RIS spread outlook. I guess more so to the extent you can comment beyond 2023 and how to think about the interest rate cap, how much they're contributing in '23 and how we should think about them rolling off beyond '23?\nJohn McCallion: Good morning, Ryan. It's John. So as we mentioned, we're raising the guidance. And I think just to kind of frame it in terms of if you use fourth quarter, we're at about 112 ex-VII. If you add 10 for LDTI, which we referenced, it's more of a mechanic than it is necessarily an earnings change or run rate change. And then on top of that, you add kind of a normal VII balance, that gets you to the range we gave. And we are benefiting from the caps. I mean this is really how we constructed the portfolio is to put these in place to address a short-term headwind of rising rates and really rising short-term rates to allow for the longer end of the curve for the rollover and reinvest to start to manifest itself in portfolio yield. So it's all part of the plan. They'll be pretty healthy in '23. They'll start to roll off over the next 2 plus years, and that should give us some time to allow for the longer end of the curve to kind of improve in terms of contribution. We typically stick to '23 - to 1 year, and there's a reason for that. I mean, if you - if we try to predict more than 1 year, I think we would have been wrong every time. So I think we'll stick with that.\nRyan Krueger: Okay. Got it, thanks. And then I guess on capital deployment and are you - I guess there's a lot of talk about the risk of recession. I mean at this point, have you - are you - is there anything about the economic outlook that would lead you to pull back some on capital deployment at this point? Or are you kind of viewing as a somewhat status quo situation for now?\nMichel Khalaf: Yes. Hi, Ryan. It's Michel. I mean I would say the short answer is no, no change in philosophy in our approach. And I might sound like a broken record here, but that's probably a good thing. So from our standpoint, the approach is that beyond supporting organic growth and in the absence of strategic accretive M&A, excess capital belongs to shareholders. And we've defined that as cash and equivalents at our holding companies above our liquidity buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. And we do expect to migrate back to those levels over time. But just given the environment, I think having the financial flexibility that being above that range offer is not a bad thing. We've bought back $3.3 billion in 2022, an additional $250 million in January. And we have $900 million left on our current authorization. And as we've done in the past, we're going to continue to manage the authorization deliberately and in a consistent manner, I would say. So from that perspective, no change in terms of approach or philosophy.\nRyan Krueger: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mr. Bhullar, do you have your phone muted by chance. We will move on to the next person, one moment here. We'll move on to Alex Scott [Goldman Sachs]. Please go ahead.\nAlex Scott: Hey, good morning. First one I had is just on LDTI, could you provide an update on how book value is impacted as we sort of move over to that accounting as of year-end? And the reason I asked is just I want to better understand the ROE guidance that you've provided as part of your outlook. And then maybe if you can comment at all on how sensitive that will be to interest rates as we think through declining rates in the first quarter?\nJohn McCallion: Good morning, Alex. It's John. So we gave a range before, and we'll be providing a point estimate as we file our 10-K in the middle of that range was, call it, all in about a 22.5 change in total equity and about a $5 billion, so $22.5 billion and a $5 billion change in book value ex-AOCI, excluding FCTA. That was at 1/1/21. Since that time, obviously, a lot has changed in terms of economic and interest rate environments. And so I think if you were to compare to year-end this year of '22, the delta should be much different or smaller, at least, certainly, on book value ex-AOCI would be about 2 - a little less than a $2 billion, call it, impact on book value ex-AOCI. And then if you include AOCI, it actually flips a little bit to $2 billion positive from the overall $22.5 billion negative to GAAP equity. So hopefully, that helps.\nAlex Scott: Yes, that's very helpful. Thank you. And then the second one I had is on LatAm and the outlook. You guys have had really strong growth there. How influenced has it all been by the macro environment and the employment in Mexico, which candidly am a little less doubt [ph] in on myself? And I just wanted to understand like, to what degree that's been fueling things and what that could look like if it more levels off or is not as robust as it's been? And then maybe also if the Chile pension reform does go into effect in 2024? Would that change your view on the growth rates on sort of the outer years of the guidance you gave?\nEric Clurfain: Okay. Hi, Alex. This is Eric. Let me take the first question regarding the LatAm outlook. So as you mentioned, and you've seen 2022 results and our near-term guidance, we're excited about our prospects in Latin America for a number of reasons. And let me put things in perspective. So we, as you know, we have a strong franchise across the region. We have a significant footprint in three of the largest insurance markets across LatAm. We are market leaders with a very strong brand in Mexico and Chile, and we have a fast-growing business in Brazil. So in addition, the market in the region has significant potential for three reasons in addition to the one that you mentioned. But the three core reasons that are really pushing things forward are, one, the insurance penetration rates remain very low. We are also seeing heightened protection awareness resulting in increased demand for our products. We're also observing an increased expectations from customers for more of a digital and seamless experience, and this is leading to a flight to quality that I mentioned during last year. And these evolving customer needs have been met by our franchise because we have invested significantly in our digital transformation over the past few years, and that digital transformation in both sales and service levels is now paying off clearly. And in parallel, we've been expanding and diversifying our distribution and product reach by growing bancassurance, direct marketing channels, while continuing to strengthen and grow our retail and group business across the region. The good example of that diversification strategy in Mexico where we had a record top and bottom line here in 2022. So we've been also expanding successfully in the private business in both retail and group while continuing that strong franchise that you know very well in worksite government. So all in all, I think there are market factors that are helping, but the strength of our franchise and our strategy is certainly positioning us well for the future and moving forward. So I hope this helps on the LatAm question. And I'll pass it to Michel regarding the Chile view.\nMichel Khalaf: Yes. I mean the thing I would say about Chile is that I think all in all, we feel better about the environment. The pension reform is going to play out over, say, a number of months. And we'll have to see how things turn out. But all in all, I think compared to maybe six months ago, I would say the environment is better, more favorable.\nAlex Scott: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And we will go back to the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mr. Bhullar, we are still unable to hear you. We will move on to Suneet Kamath [Jefferies]. You may go ahead.\nSuneet Kamath: Hi. Can you hear me? A - Michel Khalaf Yes. Suneet, go ahead.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay, great. Perfect. So my first question, just on VII, I think I know the answer, but I figured I'd ask anyway. It looks like you've kept your return assumption consistent despite the economic uncertainty that you've talked about on this call. Is that just for the simplicity of being consistent with the past? Or is that at all informed by what you're hearing from your private equity partners?\nSteven Goulart: Hi, Suneet. It's Steve. Thanks for the question. And this really reflects the fact that we don't want to try and predict near-term market quarterly or annual returns. This really reflects our long-term experience for the asset class and then therefore our expectation going forward. So that's why I think if you go back, it's been 12%, 3% a quarter as long as I can recall. And again, it reflects the fact that we know that - a couple of things. One is that there is volatility in the returns. But basically, our PE portfolio has generally moved directionally in line with the broad markets. If you can look at the fourth quarter, what happened, we had basically strong kind of broad market returns. NASDAQ was down a little bit. I'm sure that will reflect its way through the portfolio as well. The key, though, is despite any volatility we see in the returns on the portfolio, we're also getting very solid cash distributions. And last year, we had over - about $2.5 billion of cash distribution. As you look at the last 5 years, they've totaled $9 billion. So it really is a very reliable portfolio in that respect as well. And I think a lot of it just reflects the diversification in the portfolio. I mean we've said a number of times, we're very diversified by strategy, by manager, by vintage. Yes, LBOs and BC are the biggest part of the portfolios, but we also have significant investments in specialized strategies like special situations, energy, power and the like. So all in all, our expectations really reflect the long-term experience we've seen in the portfolio that represents the strong diversification we have.\nSuneet Kamath: Got it. That's helpful. And then, I guess, for John, it looks like you were able to use this Japanese reinsurance transaction to help solve for some of the uneconomic pieces of the SMR. Should we be thinking about this as another tool that you have going forward in terms of capital optimization? Or was this really just to solve that issue?\nJohn McCallion: Good morning, Suneet. Yes, I think you've done a nice job summarizing it. It's a tool in the toolbox. We - it's not our only. We did use it to solve that situation. It was - in the fourth quarter, we executed an internal reinsurance transaction, which improved the ratio by approximately 250 points. And so - and also remember, there is two other things. One, rising rates are good for this business. So that's important to remember from an economic perspective. Second is the solvency regime is meant to be replaced in a few years time and move to a more economic solvency framework that will better reflect the economics. So this is really to deal with, I'll say, a temporary situation. And ultimately, I think these tools allow us to have no concerns over capital generation or dividend capacity.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one last question, that's from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you. Good morning. My first question, with your guidance and comments on Holdings, you guys have a pretty good handle on how LDTI will impact the income statement. Can you help give us a sense of the total impact to net from LDTI on adjusted earnings as well as on net income?\nJohn McCallion: Good morning, Elyse. It's John. As I mentioned, I think our summary around earnings run rate is there's a few puts and takes, but net-net for the firm overall, run rate is intact for adjusted earnings. Net income will probably become, I'd say, directionally smoother than it has been. It's probably the best way to describe it and you'll probably - and you'll see that when we provide our restated QFS in kind of early April. And you'll see that there's a bit more symmetry between net income and adjusted earnings. But it's - there's still some volatility and fluctuations that you'll see. But net-net, it should be directionally better.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks. And then in terms of PRT, can you just give us a sense of your outlook for deal volume during '23? And would you expect to see seasonality during the quarter as I think typically sometimes you've seen heavier activity to end the year?\nRamy Tadros: Elyse. So as you know, we had a record year last year with respect to PRT. And sitting here today, we're still seeing a pretty healthy pipeline given funded status of pension plans. And we're seeing that pipeline also geared towards the jumbo end of the market, which is the place where we compete the most and where we focus on. The seasonality has largely dissipated. If you looked at the timing of the deals over the last few years, we've seen less seasonality. We've seen more deals earlier on in some cases and more these later on. So I wouldn't speculate on the seasonality, but the pipeline is certainly healthy.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, we do have no more time for questions. I'll turn you back to John Hall, Head of Investor Relations, for closing comments.\nJohn Hall: Great. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today, and have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "John McCallion",
            "content": "Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 4Q '22 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and update on our cash and capital positions and more detail on our near-term outlook. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year. Net income in 4Q of '22 was $1.3 billion or $88 million higher than adjusted earnings. Net investment gains in the fourth quarter were primarily driven by real estate sales, which were partially offset by losses on the fixed maturity portfolio due to normal trading activity in a rising rate environment. Credit losses in the portfolio remain modest. In addition, we had net derivative gains primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter. For the full year, net derivative losses accounted for most of the variance between net income and adjusted earnings, primarily due to higher interest rates in 2022. Overall, our hedging program continues to perform as expected. On Page 4, you can see the fourth quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding $140 million of notable tax items that were favorable in the fourth quarter of '21 and accounted for in Corporate and Other. Adjusted earnings in 4Q of '22 were $1.2 billion, down 28% and down 26% on a constant currency basis. Lower variable investment income drove the year-over-year decline, while higher recurring interest margins and favorable underwriting were partial offsets. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.55, down 23% year-over-year and down 21% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were $400 million versus $20 million in 4Q of '21, primarily due to significant improvement in underwriting margins aided by lower COVID-19 life claims, as well as higher volume growth. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins year-over-year. Group Life mortality ratio was 87.6% in the fourth quarter of '22, in the middle of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 69.4% in Q4 of '22, slightly below its annual target range of 70% to 75% and below the prior year quarter of 74.2%. The non-medical health ratio benefited from favorable disability severity, while dental was in line with expectations. Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were essentially flat year-over-year. As we discussed in prior quarters, excess mortality can result in higher premiums from participating life contracts in the period. The higher excess mortality in Q4 '21 versus Q4 of '22 resulted in year-over-year decline in premiums from participating contracts, which dampened growth by roughly 6 percentage points. The underlying PFO increase of approximately 6% was primarily due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. For the full year, Group Benefits adjusted PFO growth was 3%, while underlying growth, excluding excess premiums from participating contracts in 2021 versus 2022 was up 5% and within the 2022 target range of 4% to 6%. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 40% year-over-year. The primary driver was lower variable investment income, mostly due to weaker private equity returns. This was partially offset by favorable recurring interest margins year-over-year. RIS investment spreads were 96 basis points and 112 basis points excluding VII, up 21 basis points versus Q4 of '21 and up 11 basis points sequentially, primarily due to income from in-the-money interest rate caps. RIS liability exposures were down 1% year-over-year due to certain accounting adjustments that do not impact fees or spread income. That said, RIS had strong volume growth driven by sales up 23% in 2022. This was primarily driven by pension risk transfers and stable value products. In addition, we had a record sales quarter for structured settlements, demonstrating the strength of product diversification within RIS. With regards to PRT, we completed 6 transactions worth $12.2 billion in 2022, a record year for MetLife, and we continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were down 63% and down 62% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower variable investment income. In addition, we had a write-down of a deferred tax asset in China as it was determined that the accumulated tax losses were unlikely to be utilized within the required 5 year statutory period. The write-down of the DTA reduced Asia's adjusted earnings in Q4 of 2022 by $34 million after tax and was accounted for in net investment income due to the equity method of accounting treatment for our China joint venture. While Asia's underwriting was modestly unfavorable versus Q4 of '21, we saw a significant sequential improvement due to lower COVID claims in Japan. Asia's key growth metrics remained solid as general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 4% on a constant currency basis. And sales were up 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by FX annuities sold through face-to-face channels in Japan. For the full year, Asia sales were up 11%, exceeding its 2022 guidance of mid to high-single digits. Latin America adjusted earnings were $181 million, up 45% and up 51% on a constant currency basis. This strong performance was primarily driven by favorable underwriting and solid volume growth. Overall, COVID-19related deaths in Mexico were down significantly year-over-year. In addition, the Chilean encaje, which had a positive 6% return in 4Q '22 versus 4% in the prior year and higher recurring interest margins, were positive contributors. These two favorable items were partially offset by lower variable investment income year-over-year. LatAm's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs are up 20% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 22% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were $70 million, up 67% and up 112% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by favorable underwriting versus Q4 of '21, which had elevated COVID-19-related claims, particularly in the U.K. This was partially offset by less favorable expenses year-over-year. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 2% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 13% on a constant currency basis, reflecting solid growth across the region. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $208 million, down 57%. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income. In addition, less favorable expense margins and adverse equity market performance also reduced adjusted earnings year-over-year. Corporate and Other adjusted loss was $219 million versus an adjusted loss of $177 million in the prior year, which excludes favorable notable tax items of $140 million. Higher taxes and lower net investment income were partially offset by lower expenses year-over-year. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 19%, which includes favorable tax benefits primarily related to the settlement of an IRS audit. Excluding these favorable items, the company's effective tax rate was approximately 22%, within our 2022 guidance range of 21% to 23%. On Page 5, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the four quarters and full year of 2022. VII was $24 million in the fourth quarter. The private equity portfolio, which makes up the bulk of the VII asset balances, had a negative 0.3% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equities generally accounted for on a one quarter lag. For the full year, VII was $1.5 billion, below our 2022 target range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. Our private equity portfolio had a positive 7% return in 2022, a solid performance in comparison to the public equity markets with the S&P 500 down 19%. While VII underperformed in 4Q '22, our new money rate increased to 5.66%, which was 150 basis points above our roll-off yield of 4.16%. On Page 6, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the four quarters and full year 2022. On a full year basis, you will note RIS MetLife Holdings in Asia continue to earn the vast majority of variable investment income, consistent with the higher VII assets in their respective investment portfolios. VII assets are primarily owned to match longer-dated liabilities, which are mostly in these three businesses. Turning to Page 7. This chart shows the comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior eight quarters and full year 2021 and 2022. Our direct expense ratio in 4Q of '22 was elevated at 13.1%, reflecting the impact from seasonal enrollment costs in Group Benefits, as well as higher employee-related costs and timing of certain projects. That said, as we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. For the full year of 2022, our direct expense ratio was 12.2%, below our annual target of 12.3%. We believe this result once again demonstrates our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset in a challenging inflationary environment while continuing to make investments in our businesses. I will now discuss our cash and capital positions on Page 8. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.4 billion at December 31, which was up from $5.2 billion at September 30 and remained above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential increase in cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of approximately $600 million in the fourth quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. For the 2 year period, 2021 to 2022, our average free cash flow ratio, excluding notable items, totaled 68% and was within our 65% to 75% target range. In terms of statutory capital for our U.S. companies, we expect our combined 2022 NAIC RBC ratio will be above our 360% target. Preliminary 2022 statutory operating earnings for our U.S. companies were approximately $2.6 billion, while net income was approximately $3 billion. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was $18.3 billion as of December 31, 2022, a decrease of 3% sequentially, primarily due to derivative losses and dividends paid, partially offset by operating earnings and investment gains. Finally, while our Japan solvency margin ratio dipped below 500% as of September 30, we expect the Japan SMR to be approximately 700% as of December 31, which will be based on statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks. As we have discussed on prior calls, our Japan business as well as MetLife overall does better economically in a higher interest rate environment. However, given the asymmetrical nature of how the SMR is calculated, the ratio declines in a rising rate environment as assets are mark-to-market, but not the corresponding liabilities. As a result, we executed an internal reinsurance transaction in December with our Bermuda entity, which has an economic-based solvency regime. This transaction improved the Japan SMR ratio by approximately 250 percentage points. Before I shift to our near-term outlook, starting on Page 9, a few points on what we included in the appendix. The chart on Page 15 reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments from 2017 through 2021. This is the same chart that we showed as part of our 3Q '22 supplemental slides, but we felt it was worth including again for the sake of completeness. Also, Pages 16 through 19 provide interest rate assumptions and key outlook sensitivities by line of business. Turning back to Page 9, our 2023 to 2025 outlook reflects the impacts of the new accounting requirements of long-duration targeted improvement or LDTI. While 2022 actually used for growth rate calculations remain as previously reported on a pre-LDTI basis. In mid-April or roughly two to three weeks prior to the reporting of our 1Q '23 earnings, we plan to provide you with a recasted QFS based on LDTI for each of the quarters in 2022. While there would be certain positive and negative effects depending on product and segment, we do not expect the underlying run rate of adjusted earnings for the firm overall to change materially. Now let's turn to Page 10 for further details on our near-term outlook. We assume COVID-19 to be endemic, consistent with the recent trends that we have been experiencing. We expect continued uncertainty to persist around inflation and a potential recession in 2023. Based on the 12/31/22 forward curve, we expect interest rates to rise in 2023. Finally, for purposes of the near-term outlook, we assume a 5% annual return for the S&P 500 and a 12% annual return for private equity. This is consistent with our long-term historical returns for PE. Moving to near-term targets. We are increasing our adjusted ROE range to 13% to 15%. This increase of 100 basis points from our prior 12% to 14% ROE range is a function of the growing impact of our mix of business and higher new business returns over the last several years as well as the impact of LDTI. We expect to maintain our 2 year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75% of adjusted earnings, excluding total notable items. Our direct expense ratio guidance for 2023 is being recalibrated to reflect LDTI by approximately 30 basis points to 12.6%. This captures an approximate $1 billion reduction in adjusted PFOs, excluding PRTs, due to the change in accounting. This is primarily related to certain annuity contracts within RIS as well as shifting certain variable annuity fees to market risk benefits, which are reported outside adjusted earnings. Since this change in accounting to LDTI will be retroactively applied back to the beginning of 2021, our previously reported direct expense ratios will likewise be recalibrated to put 2021 and 2022 on the same basis as 2023 and beyond. Our VII for 2023 is expected to be approximately $2 billion after applying our historical average returns on asset balances. I'll provide more detail on VII in a moment. Our Corporate and Other adjusted loss target is expected to remain at $650 million to $750 million after tax in 2023. We are increasing our expected effective tax rate range by 1 point to 22% to 24% to reflect our expectation for higher earnings in foreign markets and lower tax credits in the U.S. At the bottom of the page, you'll see certain interest rate sensitivities relative to our base case, reflecting a relatively modest impact on adjusted earnings over the near term. On Page 11, the chart reflects our VII average asset balances from $14.7 billion in 2021 to $19 billion expected in 2023. Private equities will continue to hold the vast majority of our VII asset balances. We are applying our historical annual returns for each asset class within VII. In addition to the PE annual return of 12%, we expect an annual 7% return for real estate and other funds. Finally, as a reminder, we include prepayment fees on fixed maturities and mortgage loans in VII. So now I will discuss our near term outlook for our business segments. Let's start with the U.S. on Page 12. For Group Benefits, excluding the excess premium from participating group life contracts of approximately $750 million in 2022, adjusted PFOs are expected to grow at 4% to 6% annually. Regarding underwriting, we expect the Group Life mortality ratio to be between 85% to 90%. We are also maintaining the expected group non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio at 70% to 75%. Keep in mind, these are annual ratios and are typically higher in the first quarter for both Group Life and Non-Medical Health given the seasonality of the business. For RIS, we are maintaining our 2% to 4% expected annual growth for total liability exposures across our general account spread and fee-based businesses. We are increasing the range of our expected annual RIS investment spread by 40 basis points to 135 to 160 basis points in 2023. The majority of this increase is driven by continued expectations of rising interest rates on the short end of the curve and the resulting benefit of interest rate cap income, which we expect to peak in the first half of 2023. In addition, LDTI will contribute approximately 10 basis points to the investment spread calculation while not increasing adjusted earnings. Upon transition to LDTI, the unlocking of future cash flow assumptions to current best estimate increased our deferred profit liability, which is amortized into earnings and will now be included in the spread calculation, reducing other sources of earnings. Overall, the conversion to LDTI will not significantly change RIS run rate adjusted earnings. For MetLife Holdings, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to decline 12% to 14% in 2023, driven by the normal runoff of the business, market declines and the transition to LDTI. Beyond 2023, we expect annual PFOs to decline 6% to 8%. We are lowering the life interest adjusted benefit ratio target to 40% to 45% in 2023 from the prior 45% to 50% target to reflect the impact of lowering policyholder dividend levels. Finally, we are maintaining the adjusted earnings guidance of $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2023. Now let's look at the near-term guidance of our businesses outside the U.S. on Page 13. For Asia, we expect the recent sales momentum to continue and generate mid to high-single-digit growth on a constant currency basis over the near term. In addition, we expect general account AUM to maintain mid-single-digit growth on a constant currency basis. We expect Asia's adjusted earnings, excluding $270 million of COVID-19 claims in 2022, to grow at mid-single digits over the near term. For Latin America, we expect adjusted PFOs to grow by low double digits over the near term. We expect our adjusted earnings to grow high single digits over the near term, excluding roughly $80 million due to favorable market-related factors in 2022. Finally, for EMEA, we are expecting sales and adjusted PFOs to grow mid to high single digits on a constant currency basis over the near term. We expect EMEA run rate adjusted earnings to be roughly $55 million per quarter in 2023, reflecting the impact of currency headwinds and then grow by high single digits in 2024 and 2025. Let me conclude by saying that MetLife delivered a good quarter to close out another strong year, reflecting the strength of our business fundamentals, solid top line growth, favorable underwriting and ongoing expense discipline. While private equity returns were down this quarter, core spreads remained robust. In addition, results in our market-leading franchises, Group Benefits and Latin America continued their strong growth and recovery. Finally, our commitment to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth positions MetLife to build sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Good morning, Erik. It's John. Great question. We have had some resiliency in our runoff business here. So we did provide a guidance raise of 1 to 1.2. Let me start with just PFO decline versus earnings. So as I referenced in my opening remarks, one aspect of LDTI is for our VAs, we do move some of the fees down below the line. That's a revenue decline, but it's not an earnings decline. The way we have - our policy has been that we've attributed fees to the guarantees. And to the extent that they're below the line, we would put 100% of those fees below the line. So as you move, we have a number of SOP 03-1, which is kind of the accrual-based accounting, as you move them down below the line, so does the claims. So you see this like this kind of breakage between revenue decline but earnings staying flat. And then we did have - this is probably one of the businesses with a marginal positive from LDTI. And so that's probably another item. And then thirdly, I think it's the optimization efforts. Now the team has done a great job and continue to look for ways to find improvements around expenses, around contracts. And I think, all in all, we think with the guidance in terms of equity outlook, 1 to 1.2 is a good range. Good morning, Tom. It's John. Yes, I don't think any update or change for us. I think we've been pretty transparent about this. This is not an easy solution, particularly when you're talking about a reinsurance arrangement. It is complex. I think particularly when it's a reinsurance, you're looking for a good partner and you're looking for to ensure that not only is it beneficial for us, but beneficial for them. And so there is a - you do have to look for ways for common ground. And sometimes that works out, and sometimes it doesn't. It hasn't changed our perspective on optimization. And so I think things are the same for us, so which is we continue to look for ways to optimize internally and we are, and I just referenced that on the previous comment, and that's helped us be resilient in terms of our earnings. And at the same time, we're still going to look and speak and converse with third parties and look for ways to see if we can accelerate the release and runoff of that block in an appropriate way. And if we can, we would do a deal, if we can't, then we'll continue to optimize internally. Good morning, Ryan. It's John. So as we mentioned, we're raising the guidance. And I think just to kind of frame it in terms of if you use fourth quarter, we're at about 112 ex-VII. If you add 10 for LDTI, which we referenced, it's more of a mechanic than it is necessarily an earnings change or run rate change. And then on top of that, you add kind of a normal VII balance, that gets you to the range we gave. And we are benefiting from the caps. I mean this is really how we constructed the portfolio is to put these in place to address a short-term headwind of rising rates and really rising short-term rates to allow for the longer end of the curve for the rollover and reinvest to start to manifest itself in portfolio yield. So it's all part of the plan. They'll be pretty healthy in '23. They'll start to roll off over the next 2 plus years, and that should give us some time to allow for the longer end of the curve to kind of improve in terms of contribution. We typically stick to '23 - to 1 year, and there's a reason for that. I mean, if you - if we try to predict more than 1 year, I think we would have been wrong every time. So I think we'll stick with that. Good morning, Alex. It's John. So we gave a range before, and we'll be providing a point estimate as we file our 10-K in the middle of that range was, call it, all in about a 22.5 change in total equity and about a $5 billion, so $22.5 billion and a $5 billion change in book value ex-AOCI, excluding FCTA. That was at 1/1/21. Since that time, obviously, a lot has changed in terms of economic and interest rate environments. And so I think if you were to compare to year-end this year of '22, the delta should be much different or smaller, at least, certainly, on book value ex-AOCI would be about 2 - a little less than a $2 billion, call it, impact on book value ex-AOCI. And then if you include AOCI, it actually flips a little bit to $2 billion positive from the overall $22.5 billion negative to GAAP equity. So hopefully, that helps. Good morning, Suneet. Yes, I think you've done a nice job summarizing it. It's a tool in the toolbox. We - it's not our only. We did use it to solve that situation. It was - in the fourth quarter, we executed an internal reinsurance transaction, which improved the ratio by approximately 250 points. And so - and also remember, there is two other things. One, rising rates are good for this business. So that's important to remember from an economic perspective. Second is the solvency regime is meant to be replaced in a few years time and move to a more economic solvency framework that will better reflect the economics. So this is really to deal with, I'll say, a temporary situation. And ultimately, I think these tools allow us to have no concerns over capital generation or dividend capacity. Good morning, Elyse. It's John. As I mentioned, I think our summary around earnings run rate is there's a few puts and takes, but net-net for the firm overall, run rate is intact for adjusted earnings. Net income will probably become, I'd say, directionally smoother than it has been. It's probably the best way to describe it and you'll probably - and you'll see that when we provide our restated QFS in kind of early April. And you'll see that there's a bit more symmetry between net income and adjusted earnings. But it's - there's still some volatility and fluctuations that you'll see. But net-net, it should be directionally better."

            "name": "Steven Goulart",
            "content": "Hi, Suneet. It's Steve. Thanks for the question. And this really reflects the fact that we don't want to try and predict near-term market quarterly or annual returns. This really reflects our long-term experience for the asset class and then therefore our expectation going forward. So that's why I think if you go back, it's been 12%, 3% a quarter as long as I can recall. And again, it reflects the fact that we know that - a couple of things. One is that there is volatility in the returns. But basically, our PE portfolio has generally moved directionally in line with the broad markets. If you can look at the fourth quarter, what happened, we had basically strong kind of broad market returns. NASDAQ was down a little bit. I'm sure that will reflect its way through the portfolio as well. The key, though, is despite any volatility we see in the returns on the portfolio, we're also getting very solid cash distributions. And last year, we had over - about $2.5 billion of cash distribution. As you look at the last 5 years, they've totaled $9 billion. So it really is a very reliable portfolio in that respect as well. And I think a lot of it just reflects the diversification in the portfolio. I mean we've said a number of times, we're very diversified by strategy, by manager, by vintage. Yes, LBOs and BC are the biggest part of the portfolios, but we also have significant investments in specialized strategies like special situations, energy, power and the like. So all in all, our expectations really reflect the long-term experience we've seen in the portfolio that represents the strong diversification we have."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will now turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife's third quarter 2022 earnings call. To begin, I refer you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements which you should review. Presenting on the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also available to participate in the discussion are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides which addressed the quarter. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. An appendix to these slides features incremental disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information which you should also review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session, and it will end no later than the top of the hour. In fairness to all, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Now on to Michel.\nMichel Khalaf: Thank you, John and good morning, everyone. Many of the macroeconomic trends from the first half of the year persisted in the third quarter. As equity markets fell again, interest rates rose some more and the possibility of a recession remains in sight. Against this backdrop, we are pleased with the execution of our Next Horizon strategy which continues to prove its resilience in the face of uncertainty. Looking ahead, there are several areas that we believe differentiate MetLife and position us well going forward. We have established a track record of relentless execution focused on controlling those factors that we can control. We have built a diversified portfolio of businesses with natural offsets through organic growth, supplemented by strategic acquisitions and tactical divestments. We have a commitment to responsible growth, aided by the use of powerful analytical tools such as VNB or value of new business to produce high-teen IRRs and mid-single-digit payback periods. We have embedded an efficiency mindset in our DNA which drives our productivity and provides us with the capacity to invest in the future. And we generate strong recurring free cash flow that supports clear and consistent capital and liquidity management. Turning to quarterly performance as a whole. Recurring investment rates rose, PFOs on a constant rate basis were strong, COVID-19 losses in the aggregate moderated and expense discipline held firm. The greatest headwind was variable investment income. Starting with some numbers. Last night, we reported third quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $966 million or $1.21 per share. Notable items in the quarter included our annual actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments which had a positive impact of $34 million or $0.04 per share on adjusted earnings. Excluding notable items, adjusted earnings in the quarter were $1.16 per share. Net income in the third quarter was $331 million compared to $1.5 billion a year ago, primarily driven by lower adjusted earnings and derivative losses from hedges we hold to protect our balance sheet as well as investment losses from standard investment activity. In the third quarter, variable investment income was a loss of $53 million. Private equity is the largest contributor to VII and generated a negative 1.3% return in the quarter. As you know, our PE portfolio is reported on a 1 quarter lag. Third quarter private equity results reflect the difficult second quarter equity market which fell 16.4% as measured by the S&P 500. Our investment in private equity is driven by its properties as a long-dated asset class that provides a good match for our long-dated liabilities. Not only has this proven to be a good ALM strategy but we have generated substantial gains over time for the benefit of our policyholders and our shareholders. As a partial offset to private equity in the quarter, we saw recurring investment income grow sequentially on higher new money rates. For roughly the past decade, we effectively managed through an interest rate environment where our new money rate was below our roll-off rate. In the second quarter, that finally reversed as our new money rate exceeded our roll-off rate. This repeated in the third quarter to even greater effect. With the duration of our investment portfolio at roughly 8 years, we expect the impact of this change to build over time. Broadly speaking, rising interest rates are a good thing for MetLife. Shifting to our business segments. We saw strong growth in U.S. Group Benefits with adjusted earnings of $399 million, up 259% year-over-year. This represents favorable underwriting, including a substantial decline in COVID-19 life insurance claims and aided by strong volume growth. Group Life mortality, including COVID-19 losses, registered a benefit ratio of 86% which continues to be at the low end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. And our nonmedical health ratio was 70.8%, also at the low end of our annual target range of 70% to 75%. Execution across our enrollment and voluntary strategy is going well and responsible for driving double-digit PFO growth across our voluntary suite of products. The investments we've made to expand our product breadth to deepen our understanding of employee needs and to connect and communicate with employees are all paying off. In Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were $345 million which were down from a year ago, largely due to lower variable investment income. Benefiting from higher rates, recurring investment income spreads remained strong. The highlight in the quarter for RIS was winning our largest ever pension risk transfer deal of roughly $8 billion. Year-to-date, we have booked $12.3 billion of new PRT business, already an all-time annual high for MetLife. And we continue to see a robust pipeline with a market opportunity extending out for years. For Asia, adjusted earnings of $197 million were below a year ago, mostly on lower variable investment income and unfavorable underwriting. COVID claims reduced adjusted earnings in the quarter by $129 million, driven largely by hospitalization claims in Japan. Changes to hospitalization claims eligibility rules which took effect at the end of September, will greatly reduce such claims looking ahead. Asia sales were up 27% on a constant currency basis from a year ago, led by Japan foreign currency annuities and Accident & Health products. Two weeks ago, on a visit to Asia, I had the opportunity to engage with our team and our distribution partners and bear witness to our strong execution. In this fast-changing environment, our efforts to meet our customers where they are and the nimbleness of that pursuit are strengthening our competitive advantage. In Latin America, the region had another strong quarter with adjusted earnings totaling $171 million, up significantly from COVID-impacted $29 million a year ago. Latin America sales continue to be strong, rising 22% for the quarter across the region on a constant currency basis, reflecting sustained business momentum. MetLife's focus on responsible growth is an integral element of our strategy. On an annual basis, in the third quarter, we disclosed our value of new business metrics for the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, VNB is a tool that underpins our efforts to generate responsible growth. The metrics show that MetLife has been able to put capital to work to support organic growth more effectively and efficiently over time. For example, in 2019, we deployed $3.8 billion of capital at a 15% IRR to generate $1.8 billion of VNB. 2 years later, we put less capital to work, $2.8 billion at a higher IRR to generate even more VNB, $1.9 billion. We think our principal use of VNB and the results that we've achieved are clear differentiators for MetLife. The discipline we use to evaluate and drive new business is no different than the discipline we employ to score merger and acquisition opportunities. During the third quarter, MetLife Investment Management announced a definitive agreement to acquire Affirmative Investment Management. AIM is an award-winning global environmental, social and corporate governance investment manager with roughly $1 billion of assets under management. Combining AIMs ESG capabilities with MEMS fundamental investment expertise will create differentiated client solutions and offer a new and attractive opportunity for growth. Further, this transaction underscores our strategic objective to grow our investment management business while highlighting M&A as a strategic capability for MetLife. Moving to cash and capital. MetLife continued to be active with capital management during the third quarter. We paid $400 million of common stock dividends to shareholders. We also repurchased $674 million of our common shares, bringing total capital return in the quarter to roughly $1.1 billion. In October, we repurchased an additional $176 million of MetLife shares. There remains $1.6 billion outstanding on our current $3 billion authorization. MetLife is well capitalized and highly liquid. At the end of the quarter, we had $5.2 billion of cash and liquid assets at our Holdings companies. We remain comfortably above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. In closing, our all-weather Next Horizon strategy continues to be the right strategy to guide us through the changing times ahead. Together, the diversification of our great set of market-leading businesses, our responsible growth, our efficiency mindset and our strong free cash flow generation will serve MetLife well across a range of economic cycles. We believe these are the right ingredients to create value for our shareholders and our stakeholders now and into the future. With that, I will turn things over to John.\nJohn McCallion: Thank you, Michel and good morning. I will start with the 3Q '22 supplemental slides which provide highlights of our financial performance, details of our annual global actuarial assumption review, updates on our value of new business metrics and our cash and capital positions. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the third quarter. Net derivative losses were primarily the result of higher interest rates. As a reminder, MetLife uses derivatives as part of our broader asset liability management strategy to hedge certain risks. This hedging activity can generate durative gains or losses and create fluctuations in net income because the risk being hedged may not have the same GAAP accounting treatment. Overall, the hedging program continues to perform as expected. In addition, we had net investment losses from our normal trading activity in the portfolio given the rising interest rate environment. In total, the actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments in 3Q of '22, was favorable to net income by $54 million, with a positive impact to adjusted earnings of $34 million and a $20 million impact to non-adjusted earnings. The table on Page 4 provides highlights of the actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments with a breakdown of the adjusted earnings and net income impact by business. Overall, the impacts were fairly modest. In MetLife Holdings, annuity earnings were negatively impacted by lower-than-expected lapses and annuitizations as well as model refinements. This was partially offset by favorable impact in life as a result of higher earned rates and favorable mortality. In addition, we had a reinsurance recapture gain which was favorable to RIS adjusted earnings by $91 million in the quarter. Our U.S. mean reversion interest rate remained unchanged at 2.75%. And we have maintained our long-term mortality assumptions. On Page 5, you can see the third quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment which excludes notable items in both periods. Adjusted earnings, excluding total notable items was $932 million in 3Q of '22, down 58% and down 57% on a constant currency basis. Lower variable investment income drove the year-over-year decline while favorable underwriting and solid volume growth were partial offsets. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding notable items, was $1.16, down 55% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 54% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. business. Group Benefits adjusted earnings more than tripled year-over-year, primarily due to significant improvement in underwriting margins aided by lower COVID-19 life claims as well as higher volume growth. This was partially offset by less favorable expense and investment margins year-over-year. The Group Life mortality ratio was 86% in the third quarter of '22 towards the bottom end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. The business benefited from lower U.S. COVID deaths in the quarter and a continued favorable shift in the percentage of death under age 65 which was roughly 15% in Q3 of '22. More detail on the Group Life mortality results over the past 5 quarters can be found on Page 12 in the appendix. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 70.8% in Q3 of '22 at the low end of its annual target range of 70% to 75% and essentially in line with the prior year quarter. Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 3.4% year-over-year. As we discussed in prior quarters, excess mortality can result in higher premiums from participating life contracts in the period. The higher excess mortality in Q3 of '21 versus Q3 of '22 resulted in a year-over-year decline in premiums from participating contracts which dampened growth by roughly 1 percentage point. The underlying PFO increase of approximately 4.4% was primarily due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings, excluding the notable in this quarter, were down 68% year-over-year. The primary driver was lower private equity return versus a very strong Q3 of '21 as well as less favorable underwriting. Favorable volume growth was a partial offset. RIS investment spreads were 71 basis points, well below our full year 2022 guidance of 95 to 120 basis points and prior year quarter of 256 basis points due to the significant decline in variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 101 basis points, up 8 basis points versus Q3 of '21 and down 2 basis points sequentially. While RIS liability exposures were down 1% year-over-year due to certain accounting adjustments that do not impact fees or spread income, RIS had strong volume growth driven by sales up 59% year-to-date. This was primarily driven by pension risk transfers and stable value products. With regards to PRT, this has been a record year for MetLife as we have completed 6 transactions worth $12.3 billion year-to-date and we continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings ex notables were down 73% on both a reported and constant currency basis, primarily due to lower variable investment income and unfavorable underwriting. This was partially offset by solid volume growth as assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 4% on a constant currency basis. In addition, Asia sales were up 27% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by a strong performance in Japan. Overall, Japan sales were up 33% driven by FX annuities and accident and health products which benefited from product launches and new capabilities over the past year as well as the strength of our diversified channels. Latin America adjusted earnings ex notables were $164 million versus $31 million in the prior year quarter. This strong performance was primarily driven by favorable underwriting and solid volume growth. Overall, COVID-19-related deaths in Mexico were down significantly year-over-year. LATAM's recurring interest margins in 3Q '22 continued to benefit from higher inflation rates in Chile. However, this favorable impact was more than offset by lower variable investment income and the Chilean and encaje [ph] which had a negative 1.9% return in 3Q '22 versus a negative 0.3% in the prior year quarter. LATAM's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 21% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and sales were up 22% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region, primarily from higher single premium immediate annuity sales in Chile and group cases in Mexico. EMEA adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were down 44% and 31% on a constant currency basis compared to a strong Q3 of '21 which benefited from very favorable underwriting. EMEA adjusted PFOs were down 7% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to refinements to certain unearned revenue reserves in both periods. However, sales were up 10% on a constant currency basis, reflecting growth across the region. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 77%, excluding notable items in both periods. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income. Adverse equity market impact was also a contributor as MetLife Holdings separate account return was negative 5.5% in the quarter versus a negative 1% in 3Q of '21. Favorable underwriting margins in Life and long-term care were a partial offset. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $265 million versus an adjusted loss of $131 million. The year-over-year variance was primarily due to less favorable taxes, lower variable investment income and higher expenses due to market-sensitive employee-related costs. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 23% which was at the top end of our 2022 guidance range of 21% to 23%. On Page 6, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the past 5 quarters, including a $53 million loss in the third quarter of '22. The majority of VII was attributable to the private equity portfolio of roughly $14 billion which had an overall negative return of 1.3% in the quarter. As we have discussed previously, private equity is generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag. In addition, real estate equity funds had a positive 4.3% return in the quarter on a portfolio of roughly $2.3 billion. While VII underperformed in 3Q '22, our new money rate increased to 4.71% which was 79 basis points above our roll-off yield of 3.92%. We expect this favorable trend to continue in a rising interest rate environment. On Page 7, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the prior 5 quarters, including a $42 million loss in Q3 of '22. RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia continue to earn the vast majority of variable investment income consistent with the higher VII assets in their respective investment portfolios. VII assets are primarily owned to match longer-dated liabilities which are mostly in these 3 businesses. Turning to Page 8. This chart shows the comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior 5 quarters, including 12.3% in Q3 of '22. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our third quarter expense ratio was in line with our full year target but above recent trend given higher employee-related costs that are sensitive to market fluctuations. Those costs contributed roughly 40 basis points to the ratio. While we'd expect our direct expense ratio to be higher in 4Q, consistent with the seasonality of our business, we remain committed to achieving our full year direct expense ratio target of 12.3% in 2022 despite the challenging inflationary environment. We believe this demonstrates our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. Now, let's turn to Page 9. This chart reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments for the past 5 years, including an update for 2021. Consistent with our Next Horizon strategy, we continue to have a relentless focus on deploying capital and resources to the highest value opportunities. As evidence of that commitment, MetLife invested $2.8 billion of capital in 2021 to support new business which was deployed at an average unlevered IRR of approximately 17% with a payback period of 6 years, generating roughly $1.9 billion in value. New business written in 2021 reflects our disciplined approach to building responsible growth while creating value, generating cash and mitigating risk. I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 10. Cash and liquid assets at the Holdings companies were approximately $5.2 billion at September 30 which was up from $4.5 billion at June 30 and remains well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential increase in cash at the Holdings companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of approximately $700 million in the third quarter as well as Holdings company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, Holdco cash includes the proceeds from the $1 billion senior debt issuance in July. In regard to our statutory capital, for our U.S. companies, our preliminary third quarter year-to-date 2022 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.6 billion, while net income was approximately $2.1 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by approximately $2.4 billion year-over-year, driven by unfavorable VA rider reserves, lower variable investment income and higher expenses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.7 billion as of September 30, 2022, down 2% sequentially and year-to-date. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 617% as of June 30 which is the latest public data. The decline from March 2022 was primarily due to higher U.S. interest rates. That being said, rising interest rates improve the overall economic solvency of our Japan business. Let me conclude by saying the fundamentals of the business remain strong, solid top line growth, favorable underwriting and ongoing expense discipline. While private equity returns were down this quarter, core spreads remain robust. In addition, results in our market-leading franchises, Group Benefits and Latin America continue their strong growth and recovery. Finally, our commitment to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth positions MetLife to build sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.\nJimmy Bhullar: So first, I had a question just on your new money yield. If you could talk about where it stands with the recent rise in rates? And how it compares to the yield on your maturing investments?\nSteven Goulart: Jimmy, it's Steve Goulart. Thanks for the question. And I think John gave some details and color on it but our new money yield rose again this past quarter. 471 was the actual number and that shows continued improvement. I think a reflection of what we're seeing in the market, obviously, with interest rates rising. And so we're very pleased with what it means for our general account investing. We're obviously going to continue to see the portfolio yield rise as a result of that given that our roll-off has been now for the last couple of quarters also lower than our new money rates. I would also just remind everybody, though, that things can be a little bit volatile quarter-to-quarter, just looking at the existing book of assets that we have, with the roll-off of maturity characteristics of those are. This was -- we look and see some big blocks that rolled off this past quarter and there'll be things like that in the future as well. But I think what's important is to think about what the trend is. The trend is positive. We continue to see and expect our new money yield to increase and continue to expect to see widening spread over the existing portfolio and that's obviously positive for net investment income.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And as the new money yield is going up, how much are you having to raise crediting rates or improved terms and conditions on the interest-sensitive products that I noticed in the retirement business, the yield was up a decent amount but crediting rates were up even, I think, sequentially even a little bit more. So this spread ended up declining sequentially ex-VII.\nRamy Tadros: Jimmy, it's Ramy Tadros here. If you look at our in-force for RIS, the vast majority of our in-force from a crediting grade perspective is fixed. You may see quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in terms of the crediting grid. And clearly, the new business we're writing, while we're running at attractive spreads, it has a higher crediting rate given the market environment. But there is no really increases or pressure on our in-force because that's mostly fixed.\nJimmy Bhullar: Yes. And then just lastly, on Group Benefits, your margins were pretty good, I think, across all products and other companies have reported similar results as well. Are you seeing any signs of competition in the market picking up given the strong results that companies have had in the Group Benefits market over the past few quarters?\nRamy Tadros: Thanks, Jimmy. It's Ramy again. So I'll give a specific answer to your question. It may be also helpful to give you some broader context. Both our mortality ratio as well as our nonmedical health ratio were clearly favorable in the quarter. But if you look at our results, historically, there's some seasonality to both of those ratios and we'd expect them to somewhat pick up in the fourth quarter just from a seasonality perspective. In terms of the overall market, we remain extremely bullish about this market. And if you were to kind of step back more broadly, you've all heard about the workplace dynamics and how those are changing where we're seeing employees expecting more from their employers and we're seeing employers looking for a variety of levers to attract, retain and engage their talent. And so that's a secular trend that's here to stay and that's providing kind of tailwinds for the entire market. From a competitive perspective, I would say overall pricing is competitive but is also rational. We've talked about this in the past, the short nature of these products, Jimmy, really act as a natural check on any sustained irrational pricing. And the other piece of this market that we kind of like is that you can also differentiate on many factors beyond price such as service and digital experiences to name a few. So some of these things, we believe, are going to provide kind of tailwinds to the overall market and keep the competitive landscape rationale. Now all of these are germane to the entire Group Benefits industry. They're particularly pertinent for us because we are the market leader in this industry across both our core and voluntary products. And that leadership and the strategic focus we've had is really giving us the scale to invest in a broad range of capabilities that we have that allows us to differentiate our offerings. So overall, really pleased with the performance, really pleased with the persistency and continue to see a competitive but rational market here.\nOperator: Next, we move on to Ryan Krueger with KBW.\nRyan Krueger: First question was the $1 billion of debt that you issued in the quarter. Is there anything that, that's earmarked for? Or is that fully available to use?\nJohn McCallion: Ryan, it's John. So as you said, we issued $1 billion of debt back in July. We got some great terms on that and great execution. It's generally used -- it's generally raised for general purposes as well as we do have a maturity coming up in 2023. I think at the present time, we're maintaining flexibility and we'll see how things progress over the next few months. But all in all, we're pretty pleased with our holdco cash and cash flows generally.\nRyan Krueger: Got it. And then I just had a question on Japan, just given the big moves in FX and rates there. I guess is that -- do you view the SMR becoming less relevant in this environment and there's more emerging focus on the ESR in Japan? Or could there be a situation where the SMR becomes a negating factor to sending cash out of Japan?\nJohn McCallion: Yes, thanks. It's John, again. I'll take that. So as you said, the SMR was down in the second quarter at 6 17 and certainly in the current regime, rising interest rates do impact that. But overall, as you mentioned and I said in my opening remarks, rising interest rates improve the overall economic value of that business. We'll have to monitor the SMR. We can't ignore it but we want to also do things that make sense. And we have a number of internal tools that we can utilize to help manage that temporary impact you would see in the SMR because of the asymmetrical accounting. So overall, the economics is improving, as you mentioned, in a few years' time. They're moving to a more economic solvency framework known as ESR that will better reflect the economics of the business. And right now, we have no concerns over the capital generation or dividend capacity of the business or overall free cash flow for the firm.\nOperator: Next, we go to the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI.\nTom Gallagher: Just a couple of questions on one on derivatives, second on investment losses. Just on -- as I think about your hedges and I just look at derivative losses from rising interest rates, I just want to understand if there's any real impact to statutory capital generation from that. I look at the last 3 quarters, they've been about $2 billion or more than $2 billion of losses. I didn't think that impacted stat earnings, I thought that was an adjustment to TAC. But just first question is just any impact that should have on stack capital generation?\nJohn McCallion: And just to clarify, the $2 billion you're referencing is a GAAP number, right?\nTom Gallagher: Yes. It's in your QFS, not -- and I don't see that showing up in the -- the intact, right?\nJohn McCallion: That's right. Yes. And I think that's the correct observation. Obviously, there's different accounting that occurs in GAAP versus stat. I think the punch line that I would just leave you with is overall, we actively manage the statutory capital of the operating entities. And as you've seen, there's been a rising rate environment. And I'd say CAC has been very resilient despite the market fluctuations. That's probably how I'd leave it.\nTom Gallagher: Okay. So John, no real impact that you see right now on dividend capacity or capital generation that would be notable to point out?\nJohn McCallion: No.\nTom Gallagher: Okay. And then my follow-up is, just on the investment losses and gains in your supplement, I just want to understand how to think about whether those loss could have an impact on stack capital generation as well? I think most of those should be flowing through IMR. So to the extent that you have net losses, I think that will reduce amortization gains every year but it will have a very like modest annual impact. Am I thinking about that correctly? Or can you shed some light on that?\nSteven Goulart: Tom, it's Steve Goulart. I think John and I will tag team on this a little bit. But just in thinking about what's happening in the market and trading and losses and the like. First thing I'd say is losses are not unexpected in this environment, just given rising rates. Although I would note that they're down significantly from where they were last quarter which I think shows sort of a more moderating environment in that respect. And again, like I said last quarter, it's usually pretty easy to decipher understand why we're taking losses. It's a combination of rotating temporary assets into permanent assets and things like PRTs and other longer-term liabilities. And also just funding outflows and cash flow needs of the different businesses, whether it be surrenders or capital markets and the like. So that sort of sets the stage. Again, down from last quarter as we would expect. And obviously, this is something though that we do manage and John can talk a little bit about the capital impacts.\nJohn McCallion: Yes. And you're correct, Tom, if you have an IMR balance, would typically get absorbed, we're in that position today. But it's one you have to actively monitor and manage and we plan to do so.\nOperator: Our next question is from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research.\nErik Bass: You highlighted the strong PRT sales year-to-date in a robust pipeline. I was just hoping you could talk about how the rise in interest rates is affecting both plan sponsor demand for risk transfer as well as pricing for transactions? And also in the past, I think you've given a rule of thumb for the earnings contribution from each $1 billion of sales. I'm just wondering if this is still the right level to think about?\nRamy Tadros: Eric, it's Ramy here. I'll answer the second question first. Yes, that's still the rule of thumb still holds and that's how you should think about the earnings run rate of these deals. With respect to the overall PRT market, clearly, I think the headline number to look at is the overall funding level which is going to be helped by rising interest rates and therefore, improve if you fill the affordability and the funding levels of defined benefit plans to engage in any kind of pension risk transfer. Clearly, we've seen -- we're on track to have a record year this year. With respect to PRT, we're extremely pleased with winning our largest deal ever with IBM. And we still see a very robust pipeline in front of us. I mean, we are the market leader here. We have deep experience working with plan sponsors and their advisers on all aspects of pension risk transfers. And we have a very clear strategy in this market. We're focused on the jumbo end of the market. That placed our competitive strengths in terms of our rating, the size of our balance sheet, our investment capabilities and you see large sponsors like IBM are looking for solution providers with a very long track record of being in this business. I'd also note that the jumbo end of the market is the part of the market where the competitive set of providers tends to be somewhat smaller given all the other attributes I've talked about. And the last thing I would point on this market, while we are a market leader and actively engaged, we always have our eye on value and value of new business. Going back to the chart that Michel and John referenced and we want the write business and we are writing business which with ROEs that are well within our enterprise ROE targets.\nErik Bass: And then, I was hoping you could talk about the growth outlook for the Latin American business. There's been strong sales momentum and you're back to the earnings run rate that you had talked about. So looking forward, is double-digit growth in PFOs and earnings from here, kind of the right target to think about?\nEric Clurfain: Yes. Thanks, Erik. This is Eric. So Yes. Overall, we had another solid quarter for the region, supported by what you know is the strength of our franchise, our strong underlying business fundamentals. All of it combined with a market factors and tailwinds last quarter and this quarter. Now we continue to deliver on our growth commitments as evidenced and as you mentioned, by a double-digit growth in PFOs that are reflective both of our strong sales and solid persistencies and good momentum that we're continuing to see across all countries. Now the sales momentum that began really last year has continued throughout this year. It is reflective of the resilience of our distribution channel, the diversification and the diversified product mix and the overall solidity and growth potential of the franchise in the region. Now the sales quarter -- the strong sales quarter was really across the region and across all channels with Chile and Brazil having the record quarter. Brazil actually I want to point out this is a growth story. We have grown twice as fast as the market. We are growing very well across all channels and all products. And just to give you an idea, this quarter, Brazil contributed to over 20% of the region's sales. So that overall flight to quality that I referenced last quarter is also evidenced by the strong persistencies that we're continuing to see and the robust sales of year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. So overall, we don't update our outlook and we'll do so in February but we're very pleased with the momentum and the growth that we're seeing across the region.\nOperator: And our next question is from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Scott: First question I had a few on expenses. I know you guys have guided to this direct expense ratio. But I also recognize you've been getting pretty good growth across a number of your businesses. So I just wanted to better understand the kind of operating leverage that you expect to get over time?\nMichel Khalaf: Alex, it's Michel. So let me just maybe remind why we anchored on the 12 3 and we talked about building an efficiency mindset as part of our DNA and we're seeing excellent traction on this front. And the idea here is that we wanted to -- we want to continue to free up capacity to make important investments in our business. And we've been able to do so over the last few years and I think this is playing out very nicely. If you think about, I referenced voluntary benefits and some of the capabilities that we've introduced there, Japan in terms of digitizing our business and speed to market in terms of introducing new products. So we believe it's important to continue to make those types of investments to drive our competitive advantage going forward. Now when we did sort of establish the 12 3 target, obviously, it was also in a different environment if you consider the inflationary pressures that everyone is feeling at the moment. Yet, I mean -- and again, I think this is credit to the sort of efficiency mindset that we've built here. We continue to be committed to achieving 12 3 for the year. And the last thing I would point to is that whereas we're having a record year when it comes to PRT, over $12 billion in new PRT deals, PRT premiums does not factor into our direct expense ratio, does not sort of help us from that standpoint yet. There are obviously expenses associated with winning this business. So for all those reasons, we continue to believe that 12 3 is the right target for us.\nAlex Scott: Got it. That's really helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up on the capital deployment and the value of new business disclosure you all gave. You show in that disclosure that the margins that you're making on new business are seemingly getting materially better. Does it make sense to deploy more capital? I mean I noticed you deployed a little bit less at better margins. Does it make sense to ramp that up as we think about 2023 and how much you'll deploy behind new business?\nJohn McCallion: Alex, it's John. Yes, it's a great point. I mean we are focused on achieving solid returns and deploying capital to its highest and best use and ultimately creating value, right? Value is the important number there. And while the IRR and the payback is also -- we don't want to just get focused on 1 metric, the reality is that when we can deploy a great amount of capital to improve value that we're comfortable with, we're going to do it. And I think that it's a great call out I think that you've made. It's not -- we're not just focused on reducing the amount we deploy. We want to deploy more at very attractive returns. And I think that will fluctuate. I mean you can see, I would say, a transition that has happened over time and that's the trend you're seeing. We're at a great point right now where I think to the extent we can deploy even more capital at attractive returns, we're going to do it.\nOperator: And our next question is from Suneet Kamath with Jefferies.\nSuneet Kamath: Just going back to PRT for a second. I just wanted to think through the capital needs as you think about growth in that business. It didn't look like you needed to infuse any capital to support IBM. So I just want to confirm that. But also, as you think about the pipeline, is the opportunity set that you see in front of you going to require more capital? Or is that business sort of self-funding at this point?\nJohn McCallion: Suneet, this is John. I'll maybe just take it at a high level and maybe touch on -- I referenced in my opening remarks a slight decline in STACK capital. If you think about that, it was about 2%. Part of that -- most of that I'd say was attributable to the large deal we did in the third quarter and the related capital strain, offset by some capital generation as well as we also updated some of our latest estimates on the net positive impact from the C2 updates around mortality and morbidity. So net-net, I think overall, we've been able to self-fund our record years to date. Now your question on the outlook. I think everything is dependent. I mean, volume is a dependent factor in answering that question. But right now, we feel very comfortable with being able to fund within the operating entities, what's needed to successfully grow this business.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay, got it. And then I guess for Steve, on VII, any thoughts on kind of fourth quarter? And then also as we think about longer term, given kind of higher rates in volatile markets, any change to kind of the longer-term thought around what the returns of this portfolio could be?\nSteven Goulart: I'd say probably several points just thinking about VII and specifically, the alternatives portfolio. First is just remember our guidance. We've been very consistent for several years in that. 12% is our expectation every year when we're going to planning, 3% a quarter. And I'd say that even now looking forward to the last part of your question, I wouldn't anticipate that changing. That's just how we think about this portfolio. The second thing is really our experience. And we've talked a lot about this, too, where in general, one of the things that we've always found attractive about the alternatives portfolio is that it does give us equity-like returns but it gives it to us with less volatility and less extremes as compared to some other public market alternatives would. So that's why it's been very attractive to us. Now, we did -- we talked a little bit several quarters over the last couple of years where we saw that relationship be challenged. But when we look at the last couple of quarters, we do think that we're turning to sort of the historical norm in our expectations which is, again, more muted in terms of volatility and extremes but still giving us very attractive returns. So I don't think our outlook would change for it now but we continue to like it for the reasons that we've mentioned.\nOperator: Next, we have a question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: My first question, I know you guys are typically asked just about potential transaction within your blocks within Holdings. Anything new there or any changes that you've seen within the bid-ask spread within the market in the quarter?\nJohn McCallion: Elyse, nothing new to update here. It's still an active market out there. There is still an active set of participants. We continue to focus on optimizing holdings, both from an internal perspective as well as speaking with external participants on opportunities. And as we have been for quite some time. And it's a potential opportunity but it's not one where we feel like we have to do anything and we're being thoughtful about seeing if there is a opportunity one way or the other. So -- but nothing new at this point.\nElyse Greenspan: And then on the RIS on the core spread ex-VII, anything within that number? And how should we kind of think about that trending from here?\nJohn McCallion: Elyse, it's John again. As you said, total spreads were at 71, ex-VII came in at 101. So year-over-year, up 8 basis points on an ex-VII basis and then down sequentially. Year-over-year, it's -- obviously, the higher interest rates have been beneficial. We have more of these interest rate caps that are in the money that are starting to kind of add to the spread. Sequentially, it was down 2 basis points. In the second quarter, I called out that there were some excess returns in real estate that we expected to moderate they did. So, I'd say third quarter came in pretty much as expected. And then I think the thing going forward here is certainly based on the forward curve which I just pulled up this morning of 3-month LIBOR which is expected to rise to above 5% in the end of the year and beyond into next year. These caps will still be in place and will be additive to the spread. I'd say for fourth quarter, we'd expect spreads all else equal to grow by 5-plus bps.\nOperator: Next, we go to the line of Wilma Burtis with Raymond James.\nWilma Burdis: [Indiscernible] previously guided to $650 million, $750 million of corporate costs for 2022. It sounds like you're sticking to the 12.3% expense guidance but should we expect a higher run rate in corporate heading into 2023, given PFO growth and inflation?\nJohn McCallion: Wilma, this is John. Good question. I think a couple of things to point out in terms of just third quarter. First, in the first and third quarter, we typically have higher preferred stock dividends by about $30 million. Second, we are running a little heavier on interest costs on debt just because of the $1 billion of debt we raised in July. I think third item is PE returns have been down the last couple of quarters. And then lastly, I called out in my opening remarks that we do get -- we have seen over the last couple of quarters some higher market-sensitive employee-related costs or corporate costs that we referred to. And actually, that probably hit us by about 40 basis points on the expense ratio this quarter. So we are running a little heavy, as Michel commented before, we still expect to meet the 12.3% target despite this. And then I think we'll talk about outlook as we get into our February call. So hopefully, that helps.\nWilma Burdis: Okay. Second question, you've previously guided to a roughly $65 million quarterly earnings run rate in EMEA. But it seems like $56 million this quarter was fairly normal. So I'm wondering if that's a good run rate reflecting currency pressures.?\nJohn McCallion: Yes. I think that's a pretty simple way of thinking about it, one, you're on. I mean, the currency has basically brought down that run rate over the last couple of quarters. So I think you're right that probably the new number is probably closer to that.\nOperator: And that's all the time we have available for questions. And we will now pass the call back to MetLife's CEO, Michel Khalaf for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nMichel Khalaf: Thank you all for joining us this morning. When we rolled out our future work model in March, we did so grounded in the belief that the office plays an important role in how we live our purpose. I've now had the opportunity to visit our major offices in the U.S. and internationally. The vibrancy, energy and focus I encountered was palpable and speaks to the cultural evolution underpinning our Next Horizon strategy. More evidence of this emerged in our annual global employee survey, where participation rates and engagement scores reached their highest levels ever. MetLife is a team sport. These levels of energy and engagement give us further confidence in our ability to relentlessly execute on our strategy and deliver long-term value to our stakeholders. Thanks again and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Eric Clurfain",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Erik. This is Eric. So Yes. Overall, we had another solid quarter for the region, supported by what you know is the strength of our franchise, our strong underlying business fundamentals. All of it combined with a market factors and tailwinds last quarter and this quarter. Now we continue to deliver on our growth commitments as evidenced and as you mentioned, by a double-digit growth in PFOs that are reflective both of our strong sales and solid persistencies and good momentum that we're continuing to see across all countries. Now the sales momentum that began really last year has continued throughout this year. It is reflective of the resilience of our distribution channel, the diversification and the diversified product mix and the overall solidity and growth potential of the franchise in the region. Now the sales quarter -- the strong sales quarter was really across the region and across all channels with Chile and Brazil having the record quarter. Brazil actually I want to point out this is a growth story. We have grown twice as fast as the market. We are growing very well across all channels and all products. And just to give you an idea, this quarter, Brazil contributed to over 20% of the region's sales. So that overall flight to quality that I referenced last quarter is also evidenced by the strong persistencies that we're continuing to see and the robust sales of year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. So overall, we don't update our outlook and we'll do so in February but we're very pleased with the momentum and the growth that we're seeing across the region."

            "name": "Michel Khalaf",
            "content": "Thank you, John and good morning, everyone. Many of the macroeconomic trends from the first half of the year persisted in the third quarter. As equity markets fell again, interest rates rose some more and the possibility of a recession remains in sight. Against this backdrop, we are pleased with the execution of our Next Horizon strategy which continues to prove its resilience in the face of uncertainty. Looking ahead, there are several areas that we believe differentiate MetLife and position us well going forward. We have established a track record of relentless execution focused on controlling those factors that we can control. We have built a diversified portfolio of businesses with natural offsets through organic growth, supplemented by strategic acquisitions and tactical divestments. We have a commitment to responsible growth, aided by the use of powerful analytical tools such as VNB or value of new business to produce high-teen IRRs and mid-single-digit payback periods. We have embedded an efficiency mindset in our DNA which drives our productivity and provides us with the capacity to invest in the future. And we generate strong recurring free cash flow that supports clear and consistent capital and liquidity management. Turning to quarterly performance as a whole. Recurring investment rates rose, PFOs on a constant rate basis were strong, COVID-19 losses in the aggregate moderated and expense discipline held firm. The greatest headwind was variable investment income. Starting with some numbers. Last night, we reported third quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $966 million or $1.21 per share. Notable items in the quarter included our annual actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments which had a positive impact of $34 million or $0.04 per share on adjusted earnings. Excluding notable items, adjusted earnings in the quarter were $1.16 per share. Net income in the third quarter was $331 million compared to $1.5 billion a year ago, primarily driven by lower adjusted earnings and derivative losses from hedges we hold to protect our balance sheet as well as investment losses from standard investment activity. In the third quarter, variable investment income was a loss of $53 million. Private equity is the largest contributor to VII and generated a negative 1.3% return in the quarter. As you know, our PE portfolio is reported on a 1 quarter lag. Third quarter private equity results reflect the difficult second quarter equity market which fell 16.4% as measured by the S&P 500. Our investment in private equity is driven by its properties as a long-dated asset class that provides a good match for our long-dated liabilities. Not only has this proven to be a good ALM strategy but we have generated substantial gains over time for the benefit of our policyholders and our shareholders. As a partial offset to private equity in the quarter, we saw recurring investment income grow sequentially on higher new money rates. For roughly the past decade, we effectively managed through an interest rate environment where our new money rate was below our roll-off rate. In the second quarter, that finally reversed as our new money rate exceeded our roll-off rate. This repeated in the third quarter to even greater effect. With the duration of our investment portfolio at roughly 8 years, we expect the impact of this change to build over time. Broadly speaking, rising interest rates are a good thing for MetLife. Shifting to our business segments. We saw strong growth in U.S. Group Benefits with adjusted earnings of $399 million, up 259% year-over-year. This represents favorable underwriting, including a substantial decline in COVID-19 life insurance claims and aided by strong volume growth. Group Life mortality, including COVID-19 losses, registered a benefit ratio of 86% which continues to be at the low end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. And our nonmedical health ratio was 70.8%, also at the low end of our annual target range of 70% to 75%. Execution across our enrollment and voluntary strategy is going well and responsible for driving double-digit PFO growth across our voluntary suite of products. The investments we've made to expand our product breadth to deepen our understanding of employee needs and to connect and communicate with employees are all paying off. In Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were $345 million which were down from a year ago, largely due to lower variable investment income. Benefiting from higher rates, recurring investment income spreads remained strong. The highlight in the quarter for RIS was winning our largest ever pension risk transfer deal of roughly $8 billion. Year-to-date, we have booked $12.3 billion of new PRT business, already an all-time annual high for MetLife. And we continue to see a robust pipeline with a market opportunity extending out for years. For Asia, adjusted earnings of $197 million were below a year ago, mostly on lower variable investment income and unfavorable underwriting. COVID claims reduced adjusted earnings in the quarter by $129 million, driven largely by hospitalization claims in Japan. Changes to hospitalization claims eligibility rules which took effect at the end of September, will greatly reduce such claims looking ahead. Asia sales were up 27% on a constant currency basis from a year ago, led by Japan foreign currency annuities and Accident & Health products. Two weeks ago, on a visit to Asia, I had the opportunity to engage with our team and our distribution partners and bear witness to our strong execution. In this fast-changing environment, our efforts to meet our customers where they are and the nimbleness of that pursuit are strengthening our competitive advantage. In Latin America, the region had another strong quarter with adjusted earnings totaling $171 million, up significantly from COVID-impacted $29 million a year ago. Latin America sales continue to be strong, rising 22% for the quarter across the region on a constant currency basis, reflecting sustained business momentum. MetLife's focus on responsible growth is an integral element of our strategy. On an annual basis, in the third quarter, we disclosed our value of new business metrics for the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, VNB is a tool that underpins our efforts to generate responsible growth. The metrics show that MetLife has been able to put capital to work to support organic growth more effectively and efficiently over time. For example, in 2019, we deployed $3.8 billion of capital at a 15% IRR to generate $1.8 billion of VNB. 2 years later, we put less capital to work, $2.8 billion at a higher IRR to generate even more VNB, $1.9 billion. We think our principal use of VNB and the results that we've achieved are clear differentiators for MetLife. The discipline we use to evaluate and drive new business is no different than the discipline we employ to score merger and acquisition opportunities. During the third quarter, MetLife Investment Management announced a definitive agreement to acquire Affirmative Investment Management. AIM is an award-winning global environmental, social and corporate governance investment manager with roughly $1 billion of assets under management. Combining AIMs ESG capabilities with MEMS fundamental investment expertise will create differentiated client solutions and offer a new and attractive opportunity for growth. Further, this transaction underscores our strategic objective to grow our investment management business while highlighting M&A as a strategic capability for MetLife. Moving to cash and capital. MetLife continued to be active with capital management during the third quarter. We paid $400 million of common stock dividends to shareholders. We also repurchased $674 million of our common shares, bringing total capital return in the quarter to roughly $1.1 billion. In October, we repurchased an additional $176 million of MetLife shares. There remains $1.6 billion outstanding on our current $3 billion authorization. MetLife is well capitalized and highly liquid. At the end of the quarter, we had $5.2 billion of cash and liquid assets at our Holdings companies. We remain comfortably above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. In closing, our all-weather Next Horizon strategy continues to be the right strategy to guide us through the changing times ahead. Together, the diversification of our great set of market-leading businesses, our responsible growth, our efficiency mindset and our strong free cash flow generation will serve MetLife well across a range of economic cycles. We believe these are the right ingredients to create value for our shareholders and our stakeholders now and into the future. With that, I will turn things over to John. Alex, it's Michel. So let me just maybe remind why we anchored on the 12 3 and we talked about building an efficiency mindset as part of our DNA and we're seeing excellent traction on this front. And the idea here is that we wanted to -- we want to continue to free up capacity to make important investments in our business. And we've been able to do so over the last few years and I think this is playing out very nicely. If you think about, I referenced voluntary benefits and some of the capabilities that we've introduced there, Japan in terms of digitizing our business and speed to market in terms of introducing new products. So we believe it's important to continue to make those types of investments to drive our competitive advantage going forward. Now when we did sort of establish the 12 3 target, obviously, it was also in a different environment if you consider the inflationary pressures that everyone is feeling at the moment. Yet, I mean -- and again, I think this is credit to the sort of efficiency mindset that we've built here. We continue to be committed to achieving 12 3 for the year. And the last thing I would point to is that whereas we're having a record year when it comes to PRT, over $12 billion in new PRT deals, PRT premiums does not factor into our direct expense ratio, does not sort of help us from that standpoint yet. There are obviously expenses associated with winning this business. So for all those reasons, we continue to believe that 12 3 is the right target for us. Thank you all for joining us this morning. When we rolled out our future work model in March, we did so grounded in the belief that the office plays an important role in how we live our purpose. I've now had the opportunity to visit our major offices in the U.S. and internationally. The vibrancy, energy and focus I encountered was palpable and speaks to the cultural evolution underpinning our Next Horizon strategy. More evidence of this emerged in our annual global employee survey, where participation rates and engagement scores reached their highest levels ever. MetLife is a team sport.

            "name": "Ramy Tadros",
            "content": "Jimmy, it's Ramy Tadros here. If you look at our in-force for RIS, the vast majority of our in-force from a crediting grade perspective is fixed. You may see quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in terms of the crediting grid. And clearly, the new business we're writing, while we're running at attractive spreads, it has a higher crediting rate given the market environment. But there is no really increases or pressure on our in-force because that's mostly fixed. Thanks, Jimmy. It's Ramy again. So I'll give a specific answer to your question. It may be also helpful to give you some broader context. Both our mortality ratio as well as our nonmedical health ratio were clearly favorable in the quarter. But if you look at our results, historically, there's some seasonality to both of those ratios and we'd expect them to somewhat pick up in the fourth quarter just from a seasonality perspective. In terms of the overall market, we remain extremely bullish about this market. And if you were to kind of step back more broadly, you've all heard about the workplace dynamics and how those are changing where we're seeing employees expecting more from their employers and we're seeing employers looking for a variety of levers to attract, retain and engage their talent. And so that's a secular trend that's here to stay and that's providing kind of tailwinds for the entire market. From a competitive perspective, I would say overall pricing is competitive but is also rational. We've talked about this in the past, the short nature of these products, Jimmy, really act as a natural check on any sustained irrational pricing. And the other piece of this market that we kind of like is that you can also differentiate on many factors beyond price such as service and digital experiences to name a few. So some of these things, we believe, are going to provide kind of tailwinds to the overall market and keep the competitive landscape rationale. Now all of these are germane to the entire Group Benefits industry. They're particularly pertinent for us because we are the market leader in this industry across both our core and voluntary products. And that leadership and the strategic focus we've had is really giving us the scale to invest in a broad range of capabilities that we have that allows us to differentiate our offerings. So overall, really pleased with the performance, really pleased with the persistency and continue to see a competitive but rational market here. Eric, it's Ramy here. I'll answer the second question first. Yes, that's still the rule of thumb still holds and that's how you should think about the earnings run rate of these deals. With respect to the overall PRT market, clearly, I think the headline number to look at is the overall funding level which is going to be helped by rising interest rates and therefore, improve if you fill the affordability and the funding levels of defined benefit plans to engage in any kind of pension risk transfer. Clearly, we've seen -- we're on track to have a record year this year. With respect to PRT, we're extremely pleased with winning our largest deal ever with IBM. And we still see a very robust pipeline in front of us. I mean, we are the market leader here. We have deep experience working with plan sponsors and their advisers on all aspects of pension risk transfers. And we have a very clear strategy in this market. We're focused on the jumbo end of the market. That placed our competitive strengths in terms of our rating, the size of our balance sheet, our investment capabilities and you see large sponsors like IBM are looking for solution providers with a very long track record of being in this business. I'd also note that the jumbo end of the market is the part of the market where the competitive set of providers tends to be somewhat smaller given all the other attributes I've talked about. And the last thing I would point on this market, while we are a market leader and actively engaged, we always have our eye on value and value of new business. Going back to the chart that Michel and John referenced and we want the write business and we are writing business which with ROEs that are well within our enterprise ROE targets."

            "name": "John McCallion",
            "content": "Thank you, Michel and good morning. I will start with the 3Q '22 supplemental slides which provide highlights of our financial performance, details of our annual global actuarial assumption review, updates on our value of new business metrics and our cash and capital positions. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the third quarter. Net derivative losses were primarily the result of higher interest rates. As a reminder, MetLife uses derivatives as part of our broader asset liability management strategy to hedge certain risks. This hedging activity can generate durative gains or losses and create fluctuations in net income because the risk being hedged may not have the same GAAP accounting treatment. Overall, the hedging program continues to perform as expected. In addition, we had net investment losses from our normal trading activity in the portfolio given the rising interest rate environment. In total, the actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments in 3Q of '22, was favorable to net income by $54 million, with a positive impact to adjusted earnings of $34 million and a $20 million impact to non-adjusted earnings. The table on Page 4 provides highlights of the actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments with a breakdown of the adjusted earnings and net income impact by business. Overall, the impacts were fairly modest. In MetLife Holdings, annuity earnings were negatively impacted by lower-than-expected lapses and annuitizations as well as model refinements. This was partially offset by favorable impact in life as a result of higher earned rates and favorable mortality. In addition, we had a reinsurance recapture gain which was favorable to RIS adjusted earnings by $91 million in the quarter. Our U.S. mean reversion interest rate remained unchanged at 2.75%. And we have maintained our long-term mortality assumptions. On Page 5, you can see the third quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment which excludes notable items in both periods. Adjusted earnings, excluding total notable items was $932 million in 3Q of '22, down 58% and down 57% on a constant currency basis. Lower variable investment income drove the year-over-year decline while favorable underwriting and solid volume growth were partial offsets. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding notable items, was $1.16, down 55% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 54% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. business. Group Benefits adjusted earnings more than tripled year-over-year, primarily due to significant improvement in underwriting margins aided by lower COVID-19 life claims as well as higher volume growth. This was partially offset by less favorable expense and investment margins year-over-year. The Group Life mortality ratio was 86% in the third quarter of '22 towards the bottom end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. The business benefited from lower U.S. COVID deaths in the quarter and a continued favorable shift in the percentage of death under age 65 which was roughly 15% in Q3 of '22. More detail on the Group Life mortality results over the past 5 quarters can be found on Page 12 in the appendix. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 70.8% in Q3 of '22 at the low end of its annual target range of 70% to 75% and essentially in line with the prior year quarter. Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 3.4% year-over-year. As we discussed in prior quarters, excess mortality can result in higher premiums from participating life contracts in the period. The higher excess mortality in Q3 of '21 versus Q3 of '22 resulted in a year-over-year decline in premiums from participating contracts which dampened growth by roughly 1 percentage point. The underlying PFO increase of approximately 4.4% was primarily due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings, excluding the notable in this quarter, were down 68% year-over-year. The primary driver was lower private equity return versus a very strong Q3 of '21 as well as less favorable underwriting. Favorable volume growth was a partial offset. RIS investment spreads were 71 basis points, well below our full year 2022 guidance of 95 to 120 basis points and prior year quarter of 256 basis points due to the significant decline in variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 101 basis points, up 8 basis points versus Q3 of '21 and down 2 basis points sequentially. While RIS liability exposures were down 1% year-over-year due to certain accounting adjustments that do not impact fees or spread income, RIS had strong volume growth driven by sales up 59% year-to-date. This was primarily driven by pension risk transfers and stable value products. With regards to PRT, this has been a record year for MetLife as we have completed 6 transactions worth $12.3 billion year-to-date and we continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings ex notables were down 73% on both a reported and constant currency basis, primarily due to lower variable investment income and unfavorable underwriting. This was partially offset by solid volume growth as assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 4% on a constant currency basis. In addition, Asia sales were up 27% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by a strong performance in Japan. Overall, Japan sales were up 33% driven by FX annuities and accident and health products which benefited from product launches and new capabilities over the past year as well as the strength of our diversified channels. Latin America adjusted earnings ex notables were $164 million versus $31 million in the prior year quarter. This strong performance was primarily driven by favorable underwriting and solid volume growth. Overall, COVID-19-related deaths in Mexico were down significantly year-over-year. LATAM's recurring interest margins in 3Q '22 continued to benefit from higher inflation rates in Chile. However, this favorable impact was more than offset by lower variable investment income and the Chilean and encaje [ph] which had a negative 1.9% return in 3Q '22 versus a negative 0.3% in the prior year quarter. LATAM's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 21% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and sales were up 22% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region, primarily from higher single premium immediate annuity sales in Chile and group cases in Mexico. EMEA adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were down 44% and 31% on a constant currency basis compared to a strong Q3 of '21 which benefited from very favorable underwriting. EMEA adjusted PFOs were down 7% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to refinements to certain unearned revenue reserves in both periods. However, sales were up 10% on a constant currency basis, reflecting growth across the region. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 77%, excluding notable items in both periods. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income. Adverse equity market impact was also a contributor as MetLife Holdings separate account return was negative 5.5% in the quarter versus a negative 1% in 3Q of '21. Favorable underwriting margins in Life and long-term care were a partial offset. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $265 million versus an adjusted loss of $131 million. The year-over-year variance was primarily due to less favorable taxes, lower variable investment income and higher expenses due to market-sensitive employee-related costs. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 23% which was at the top end of our 2022 guidance range of 21% to 23%. On Page 6, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the past 5 quarters, including a $53 million loss in the third quarter of '22. The majority of VII was attributable to the private equity portfolio of roughly $14 billion which had an overall negative return of 1.3% in the quarter. As we have discussed previously, private equity is generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag. In addition, real estate equity funds had a positive 4.3% return in the quarter on a portfolio of roughly $2.3 billion. While VII underperformed in 3Q '22, our new money rate increased to 4.71% which was 79 basis points above our roll-off yield of 3.92%. We expect this favorable trend to continue in a rising interest rate environment. On Page 7, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the prior 5 quarters, including a $42 million loss in Q3 of '22. RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia continue to earn the vast majority of variable investment income consistent with the higher VII assets in their respective investment portfolios. VII assets are primarily owned to match longer-dated liabilities which are mostly in these 3 businesses. Turning to Page 8. This chart shows the comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior 5 quarters, including 12.3% in Q3 of '22. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our third quarter expense ratio was in line with our full year target but above recent trend given higher employee-related costs that are sensitive to market fluctuations. Those costs contributed roughly 40 basis points to the ratio. While we'd expect our direct expense ratio to be higher in 4Q, consistent with the seasonality of our business, we remain committed to achieving our full year direct expense ratio target of 12.3% in 2022 despite the challenging inflationary environment. We believe this demonstrates our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. Now, let's turn to Page 9. This chart reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments for the past 5 years, including an update for 2021. Consistent with our Next Horizon strategy, we continue to have a relentless focus on deploying capital and resources to the highest value opportunities. As evidence of that commitment, MetLife invested $2.8 billion of capital in 2021 to support new business which was deployed at an average unlevered IRR of approximately 17% with a payback period of 6 years, generating roughly $1.9 billion in value. New business written in 2021 reflects our disciplined approach to building responsible growth while creating value, generating cash and mitigating risk. I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 10. Cash and liquid assets at the Holdings companies were approximately $5.2 billion at September 30 which was up from $4.5 billion at June 30 and remains well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential increase in cash at the Holdings companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of approximately $700 million in the third quarter as well as Holdings company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, Holdco cash includes the proceeds from the $1 billion senior debt issuance in July. In regard to our statutory capital, for our U.S. companies, our preliminary third quarter year-to-date 2022 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.6 billion, while net income was approximately $2.1 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by approximately $2.4 billion year-over-year, driven by unfavorable VA rider reserves, lower variable investment income and higher expenses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.7 billion as of September 30, 2022, down 2% sequentially and year-to-date. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 617% as of June 30 which is the latest public data. The decline from March 2022 was primarily due to higher U.S. interest rates. That being said, rising interest rates improve the overall economic solvency of our Japan business. Let me conclude by saying the fundamentals of the business remain strong, solid top line growth, favorable underwriting and ongoing expense discipline. While private equity returns were down this quarter, core spreads remain robust. In addition, results in our market-leading franchises, Group Benefits and Latin America continue their strong growth and recovery. Finally, our commitment to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth positions MetLife to build sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Ryan, it's John. So as you said, we issued $1 billion of debt back in July. We got some great terms on that and great execution. It's generally used -- it's generally raised for general purposes as well as we do have a maturity coming up in 2023. I think at the present time, we're maintaining flexibility and we'll see how things progress over the next few months. But all in all, we're pretty pleased with our holdco cash and cash flows generally. Yes, thanks. It's John, again. I'll take that. So as you said, the SMR was down in the second quarter at 6 17 and certainly in the current regime, rising interest rates do impact that. But overall, as you mentioned and I said in my opening remarks, rising interest rates improve the overall economic value of that business. We'll have to monitor the SMR. We can't ignore it but we want to also do things that make sense. And we have a number of internal tools that we can utilize to help manage that temporary impact you would see in the SMR because of the asymmetrical accounting. So overall, the economics is improving, as you mentioned, in a few years' time. They're moving to a more economic solvency framework known as ESR that will better reflect the economics of the business. And right now, we have no concerns over the capital generation or dividend capacity of the business or overall free cash flow for the firm. And just to clarify, the $2 billion you're referencing is a GAAP number, right? That's right. Yes. And I think that's the correct observation. Obviously, there's different accounting that occurs in GAAP versus stat. I think the punch line that I would just leave you with is overall, we actively manage the statutory capital of the operating entities. And as you've seen, there's been a rising rate environment. And I'd say CAC has been very resilient despite the market fluctuations. That's probably how I'd leave it. No. Yes. And you're correct, Tom, if you have an IMR balance, would typically get absorbed, we're in that position today. But it's one you have to actively monitor and manage and we plan to do so. Alex, it's John. Yes, it's a great point. I mean we are focused on achieving solid returns and deploying capital to its highest and best use and ultimately creating value, right? Value is the important number there. And while the IRR and the payback is also -- we don't want to just get focused on 1 metric, the reality is that when we can deploy a great amount of capital to improve value that we're comfortable with, we're going to do it. And I think that it's a great call out I think that you've made. It's not -- we're not just focused on reducing the amount we deploy. We want to deploy more at very attractive returns. And I think that will fluctuate. I mean you can see, I would say, a transition that has happened over time and that's the trend you're seeing. We're at a great point right now where I think to the extent we can deploy even more capital at attractive returns, we're going to do it. Suneet, this is John. I'll maybe just take it at a high level and maybe touch on -- I referenced in my opening remarks a slight decline in STACK capital. If you think about that, it was about 2%. Part of that -- most of that I'd say was attributable to the large deal we did in the third quarter and the related capital strain, offset by some capital generation as well as we also updated some of our latest estimates on the net positive impact from the C2 updates around mortality and morbidity. So net-net, I think overall, we've been able to self-fund our record years to date. Now your question on the outlook. I think everything is dependent. I mean, volume is a dependent factor in answering that question. But right now, we feel very comfortable with being able to fund within the operating entities, what's needed to successfully grow this business. Elyse, nothing new to update here. It's still an active market out there. There is still an active set of participants. We continue to focus on optimizing holdings, both from an internal perspective as well as speaking with external participants on opportunities. And as we have been for quite some time. And it's a potential opportunity but it's not one where we feel like we have to do anything and we're being thoughtful about seeing if there is a opportunity one way or the other. So -- but nothing new at this point. Elyse, it's John again. As you said, total spreads were at 71, ex-VII came in at 101. So year-over-year, up 8 basis points on an ex-VII basis and then down sequentially. Year-over-year, it's -- obviously, the higher interest rates have been beneficial. We have more of these interest rate caps that are in the money that are starting to kind of add to the spread. Sequentially, it was down 2 basis points. In the second quarter, I called out that there were some excess returns in real estate that we expected to moderate they did. So, I'd say third quarter came in pretty much as expected. And then I think the thing going forward here is certainly based on the forward curve which I just pulled up this morning of 3-month LIBOR which is expected to rise to above 5% in the end of the year and beyond into next year. These caps will still be in place and will be additive to the spread. I'd say for fourth quarter, we'd expect spreads all else equal to grow by 5-plus bps. Wilma, this is John. Good question. I think a couple of things to point out in terms of just third quarter. First, in the first and third quarter, we typically have higher preferred stock dividends by about $30 million. Second, we are running a little heavier on interest costs on debt just because of the $1 billion of debt we raised in July. I think third item is PE returns have been down the last couple of quarters. And then lastly, I called out in my opening remarks that we do get -- we have seen over the last couple of quarters some higher market-sensitive employee-related costs or corporate costs that we referred to. And actually, that probably hit us by about 40 basis points on the expense ratio this quarter. So we are running a little heavy, as Michel commented before, we still expect to meet the 12.3% target despite this. And then I think we'll talk about outlook as we get into our February call. So hopefully, that helps. Yes. I think that's a pretty simple way of thinking about it, one, you're on. I mean, the currency has basically brought down that run rate over the last couple of quarters. So I think you're right that probably the new number is probably closer to that."

            "content": "Jimmy, it's Steve Goulart. Thanks for the question. And I think John gave some details and color on it but our new money yield rose again this past quarter. 471 was the actual number and that shows continued improvement. I think a reflection of what we're seeing in the market, obviously, with interest rates rising. And so we're very pleased with what it means for our general account investing. We're obviously going to continue to see the portfolio yield rise as a result of that given that our roll-off has been now for the last couple of quarters also lower than our new money rates. I would also just remind everybody, though, that things can be a little bit volatile quarter-to-quarter, just looking at the existing book of assets that we have, with the roll-off of maturity characteristics of those are. This was -- we look and see some big blocks that rolled off this past quarter and there'll be things like that in the future as well. But I think what's important is to think about what the trend is. The trend is positive. We continue to see and expect our new money yield to increase and continue to expect to see widening spread over the existing portfolio and that's obviously positive for net investment income. Tom, it's Steve Goulart. I think John and I will tag team on this a little bit. But just in thinking about what's happening in the market and trading and losses and the like. First thing I'd say is losses are not unexpected in this environment, just given rising rates. Although I would note that they're down significantly from where they were last quarter which I think shows sort of a more moderating environment in that respect. And again, like I said last quarter, it's usually pretty easy to decipher understand why we're taking losses. It's a combination of rotating temporary assets into permanent assets and things like PRTs and other longer-term liabilities. And also just funding outflows and cash flow needs of the different businesses, whether it be surrenders or capital markets and the like. So that sort of sets the stage. Again, down from last quarter as we would expect. And obviously, this is something though that we do manage and John can talk a little bit about the capital impacts. I'd say probably several points just thinking about VII and specifically, the alternatives portfolio. First is just remember our guidance. We've been very consistent for several years in that. 12% is our expectation every year when we're going to planning, 3% a quarter. And I'd say that even now looking forward to the last part of your question, I wouldn't anticipate that changing. That's just how we think about this portfolio. The second thing is really our experience. And we've talked a lot about this, too, where in general, one of the things that we've always found attractive about the alternatives portfolio is that it does give us equity-like returns but it gives it to us with less volatility and less extremes as compared to some other public market alternatives would. So that's why it's been very attractive to us. Now, we did -- we talked a little bit several quarters over the last couple of years where we saw that relationship be challenged. But when we look at the last couple of quarters, we do think that we're turning to sort of the historical norm in our expectations which is, again, more muted in terms of volatility and extremes but still giving us very attractive returns. So I don't think our outlook would change for it now but we continue to like it for the reasons that we've mentioned."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to the risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings.  With that, I will now turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.\nJohn Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I'd point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review.  On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides, which address the quarter. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along.  An appendix to these slides feature incremental disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information which you should also review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session, which will end no later than the top of the hour. In fairness to all, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Now over to Michel.\nMichel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Over time, I have referred to our Next Horizon strategy as being all weather designed to guide MetLife through a variety of economic environments. And the environment has shifted with equity markets falling from historic highs, interest rates trending up from historic lows, further strengthening of the dollar and the odds of a U.S. recession on the rise.  The resilience of Next Horizon, combined with our clarity of purpose, positioned MetLife to meet these challenges in the second quarter of 2022. While certain things may be outside our control, we continue to execute with urgency across those things we do control. Let's turn to some numbers. MetLife reported strong financial results for the second quarter. Adjusted earnings were $1.6 billion or $2 per share compared to $2.37 per share a year ago. Excluding one notable item, adjusted earnings were $1.90 per share.  The combination of strong underwriting margins and good volume growth drove solid adjusted earnings results while variable investment income fell below our quarterly outlook expectations. Net income in the second quarter was $103 million compared to $3.4 billion a year ago. Current period net income was driven by adjusted earnings, offset by interest rate and foreign currency derivative losses from securities held to protect our balance sheet.  Also, standard investment activity resulted in realized losses as interest rates rose during the quarter. Year ago net income includes the gain we booked on the successful sale of our Auto & Home business. Now moving to variable investment income, which returned to a more typical level following 7 consecutive quarters of truly outstanding results. During the 7-quarter period, MetLife generated more than $8 billion of cumulative pretax variable investment income. This type of investment performance serves to validate MetLife's long-term prudent exposure to this value-added asset class.  In the second quarter, variable investment income of $389 million was aided by private equity investments and real estate funds, which generated returns of 1.5% and 7.9%, respectively. Our private equity returns are reported on a 1-quarter lag and the weak second quarter equity market should negatively impact our variable investment income in the third quarter.  Throughout the pandemic, the broad diversity of MetLife's businesses across product lines and geographies has clearly been a great strength. Initially, underwriting gains in one business offset underwriting losses elsewhere. When COVID claims seem to reach their peak, our private equity gains then filled the gap. And the current quarter continues to illustrate this point as variable investment income has returned to more normal levels in the second quarter, so too have our underwriting margins.  Turning to MetLife's business performance. I'll start with our U.S. Group Benefits results. Adjusted earnings of $400 million were up 61% year-over-year. This represents the highest quarterly result ever posted by this flagship business, primarily driven by favorable underwriting. Historically, the second quarter tends to be a low mortality quarter, something that was also evident this year.  Group Life mortality, including COVID-19 losses, registered a benefit ratio of 85.8%, which is at the low end of our target range of 85% to 90%. A significant contraction in U.S. COVID-related deaths and a further shift upward in the age of death contributed to the improvement in the second quarter benefit ratio. Having witnessed prior [indiscernible] during this 2.5-year long pandemic, we are cautiously optimistic and note the absence of much, if any, excess mortality in our current period group benefits results.  At the current pace, MetLife is on track to generate close to $25 billion of adjusted group benefit revenue in 2022, a true testament to our product breadth, scale and momentum in this attractive market-leading business. For Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings totaled $388 million, which were down from a year ago due to less variable investment income, but helped by favorable volume growth. Looking past the decline in variable investment income, recurring investment income spreads were strong at 103 basis points as we continue to manage against a shifting yield curve.  During the quarter, we booked $2.6 billion of new pension risk transfer business, which brings our year-to-date total to roughly $4 billion. We continue to see a strong pipeline for the balance of the year based on good funding levels and higher long-term interest rates. In Asia, adjusted earnings of $386 million were below a year ago on lower variable investment income and less favorable underwriting.  COVID claims in Japan impacted adjusted earnings in the quarter, driven largely by deemed hospitalization, which allows for payment of COVID claims incurred for care outside of the hospital. Other Asia business metrics remained favorable, with sales growing 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, while general account AUMs in the region were up 5% on the same basis.  In Japan, sales grew 5% on a constant currency basis. MetLife has a history of product innovation in Japan. Most recently, we've built on that legacy with product launches in September, February and April, illustrating both our speed to market for new products and our leading digital distribution capabilities. We continue to have good sales momentum in Japan, supported by a resilient business model and we remain on track to achieve our Asia region sales outlook for the year.  Looking to Latin America, adjusted earnings totaled $267 million, well above $97 million a year ago. Lower COVID claims, a favorable impact from inflation, a strong encaje and continued volume growth, all combined to generate substantial outperformance in the second quarter. Fundamental drivers in Latin America also remains strong with sales and PFOs up from a year ago on a constant currency basis by 19% and 26%, respectively.  Moving to capital and cash. MetLife was active with capital management during the second quarter, and we returned more than $1.5 billion to shareholders through $408 million of common dividends and $1.1 billion of share repurchase. In the first half of 2022, MetLife repurchased approximately $2 billion of common stock. Given the accelerated pace of buyback activity in the first half of the year, we anticipate a modestly slower pace in the back half.  There remains $2.5 billion outstanding on our current $3 billion authorization. MetLife continues to be well capitalized and highly liquid. At the end of the quarter, we had $4.5 billion of cash and liquid assets at our holding companies, which includes the proceeds from the sale of our Poland business, and we remain comfortably above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion.  Financial flexibility was further enhanced after the second quarter's end when we tapped the debt market raising $1 billion of 30-year paper and a well oversubscribed offering, another example of the value the market attributes to MetLife's financial strength. Turning to sustainability. At the end of last quarter, MetLife announced a broad set of DEI commitments designed to address the needs of the underserved and underrepresented by 2030.  The MetLife Foundation recently announced an updated strategy aimed at driving inclusive economic mobility by addressing the needs of underserved and underrepresented communities around the globe. The foundation's grant-making and impact investments will be aligned across 3 core portfolios: Economic inclusion, financial health and resilient communities and will advance the broad set of diversity, equity and inclusion commitment MetLife announced at the end of last quarter.  In closing, when we introduced our Next horizon strategy, little did we know that it would be put to the test so quickly and so severely. Our results this quarter clearly demonstrate its resilience. We saw solid underlying business performance, supported by a strong capital base, which reinforces our confidence that Next Horizon is the right strategy for MetLife. With our purpose as our North Star and with our strategic pillars to guide us along the way, MetLife is well positioned to rise to the challenges ahead and deliver significant long-term value to our shareholders and other stakeholders.  With that, I will turn things over to John.\nJohn McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 2Q '22 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, an update on our cash and capital positions as well as commentary on the new U.S. GAAP accounting known as Long Duration Targeted Improvements or LDTI, effective 1/1/23.  Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the second quarter. Higher interest rates and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter drove net derivative losses. As a reminder, MetLife uses derivatives as part of our broader asset liability management strategy to hedge certain risks. This hedging activity often generates derivative gains or losses and creates fluctuations in net income because the risk being hedged may not have the same GAAP accounting treatment.  In addition, we had net investment losses from our normal trading activity in the portfolio given the rising interest rate environment. We had one favorable notable item this quarter of $77 million or $0.09 per share related to a reinsurance settlement, which was accounted for in MetLife Holdings.  On Page 4, you can see the second quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, which excludes notable items in both periods. Adjusted earnings in the second quarter of 2022, excluding the notable item were $1.5 billion, down 23% and down 21% on a constant currency basis. Lower variable investment income drove the year-over-year decline, while favorable underwriting and solid volume growth were partial offsets.  Adjusted earnings per share, excluding the notable item, was $1.90, down 17% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 15% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. business. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were up 61% year-over-year, primarily due to significant improvement in underwriting margins aided by lower COVID-19 Life claims as well as higher volume growth.  The Group Life mortality ratio was 85.8% in the second quarter of '22 towards the bottom end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. The business benefited from lower U.S. COVID deaths in the quarter and a continued favorable shift in the percentage of death under age 65, declining from approximately 23% in the first quarter to roughly 17% in the second quarter.  The adjusted earnings impact of Group Life COVID-19 reported claims was approximately $35 million offset in part by an IBNR release related to 1Q '22 COVID-19 claims of approximately $25 million. Therefore, the net COVID impact was roughly $10 million or one percentage point on the Group Life mortality ratio. More detail on the Group Life mortality results over the past 5 quarters can be found on Page 11 in the appendix.  Regarding non-medical health, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 73.1% in Q2 of '22 within its annual target range of 70% to 75% and favorable to the prior year quarter of 73.8%. Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 3% year-over-year. As we discussed in the prior quarters, excess mortality can result in higher premiums from participating contracts in the period.  The higher excess mortality in Q2 of '21 versus Q2 of '22 resulted in a year-over-year decline in premiums from participating contracts, which dampened growth by roughly 1.5 percentage points. The underlying PFO increase of approximately 4.5% was due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 41% year-over-year. The primary driver was less favorable private equity returns versus a very strong Q2 of '21.  Favorable volume growth was a partial offset. RIS investment spreads were 116 basis points within our full year 2022 guidance of 95 to 120 basis points, but well below the prior year quarter of 224 basis points due to the significant decline in variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 103 basis points, up 5 basis points versus Q2 of '21 and up 14 basis points sequentially due to higher interest rates, wider credit spreads and favorable real estate performance.  RIS liability exposures were down 3% year-over-year despite strong top line growth. The key drivers of this decrease came from reductions in accounting adjustments that impact our liabilities, but do not impact fees or spread income and thus have no impact on adjusted earnings. RIS sales were up 30% year-to-date, primarily driven by pension risk transfers and stable value products.  With regards to PRT, we completed 3 transactions worth $2.6 billion in the quarter, a strong first half of 2022, and we continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia. adjusted earnings were down 26% and 22% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower variable investment income and unfavorable underwriting. This was partially offset by solid volume growth as assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 5% on a constant currency basis.  In addition, Asia sales were up 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by another solid performance in Japan. Overall, Japan sales were up 5% driven by FX annuities and accident and health products sold through face-to-face channels. Latin America adjusted earnings were $267 million versus $97 million in the prior year quarter. This strong performance were driven by several positive factors, primarily favorable underwriting and investment margins as well as solid volume growth.  Overall, COVID-19 related deaths in Mexico were down significantly in Q2. This positive trend, coupled with the emergence of even more favorable mortality experience in our own block, resulted in a reduction to the IBNR reserve that was established in prior periods. This benefited LatAm's adjusted earnings by roughly $40 million after tax in 2Q '22. The LatAm's adjusted earnings in the quarter also benefited from strong investment margins, primarily due to the net impact from inflation-linked assets and liabilities in Chile that increased with higher inflation rates as well as the Chilean encaje, which had a 4.8% return in 2Q '22 versus a negative 1.5% in the prior year quarter.  LATAM's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 26% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 19% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region, primarily from higher single premium immediate annuity sales in Chile and group cases in Mexico. EMEA adjusted earnings were down 32% and 16% on a constant currency basis compared to a strong Q2 of '21, which benefited from a favorable refinement of an unearned premium reserve in the prior year period, totaling approximately $15 million after tax.  In addition, adverse equity market impacts in the current year period were partially offset by favorable underwriting margins. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 46%, excluding the favorable notable item of $77 million after tax as discussed earlier. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income, adverse equity market impacts and less favorable underwriting also were contributors to the year-over-year decline.  MetLife Holdings separate account return was negative 14% in the quarter versus a positive 6% in Q2 of '21. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $243 million versus an adjusted loss of $126 million, excluding notables in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year variance was primarily due to higher expenses from corporate-related costs associated with less favorable equity markets and higher interest rates. Higher taxes and lower variable investment income were also contributors.  The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 22.3% and within our 2022 guidance range of 21% to 23%. On Page 5, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the past 5 quarters, including $389 million in the second quarter of '22. The majority of VII was attributable to the private equity portfolio of roughly $14 billion, which had an overall return of 1.5% in the quarter.  As we have previously discussed, private equity is generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag. In addition, real estate equity funds were also a strong contributor to VII with nearly an 8% return in the quarter while hedge funds, which are reported on a 1-month lag, had a loss.  While VII in 2Q '22 was below expectation and recent trends, our new money rate was 3.92% and above our roll-off yield of 3.71%. This marks the first time in over a decade in which we did not experience quarterly spread compression in the investment portfolio. On Page 6, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the prior 5 quarters, including $307 million in Q2 of '22.  Asia, MetLife Holdings and RIS continue to earn the vast majority of variable investment income consistent with the higher VII assets in their respective investment portfolios. VII assets are primarily owned to match longer-date liabilities, which are mostly in these 3 businesses.  Turning to Page 7. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior 5 quarters, including 11.9% in Q2 of '22. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our second quarter direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline.  While we would expect our direct expense ratio to be higher in the second half of the year, consistent with the seasonality of our business, we remain committed to achieving a full year direct expense ratio below 12.3% in 2022 despite the challenging inflationary environment. We believe this demonstrates our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset.  I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 8. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.5 billion at June 30, which is up from $4.2 billion at March 31 and remains above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential increase in cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $1.1 billion in the second quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows.  In addition, holdco cash includes the proceeds from the sale of our Poland business, which closed in April. In regard to our statutory capital for our U.S. companies, our preliminary second quarter year-to-date 2022 statutory operating earnings were approximately $700 million, while net income was approximately $1.3 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by approximately $2 billion year-over-year, driven by unfavorable VA rider reserves, underwriting results and lower variable investment income.  We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $19.1 billion as of June 30, 2022, up 2% sequentially. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 764% as of March 31, which is the latest public data. The decline from December 2021 was primarily due to higher U.S. interest rates.  Now shifting to LDTI on Page 9. While there is quite a bit of work still to be done prior to implementation on January 1, let me take a moment to recognize the great work of our MetLife associates and our partners in getting us to this point. This slide provides an update on our expected transition balances as of January 1, 2021, under LDTI. The column on the left was our actual balances at 12/31/'20, and the middle column contains the estimated range of our restated balances under LDTI.  The changes under LDTI that account for the bulk of the book value adjustment at transition include the market risk benefit adjustment associated with variable annuities, not presently accounted for at market, the impact of disaggregation and the revaluation of in-scope long-duration insurance contracts using a [indiscernible] equivalent discount rate and the elimination of relevant shadow account balances.  As you can see from MetLife at the end of 2020, there is a greater convergence between book value and book value excluding AOCI under LDTI. However, this may not always be the case as certain assets are not mark-to-market and not all liabilities are in scope under LDTI. While LDTI will provide additional information and transparency and improve consistency around accounting for certain aspects of the life insurance industry, it does not impact cumulative product profitability, cash flow generation, our strategy or how we manage the business.  Let me conclude by saying MetLife delivered another strong quarter, highlighted by solid top line growth, ongoing expense discipline and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities that allow us to navigate successfully through uncertain environments. While private equity returns were lower this quarter, it was offset by favorable underwriting, most notably in our market-leading franchises in Group Benefits and Mexico, which saw a return to more normal mortality as COVID-19 deaths significantly declined.  Finally, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio remains strong and position us for further success. And we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Ryan Krueger with KBW.\nRyan Krueger: First question was, thanks for the LDTI disclosure on the balance sheet. I guess, at this point, are you able to give any sense, I guess, directionally on the potential impact to ongoing earnings?\nJohn McCallion: Ryan, it's John. We're still working through that. And I think our plan would be to discuss more details at a later date. But I think the general point, I would probably leave you with is that we don't expect major differences in the core underlying earnings, but there are sources of differences when actuals emerge, right?  So how actual experience may deviate from expectation, gets treated one way in current GAAP versus under LDTI, and then there's a number of different aspects. But I think all in all, we would expect kind of core earnings. Maybe I'll just give you a little color, too. I think this is probably a good perspective as to why that would be the case.  So it does not affect all of our segments, right? If you think about group minimal impact, vast majority, not subject to it given it's a short duration product. We go through RIS and it's mainly a spread business. We would expect spread calcs to look similar.  As you move into MLH, not all products are impacted, right? We have a number of [indiscernible] FAS 97 products, universal life fixed annuities. Also the participating business is not subject to LDTI. And if we took kind of an early look at that and kind of assume that we would implement this the beginning of this year, we probably would have given you the same range of guidance that we would have otherwise given back in February. And then Asia is probably the other one that's somewhat sizable. Again, there's a lot of FAS 97 products there. Japan, if you think about our flagship products in FX, they're all under FAS 97 versus FAS 60. And then EMEA and LatAm are much more modest. So hopefully, that kind of just gives you color as to why kind of give you that general statement.\nRyan Krueger: Yes. No, that's very helpful. And then on VII, obviously, acknowledging how strong it's been over the last couple of years. But can you give any sense of what it could look like in the third quarter?\nSteven Goulart: Ryan, it's Steve Goulart. I think -- I guess I'd start with just reminding everybody sort of the slide that John used, which is what's our guidance. Our guidance is really just a generic assumption of 12% a year, 3% a quarter. We all know, of course, there's a one quarter lag in it too. And when we look at broad market returns in the second quarter, we know that they were basically negative in the teens.  But I think what we've proven over time through the diversification in our portfolio across strategies and geographies is we would expect that directionally but likely not to the same degree as a market overall. So I think that's probably all we'd really say at this point.\nOperator: And our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.\nJamminder Bhullar: So first, I had a question on the retirement business in terms of spreads. I think they expanded about 14 basis points sequentially. And I think you had been cautioning that they might actually decline or certainly weren't expecting much of an improvement. So wondering how much of the improvement has to do with interest rate caps or other types of sort of hedging activities? And do you expect this to be a good base for spread going forward? Or should we think about the 1Q level and adjust off of that looking forward?\nJohn McCallion: Jimmy, it's John. As you point out, we had a pretty resilient level of spreads this quarter, up 14 basis points sequentially. And as you point out, we did not quite expect that back in the Q1 call. But that was -- we were basing our commentary based on forward rate curve, right? And if you think about what has happened since the 10-year treasury ends up about 65 basis points above that. And the other thing that happened is spreads widened. So our reinvestments were strong. And then the third thing is 3-month LIBOR jumped to a much greater level than we had expected and actually the forward curve expected ended the quarter at roughly 2.3%.  If I think about just during the course of the quarter, it was kind of hovering around 150 and then all of a sudden, there was a huge spike kind of at the end of May into June. And bypassing that [indiscernible], I referenced this 2% marker. As LIBOR started to grow, get towards that 2% and then beyond, it could create a little bit of a tailwind. We have a number of caps that start to become in the money. That we have in place today.  And so that was really the main driver moving us from a headwind of LIBOR rising to a, if you call it, I guess, a benefit of having the caps be in the money. So that was the real driver. The other thing I'd point out is real estate equity outperformed. So within our core investment income, real estate equity was stronger than expected. We'd expect that to moderate.  But if we look forward, and I guess, assuming today's current forward rates, which we know can be different, we'd expect ex-VII spreads to remain pretty close to where we are today, I mean, give or take, plus or minus, and even assuming some moderation of the real estate returns.\nJamminder Bhullar: And then sales...\nJohn McCallion: Sorry, Jimmy just let me just add. I would just tell you that, that's probably for the next couple of quarters, right? I mean we'll give guidance for next year when we get towards the latter part of the year.\nJamminder Bhullar: And then obviously, the changes in new money yields and those affect that as well, obviously, modestly, but they do have a an effect.\nJohn McCallion: Yes, you're right. Yes.\nJamminder Bhullar: And on sales in the Asia business outside of Japan were down. And I think you had mentioned previously that in Korea, it was because of a lot of your salespeople getting COVID and COVID cases still being high. And then I think in China, with the mobility restrictions, that's hurting sales, is it more -- are the sales down more because of those types of factors in 2Q as well? Or is there anything else going on in the underlying market that could sustain even beyond COVID.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Jimmy, it's Lindon here. So let me give you the color on total Asia sales, and then I'll get into the other markets as well. we have good diversification across all the markets, products and channels, and that really drives very consistent execution through this market conditions.  So overall, we've had positive growth in the second quarter, led by strong performance in Japan. If we look a little bit at Japan sales, we're up 5%. And that's actually driven by 3 factors. First, the execution on the ground of the team has been very strong. We have a very diversified distribution channels, and the products and capabilities we've launched in the past year has really helped us drive the growth over there.  But as you pointed out in Other Asia, we've faced a couple of headwinds. We've got COVID restrictions going on in China right now, and the stronger U.S. dollar has really impacted sales for the FX products in Korea. But despite these channels, we actually have other markets that are compensating for these and help offset some of these headwinds.  Looking forward, we expect strong momentum going into the third quarter. We're introducing new products in Korea. And also, we expect some relief in the lockdown conditions in China. So full year basis, we are comfortable with the guidance of mid-single year digit growth that we gave at the outlook call.\nOperator: And next, we go to Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI.\nThomas Gallagher: I had two capital questions. The first is the new C2 factor change that's coming year-end for mortality, morbidity. My understanding is it positively impacts Group Life, negatively affects Individual Life. If so, is that a positive for Met? And if so, could you quantify it?\nRamy Tadros: Tom, it's Ramy here. I would say it's overall neutral. I mean we have been looking at our business and pricing it in anticipation of changes to the C2 factors, and there's a fair bit of diversification calculation in that number. So I would say very small and neutral in terms of its impact.\nThomas Gallagher: Okay. And the SMR change in Japan dropped a lot in March, I assume that's going to go down a lot more in June just based on where rates went. How are you thinking about managing through that? Or are you contemplating hedging this at all? And also, is there a risk that, that can impact the dividend remittances out of Japan.\nJohn McCallion: Tom, it's John. As you point out, the higher U.S. rates really for us is what's driving that decline. And as you point out, they've continued to rise throughout 2Q. Just a couple of reminders. One, rising rates is a improvement proving economic value situation for that business. But the reality is, right now, we have a solvency regime that has some asymmetrical accounting, so it creates some unintuitive results, if you will.  So so that's kind of one. Two, I'd say, remember in a few years, it's likely this moves to this new economic solvency regime, which would kind of better align the solvency accounting with the economic reality. And so we really -- we don't have concerns over dividends or dividend capacity at this time. The reality is that this is a good economic situation, and we have plenty of tools to be able to manage the overall situation. So at this time, we're fine.\nOperator: And next, we move to Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: You guys had strong results in LatAm in the quarter, and I know you called out around $40 million from favorable mortality. Can you just expand on the other underlying drivers of the results this quarter and just with the sustainability of results there?\nEric Clurfain: Elyse, this is Eric. So yes, as you pointed out. So overall, this was a strong quarter for the region, supported by solid business fundamentals and several positive items that we really put into 2 buckets, right, the market factors and underwriting. So starting with market factors, we had very strong net investment margins this quarter, which include the net positive impact of inflation in Chile as well as the above-average encaje results. And the quarter also benefited from strong variable investment income.  So these items combined contributed to roughly $60 million in adjusted earnings. Then the second bucket, underwriting, and John mentioned that earlier, this quarter was really recorded a 40 million after-tax benefit from a favorable prior year developments related mainly to COVID mortality experience. So these are the 2 main items. Now putting these items aside, we're also very pleased to see our business continues to deliver. As you may recall, last quarter, I mentioned that our earnings growth continued to be supported by strong and resilient business fundamentals, which are driving solid top line growth.  And that sales momentum that began last year has continued this quarter as well. And this reflects really the strengths, the resiliency and the diversity of our distribution franchise across the region, combined with a noticeable flight to quality. And then this emphasis on quality is also evidenced by a very solid persistency across the region, which, combined with the strong sales momentum that I mentioned has resulted in a 26% growth year-over-year in PFOs on a constant rate basis. Now about half of that growth came from the SPIA business in Chile, where our market share has increased, but the market as well has grown over the past over the past quarter. So that's in a nutshell, the story for LatAm this quarter. I hope this helps.\nElyse Greenspan: Yes. And then my second question, you guys bought back $1.1 billion in the quarter, a pretty strong number. Was there any acceleration in buybacks, just given the market weakness and an opportunity to buy your shares at a more attractive price? And can you just give us a sense of the outlook for future levels of share repurchase for the balance of the year?\nMichel Khalaf: This is Michel. So yes, as I noted in my opening comments, we had our foot on the gas pedal a little bit in the second quarter, in particular. So expect a modestly slower pace, I would say, in the second half. Our overall view has not changed. Our philosophy, our approach have not changed. We're still comfortable with the $3 billion to $4 billion cash buffer over time. We'll get back to that. So no change in approach here. It's just that we had an acceleration in the first half. So it will be modestly slower in the second.\nOperator: And our next question is from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research.\nErik Bass: Can you provide some more color on the expected adjustment to retained earnings from adopting LDTI. And is this all being driven by the impact of bringing market risk benefits to fair value? Or are there any meaningful reserve adjustments? And I guess given the rise in interest rates since year-end '20, should we expect the adjustment to be smaller today than what you're showing on the slide?\nJohn McCallion: Eric, it's John. So the impact to retained earnings, it affects both market risk benefits and a function of disaggregation. Disaggregation's about, I'd say, 20% to 25% of the number. So it's mainly a function of the fact that our -- under our -- for VAs and primarily the GMIBs, also, by the way, GMDBs get now mark to market, which is a different debate. But GMIBs, they're all kind of accrual accounting, if you will, and now they're moving to mark-to-market. So that's the biggest driver.  As we think about relative to initial impact that we disclosed, it's a little better as you get into kind of year-end '21 in terms of less of a change. I think interest rates moved maybe 60 basis points on the 10-year. And then it will continue to decline, if you will, as you move into 2022, just given the -- a function of the rising rate environment. So that's the -- those are the main drivers.\nErik Bass: Perfect. And then maybe if you could touch on your U.S. mortality experience this quarter across both Group and Holdings. And it looks like even ex COVID margins were favorable versus your targets. So have you seen some of the elevated non-COVID mortality that have been a factor in recent quarters? Has that started to come down as well?\nRamy Tadros: Eric. It's Ramy here. I'll start off with group and Michel and John will comment on Holdings. So for the quarter, if you look at our ratio sequentially, I would say the decline can be broken down into 4 pieces. So the first one is just the lower frequency in terms of overall population death. The second piece is the material decrease in the percentage of deaths under 65, which clearly reduced the impact on the working age population. The third piece is the Q1 reserves, which competed favorably, which John spoke about, and that was less than a point or so.  And then the final piece is we did see little by way of non-COVID excess mortality in the quarter. And as Michel pointed out, the second quarter tends to be a bit lighter in general in terms of mortality. As we look at the rest of the year, on the Group business side, we're cautiously optimistic given the results here. But clearly, you know the trajectory of the pandemic is uncertain. At this point, I would say, if you exclude COVID, we anticipate that our mortality ratio to be comfortably inside our range for the second half of the year for the group business.\nJohn McCallion: Yes. And just on -- just touching on Holdings. I mean we certainly saw kind of a reduction in claims in the quarter. We didn't really see a big impact at all for COVID. And then on the -- if you just look at the life interest adjusted benefit ratio, you have to adjust for the reinsurance settlement. But excluding that, it comes in at 43.8. And that's -- we just saw a favorable non-COVID claim experience in the quarter.\nOperator: And our next question is from Suneet Kamath with Jefferies.\nSuneet Kamath: Maybe just for Steve to start out with. Can you just maybe talk a little bit about your outlook for credit and the potential for credit losses if we move into a recession? Is there any asset classes or sectors that you're paying particular attention to these days?\nSteven Goulart: Sure. Thanks, Suneet. I think obviously, there's still a lot of uncertainty and clearly, volatility in the markets about where we're headed from a macro perspective. What I do is really sort of rewind the clock a little bit. And remember, in a way, we sound like a broken record, but we go back to really even pre-COVID where we were actually starting to get concerned about a recession occurring sometime in 2020 and started preparing the portfolio then.  Our derisking efforts started in a pretty big way. And I think then, of course, was accelerated during COVID, and we went through over $8 billion of derisking in that time period. And that really sort of set the portfolio in a position that we're very comfortable with.  Obviously, we continue to watch as we go through this period now, expectations of recessions, again, of course, depend how one defines a recession, I guess, these days are clearly picking up. But we're very comfortable with the derisking we've done over the last couple of years and think the portfolio is in very good shape.  Obviously, we continue to have a cautious attitude, but opportunistic at the same time because we do see some attractive investments and we have the opportunity to do that. one metric that might be of interest to is just in looking at the portfolio, during the course of this year, we've actually had twice as many upgrades as downgrades. And I think that says a lot about how we've been positioning the portfolio and our overall outlook. So we're very comfortable with where we are today.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. And then I guess for Ramy, on the Group Benefit side, I know Q2 is a low quarter for sales. But just curious on any color from the conversations you're having with your clients around pricing just given -- I'm assuming most of them are facing pressures across the board on cost from inflation. So just any color on how those conversations are going as we think about 1/1 next year?\nRamy Tadros: Sure. Just with respect to your comment on sales, as we've kind of discussed earlier, the year-to-date drop in sales is very much a function of the record year we had last year where we had a record number of jumbos. And as you know, these jumbos can be pretty lumpy. So this is something we expected in terms of the sales coming down. And I would just also point you to the fact that really the better measure to think about the overall growth of this business is the PFO number and we're certainly very pleased with the PFO growth number that we're seeing this quarter.  In terms of the pricing environment, I would say, the market is competitive, but remains rational. In aggregate, we have put in place price increases, both on the life and the disability side to reflect our expectation of the coming environment to reflect also a load with respect to the COVID deaths. And in aggregate, we are getting our target price increases, and we're also continuing to see very strong persistency in the book.\nOperator: And our next question is from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs.\nAlexander Scott: First one I had for you was just to get your latest thoughts on MetLife Holdings and the potential for risk transfer. And also any commentary you have around if doing something -- taking action on something in holdings could influence the way that these impacts look from LDTI?\nJohn McCallion: Alex, it's John. I think overall, on risk transfer, I'd say nothing new really to update. I mean we've probably given a consistent message every quarter for quite some time now. And I think it's the same, and I think we're being very transparent. Our goal here is continuously optimize. And we're trying to do that both in the form of internal actions but also looking at opportunities to leverage the growing risk transfer market. And as a result, we continue to converse with third parties.  Our philosophy is there's no burning platform. We're happy to maintain our approach and continue to optimize internally, but we want the optionality to see if we can accelerate the appropriate release of capital and reserves. I think the one thing that we continue to just look at here, this is a reinsurance transaction for us if we were to do something.  So as we think about our philosophy, when we look at this is, we view this as a long-term relationship. So it's -- this is one of those things that would take time. It takes time to make sure that we feel grounded with a strong counterparty and structure and kind of the approach.  But I think we're continuing to evaluate that and that's been the case now for some time. In terms of the impact to LDTI, I don't know how to exactly answer that. I think one thing we have to be careful about is under LDTI, one of the things that probably did not come out as perfect was just the -- there is some asymmetrical counting when you do enter into reinsurance. So you have to be mindful of that under GAAP. So it doesn't perfectly line up. So I don't know how to perfectly answer your question that way because it would -- I guess the answer is it depends. So I'm sure that...\nAlexander Scott: It's helpful color. And then the follow-up I had was maybe just a question on sort of the broader economy. I mean, you guys get such an interesting look at the labor market, given your presence in the Group Benefits. I mean anything that you can give us color on, even maybe thinking through like beyond the end of the quarter that you're seeing in labor markets and potential implications just more broadly for your business?\nRamy Tadros: Alex, I would say, the numbers we're continuing to track clearly is just overall eligibility in our book, and we have a highly diversified book of business. And with the low unemployment levels, clearly, those numbers continue to kind of increase and remain very solid.  And we're seeing some kind of form of wage inflation come through as well, and both of these have been kind of tailwinds to the business. So we're kind of seeing in the book, what you're seeing probably in the broader economy. And maybe that's kind of as much color as I can give you in terms of what we're seeing.\nOperator: And our next question is from John Barnidge with Piper Sandler.\nJohn Barnidge: So you had an IBNR reserve release in both group and Latin America. Is there any tail that we should be thinking about for subsequent quarters from that?\nJohn McCallion: John, it's John. Just when you say tail, you're referencing just more releases. Is that what you mean?\nJohn Barnidge: Yes, correct.\nJohn McCallion: Yes. Look, I think our -- this is a reserve. It's -- the reserve was put up at the point in time based on best estimates. I think in both cases, the facts are that actuals have emerged different than expected. And so that's just kind of the simple answer to why there was a release. I wouldn't assume there is a tail because if we had a -- if we assume there was more, we would have taken it.  So right now, our best estimates are what we have up on our balance sheet. But I think just like we do every quarter, we'll continue to evaluate and review the emergence of actuals. And if there are refinements needed, we'll make them.\nJohn Barnidge: Okay. And then my follow-up to that, if we're talking about emergence versus expected, the LDTI disclosure, can you maybe talk about is there any unrealized insurance margin that's something we've seen from other companies that have large operations in Japan?\nJohn McCallion: Yes. Sure, John. It's John again. Look, I think the reality on that one is it's really a function of mix of business. And I think that's -- if you listened to my earlier response to earnings and how some things are in scope and others are not, that's a major driver to kind of that outcome.  Many of our segments are not materially impacted by LDTI and many of the products we sell are not as well. And that includes like Asia, where some of those products are out there that show that unrealized in Asia. You think about in Japan, our flagship products are not subject to this. If you think about some of the, I wouldn't say all products, but some of the FX products that we sell, they're all under FAS 97. So it's a little bit of a different probably situation for us. And so I -- like I said, it really depends on mix of business to answer that question.\nOperator: Next, we go to Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse.\nAndrew Kligerman: A lot of most of the questions have been asked. But I'm wondering, as we look at another excellent quarter at MetLife, if there's anything transformative that you need to do from an M&A perspective, anything that you think in your business lines that could change kind of or improve MetLife?\nMichel Khalaf: Andrew. So I don't think -- if we look at our portfolio, I think we don't see any major gaps when it comes to that portfolio. We're really well pleased. As you know, we've gone through a major transformation that got us to this point. We believe we have the right strategy. Having said that, M&A is a strategic capability and if we see opportunities to accelerate revenue growth in certain businesses that we -- where we believe, potentially doing something organically might make sense or bring in a capability that can help drive our competitive advantage, we'd certainly be open to doing so.  And look at a lot of deals and the -- maybe the sort of lack of deal should not suggest to you that there's a lack of activity here. We increased our shareholding in our India JV in the first quarter to 47%. So we continue to be active, but we're also very disciplined and whatever we do has to make strategic sense for us as well.\nAndrew Kligerman: And then with regard to pension risk transfer, I think you said you did 3 deals of $2-plus billion. Maybe a little color around the pipeline. It seems like there are a lot of new players in pension risk transfer that we didn't see 3 years ago. So do you think that pipeline will continue to be robust and that we'll have quarters like this one.\nRamy Tadros: Andrew, it's Ramy here. I mean, as you know, the activity in the first half of the year was pretty substantial in the PRT space. Year-to-date, we've written $3.8 billion worth of deals, and that comes after a successful fourth quarter where we roll $3.6 billion worth of deals. So that's cumulatively about $7.5 billion year-over-year. The pipeline continues to be pretty active and pretty robust, as Michel mentioned.  And we are focused on a specific part of that pipeline where we enjoy our own kind of set of competitive advantages, namely the jumbo end of the plans, and there are fewer competitors there. When you go down size, clearly, there are more competition and more providers, but where we play, it's another set of competitors because of the size of the transactions that we bid for.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, we will now turn the conference back to the CEO, Michel Khalaf.\nMichel Khalaf: Thank you all for joining us this morning. I know it's a busy morning. Our second quarter results add to MetLife's track record of consistent, strong performance and provide further evidence of the strength and momentum of our well-diversified, market-leading businesses.  With our clarity of purpose, a compelling all-weather strategy and a relentless focus on execution, we are well positioned to deliver superior value to all our stakeholders. Thank you, and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this conference is available for digitized replay after 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time today through August 12 at midnight.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Michel Khalaf",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Over time, I have referred to our Next Horizon strategy as being all weather designed to guide MetLife through a variety of economic environments. And the environment has shifted with equity markets falling from historic highs, interest rates trending up from historic lows, further strengthening of the dollar and the odds of a U.S. recession on the rise.  The resilience of Next Horizon, combined with our clarity of purpose, positioned MetLife to meet these challenges in the second quarter of 2022. While certain things may be outside our control, we continue to execute with urgency across those things we do control. Let's turn to some numbers. MetLife reported strong financial results for the second quarter. Adjusted earnings were $1.6 billion or $2 per share compared to $2.37 per share a year ago. Excluding one notable item, adjusted earnings were $1.90 per share.  The combination of strong underwriting margins and good volume growth drove solid adjusted earnings results while variable investment income fell below our quarterly outlook expectations. Net income in the second quarter was $103 million compared to $3.4 billion a year ago. Current period net income was driven by adjusted earnings, offset by interest rate and foreign currency derivative losses from securities held to protect our balance sheet.  Also, standard investment activity resulted in realized losses as interest rates rose during the quarter. Year ago net income includes the gain we booked on the successful sale of our Auto & Home business. Now moving to variable investment income, which returned to a more typical level following 7 consecutive quarters of truly outstanding results. During the 7-quarter period, MetLife generated more than $8 billion of cumulative pretax variable investment income. This type of investment performance serves to validate MetLife's long-term prudent exposure to this value-added asset class.  In the second quarter, variable investment income of $389 million was aided by private equity investments and real estate funds, which generated returns of 1.5% and 7.9%, respectively. Our private equity returns are reported on a 1-quarter lag and the weak second quarter equity market should negatively impact our variable investment income in the third quarter.  Throughout the pandemic, the broad diversity of MetLife's businesses across product lines and geographies has clearly been a great strength. Initially, underwriting gains in one business offset underwriting losses elsewhere. When COVID claims seem to reach their peak, our private equity gains then filled the gap. And the current quarter continues to illustrate this point as variable investment income has returned to more normal levels in the second quarter, so too have our underwriting margins.  Turning to MetLife's business performance. I'll start with our U.S. Group Benefits results. Adjusted earnings of $400 million were up 61% year-over-year. This represents the highest quarterly result ever posted by this flagship business, primarily driven by favorable underwriting. Historically, the second quarter tends to be a low mortality quarter, something that was also evident this year.  Group Life mortality, including COVID-19 losses, registered a benefit ratio of 85.8%, which is at the low end of our target range of 85% to 90%. A significant contraction in U.S. COVID-related deaths and a further shift upward in the age of death contributed to the improvement in the second quarter benefit ratio. Having witnessed prior [indiscernible] during this 2.5-year long pandemic, we are cautiously optimistic and note the absence of much, if any, excess mortality in our current period group benefits results.  At the current pace, MetLife is on track to generate close to $25 billion of adjusted group benefit revenue in 2022, a true testament to our product breadth, scale and momentum in this attractive market-leading business. For Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings totaled $388 million, which were down from a year ago due to less variable investment income, but helped by favorable volume growth. Looking past the decline in variable investment income, recurring investment income spreads were strong at 103 basis points as we continue to manage against a shifting yield curve.  During the quarter, we booked $2.6 billion of new pension risk transfer business, which brings our year-to-date total to roughly $4 billion. We continue to see a strong pipeline for the balance of the year based on good funding levels and higher long-term interest rates. In Asia, adjusted earnings of $386 million were below a year ago on lower variable investment income and less favorable underwriting.  COVID claims in Japan impacted adjusted earnings in the quarter, driven largely by deemed hospitalization, which allows for payment of COVID claims incurred for care outside of the hospital. Other Asia business metrics remained favorable, with sales growing 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, while general account AUMs in the region were up 5% on the same basis.  In Japan, sales grew 5% on a constant currency basis. MetLife has a history of product innovation in Japan. Most recently, we've built on that legacy with product launches in September, February and April, illustrating both our speed to market for new products and our leading digital distribution capabilities. We continue to have good sales momentum in Japan, supported by a resilient business model and we remain on track to achieve our Asia region sales outlook for the year.  Looking to Latin America, adjusted earnings totaled $267 million, well above $97 million a year ago. Lower COVID claims, a favorable impact from inflation, a strong encaje and continued volume growth, all combined to generate substantial outperformance in the second quarter. Fundamental drivers in Latin America also remains strong with sales and PFOs up from a year ago on a constant currency basis by 19% and 26%, respectively.  Moving to capital and cash. MetLife was active with capital management during the second quarter, and we returned more than $1.5 billion to shareholders through $408 million of common dividends and $1.1 billion of share repurchase. In the first half of 2022, MetLife repurchased approximately $2 billion of common stock. Given the accelerated pace of buyback activity in the first half of the year, we anticipate a modestly slower pace in the back half.  There remains $2.5 billion outstanding on our current $3 billion authorization. MetLife continues to be well capitalized and highly liquid. At the end of the quarter, we had $4.5 billion of cash and liquid assets at our holding companies, which includes the proceeds from the sale of our Poland business, and we remain comfortably above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion.  Financial flexibility was further enhanced after the second quarter's end when we tapped the debt market raising $1 billion of 30-year paper and a well oversubscribed offering, another example of the value the market attributes to MetLife's financial strength. Turning to sustainability. At the end of last quarter, MetLife announced a broad set of DEI commitments designed to address the needs of the underserved and underrepresented by 2030.  The MetLife Foundation recently announced an updated strategy aimed at driving inclusive economic mobility by addressing the needs of underserved and underrepresented communities around the globe. The foundation's grant-making and impact investments will be aligned across 3 core portfolios: Economic inclusion, financial health and resilient communities and will advance the broad set of diversity, equity and inclusion commitment MetLife announced at the end of last quarter.  In closing, when we introduced our Next horizon strategy, little did we know that it would be put to the test so quickly and so severely. Our results this quarter clearly demonstrate its resilience. We saw solid underlying business performance, supported by a strong capital base, which reinforces our confidence that Next Horizon is the right strategy for MetLife. With our purpose as our North Star and with our strategic pillars to guide us along the way, MetLife is well positioned to rise to the challenges ahead and deliver significant long-term value to our shareholders and other stakeholders.  With that, I will turn things over to John. This is Michel. So yes, as I noted in my opening comments, we had our foot on the gas pedal a little bit in the second quarter, in particular. So expect a modestly slower pace, I would say, in the second half. Our overall view has not changed. Our philosophy, our approach have not changed. We're still comfortable with the $3 billion to $4 billion cash buffer over time. We'll get back to that. So no change in approach here. It's just that we had an acceleration in the first half. So it will be modestly slower in the second. Andrew. So I don't think -- if we look at our portfolio, I think we don't see any major gaps when it comes to that portfolio. We're really well pleased. As you know, we've gone through a major transformation that got us to this point. We believe we have the right strategy. Having said that, M&A is a strategic capability and if we see opportunities to accelerate revenue growth in certain businesses that we -- where we believe, potentially doing something organically might make sense or bring in a capability that can help drive our competitive advantage, we'd certainly be open to doing so.  And look at a lot of deals and the -- maybe the sort of lack of deal should not suggest to you that there's a lack of activity here. We increased our shareholding in our India JV in the first quarter to 47%. So we continue to be active, but we're also very disciplined and whatever we do has to make strategic sense for us as well. Thank you all for joining us this morning. I know it's a busy morning. Our second quarter results add to MetLife's track record of consistent, strong performance and provide further evidence of the strength and momentum of our well-diversified, market-leading businesses.  With our clarity of purpose, a compelling all-weather strategy and a relentless focus on execution, we are well positioned to deliver superior value to all our stakeholders. Thank you, and have a great day."

            "name": "Ramy Tadros",
            "content": "Tom, it's Ramy here. I would say it's overall neutral. I mean we have been looking at our business and pricing it in anticipation of changes to the C2 factors, and there's a fair bit of diversification calculation in that number. So I would say very small and neutral in terms of its impact. Eric. It's Ramy here. I'll start off with group and Michel and John will comment on Holdings. So for the quarter, if you look at our ratio sequentially, I would say the decline can be broken down into 4 pieces. So the first one is just the lower frequency in terms of overall population death. The second piece is the material decrease in the percentage of deaths under 65, which clearly reduced the impact on the working age population. The third piece is the Q1 reserves, which competed favorably, which John spoke about, and that was less than a point or so.  And then the final piece is we did see little by way of non-COVID excess mortality in the quarter. And as Michel pointed out, the second quarter tends to be a bit lighter in general in terms of mortality. As we look at the rest of the year, on the Group business side, we're cautiously optimistic given the results here. But clearly, you know the trajectory of the pandemic is uncertain. At this point, I would say, if you exclude COVID, we anticipate that our mortality ratio to be comfortably inside our range for the second half of the year for the group business. Sure. Just with respect to your comment on sales, as we've kind of discussed earlier, the year-to-date drop in sales is very much a function of the record year we had last year where we had a record number of jumbos. And as you know, these jumbos can be pretty lumpy. So this is something we expected in terms of the sales coming down. And I would just also point you to the fact that really the better measure to think about the overall growth of this business is the PFO number and we're certainly very pleased with the PFO growth number that we're seeing this quarter.  In terms of the pricing environment, I would say, the market is competitive, but remains rational. In aggregate, we have put in place price increases, both on the life and the disability side to reflect our expectation of the coming environment to reflect also a load with respect to the COVID deaths. And in aggregate, we are getting our target price increases, and we're also continuing to see very strong persistency in the book. Alex, I would say, the numbers we're continuing to track clearly is just overall eligibility in our book, and we have a highly diversified book of business. And with the low unemployment levels, clearly, those numbers continue to kind of increase and remain very solid.  And we're seeing some kind of form of wage inflation come through as well, and both of these have been kind of tailwinds to the business. So we're kind of seeing in the book, what you're seeing probably in the broader economy. And maybe that's kind of as much color as I can give you in terms of what we're seeing. Andrew, it's Ramy here. I mean, as you know, the activity in the first half of the year was pretty substantial in the PRT space. Year-to-date, we've written $3.8 billion worth of deals, and that comes after a successful fourth quarter where we roll $3.6 billion worth of deals. So that's cumulatively about $7.5 billion year-over-year. The pipeline continues to be pretty active and pretty robust, as Michel mentioned.  And we are focused on a specific part of that pipeline where we enjoy our own kind of set of competitive advantages, namely the jumbo end of the plans, and there are fewer competitors there. When you go down size, clearly, there are more competition and more providers, but where we play, it's another set of competitors because of the size of the transactions that we bid for."

            "name": "John McCallion",
            "content": "Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 2Q '22 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, an update on our cash and capital positions as well as commentary on the new U.S. GAAP accounting known as Long Duration Targeted Improvements or LDTI, effective 1/1/23.  Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the second quarter. Higher interest rates and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter drove net derivative losses. As a reminder, MetLife uses derivatives as part of our broader asset liability management strategy to hedge certain risks. This hedging activity often generates derivative gains or losses and creates fluctuations in net income because the risk being hedged may not have the same GAAP accounting treatment.  In addition, we had net investment losses from our normal trading activity in the portfolio given the rising interest rate environment. We had one favorable notable item this quarter of $77 million or $0.09 per share related to a reinsurance settlement, which was accounted for in MetLife Holdings.  On Page 4, you can see the second quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, which excludes notable items in both periods. Adjusted earnings in the second quarter of 2022, excluding the notable item were $1.5 billion, down 23% and down 21% on a constant currency basis. Lower variable investment income drove the year-over-year decline, while favorable underwriting and solid volume growth were partial offsets.  Adjusted earnings per share, excluding the notable item, was $1.90, down 17% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 15% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. business. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were up 61% year-over-year, primarily due to significant improvement in underwriting margins aided by lower COVID-19 Life claims as well as higher volume growth.  The Group Life mortality ratio was 85.8% in the second quarter of '22 towards the bottom end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. The business benefited from lower U.S. COVID deaths in the quarter and a continued favorable shift in the percentage of death under age 65, declining from approximately 23% in the first quarter to roughly 17% in the second quarter.  The adjusted earnings impact of Group Life COVID-19 reported claims was approximately $35 million offset in part by an IBNR release related to 1Q '22 COVID-19 claims of approximately $25 million. Therefore, the net COVID impact was roughly $10 million or one percentage point on the Group Life mortality ratio. More detail on the Group Life mortality results over the past 5 quarters can be found on Page 11 in the appendix.  Regarding non-medical health, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 73.1% in Q2 of '22 within its annual target range of 70% to 75% and favorable to the prior year quarter of 73.8%. Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 3% year-over-year. As we discussed in the prior quarters, excess mortality can result in higher premiums from participating contracts in the period.  The higher excess mortality in Q2 of '21 versus Q2 of '22 resulted in a year-over-year decline in premiums from participating contracts, which dampened growth by roughly 1.5 percentage points. The underlying PFO increase of approximately 4.5% was due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 41% year-over-year. The primary driver was less favorable private equity returns versus a very strong Q2 of '21.  Favorable volume growth was a partial offset. RIS investment spreads were 116 basis points within our full year 2022 guidance of 95 to 120 basis points, but well below the prior year quarter of 224 basis points due to the significant decline in variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 103 basis points, up 5 basis points versus Q2 of '21 and up 14 basis points sequentially due to higher interest rates, wider credit spreads and favorable real estate performance.  RIS liability exposures were down 3% year-over-year despite strong top line growth. The key drivers of this decrease came from reductions in accounting adjustments that impact our liabilities, but do not impact fees or spread income and thus have no impact on adjusted earnings. RIS sales were up 30% year-to-date, primarily driven by pension risk transfers and stable value products.  With regards to PRT, we completed 3 transactions worth $2.6 billion in the quarter, a strong first half of 2022, and we continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia. adjusted earnings were down 26% and 22% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower variable investment income and unfavorable underwriting. This was partially offset by solid volume growth as assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 5% on a constant currency basis.  In addition, Asia sales were up 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by another solid performance in Japan. Overall, Japan sales were up 5% driven by FX annuities and accident and health products sold through face-to-face channels. Latin America adjusted earnings were $267 million versus $97 million in the prior year quarter. This strong performance were driven by several positive factors, primarily favorable underwriting and investment margins as well as solid volume growth.  Overall, COVID-19 related deaths in Mexico were down significantly in Q2. This positive trend, coupled with the emergence of even more favorable mortality experience in our own block, resulted in a reduction to the IBNR reserve that was established in prior periods. This benefited LatAm's adjusted earnings by roughly $40 million after tax in 2Q '22. The LatAm's adjusted earnings in the quarter also benefited from strong investment margins, primarily due to the net impact from inflation-linked assets and liabilities in Chile that increased with higher inflation rates as well as the Chilean encaje, which had a 4.8% return in 2Q '22 versus a negative 1.5% in the prior year quarter.  LATAM's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 26% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 19% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region, primarily from higher single premium immediate annuity sales in Chile and group cases in Mexico. EMEA adjusted earnings were down 32% and 16% on a constant currency basis compared to a strong Q2 of '21, which benefited from a favorable refinement of an unearned premium reserve in the prior year period, totaling approximately $15 million after tax.  In addition, adverse equity market impacts in the current year period were partially offset by favorable underwriting margins. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 46%, excluding the favorable notable item of $77 million after tax as discussed earlier. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income, adverse equity market impacts and less favorable underwriting also were contributors to the year-over-year decline.  MetLife Holdings separate account return was negative 14% in the quarter versus a positive 6% in Q2 of '21. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $243 million versus an adjusted loss of $126 million, excluding notables in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year variance was primarily due to higher expenses from corporate-related costs associated with less favorable equity markets and higher interest rates. Higher taxes and lower variable investment income were also contributors.  The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 22.3% and within our 2022 guidance range of 21% to 23%. On Page 5, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the past 5 quarters, including $389 million in the second quarter of '22. The majority of VII was attributable to the private equity portfolio of roughly $14 billion, which had an overall return of 1.5% in the quarter.  As we have previously discussed, private equity is generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag. In addition, real estate equity funds were also a strong contributor to VII with nearly an 8% return in the quarter while hedge funds, which are reported on a 1-month lag, had a loss.  While VII in 2Q '22 was below expectation and recent trends, our new money rate was 3.92% and above our roll-off yield of 3.71%. This marks the first time in over a decade in which we did not experience quarterly spread compression in the investment portfolio. On Page 6, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the prior 5 quarters, including $307 million in Q2 of '22.  Asia, MetLife Holdings and RIS continue to earn the vast majority of variable investment income consistent with the higher VII assets in their respective investment portfolios. VII assets are primarily owned to match longer-date liabilities, which are mostly in these 3 businesses.  Turning to Page 7. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior 5 quarters, including 11.9% in Q2 of '22. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our second quarter direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline.  While we would expect our direct expense ratio to be higher in the second half of the year, consistent with the seasonality of our business, we remain committed to achieving a full year direct expense ratio below 12.3% in 2022 despite the challenging inflationary environment. We believe this demonstrates our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset.  I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 8. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.5 billion at June 30, which is up from $4.2 billion at March 31 and remains above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential increase in cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $1.1 billion in the second quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows.  In addition, holdco cash includes the proceeds from the sale of our Poland business, which closed in April. In regard to our statutory capital for our U.S. companies, our preliminary second quarter year-to-date 2022 statutory operating earnings were approximately $700 million, while net income was approximately $1.3 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by approximately $2 billion year-over-year, driven by unfavorable VA rider reserves, underwriting results and lower variable investment income.  We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $19.1 billion as of June 30, 2022, up 2% sequentially. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 764% as of March 31, which is the latest public data. The decline from December 2021 was primarily due to higher U.S. interest rates.  Now shifting to LDTI on Page 9. While there is quite a bit of work still to be done prior to implementation on January 1, let me take a moment to recognize the great work of our MetLife associates and our partners in getting us to this point. This slide provides an update on our expected transition balances as of January 1, 2021, under LDTI. The column on the left was our actual balances at 12/31/'20, and the middle column contains the estimated range of our restated balances under LDTI.  The changes under LDTI that account for the bulk of the book value adjustment at transition include the market risk benefit adjustment associated with variable annuities, not presently accounted for at market, the impact of disaggregation and the revaluation of in-scope long-duration insurance contracts using a [indiscernible] equivalent discount rate and the elimination of relevant shadow account balances.  As you can see from MetLife at the end of 2020, there is a greater convergence between book value and book value excluding AOCI under LDTI. However, this may not always be the case as certain assets are not mark-to-market and not all liabilities are in scope under LDTI. While LDTI will provide additional information and transparency and improve consistency around accounting for certain aspects of the life insurance industry, it does not impact cumulative product profitability, cash flow generation, our strategy or how we manage the business.  Let me conclude by saying MetLife delivered another strong quarter, highlighted by solid top line growth, ongoing expense discipline and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities that allow us to navigate successfully through uncertain environments. While private equity returns were lower this quarter, it was offset by favorable underwriting, most notably in our market-leading franchises in Group Benefits and Mexico, which saw a return to more normal mortality as COVID-19 deaths significantly declined.  Finally, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio remains strong and position us for further success. And we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Ryan, it's John. We're still working through that. And I think our plan would be to discuss more details at a later date. But I think the general point, I would probably leave you with is that we don't expect major differences in the core underlying earnings, but there are sources of differences when actuals emerge, right?  So how actual experience may deviate from expectation, gets treated one way in current GAAP versus under LDTI, and then there's a number of different aspects. But I think all in all, we would expect kind of core earnings. Maybe I'll just give you a little color, too. I think this is probably a good perspective as to why that would be the case.  So it does not affect all of our segments, right? If you think about group minimal impact, vast majority, not subject to it given it's a short duration product. We go through RIS and it's mainly a spread business. We would expect spread calcs to look similar.  As you move into MLH, not all products are impacted, right? We have a number of [indiscernible] FAS 97 products, universal life fixed annuities. Also the participating business is not subject to LDTI. And if we took kind of an early look at that and kind of assume that we would implement this the beginning of this year, we probably would have given you the same range of guidance that we would have otherwise given back in February. And then Asia is probably the other one that's somewhat sizable. Again, there's a lot of FAS 97 products there. Japan, if you think about our flagship products in FX, they're all under FAS 97 versus FAS 60. And then EMEA and LatAm are much more modest. So hopefully, that kind of just gives you color as to why kind of give you that general statement. Jimmy, it's John. As you point out, we had a pretty resilient level of spreads this quarter, up 14 basis points sequentially. And as you point out, we did not quite expect that back in the Q1 call. But that was -- we were basing our commentary based on forward rate curve, right? And if you think about what has happened since the 10-year treasury ends up about 65 basis points above that. And the other thing that happened is spreads widened. So our reinvestments were strong. And then the third thing is 3-month LIBOR jumped to a much greater level than we had expected and actually the forward curve expected ended the quarter at roughly 2.3%.  If I think about just during the course of the quarter, it was kind of hovering around 150 and then all of a sudden, there was a huge spike kind of at the end of May into June. And bypassing that [indiscernible], I referenced this 2% marker. As LIBOR started to grow, get towards that 2% and then beyond, it could create a little bit of a tailwind. We have a number of caps that start to become in the money. That we have in place today.  And so that was really the main driver moving us from a headwind of LIBOR rising to a, if you call it, I guess, a benefit of having the caps be in the money. So that was the real driver. The other thing I'd point out is real estate equity outperformed. So within our core investment income, real estate equity was stronger than expected. We'd expect that to moderate.  But if we look forward, and I guess, assuming today's current forward rates, which we know can be different, we'd expect ex-VII spreads to remain pretty close to where we are today, I mean, give or take, plus or minus, and even assuming some moderation of the real estate returns. Sorry, Jimmy just let me just add. I would just tell you that, that's probably for the next couple of quarters, right? I mean we'll give guidance for next year when we get towards the latter part of the year. Yes, you're right. Yes. Tom, it's John. As you point out, the higher U.S. rates really for us is what's driving that decline. And as you point out, they've continued to rise throughout 2Q. Just a couple of reminders. One, rising rates is a improvement proving economic value situation for that business. But the reality is, right now, we have a solvency regime that has some asymmetrical accounting, so it creates some unintuitive results, if you will.  So so that's kind of one. Two, I'd say, remember in a few years, it's likely this moves to this new economic solvency regime, which would kind of better align the solvency accounting with the economic reality. And so we really -- we don't have concerns over dividends or dividend capacity at this time. The reality is that this is a good economic situation, and we have plenty of tools to be able to manage the overall situation. So at this time, we're fine. Eric, it's John. So the impact to retained earnings, it affects both market risk benefits and a function of disaggregation. Disaggregation's about, I'd say, 20% to 25% of the number. So it's mainly a function of the fact that our -- under our -- for VAs and primarily the GMIBs, also, by the way, GMDBs get now mark to market, which is a different debate. But GMIBs, they're all kind of accrual accounting, if you will, and now they're moving to mark-to-market. So that's the biggest driver.  As we think about relative to initial impact that we disclosed, it's a little better as you get into kind of year-end '21 in terms of less of a change. I think interest rates moved maybe 60 basis points on the 10-year. And then it will continue to decline, if you will, as you move into 2022, just given the -- a function of the rising rate environment. So that's the -- those are the main drivers. Yes. And just on -- just touching on Holdings. I mean we certainly saw kind of a reduction in claims in the quarter. We didn't really see a big impact at all for COVID. And then on the -- if you just look at the life interest adjusted benefit ratio, you have to adjust for the reinsurance settlement. But excluding that, it comes in at 43.8. And that's -- we just saw a favorable non-COVID claim experience in the quarter. Alex, it's John. I think overall, on risk transfer, I'd say nothing new really to update. I mean we've probably given a consistent message every quarter for quite some time now. And I think it's the same, and I think we're being very transparent. Our goal here is continuously optimize. And we're trying to do that both in the form of internal actions but also looking at opportunities to leverage the growing risk transfer market. And as a result, we continue to converse with third parties.  Our philosophy is there's no burning platform. We're happy to maintain our approach and continue to optimize internally, but we want the optionality to see if we can accelerate the appropriate release of capital and reserves. I think the one thing that we continue to just look at here, this is a reinsurance transaction for us if we were to do something.  So as we think about our philosophy, when we look at this is, we view this as a long-term relationship. So it's -- this is one of those things that would take time. It takes time to make sure that we feel grounded with a strong counterparty and structure and kind of the approach.  But I think we're continuing to evaluate that and that's been the case now for some time. In terms of the impact to LDTI, I don't know how to exactly answer that. I think one thing we have to be careful about is under LDTI, one of the things that probably did not come out as perfect was just the -- there is some asymmetrical counting when you do enter into reinsurance. So you have to be mindful of that under GAAP. So it doesn't perfectly line up. So I don't know how to perfectly answer your question that way because it would -- I guess the answer is it depends. So I'm sure that... John, it's John. Just when you say tail, you're referencing just more releases. Is that what you mean? Yes. Look, I think our -- this is a reserve. It's -- the reserve was put up at the point in time based on best estimates. I think in both cases, the facts are that actuals have emerged different than expected. And so that's just kind of the simple answer to why there was a release. I wouldn't assume there is a tail because if we had a -- if we assume there was more, we would have taken it.  So right now, our best estimates are what we have up on our balance sheet. But I think just like we do every quarter, we'll continue to evaluate and review the emergence of actuals. And if there are refinements needed, we'll make them. Yes. Sure, John. It's John again. Look, I think the reality on that one is it's really a function of mix of business. And I think that's -- if you listened to my earlier response to earnings and how some things are in scope and others are not, that's a major driver to kind of that outcome.  Many of our segments are not materially impacted by LDTI and many of the products we sell are not as well. And that includes like Asia, where some of those products are out there that show that unrealized in Asia. You think about in Japan, our flagship products are not subject to this. If you think about some of the, I wouldn't say all products, but some of the FX products that we sell, they're all under FAS 97. So it's a little bit of a different probably situation for us. And so I -- like I said, it really depends on mix of business to answer that question."

Our guidance is really just a generic assumption of 12% a year, 3% a quarter. We all know, of course, there's a one quarter lag in it too. And when we look at broad market returns in the second quarter, we know that they were basically negative in the teens.  But I think what we've proven over time through the diversification in our portfolio across strategies and geographies is we would expect that directionally but likely not to the same degree as a market overall. So I think that's probably all we'd really say at this point. Sure. Thanks, Suneet. I think obviously, there's still a lot of uncertainty and clearly, volatility in the markets about where we're headed from a macro perspective. What I do is really sort of rewind the clock a little bit. And remember, in a way, we sound like a broken record, but we go back to really even pre-COVID where we were actually starting to get concerned about a recession occurring sometime in 2020 and started preparing the portfolio then.  Our derisking efforts started in a pretty big way. And I think then, of course, was accelerated during COVID, and we went through over $8 billion of derisking in that time period. And that really sort of set the portfolio in a position that we're very comfortable with.  Obviously, we continue to watch as we go through this period now, expectations of recessions, again, of course, depend how one defines a recession, I guess, these days are clearly picking up. But we're very comfortable with the derisking we've done over the last couple of years and think the portfolio is in very good shape.  Obviously, we continue to have a cautious attitude, but opportunistic at the same time because we do see some attractive investments and we have the opportunity to do that. one metric that might be of interest to is just in looking at the portfolio, during the course of this year, we've actually had twice as many upgrades as downgrades. And I think that says a lot about how we've been positioning the portfolio and our overall outlook. So we're very comfortable with where we are today."

MetLife delivered strong financial results in the first quarter of 2022, with the rise in geopolitical uncertainty and the pandemic that has not fully loosened its grip. These results demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our underlying businesses. MetLife\u2019s purpose of always with you building a more confident future is ringing true with our customers now more than ever. Starting with our financial results, we reported first quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $1.7 billion or $2.08 per share, which was well above consensus expectations. The primary driver was strong variable investment income, partly offset by continued elevated COVID-19 claims, mostly in the U.S. Trends in our business point to continued momentum despite the many global dislocations. Net income for the quarter was $606 million, up from $290 million a year ago and below adjusted earnings in the quarter. Losses on derivatives helped to protect our balance sheet from interest rate movement and payments on bonds account for most of the difference between net income and adjusted earnings. Interest rates rose rapidly during the quarter with the yield on the 10-year treasury advancing 83 basis points, triggering market value adjustments to our derivative hedges. The tragic events in Ukraine led to an impairment of Russian and Ukrainian bonds in the quarter. Let\u2019s shift to our continued strong performance and variable investment income, which totaled $1.2 billion pre-tax in the quarter. Private equity was again the engine producing an approximately 7% quarterly return, with the higher PD balances also a factor. Our private equity returns are reported on a one quarter lag and the weaker first quarter equity market may impact or VII results in the second quarter. For MetLife, private equity has long been an important source of value creation, generating strong returns and supporting our long dated liabilities. It is an asset class we manage prudently. Last quarter, we indicated that we would divest roughly $1 billion of general account PE assets. Just after the first quarter close, we launched a PE fund of funds to be managed by MetLife Investment Management and the transaction that creatively and thoughtfully addressed investment allocation, while establishing a new fee generating business venture. Turning to some first quarter business segment highlights, I will start with our U.S. Group Benefits results. Adjusted earnings of $112 million were up 20% year-over-year. We saw strong growth within our current customer base, reflecting a combination of higher enrollment, higher employment level and higher salaries. Although, COVID-19 life claims remained elevated, the Group life mortality ratio fell sequentially 250 basis points to 103.8%. Our flagship U.S. Group Benefits franchise has generated a profit for shareholders in every quarter since the pandemic began, a testament to the breadth, strength and resilience of this business. With our scalar leadership, the biggest threat in this business is becoming complacent something we will simply not allow to happen. We have taken concrete actions to grow and establish products like Group Life, Dental and Disability, voluntary products like legal and newer products like vision and Pat [ph]. The results are showing up in solid recurring PFOs, which have grown by more than $3 billion over the last three years looking past per claims. In Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 16%, primarily due to a tough comparison as the strong contribution from VII in the current quarter fell below the extraordinary contribution of a year ago. Beyond VII, a number of key metrics in this business were strong, including volume growth and spreads. Continuing the momentum from the fourth quarter, we booked a $1.3 billion pension risk transfer deal in the first quarter. With funding level strong and interest rates on the rise, we see a robust PRT pipeline going forward. For Asia, adjusted earnings similarly benefited from strong VII, partly offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange. At the same time, business momentum was solid. General account AUM was up 7% on a constant currency basis from a year ago. Sales in Asia grew 2% on a constant currency basis year-over-year driven by a good fiscal year end in Japan. In Latin America, adjusted earnings were up by more than $100 million from the prior period. As COVID 19 claims moderated in Mexico, the exceptional sales success posted in 2021 has carried into 2022 with sales on a constant currency basis jumping 40% in the first quarter. The pandemic has ushered in a renewed focus on the importance of insurance across Latin America. This has fueled a flight to quality, which in turn has helped drive our sales and boost our persistency. Shifting to capital and cash, we returned more than $1.3 billion to shareholders through common dividends and share repurchase in the first quarter. Based on the strength of our balance sheet and free cash flow generation, we announced a 4.2% increase in our common dividend per share, which has grown at a compound annual rate of 9.5% since 2011. With $475 million left on our current repurchase authorization, our Board of Directors has authorized an incremental $3 billion authorization, which brings our total buyback capacity to roughly $3.5 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had $4.2 billion of cash and liquid assets at our holding companies. Despite the seasonally low quarter for subsidiary dividends, we remain comfortably above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The proceeds from the sale of our Poland business, which closed in April, will contribute to our cash balances in the second quarter. Turning to governance, MetLife has a highly experienced and diverse Board of Directors and we were pleased to announce the addition of Carla Harris at the end of April. Carla is a well-recognized leader across the financial services industry. She brings deep expertise and fresh perspectives and her experience and knowledge will serve MetLife well. Our talent is also a competitive advantage that sets us apart from our peers. As a global company, MetLife can grow talent from around the world and match it to our greatest opportunities. Our recent leadership changes demonstrate this deep strength. I want to start by thanking Kishore Ponnavolu for his distinguished service to MetLife over the past 11 years. During his time with MetLife, Kishore served as Chief Enterprise Strategy Officer and Head of MetLife Auto and Home, and finally as Regional President, Asia, where his leadership delivered outstanding results. When Kishore steps away from this position at the end of June, we will rotate several executives into new roles. Lyndon Oliver will move from Treasurer and Head of Strategy to Regional President, Asia. John Hall will add Treasurer to his current responsibilities and Dimitri Lorenzon will move from Head of Strategy Product and Marketing from MetLife Japan to Head of Strategy for MetLife. These moves demonstrate our commitment to talent development and highlight our deep bench of leaders who are ready to step up and deliver value to our customers and shareholders. We are broadening and deepening our leadership commitment to and accountability for diversity, equity and inclusion. At the end of quarter, MetLife announced a broad set of VII commitment designed to address the needs of the underserved and underrepresented by 2030. These commitments encompass a mix of investments, partnerships and solutions, and other efforts, and are firmly aligned with MetLife\u2019s purpose. In setting these commitments, we are establishing clear roadmaps and strengthening accountability for progress. Before I close, I would like to say a few words about MetLife return to office in the U.S., which started on March 28th. Our new model Future Work combines the best of office and virtual environments and is an essential element in attracting and retaining top talent. Our Future Work model has been well received in the U.S. and we are seeing tremendous collaboration and partnership across the organization. We are also well underway to adopting our Future Work model outside the U.S. as conditions allow. From my own perspective, it is great to walk the floors again, host in-person meetings and feel of the energy in the building. Over the past few weeks, I have visited several of our offices across the U.S. and the team\u2019s enthusiasm and energy levels have been outstanding. I look forward to more such visits as the world increasingly open and I also welcome the opportunity to sit down face to face with many of you in the months ahead. The past two years has been an unprecedented period, but with all of the challenges, MetLife remain laser focused on consistent execution and we look forward to building on our momentum. With that, I will turn things over to John.\nJohn McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 1Q 2022 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our cash and capital positions. Starting on page three, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the first quarter. Net income was $606 million or $1.1 billion lower than adjusted earnings. The majority of this variance was due to net derivative losses as a result of the significant rise in long-term interest rates in the quarter. In addition, we had net investment losses, primarily due to impairments on our Russian premium bonds, as well as normal trading activity in the portfolio that resulted in losses given the rising interest rate environment. Following the impairments and a sale of Russian bonds in April, our current combined exposure in Russia and Ukraine is roughly $125 million. On page four, you can see the first quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, which did not have any notable items on either period. Adjusted earnings were $1.7 billion, down 12% and down 10% on a constant currency basis. Lower variable investment income accounted for the majority of the year-over-year decline. While private equity returns were again strong, they compared to an even stronger Q1 of 2021, adjusted earnings per share was $2.08, down 5% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 4% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S., Group Benefits adjusted earnings were up 20% year-over-year due to higher volume growth and an improvement in underwriting margins. I will discuss Group Life underwriting in more detail shortly. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 72.5% in Q1 of 2022 at the midpoint of its annual target range of 70% to 75%. That said, the ratio higher than the prior year quarter of 71.1%, due to higher incidences in disability relative to favorable incidence levels in the prior year quarter. Turning to topline, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 7% year-over-year. This growth included 2 percentage points related to higher premiums from participating contracts, which can fluctuate with claim experience. The balance of the PFO growth of 5% was due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. Group Benefits sales were down 31% compared to record sales in Q1 of 2021, which were driven by exceptionally strong jumbo cases. While jumbo case activity was significantly lower in 1Q 2022, we continue to see good growth in the business and our persistency remained strong. Retirement Income Solutions or RIS adjusted earnings were down 16% year-over-year. The primary driver was less favorable private equity returns versus a very strong Q1 of 2021. Favorable volume growth was a partial offset. RIS investment spreads were 181 basis points, driven by another strong quarter of variable investment income, spreads excluding VII were 89 basis points, up 1 basis point versus 1Q 2021, but down 2 basis points sequentially due to higher LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures were essentially flat year-over-year, as growth across most products primarily U.K. longevity reinsurance and pension risk transfers were offset by lower separate account balances. With regards to pension risk transfers, we completed one transaction worth $1.3 billion in the first quarter and continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia, the adjusted earnings were down 7% and 4% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower recurring interest margins and a decline in first quarter equity markets in Japan and Korea. This is partially offset by solid volume growth as assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 7% on a constant currency basis. In addition, sales were up 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis driven by strong sales in Japan. Latin America adjusted earnings were $142 million versus $40 million in the prior year quarter, while COVID-19 related claims remained elevated in 1Q 2002 at roughly $30 million after-tax. They were down significantly versus the prior year quarter. In addition, volume growth was a positive contributor, while lower equity markets were a partial offset. The Chilean Encaje had negative 4% return in 1Q 2022 versus the prior year quarter, which was a modest positive. While LatAm\u2019s bottomline has been trending towards pre-pandemic levels, its topline continues to demonstrate strength as adjusted PFOs were up 22% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and sales were up 40% on a constant currency basis, driven by solid growth across the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were down 27% and 15% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by the exclusion of divested businesses, Poland and Greece, which were included in the first quarter of 2021 adjusted earnings. In addition, higher expenses were partially offset by favorable underwriting margins and volume growth. While the region reported excess COVID claims in Q1, they were lower than the prior year quarter. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 39%. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income and less favorable underwriting. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $117 million versus an adjusted loss of $171 million in the prior year quarter. Higher variable investment income was the result of a $1.1 billion transfer of PE assets to corporate and other from IRS and MetLife Holdings in Q1 of 2022. To better align asset liability management for these two segments, higher expenses were partial offset. The company\u2019s effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 21.3% and within our 2022 guidance range of 21% to 23%. Now, I will provide more detail on Group Benefits mortality results on page five. This chart reflects our Group Life mortality ratio for the last five quarters, including the COVID-19 impact on the ratio and on Group Benefits adjusted earnings. The Group Life mortality ratio was one hundred and 103.8 in the first quarter of 2022, which is well above our annual target range of 85% to 90%. COVID reported claims were roughly 14% points, which reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $230 million. While U.S. COVID deaths were higher sequentially, there was a favorable shift in the percentage of deaths under age 65, declining from approximately 33% in the fourth quarter to roughly 23% in the first quarter. As a result of these two competing factors, we saw a modest improvement in mortality results this quarter. In addition we experienced 1 percentage point to 2 percentage points from non-COVID excess mortality. This included a large number of high dollar claims, which can fluctuate from period-to-period. On page six, this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the past five quarters, including $1.2 billion in the first of 2022. This strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio of roughly $14 billion, which had an overall return of 7% in the quarter. Unlike previous quarters where we have seen a dispersion in returns by fund type, this quarter our major PE returns were tightly coupled around 7% overall. As we have previously discussed, private equities generally accounted for on a quarter lag. In addition, real estate equity funds were also a strong contributor to VII with a 10% return in the quarter, while hedge funds, which are reported on a one-month lag had a loss. On page seven, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the prior five quarters, including $936 million in Q1 of 2022. You will note that our general rule of thumb that RIS, MetLife Holdings in Asia account for 90% or more of the total VII did not hold in 1Q 2022, coming in at 83%. This lower percentage was primarily due to the transfer of PES to corporate and other from RIS and MetLife Holdings that I discussed earlier. In addition, Asia\u2019s higher VII year-over-year was primarily due to strong real estate equity fund performance, as well as higher PE asset balances. Turning to page eight, this chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior five quarters, including 11.7% in Q1 of 2022. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our first quarter direct expense ratio benefited from solid topline growth and ongoing expense discipline. This included approximately 40 basis points from premiums that relate to participating cases in Group Benefits due to excess mortality. We remain committed to achieving a full year direct expense ratio below 12.3% in 2022, demonstrating our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. I will now discuss our cash and capital position on page nine. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.2 billion at March 31st, which was down from $5.4 billion at December 31st, but remains above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential decline in cash at the holding companies reflect the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $915 million in the first quarter, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. Our first quarter tends to be lower in subsidiary dividends and higher in holding company expenses. Therefore, we would expect HoldCo cash balances to increase in the second quarter due to higher subsidiary dividends, as well as proceeds from the sale of our Poland business, which closed in April, as Michel noted. In regard to our statutory capital, for our U.S. companies are 2021 combined NAIC RBC ratio was 386%, which was above our target ratio of 360%. For our U.S. companies, preliminary first-quarter year-to-date 2022 statutory operating earnings were approximately $400 million, while net income was approximately $800 million. Statutory operating earnings decreased by approximately $1.1 billion year-over-year primarily due to less favorable VA rider reserves, underwriting results and higher expenses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.7 billion as of March 31, 2022, down 2% compared to December 31, 2021. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 947% as of December 31st, which is the latest public data. Looking ahead, we expect the Japan SMR to decline in 2022, as a result of higher U.S. interest rates, but remained well above its capital target level. Let me conclude by saying MetLife delivered another strong quarter, highlighted by outstanding private equity returns, solid topline growth, ongoing expense discipline and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities that allow us to navigate successfully through uncertain environments. In addition, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio remain strong and position us for further success. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the Operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we go to the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.\nRyan Krueger: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Could you discuss your outlook for the retirement spread over the next few quarters in light of the higher interest rate environment but also the flatter yield curve?\nMichel Khalaf: Good morning, Ryan. Yes. So, let me just start with Q1, obviously it was 181, main driver there being VII and then our result ex-VII was 89 basis points of spread. And just -- maybe start with just the sequential decline in the spread with a few basis points and that was generally the rising LIBOR, which is something we highlighted as in our sensitivities that would put pressure on the spread. I think one of the things that was performed better than expected as we did see a recovery in some of our real estate property income investments in the quarter in Q1, so that helped to offset some of that downward pressure that we expected. I\u2019d say, given the upward trend in LIBOR we have already seen in 2Q, we would probably expect kind of that mid single-digit decline to occur that we would have thought to have seen in the first quarter, but to start to see in the second quarter. But if the forward curves come to fruition, we would actually start to see maybe a shift in the spread moving back up a little bit, and I\u2019d say, there\u2019s probably two reasons for that. So one is, so we get these sensitivities at the outlook and then typically the day after they are not as good as they were the day before. Ad so in terms of LIBOR, we talked about a rise in LIBOR having a headwind, at some point that kind of flips to be a positive and that\u2019s probably kind of around the 200-basis-point level and so we are at maybe a little above 130-basis-point today. So, we expect kind of rising LIBOR to continue to pressure us in the second quarter, but if it continues to rise, it would actually begin to provide income. And then the second thing as you point out just kind of the overall increase in rates, it typically comes in 10 -- the benefit of the 10-year comes in at a slower, not as quickly and so, but that will start to emerge over time. So hopefully that helps.\nRyan Krueger: Thanks. Very helpful. And then, I guess, the follow-up is just I think we all know rising interest rates are generally good for life insurance. I just want to make sure that there are any unusual impact from things like interest rate derivative mark on a stat basis that would have any kind of negative impact on dividend capacity going forward?\nMichel Khalaf: Yeah. We don\u2019t -- we would not expect any unusual impacts to occur. I think the broad interest rate sensitivities we gave as part of our outlook directionally still hold, even though the shape of the curve is a little different, so numbers may not be exact, but I would say the directional nature of that from an earnings perspective, which means that it\u2019s a little negative in the first year, may -- I might call it neutral-ish now just the way things have kind of panned out and then you start to see kind of the positive momentum emerge in the 2023 and 2024, again, assuming rates kind of pan out as they are projected to. And then in terms of stat capital now, we would not expect any unusual volatility or result as a -- as a result of a rising rate environment.\nRyan Krueger: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: And our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi. Good morning. First, I just had a question on what you are seeing in terms of activity in the pension closeout market. I think you mentioned that the pipeline is healthy, but how do you see, I guess, interest rates are obviously benefiting, but the weak equity market and its impact on funding levels, are you seeing a little bit of a slowdown or just the uncertainty causing plan sponsors to put off any transactions.\nRamy Tadros: Good morning, Jimmy. It\u2019s Ramy here. So, maybe just, I will -- maybe helpful just to reiterate our philosophy towards the PRT market and then I will come and hit your question in terms of the pipeline. The two aspects of our philosophy, which I would like to reiterate here and highlight one is that, this is a business where we continue to exercise pricing discipline, and I would say in aggregate, our capital deployment in the business is in line with our enterprise ROE targets and it\u2019s also accretive to the in-force annuity spreads. The second one, which you have heard us talk about before is that, we are focused on the large and jumbo end of the market. There are fewer players there and the deals tend to play to our competitive strengths in terms of size and rating, our balance sheet and the investment capabilities. In terms of the outlook, as you know, we have a very strong quarter in 2021. The fourth quarter of 2021, we ended with five transaction that were total of $3.6 billion. We did one transaction this quarter for $1.3 billion and we still see a very robust pipeline in front of us as we look towards the rest of the year. In terms of the segments we play in that jumbo segment. Many of these plans have been on a multiyear derisking journey, so they don\u2019t kind of turn on a dime, if you will, in terms of making that decision. So a lot of those kinds of asset allocations have been pre-positioned, and therefore, that jumbo end, it doesn\u2019t tend to be as sensitive to equity market volatility. But having said that, clearly, the overall market, as it stands today stands at a very high funding levels and that bodes well for the overall pipeline as well.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. Thanks. And then on your Latin American sales, they were pretty strong across every single major market. To what extent is that a function of the pandemic receding versus just anything that you have done on the product or distribution side.\nEric Clurfain: Yes. Hi, Jimmy. This is Eric here. So, yeah, you noticed the sales momentum really demonstrates, really the strength and -- of our distribution channels and the diversity of our product mix. We are seeing the benefits of that diversification strategy that combined with the increased awareness that Michel mentioned and that demand of insurance combined with the swift implementation of digital capabilities before during and now as we get out of the pandemic allows us to sell and serve our customers better and the marketplace is really responding to this with a true flight to quality. And that emphasis on quality is also evidenced by the strong persistency, which combined with the robust sales as resulted with an over 20% growth year-over-year on PFOs on a constant currency basis. Now about half of that\u2019s -- these sales are coming from the SPA [ph] business in Chile, as we have seen the annuity market expanding during the first quarter. So, overall I would say, it\u2019s a combination of factors and the strength of our franchise in LatAm is showing up as the pandemic recedes.\nJimmy Bhullar: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question, we have seen move up in interest rates this year. I was just wondering if that has an impact on the potential fee by secure transaction with one of your blocks within holdings.\nJohn McCallion: Hey, Elyse. It\u2019s John. Good morning. I think as we have said before, rising interest rates are, I think, beneficial to the block, the risk transfer, block transfer market and I think there is, so that gives, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the only thing that people are focused on. I don\u2019t think it changes materially. I think is a modest positive as we have talked about improving interest rates, solid equity markets, I think they all kinds of support a healthy risk transfer market. So, but again, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the only driver and I think as we have seen over the years, the last few years, there is been plenty of transactions even at lower rates. So, but again, I think, it\u2019s a modest positive.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then within Group, you guys called out the non-COVID mortality this quarter. I just was hoping to get a little bit more color there and if you guys expect this to continue as we move through this year and even potentially get on the other side of the pandemic.\nMichel Khalaf: Hi, Elyse. I would say what we saw this quarter is very much in line with kind of normal quarterly fluctuations we see. Just to give you some color in terms of one of the drivers here, if you look at our kind of large claims here define, let\u2019s say, you take a $2 million mark. We have got higher number of those claims. But when I say higher, you think high-single digits and we have got quarters when that came below our expectation. So this is kind of normal quarterly fluctuation. We clearly look at the numbers, we are the largest writer of Group Life Benefits in the industry, and as of this point, we are not seeing any real evidence outside of COVID of any long-term adverse trends here.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Next we go to the line of Erik Bass with Autonomous. Please go ahead.\nErik Bass: Hi. Thank you. In the Group business, can you talk about enrollment and persistency trends in the level of benefit you are seeing from rising employment and rates growth?\nMichel Khalaf: Erik, could you just repeat the question, you were just coming off a bit.\nErik Bass: Sorry, I was just asking in the Group business, if you could talk about enrollment and persistency trends and then the level of benefit that you are seeing from rising employment and wage growth?\nMichel Khalaf: Sure. In terms of persistency, we continue to see very, very strong persistency on our book. That\u2019s up and down market and very much kind of in line with our expectations. And as I have highlighted before, we are seeing that persistency even in a environment where we have been taking price increases on -- in particular on the life book given the uncertainty around COVID, so the persistency has been really excellent. We are also seeing continued momentum on our voluntary portfolio and that\u2019s going to continue to drive double-digit PFO growth in our business. And just to give you a flavor of that, we ended the year well above $1 billion of PFOs in voluntary and we continue to see good growth on that. In terms of employment, that\u2019s a tailwind. We are starting to see that in the business. Clearly higher employment levels provide just more eligibles and therefore more premiums. Wage inflation is another tailwind, although that does play out gradually over time. So we don\u2019t expect that to see kind of having an immediate uptick and it does depend on the population that\u2019s getting those wage increases, et cetera, but both of these I would think of as general tailwinds to the business and we are seeing evidence of that in our book today.\nErik Bass: Great. Thank you. And then can you discuss your earnings and capital exposures to a weaker yen and what hedges you have in place?\nKishore Ponnavolu: Hi, Erik. This is Kishore. So if you think about the yen impact, you can think about this in two aspects. One is the translation impact on earnings and the second one is the impact on sales. On earnings, we have a multi-currency balance sheet in Japan, because of our FX products. And if you think about it holistically for MetLife Asia, roughly 15% of our earnings are yen-denominated and so, therefore, any depreciation on the yen has a moderate impact, I can say that on Asia adjusted earnings. On the sales, however, the FX volatility more than the rate itself is the volatility that is very important to rates consideration as well. It impacts volumes so far FX products in the near-term. In periods of high FX volatility, our customers tend to wait and see before the commit there yen to be converted to U.S. dollars, say, if it\u2019s the U.S. dollar product. At the same time, the yen, the increase in U.S. dollar rates, which is certainly true now enhances the customer value making them more attractive. So there is a balanced both ways. And currently, we are seeing the impact of both the yen weakening and the higher U.S. dollar interest rates on both sides. So if you think about, that\u2019s the way I would look at it. I will leave it at that.\nErik Bass: Great. Thank you\nOperator: And our next question is from Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nTom Gallagher: Good morning. First question is just can you provide a little bit of color behind the around $400 billion of investment losses. I presume most of that was Russia-Ukraine, but can you just give some specificity for the accounting for the $400 million?\nSteve Goulart: Sure. Hey, Tom. It\u2019s Steve Goulart. And you are right on that, but I think, John mentioned is too in his script, too, there really were two issues that led to virtually all of the realized losses in the first quarter. One, as you point out was Russia and that was roughly half of the credit losses and provisions. And again, I\u2019d start out by reminding everyone that our total exposure to Russia is less than one-tenth of 1% of the general account. So, in sum some not really a material number. And then the second piece on the losses, John also mentioned was, normal trading activity, but that really just reflected what was happening with interest rates in the quarter. And if you think about, again, our asset liability management, we are heavily investing in private assets right now, and it takes time to originate those private assets. So we are putting in assets that are more liquid and as we replace those in the permanent structure with private assets, given the interest rate movements in the quarter we saw losses in that. But again we pick it up on the back end, of course, because the private assets are higher yielding.\nTom Gallagher: Got it. That makes sense, Steve. So I would assume some of that, there could be a little bit of a tail to the trading aspect of that as you roll into 2Q and rates have continued to go up. Is that fair.\nSteve Goulart: I think as long as rates are moving, we will probably see similar action and similar results, yeah.\nTom Gallagher: Okay. Got you. And then, just, I guess for Kishore, just a follow-up on Japan, the sales there seemed pretty good and your competitors that are in Japan were quite weak with the state of emergency orders in Japan. Just curious how you were able to drive sales growth, is there something unique about product launches or your distribution that that allowed you to still grow sales across -- it looks like across all products in Japan.\nKishore Ponnavolu: I love the premise of your question, Erik, and I will certainly pass on that complement to our associates in Japan. I think it\u2019s a great question. I love the way you worded it. Certainly, that said, our sales increased 18% in Japan. That\u2019s a very strong performance. There are three reasons why I would attribute that. We -- our execution on the ground has been quite strong Secondly, we do have a very diversified channel mix, as you know, and that is continuing to show where certainly there is a little bit of softness on the banker side on a relative basis, but that got picked up on the CA, so that balance is back and forth certainly is coming through really well. And then, thirdly, we have been investing quite a bit on our products and capabilities over the past two years. But most notably over the past 12 months, we have had a couple of successful product launches, and most recently, we entered the quarterly market again and so that was well received in the marketplace. We launched a new banker platform in last year, which has got very strong reception and then we also entered the variable product markets. So that\u2019s also getting good traction as well. So we are very happy about that. However, since you asked the question, I wanted to give you a little bit of context for overall Asia in terms of our performance this quarter, which is really were very good, but also caution that, we are continuing to deal with COVID and that\u2019s a big factor across all our markets, clearly, Korea and Japan, we have a surge in cases in quarter one and we are dealing with that even in China as well, And so-- and then on top of that, in Q2, we are dealing with a bunch of market-specific regulatory and exchange related challenges, which are ongoing. And then there is a seasonality factor in Q1 with March being the fiscal year-end, so that\u2019s been a tailwind which doesn\u2019t carry through Q2. Given all that, the volume of sales in the next quarter will be under pressure. But on a year-on-year basis, I expect Asia ex-Japan to come stronger in Q2 to offset that as well. So that\u2019s done well in Q1, little bit of pressure in Q2 and then I want to switch to the overall frame, which is despite all of this. Our execution has been very strong. Our diversity of markets are coming through. And so, from a guidance perspective, hitting to the mid-to-high single sales growth guidance we gave in February. And in terms of timing, I expect a much stronger year-on-year performance in the second half for Asia as a whole. So I hope that was helpful from a commentary perspective.\nTom Gallagher: That was. Thank you.\nKishore Ponnavolu: Great.\nOperator: And -- oh, go ahead. My apologies. Mr. Gallagher, did you have anything further.\nTom Gallagher: No. That\u2019s all. Thank you.\nOperator: Very good. We will move on to Suneet Kamath with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSuneet Kamath: Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to go back to Group Life for a second. So we are seeing COVID deaths -- COVID mortality decline pretty substantially here in 2Q, but just wondering as we think about earnings in that business in 2Q, is there any kind of lag that we should be reflecting in terms of when you may get death notices in Group?\nRamy Tadros: Hey. It\u2019s Ramy here. Generally speaking, we are pretty quick in terms of recognizing the getting the death claims and recognizing those and we clearly hold the reserved essentially account for the IBNR. So I would say, on average, we have been getting up pretty well over the last kind of year and a half. So I would just continue to anchor any of your kind of estimates based on the headline mortality numbers for the entire population. So I would say, you looked at those and those have trended favorably in April. And the other statistic, I would also look at, is the percentage of deaths, which are under 65, which looking at April, that has continued to be at the same level as we saw in the first quarter, which, as John mentioned, would be favorable for us from a severity perspective.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. Got it. And then, I guess, for John on capital. I think you had said that, statutory operating earnings was lower than stat net income. So I just want to make sure I got that right and maybe some color on what happened there? And then, also, I think you said, Pat decline relative to the end of the year. So can you just talk a little bit about what happened there?\nJohn McCallion: Sure. Good morning. Good morning, Suneet. Yeah. That\u2019s right. I mean I think it\u2019s just the kind of some of the geography between our -- where our VA reserves go versus some of the kind of the hedges and you think about just what equity markets did that probably explains some of that difference and some of the realization of that. So that\u2019s kind of number one. You commented and then your second point is just on stat capital generation. Yeah, I think, it was down 2%, so maybe a little over $300 million. I\u2019d kind of put that in the normal volatility in any one quarter we paid our normal kind of a fourth of 25% of our kind of target dividend for the year, give or take in the quarter and which had a little additional volatility. So I wouldn\u2019t read into that any -- in anyway, I\u2019d kind of sort of consider that to be normal volatility and I wouldn\u2019t consider a trend.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And next we go to the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlex Scott: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. First one I had is on just expenses. I think they have kind of consistently come in below sort of the target you guys outlined at Investor Day with the Horizon strategy and so forth, and you are achieving pretty good organic growth across a number of your businesses. And so I was just interested in any commentary on where that could go from here. If -- I think sometimes in the past you have called out one timers and things like that on expenses that would get you back up to sort of the targeted level, but this feels like maybe you are benefiting more from operating leverage and could it be driven down further from there.\nJohn McCallion: Good morning, Alex. Yes. We are certainly pleased with the execution and that\u2019s not without headwinds and what we are all dealing with today in terms of inflation, wage increases and things like that, but I think it\u2019s a testament to the team and really the embedded culture that we have built here around efficiency mindset. It\u2019s a critical point of our strategy as you mentioned. And just on the ratio itself, it was 11.7. I mentioned in the opening remarks that, you have to be careful, the headline number is probably benefiting about 40 basis points from elevated COVID claims, which impact our participating cases and that creates increase in revenue is a bit of a gross-up on the P&L. So, net-net, we are still -- we are a little above 12, but maybe -- but still below the 12.3. And that\u2019s -- within there is also includes our intention to continue to invest in the firm for growth to improve our use of technologies and then, obviously, if circumstances dictate that gives us optionality to leverage that capacity in different ways and to protect margins. So, all in all, I\u2019d say, we are executing on our target, our initiative, when it comes to managing expenses.\nAlex Scott: Thanks. And then my follow-up is just if you could provide a brief update on the asset management business and just what you are thinking in terms of inorganic opportunities that are out there and if the current environment makes that more challenging or maybe it presents more opportunities, just interested in if anything changing there?\nSteve Goulart: Hey, Alex. It\u2019s Steve Goulart. So the updated continues to be very positive. We continue to grow MetLife Investment Management. I think we have been really achieving an aggressive organic growth plan that is in line with what we laid out at our 2019 Investor Day on our objectives and targets for where we are going to see the business grow. At the same time, you are right, it\u2019s a very active market right now and we continue to be active in it as well and looking at opportunities for acquisitions and it does cut both ways and there is a lot of activity, but there are a lot of people looking in the markets, too. We know what we are looking for strategically. We are very disciplined financially and we want to make sure that anything we do fits culturally and strategically. So we will continue to be active and hopefully when we find something that meets those criteria we will be successful in acquiring it.\nAlex Scott: Thank you.\nOperator: And we have a question from Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTracy Benguigui: Good morning. I realized later in the year you review your reserving assumption, but still were the 10-year treasury you read it today at 3% and where it maybe heading and how should we be thinking about your 2.75% reversion mean assumption and how does inflation come into play with respect to your reserve position?\nMichel Khalaf: Hey. Good morning, Tracy. Good question. Obviously, we have that long-term assumption and things have changed quite a bit. I think it\u2019s early for us to make any predictions at this point. Obviously, as we get into that kind of the end of the second quarter into the third quarter, really more of the third quarter, we will start to think about it. I think as we have all realized that things can change quickly. So -- and so I think it\u2019s -- and it is a long-term assumption. But having said that, I think, you highlighted some kind of the circumstances we are in that the current rates are higher than our long-term assumption that we are -- we projected to hit in 12 years. So that is -- but I wouldn\u2019t anticipate kind of any abrupt change one way or the other, we just made that change recent, few years ago and so you need to kind of see a trend before you would necessarily make a change, but again we will have to kind of evaluate all the data that\u2019s out there when we get closer. In terms of inflation, it\u2019s probably, it\u2019s not a -- it\u2019s really, I\u2019d say, probably, more related to your first part of the question, what does that, how does that really impact rates. That\u2019s probably the biggest area for us when it comes to reserving. I think outside of that, it\u2019s -- there is generally, if you have any inflation impact, it\u2019s generally offset by other factors, net-net, so that\u2019s probably how I\u2019d answer the inflation point.\nTracy Benguigui: Great. Thank you. I noticed in prior years, you didn\u2019t fully utilize your U.S. statutory dividend capacity, but in 2021 it appear in the U.S. Co. and I realize you have various sources. But just looking at Metropolitan Life Insurance Company you have $3.5 billion ordinary capacity in 2022, are you expecting again to fully utilize that this year?\nJohn McCallion: Yeah. I think, as you point out, we have a lot of sources of cash to the holding company. I think what we have committed to, we don\u2019t commit to kind of a dividend in any one legal entity. And I think the benefit of having a diverse set of cash generation that can be sent to the holding company is that, it gives us the benefit of being able to commit to the 65% to 75% free cash flow ratio on average over two-year period. And so it\u2019s not something we target at any one entity. We look at all aspects of how we are trying to manage our cash and capital at the operating entities, where we are looking to grow, where we need extra capital, things like that. And I think the benefit is, like I said, it\u2019s a diverse set of sources is very helpful. So we don\u2019t set a target at any legal entity externally, I should say, and then we kind of, just like you manage your own wallet, we manage our collective wallets the same way.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you.\nOperator: And we have no more questions at this time. I will turn the call back to Michel Khalaf.\nMichel Khalaf: Great. Well, thank you again for joining us on this busy morning. Our strong performance in the first quarter of 2022 building on last year\u2019s outstanding results should provide further evidence of the significant progress we are making in delivering on our all-weather Next Horizon strategy. This management team is laser-focused on continuing to execute with urgency and we are confident in our ability to create long-term sustainable value for all stakeholders. Thanks again and talk soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference service. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Yes. Hi, Jimmy. This is Eric here. So, yeah, you noticed the sales momentum really demonstrates, really the strength and -- of our distribution channels and the diversity of our product mix. We are seeing the benefits of that diversification strategy that combined with the increased awareness that Michel mentioned and that demand of insurance combined with the swift implementation of digital capabilities before during and now as we get out of the pandemic allows us to sell and serve our customers better and the marketplace is really responding to this with a true flight to quality. And that emphasis on quality is also evidenced by the strong persistency, which combined with the robust sales as resulted with an over 20% growth year-over-year on PFOs on a constant currency basis. Now about half of that's -- these sales are coming from the SPA [ph] business in Chile, as we have seen the annuity market expanding during the first quarter. So, overall I would say, it's a combination of factors and the strength of our franchise in LatAm is showing up as the pandemic recedes."

            "name": "Michel Khalaf",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. MetLife delivered strong financial results in the first quarter of 2022, with the rise in geopolitical uncertainty and the pandemic that has not fully loosened its grip. These results demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our underlying businesses. MetLife's purpose of always with you building a more confident future is ringing true with our customers now more than ever. Starting with our financial results, we reported first quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $1.7 billion or $2.08 per share, which was well above consensus expectations. The primary driver was strong variable investment income, partly offset by continued elevated COVID-19 claims, mostly in the U.S. Trends in our business point to continued momentum despite the many global dislocations. Net income for the quarter was $606 million, up from $290 million a year ago and below adjusted earnings in the quarter. Losses on derivatives helped to protect our balance sheet from interest rate movement and payments on bonds account for most of the difference between net income and adjusted earnings. Interest rates rose rapidly during the quarter with the yield on the 10-year treasury advancing 83 basis points, triggering market value adjustments to our derivative hedges. The tragic events in Ukraine led to an impairment of Russian and Ukrainian bonds in the quarter. Let's shift to our continued strong performance and variable investment income, which totaled $1.2 billion pre-tax in the quarter. Private equity was again the engine producing an approximately 7% quarterly return, with the higher PD balances also a factor. Our private equity returns are reported on a one quarter lag and the weaker first quarter equity market may impact or VII results in the second quarter. For MetLife, private equity has long been an important source of value creation, generating strong returns and supporting our long dated liabilities. It is an asset class we manage prudently. Last quarter, we indicated that we would divest roughly $1 billion of general account PE assets. Just after the first quarter close, we launched a PE fund of funds to be managed by MetLife Investment Management and the transaction that creatively and thoughtfully addressed investment allocation, while establishing a new fee generating business venture. Turning to some first quarter business segment highlights, I will start with our U.S. Group Benefits results. Adjusted earnings of $112 million were up 20% year-over-year. We saw strong growth within our current customer base, reflecting a combination of higher enrollment, higher employment level and higher salaries. Although, COVID-19 life claims remained elevated, the Group life mortality ratio fell sequentially 250 basis points to 103.8%. Our flagship U.S. Group Benefits franchise has generated a profit for shareholders in every quarter since the pandemic began, a testament to the breadth, strength and resilience of this business. With our scalar leadership, the biggest threat in this business is becoming complacent something we will simply not allow to happen. We have taken concrete actions to grow and establish products like Group Life, Dental and Disability, voluntary products like legal and newer products like vision and Pat [ph]. The results are showing up in solid recurring PFOs, which have grown by more than $3 billion over the last three years looking past per claims. In Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 16%, primarily due to a tough comparison as the strong contribution from VII in the current quarter fell below the extraordinary contribution of a year ago. Beyond VII, a number of key metrics in this business were strong, including volume growth and spreads. Continuing the momentum from the fourth quarter, we booked a $1.3 billion pension risk transfer deal in the first quarter. With funding level strong and interest rates on the rise, we see a robust PRT pipeline going forward. For Asia, adjusted earnings similarly benefited from strong VII, partly offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange. At the same time, business momentum was solid. General account AUM was up 7% on a constant currency basis from a year ago. Sales in Asia grew 2% on a constant currency basis year-over-year driven by a good fiscal year end in Japan. In Latin America, adjusted earnings were up by more than $100 million from the prior period. As COVID 19 claims moderated in Mexico, the exceptional sales success posted in 2021 has carried into 2022 with sales on a constant currency basis jumping 40% in the first quarter. The pandemic has ushered in a renewed focus on the importance of insurance across Latin America. This has fueled a flight to quality, which in turn has helped drive our sales and boost our persistency. Shifting to capital and cash, we returned more than $1.3 billion to shareholders through common dividends and share repurchase in the first quarter. Based on the strength of our balance sheet and free cash flow generation, we announced a 4.2% increase in our common dividend per share, which has grown at a compound annual rate of 9.5% since 2011. With $475 million left on our current repurchase authorization, our Board of Directors has authorized an incremental $3 billion authorization, which brings our total buyback capacity to roughly $3.5 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had $4.2 billion of cash and liquid assets at our holding companies. Despite the seasonally low quarter for subsidiary dividends, we remain comfortably above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The proceeds from the sale of our Poland business, which closed in April, will contribute to our cash balances in the second quarter. Turning to governance, MetLife has a highly experienced and diverse Board of Directors and we were pleased to announce the addition of Carla Harris at the end of April. Carla is a well-recognized leader across the financial services industry. She brings deep expertise and fresh perspectives and her experience and knowledge will serve MetLife well. Our talent is also a competitive advantage that sets us apart from our peers. As a global company, MetLife can grow talent from around the world and match it to our greatest opportunities. Our recent leadership changes demonstrate this deep strength. I want to start by thanking Kishore Ponnavolu for his distinguished service to MetLife over the past 11 years. During his time with MetLife, Kishore served as Chief Enterprise Strategy Officer and Head of MetLife Auto and Home, and finally as Regional President, Asia, where his leadership delivered outstanding results. When Kishore steps away from this position at the end of June, we will rotate several executives into new roles. Lyndon Oliver will move from Treasurer and Head of Strategy to Regional President, Asia. John Hall will add Treasurer to his current responsibilities and Dimitri Lorenzon will move from Head of Strategy Product and Marketing from MetLife Japan to Head of Strategy for MetLife. These moves demonstrate our commitment to talent development and highlight our deep bench of leaders who are ready to step up and deliver value to our customers and shareholders. We are broadening and deepening our leadership commitment to and accountability for diversity, equity and inclusion. At the end of quarter, MetLife announced a broad set of VII commitment designed to address the needs of the underserved and underrepresented by 2030. These commitments encompass a mix of investments, partnerships and solutions, and other efforts, and are firmly aligned with MetLife's purpose. In setting these commitments, we are establishing clear roadmaps and strengthening accountability for progress. Before I close, I would like to say a few words about MetLife return to office in the U.S., which started on March 28th. Our new model Future Work combines the best of office and virtual environments and is an essential element in attracting and retaining top talent. Our Future Work model has been well received in the U.S. and we are seeing tremendous collaboration and partnership across the organization. We are also well underway to adopting our Future Work model outside the U.S. as conditions allow. From my own perspective, it is great to walk the floors again, host in-person meetings and feel of the energy in the building. Over the past few weeks, I have visited several of our offices across the U.S. and the team's enthusiasm and energy levels have been outstanding. I look forward to more such visits as the world increasingly open and I also welcome the opportunity to sit down face to face with many of you in the months ahead. The past two years has been an unprecedented period, but with all of the challenges, MetLife remain laser focused on consistent execution and we look forward to building on our momentum. With that, I will turn things over to John. Good morning, Ryan. Yes. So, let me just start with Q1, obviously it was 181, main driver there being VII and then our result ex-VII was 89 basis points of spread. And just -- maybe start with just the sequential decline in the spread with a few basis points and that was generally the rising LIBOR, which is something we highlighted as in our sensitivities that would put pressure on the spread. I think one of the things that was performed better than expected as we did see a recovery in some of our real estate property income investments in the quarter in Q1, so that helped to offset some of that downward pressure that we expected. I'd say, given the upward trend in LIBOR we have already seen in 2Q, we would probably expect kind of that mid single-digit decline to occur that we would have thought to have seen in the first quarter, but to start to see in the second quarter. But if the forward curves come to fruition, we would actually start to see maybe a shift in the spread moving back up a little bit, and I'd say, there's probably two reasons for that. So one is, so we get these sensitivities at the outlook and then typically the day after they are not as good as they were the day before. Ad so in terms of LIBOR, we talked about a rise in LIBOR having a headwind, at some point that kind of flips to be a positive and that's probably kind of around the 200-basis-point level and so we are at maybe a little above 130-basis-point today. So, we expect kind of rising LIBOR to continue to pressure us in the second quarter, but if it continues to rise, it would actually begin to provide income. And then the second thing as you point out just kind of the overall increase in rates, it typically comes in 10 -- the benefit of the 10-year comes in at a slower, not as quickly and so, but that will start to emerge over time. So hopefully that helps. Yeah. We don't -- we would not expect any unusual impacts to occur. I think the broad interest rate sensitivities we gave as part of our outlook directionally still hold, even though the shape of the curve is a little different, so numbers may not be exact, but I would say the directional nature of that from an earnings perspective, which means that it's a little negative in the first year, may -- I might call it neutral-ish now just the way things have kind of panned out and then you start to see kind of the positive momentum emerge in the 2023 and 2024, again, assuming rates kind of pan out as they are projected to. And then in terms of stat capital now, we would not expect any unusual volatility or result as a -- as a result of a rising rate environment. Hi, Elyse. I would say what we saw this quarter is very much in line with kind of normal quarterly fluctuations we see. Just to give you some color in terms of one of the drivers here, if you look at our kind of large claims here define, let's say, you take a $2 million mark. We have got higher number of those claims. But when I say higher, you think high-single digits and we have got quarters when that came below our expectation. So this is kind of normal quarterly fluctuation. We clearly look at the numbers, we are the largest writer of Group Life Benefits in the industry, and as of this point, we are not seeing any real evidence outside of COVID of any long-term adverse trends here. Erik, could you just repeat the question, you were just coming off a bit. Sure. In terms of persistency, we continue to see very, very strong persistency on our book. That's up and down market and very much kind of in line with our expectations. And as I have highlighted before, we are seeing that persistency even in a environment where we have been taking price increases on -- in particular on the life book given the uncertainty around COVID, so the persistency has been really excellent. We are also seeing continued momentum on our voluntary portfolio and that's going to continue to drive double-digit PFO growth in our business. And just to give you a flavor of that, we ended the year well above $1 billion of PFOs in voluntary and we continue to see good growth on that. In terms of employment, that's a tailwind. We are starting to see that in the business. Clearly higher employment levels provide just more eligibles and therefore more premiums. Wage inflation is another tailwind, although that does play out gradually over time. So we don't expect that to see kind of having an immediate uptick and it does depend on the population that's getting those wage increases, et cetera, but both of these I would think of as general tailwinds to the business and we are seeing evidence of that in our book today. Hey. Good morning, Tracy. Good question. Obviously, we have that long-term assumption and things have changed quite a bit. I think it's early for us to make any predictions at this point. Obviously, as we get into that kind of the end of the second quarter into the third quarter, really more of the third quarter, we will start to think about it. I think as we have all realized that things can change quickly. So -- and so I think it's -- and it is a long-term assumption. But having said that, I think, you highlighted some kind of the circumstances we are in that the current rates are higher than our long-term assumption that we are -- we projected to hit in 12 years. So that is -- but I wouldn't anticipate kind of any abrupt change one way or the other, we just made that change recent, few years ago and so you need to kind of see a trend before you would necessarily make a change, but again we will have to kind of evaluate all the data that's out there when we get closer. In terms of inflation, it's probably, it's not a -- it's really, I'd say, probably, more related to your first part of the question, what does that, how does that really impact rates. That's probably the biggest area for us when it comes to reserving. I think outside of that, it's -- there is generally, if you have any inflation impact, it's generally offset by other factors, net-net, so that's probably how I'd answer the inflation point. Great. Well, thank you again for joining us on this busy morning. Our strong performance in the first quarter of 2022 building on last year's outstanding results should provide further evidence of the significant progress we are making in delivering on our all-weather Next Horizon strategy. This management team is laser-focused on continuing to execute with urgency and we are confident in our ability to create long-term sustainable value for all stakeholders. Thanks again and talk soon."

            "content": "Good morning, Jimmy. It's Ramy here. So, maybe just, I will -- maybe helpful just to reiterate our philosophy towards the PRT market and then I will come and hit your question in terms of the pipeline. The two aspects of our philosophy, which I would like to reiterate here and highlight one is that, this is a business where we continue to exercise pricing discipline, and I would say in aggregate, our capital deployment in the business is in line with our enterprise ROE targets and it's also accretive to the in-force annuity spreads. The second one, which you have heard us talk about before is that, we are focused on the large and jumbo end of the market. There are fewer players there and the deals tend to play to our competitive strengths in terms of size and rating, our balance sheet and the investment capabilities. In terms of the outlook, as you know, we have a very strong quarter in 2021. The fourth quarter of 2021, we ended with five transaction that were total of $3.6 billion. We did one transaction this quarter for $1.3 billion and we still see a very robust pipeline in front of us as we look towards the rest of the year. In terms of the segments we play in that jumbo segment. Many of these plans have been on a multiyear derisking journey, so they don't kind of turn on a dime, if you will, in terms of making that decision. So a lot of those kinds of asset allocations have been pre-positioned, and therefore, that jumbo end, it doesn't tend to be as sensitive to equity market volatility. But having said that, clearly, the overall market, as it stands today stands at a very high funding levels and that bodes well for the overall pipeline as well. Hey. It's Ramy here. Generally speaking, we are pretty quick in terms of recognizing the getting the death claims and recognizing those and we clearly hold the reserved essentially account for the IBNR. So I would say, on average, we have been getting up pretty well over the last kind of year and a half. So I would just continue to anchor any of your kind of estimates based on the headline mortality numbers for the entire population. So I would say, you looked at those and those have trended favorably in April. And the other statistic, I would also look at, is the percentage of deaths, which are under 65, which looking at April, that has continued to be at the same level as we saw in the first quarter, which, as John mentioned, would be favorable for us from a severity perspective."

            "name": "Kishore Ponnavolu",
            "content": "Hi, Erik. This is Kishore. So if you think about the yen impact, you can think about this in two aspects. One is the translation impact on earnings and the second one is the impact on sales. On earnings, we have a multi-currency balance sheet in Japan, because of our FX products. And if you think about it holistically for MetLife Asia, roughly 15% of our earnings are yen-denominated and so, therefore, any depreciation on the yen has a moderate impact, I can say that on Asia adjusted earnings. On the sales, however, the FX volatility more than the rate itself is the volatility that is very important to rates consideration as well. It impacts volumes so far FX products in the near-term. In periods of high FX volatility, our customers tend to wait and see before the commit there yen to be converted to U.S. dollars, say, if it's the U.S. dollar product. At the same time, the yen, the increase in U.S. dollar rates, which is certainly true now enhances the customer value making them more attractive. So there is a balanced both ways. And currently, we are seeing the impact of both the yen weakening and the higher U.S. dollar interest rates on both sides. So if you think about, that's the way I would look at it. I will leave it at that. I love the premise of your question, Erik, and I will certainly pass on that complement to our associates in Japan. I think it's a great question. I love the way you worded it. Certainly, that said, our sales increased 18% in Japan. That's a very strong performance. There are three reasons why I would attribute that. We -- our execution on the ground has been quite strong Secondly, we do have a very diversified channel mix, as you know, and that is continuing to show where certainly there is a little bit of softness on the banker side on a relative basis, but that got picked up on the CA, so that balance is back and forth certainly is coming through really well. And then, thirdly, we have been investing quite a bit on our products and capabilities over the past two years. But most notably over the past 12 months, we have had a couple of successful product launches, and most recently, we entered the quarterly market again and so that was well received in the marketplace. We launched a new banker platform in last year, which has got very strong reception and then we also entered the variable product markets. So that's also getting good traction as well. So we are very happy about that. However, since you asked the question, I wanted to give you a little bit of context for overall Asia in terms of our performance this quarter, which is really were very good, but also caution that, we are continuing to deal with COVID and that's a big factor across all our markets, clearly, Korea and Japan, we have a surge in cases in quarter one and we are dealing with that even in China as well, And so-- and then on top of that, in Q2, we are dealing with a bunch of market-specific regulatory and exchange related challenges, which are ongoing. And then there is a seasonality factor in Q1 with March being the fiscal year-end, so that's been a tailwind which doesn't carry through Q2. Given all that, the volume of sales in the next quarter will be under pressure. But on a year-on-year basis, I expect Asia ex-Japan to come stronger in Q2 to offset that as well. So that's done well in Q1, little bit of pressure in Q2 and then I want to switch to the overall frame, which is despite all of this. Our execution has been very strong. Our diversity of markets are coming through. And so, from a guidance perspective, hitting to the mid-to-high single sales growth guidance we gave in February. And in terms of timing, I expect a much stronger year-on-year performance in the second half for Asia as a whole. So I hope that was helpful from a commentary perspective. Great."

            "name": "John McCallion",
            "content": "Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 1Q 2022 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our cash and capital positions. Starting on page three, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the first quarter. Net income was $606 million or $1.1 billion lower than adjusted earnings. The majority of this variance was due to net derivative losses as a result of the significant rise in long-term interest rates in the quarter. In addition, we had net investment losses, primarily due to impairments on our Russian premium bonds, as well as normal trading activity in the portfolio that resulted in losses given the rising interest rate environment. Following the impairments and a sale of Russian bonds in April, our current combined exposure in Russia and Ukraine is roughly $125 million. On page four, you can see the first quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, which did not have any notable items on either period. Adjusted earnings were $1.7 billion, down 12% and down 10% on a constant currency basis. Lower variable investment income accounted for the majority of the year-over-year decline. While private equity returns were again strong, they compared to an even stronger Q1 of 2021, adjusted earnings per share was $2.08, down 5% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 4% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S., Group Benefits adjusted earnings were up 20% year-over-year due to higher volume growth and an improvement in underwriting margins. I will discuss Group Life underwriting in more detail shortly. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 72.5% in Q1 of 2022 at the midpoint of its annual target range of 70% to 75%. That said, the ratio higher than the prior year quarter of 71.1%, due to higher incidences in disability relative to favorable incidence levels in the prior year quarter. Turning to topline, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 7% year-over-year. This growth included 2 percentage points related to higher premiums from participating contracts, which can fluctuate with claim experience. The balance of the PFO growth of 5% was due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. Group Benefits sales were down 31% compared to record sales in Q1 of 2021, which were driven by exceptionally strong jumbo cases. While jumbo case activity was significantly lower in 1Q 2022, we continue to see good growth in the business and our persistency remained strong. Retirement Income Solutions or RIS adjusted earnings were down 16% year-over-year. The primary driver was less favorable private equity returns versus a very strong Q1 of 2021. Favorable volume growth was a partial offset. RIS investment spreads were 181 basis points, driven by another strong quarter of variable investment income, spreads excluding VII were 89 basis points, up 1 basis point versus 1Q 2021, but down 2 basis points sequentially due to higher LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures were essentially flat year-over-year, as growth across most products primarily U.K. longevity reinsurance and pension risk transfers were offset by lower separate account balances. With regards to pension risk transfers, we completed one transaction worth $1.3 billion in the first quarter and continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia, the adjusted earnings were down 7% and 4% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower recurring interest margins and a decline in first quarter equity markets in Japan and Korea. This is partially offset by solid volume growth as assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 7% on a constant currency basis. In addition, sales were up 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis driven by strong sales in Japan. Latin America adjusted earnings were $142 million versus $40 million in the prior year quarter, while COVID-19 related claims remained elevated in 1Q 2002 at roughly $30 million after-tax. They were down significantly versus the prior year quarter. In addition, volume growth was a positive contributor, while lower equity markets were a partial offset. The Chilean Encaje had negative 4% return in 1Q 2022 versus the prior year quarter, which was a modest positive. While LatAm's bottomline has been trending towards pre-pandemic levels, its topline continues to demonstrate strength as adjusted PFOs were up 22% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and sales were up 40% on a constant currency basis, driven by solid growth across the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were down 27% and 15% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by the exclusion of divested businesses, Poland and Greece, which were included in the first quarter of 2021 adjusted earnings. In addition, higher expenses were partially offset by favorable underwriting margins and volume growth. While the region reported excess COVID claims in Q1, they were lower than the prior year quarter. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 39%. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income and less favorable underwriting. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $117 million versus an adjusted loss of $171 million in the prior year quarter. Higher variable investment income was the result of a $1.1 billion transfer of PE assets to corporate and other from IRS and MetLife Holdings in Q1 of 2022. To better align asset liability management for these two segments, higher expenses were partial offset. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 21.3% and within our 2022 guidance range of 21% to 23%. Now, I will provide more detail on Group Benefits mortality results on page five. This chart reflects our Group Life mortality ratio for the last five quarters, including the COVID-19 impact on the ratio and on Group Benefits adjusted earnings. The Group Life mortality ratio was one hundred and 103.8 in the first quarter of 2022, which is well above our annual target range of 85% to 90%. COVID reported claims were roughly 14% points, which reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $230 million. While U.S. COVID deaths were higher sequentially, there was a favorable shift in the percentage of deaths under age 65, declining from approximately 33% in the fourth quarter to roughly 23% in the first quarter. As a result of these two competing factors, we saw a modest improvement in mortality results this quarter. In addition we experienced 1 percentage point to 2 percentage points from non-COVID excess mortality. This included a large number of high dollar claims, which can fluctuate from period-to-period. On page six, this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the past five quarters, including $1.2 billion in the first of 2022. This strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio of roughly $14 billion, which had an overall return of 7% in the quarter. Unlike previous quarters where we have seen a dispersion in returns by fund type, this quarter our major PE returns were tightly coupled around 7% overall. As we have previously discussed, private equities generally accounted for on a quarter lag. In addition, real estate equity funds were also a strong contributor to VII with a 10% return in the quarter, while hedge funds, which are reported on a one-month lag had a loss. On page seven, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the prior five quarters, including $936 million in Q1 of 2022. You will note that our general rule of thumb that RIS, MetLife Holdings in Asia account for 90% or more of the total VII did not hold in 1Q 2022, coming in at 83%. This lower percentage was primarily due to the transfer of PES to corporate and other from RIS and MetLife Holdings that I discussed earlier. In addition, Asia's higher VII year-over-year was primarily due to strong real estate equity fund performance, as well as higher PE asset balances. Turning to page eight, this chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior five quarters, including 11.7% in Q1 of 2022. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our first quarter direct expense ratio benefited from solid topline growth and ongoing expense discipline. This included approximately 40 basis points from premiums that relate to participating cases in Group Benefits due to excess mortality. We remain committed to achieving a full year direct expense ratio below 12.3% in 2022, demonstrating our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. I will now discuss our cash and capital position on page nine. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.2 billion at March 31st, which was down from $5.4 billion at December 31st, but remains above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential decline in cash at the holding companies reflect the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $915 million in the first quarter, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. Our first quarter tends to be lower in subsidiary dividends and higher in holding company expenses. Therefore, we would expect HoldCo cash balances to increase in the second quarter due to higher subsidiary dividends, as well as proceeds from the sale of our Poland business, which closed in April, as Michel noted. In regard to our statutory capital, for our U.S. companies are 2021 combined NAIC RBC ratio was 386%, which was above our target ratio of 360%. For our U.S. companies, preliminary first-quarter year-to-date 2022 statutory operating earnings were approximately $400 million, while net income was approximately $800 million. Statutory operating earnings decreased by approximately $1.1 billion year-over-year primarily due to less favorable VA rider reserves, underwriting results and higher expenses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.7 billion as of March 31, 2022, down 2% compared to December 31, 2021. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 947% as of December 31st, which is the latest public data. Looking ahead, we expect the Japan SMR to decline in 2022, as a result of higher U.S. interest rates, but remained well above its capital target level. Let me conclude by saying MetLife delivered another strong quarter, highlighted by outstanding private equity returns, solid topline growth, ongoing expense discipline and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities that allow us to navigate successfully through uncertain environments. In addition, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio remain strong and position us for further success. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the Operator for your questions. Hey, Elyse. It's John. Good morning. I think as we have said before, rising interest rates are, I think, beneficial to the block, the risk transfer, block transfer market and I think there is, so that gives, but I don't think that's the only thing that people are focused on. I don't think it changes materially. I think is a modest positive as we have talked about improving interest rates, solid equity markets, I think they all kinds of support a healthy risk transfer market. So, but again, I don't think that's the only driver and I think as we have seen over the years, the last few years, there is been plenty of transactions even at lower rates. So, but again, I think, it's a modest positive. Sure. Good morning. Good morning, Suneet. Yeah. That's right. I mean I think it's just the kind of some of the geography between our -- where our VA reserves go versus some of the kind of the hedges and you think about just what equity markets did that probably explains some of that difference and some of the realization of that. So that's kind of number one. You commented and then your second point is just on stat capital generation. Yeah, I think, it was down 2%, so maybe a little over $300 million. I'd kind of put that in the normal volatility in any one quarter we paid our normal kind of a fourth of 25% of our kind of target dividend for the year, give or take in the quarter and which had a little additional volatility. So I wouldn't read into that any -- in anyway, I'd kind of sort of consider that to be normal volatility and I wouldn't consider a trend. Good morning, Alex. Yes. We are certainly pleased with the execution and that's not without headwinds and what we are all dealing with today in terms of inflation, wage increases and things like that, but I think it's a testament to the team and really the embedded culture that we have built here around efficiency mindset. It's a critical point of our strategy as you mentioned. And just on the ratio itself, it was 11.7. I mentioned in the opening remarks that, you have to be careful, the headline number is probably benefiting about 40 basis points from elevated COVID claims, which impact our participating cases and that creates increase in revenue is a bit of a gross-up on the P&L. So, net-net, we are still -- we are a little above 12, but maybe -- but still below the 12.3. And that's -- within there is also includes our intention to continue to invest in the firm for growth to improve our use of technologies and then, obviously, if circumstances dictate that gives us optionality to leverage that capacity in different ways and to protect margins. So, all in all, I'd say, we are executing on our target, our initiative, when it comes to managing expenses. Yeah. I think, as you point out, we have a lot of sources of cash to the holding company. I think what we have committed to, we don't commit to kind of a dividend in any one legal entity. And I think the benefit of having a diverse set of cash generation that can be sent to the holding company is that, it gives us the benefit of being able to commit to the 65% to 75% free cash flow ratio on average over two-year period. And so it's not something we target at any one entity. We look at all aspects of how we are trying to manage our cash and capital at the operating entities, where we are looking to grow, where we need extra capital, things like that. And I think the benefit is, like I said, it's a diverse set of sources is very helpful. So we don't set a target at any legal entity externally, I should say, and then we kind of, just like you manage your own wallet, we manage our collective wallets the same way."

            "name": "Steve Goulart",
            "content": "Sure. Hey, Tom. It's Steve Goulart. And you are right on that, but I think, John mentioned is too in his script, too, there really were two issues that led to virtually all of the realized losses in the first quarter. One, as you point out was Russia and that was roughly half of the credit losses and provisions. And again, I'd start out by reminding everyone that our total exposure to Russia is less than one-tenth of 1% of the general account. So, in sum some not really a material number. And then the second piece on the losses, John also mentioned was, normal trading activity, but that really just reflected what was happening with interest rates in the quarter. And if you think about, again, our asset liability management, we are heavily investing in private assets right now, and it takes time to originate those private assets. So we are putting in assets that are more liquid and as we replace those in the permanent structure with private assets, given the interest rate movements in the quarter we saw losses in that. But again we pick it up on the back end, of course, because the private assets are higher yielding. I think as long as rates are moving, we will probably see similar action and similar results, yeah. Hey, Alex. It's Steve Goulart. So the updated continues to be very positive. We continue to grow MetLife Investment Management. I think we have been really achieving an aggressive organic growth plan that is in line with what we laid out at our 2019 Investor Day on our objectives and targets for where we are going to see the business grow. At the same time, you are right, it's a very active market right now and we continue to be active in it as well and looking at opportunities for acquisitions and it does cut both ways and there is a lot of activity, but there are a lot of people looking in the markets, too. We know what we are looking for strategically. We are very disciplined financially and we want to make sure that anything we do fits culturally and strategically. So we will continue to be active and hopefully when we find something that meets those criteria we will be successful in acquiring it."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.\nJohn Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife's fourth quarter 2023 earnings and near-term outlook call. Before we begin, I'd point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides, which addressed the quarter as well as our near-term outlook. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks. An appendix to the slides features outlook sensitivities, disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information, which you should similarly review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session, which will end promptly at the top of the hour. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michel.\nMichel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As we begin 2023, I shared our conviction that despite the uncertain times, MetLife would exit the year stronger than we entered it. We accomplished this by countering the challenging environment with the actions we've taken to focus, simplify, and differentiate our business. We maintained an accelerated momentum in MetLife's diversified set of market-leading businesses, driving strong results for the year and the quarter. And we illustrated our financial strength and flexibility with sound transactions and well-timed capital management, ending the year with solid capital ratios and robust cash on hand. Clearly, our all-weather strategy stood up again in 2023. We remain steadfastly focused on what matters most in delivering for our customers and shareholders. In 2023, we exited a pandemic and have yet to enter a widely expected U.S. recession. We managed through a bank liquidity crisis and the resulting credit concerns. And we adapted to an inverted yield curve that has persisted longer than any in history. Against this backdrop, the fundamentals of our businesses are as strong as I have ever seen. Our successful 2023 is a testament to the resilience and durability of our business model, a relentless focus on execution, concentrating on the factors we control, our risk management culture and processes, the discipline we apply to managing our assets and liabilities, and the prudence of our investment portfolio. On that last point, the strength and stability of our commercial real estate portfolio, which we detailed a year ago, has borne out, as we said, a modest increase in LTVs and stable debt service coverage ratios, and we expect that to remain true in 2024. For the year, we delivered an adjusted return on equity, excluding notable items, of 13.8%, achieving our target for this all-important metric. We were unwavering in our expense discipline, employing efficiency and agility to post a full year direct expense ratio of 12.2%. We upheld our commitment to responsible growth, directing capital to its highest and best use, with high teen IRRs and mid single-digit payback periods on new business. We returned $4.7 billion to shareholders via common stock dividends and share repurchases, and we continued to generate strong, recurring free cash flow and remain financially flexible with significant liquidity at our holding companies. The resilience of our strategy and the clarity of our purpose remain powerful drivers of MetLife's success. Our diversified portfolio of market-leading businesses is well positioned to perform for years to come. Backed by a strong balance sheet and our demonstrated ability to generate cash flow, I am confident in MetLife's ability to create value for shareholders and other stakeholders, and to deliver financial security to our customers as we have for over a century and a half. Now turning to our fourth quarter 2023 results, last night we reported quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion, or $1.83 per share. Excluding notable items, we reported $1.93 per share, up 21% compared to $1.59 per share a year ago. Again, this quarter, our businesses showed strong underlying momentum with excellent underwriting results. Also, our recurring investment income grew on higher balances and higher new money rates. Shifting to the full year 2023, the differentiation and scale across our market-leading businesses were among the factors that helped to fuel our underlying business fundamentals. We generated adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, of $5.6 billion. On the strength of new money yields, our adjusted net investment income grew 9% year-over-year to almost $20 billion, despite variable investment income falling below expectations. Adjusted PFOs, excluding pension risk transfers climbed 6%, with healthy growth across most business segments. Group Benefits posted adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, of $1.6 billion, up 22% from the prior year. The scale and breadth of this franchise business continues to drive organic growth and represents a clear point of competitive advantage. Sales gained 9%, while adjusted PFOs, excluding the impact of participating policies, rose roughly at 5%. We believe group PFO growth is sustainable at more than $1 billion per year. Higher interest rates serve as a tailwind to our leading Retirement and Income Solutions business, with new money yields exceeding roll-off rates for the past seven consecutive quarters. Volume growth in RIS away from PRT was very strong, with more than $5 billion of longevity, reinsurance sales and more than $3 billion of structured settlements. Pension risk transfers totaled $5.3 billion for the year, the third largest annual total in MetLife\u2019s history. This followed an all-time record year in 2022, and we have a strong pipeline of new opportunities in 2024 and beyond. Sales growth in Asia remained strong, propelled by market demand in Japan for FX denominated life insurance products and a new cash value life product in Korea. Finally, Latin America continues to be a growing and important region for MetLife. Adjusted earnings on a reported basis in 2023 grew 15% over the prior year, and we've expanded our distribution capabilities as well as our product portfolio. One of the ways we hold ourselves accountable is against the Next Horizon commitments we made in 2019. On that basis, we are ahead of schedule to meet all criteria. In fact, we have even moved the goalpost on ourselves and raised the bar on certain of our Next Horizon commitments. For instance, we initially committed to an adjusted return on equity of 12% to 14%, and last year we chose to push that target even higher, to 13% to 15%. And as you've seen within our outlook disclosure, we've further tightened our expense ratio target from 12.6% to 12.3%. While we have the strongest conviction in our Next Horizon strategy, we do not view it as a ceiling on our aspirations. We constantly look to set higher standards and position MetLife for even greater success. When I spoke of emerging from 2023 stronger our capital and cash is another prime example. During a year marked by periods of financial and geopolitical turmoil, our balance sheet strength enabled us to repurchase $3.1 billion of our common stock and increase our common stock dividend per share, paying out roughly $1.6 billion in common stock dividends. Even still, we enter 2024 with robust levels of cash and higher capital ratios in our key markets. Our capital management has carried into 2024, and we have repurchased roughly $0.5 billion of MET common shares in the month of January. We continue to have capacity for further action with approximately $1.6 billion remaining on our repurchase authorization. There is no doubt MetLife's financial strength and financial flexibility was on full view during 2023, particularly with the execution of our $19 billion risk transfer transaction that closed in November. This will free up more than $3 billion of capital over time and illustrates the disciplined approach we apply to evaluating our portfolio of businesses. We ended the year with $5.2 billion of cash and liquid assets on our balance sheet, which is comfortably above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. We have consistently said that when responsible growth is attractive and available, we will deploy capital organically or inorganically. If not, we will return capital to our shareholders. I am pleased our Next Horizon strategy continues to prove its metal amid uncertainty. Looking ahead, whether driven by Fed policy and changes to the yield curve, geopolitical events, or the unfolding U.S. election cycle, it is prudent to anticipate more uncertainty in 2024. The supplemental slides we published last night include some near-term targets and elements of guidance. It should be playing to see that we anticipate the underlying momentum building across our businesses to continue. This is evident in our flagship Group Benefits business, where off a large embedded base we've established a strong growth outlook for premiums, fees and other revenues. And of further note, we've also increased our expectations for both group life and non-medical health margins. Importantly, the outlook that we've provided reflects the world as we see it, not as we wish it to be. In that context, we assume a more modest private equity return of high-single digits in the near term, down from the 12% assumption we have used in prior years. Private equity remains an important contributor to our well-tested asset-liability matching program. It is an asset class well suited to defeat long-term liabilities, and our historical track record has been very strong. In closing, when we launched our Next Horizon strategy in 2019, we could not have predicted the many challenges we would face in the markets where we operate. But our unyielding execution against our strategy is serving us and our many stakeholders well, allowing us to positively impact our customers and live our purpose. Our 2023 results reflect our capacity to move ahead with urgency and deliver on our strategy. We saw very good underlying business performance supported by a strong capital base. We will continue to concentrate on controlling what we can control, balance sheet security, responsible growth, expense efficiency and capital deployment among others. In the final year of the Next Horizon strategy time frame, we believe our past progress positions us to reach for new heights not possible four years ago. I am energized for the future of MetLife driven by the continued momentum I see building in our businesses for 2024 and beyond. Now I'll turn it over to John to cover our performance and outlook in detail.\nJohn McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 4Q 2023 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, an update of our liquidity and capital positions as well as our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. In addition, I will discuss our near-term outlook in more detail. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year 2023. Market risk benefit or MRB remeasurement losses in the fourth quarter was due to the decline in long-term interest rates. Net derivative gains were only a partial offset as the favorable impact from lower long-term interest rates were mitigated by changes in short-term interest rates and higher equity markets in the quarter. For the full year, the variance between net income and adjusted earnings was mostly attributable to net derivative losses, primarily due to stronger equity markets, changes in foreign currencies and higher interest rates in 2023. In addition, net investment losses were largely the result of normal trading activity on the portfolio in a rising interest rate environment as well as the mark-to-market impact on securities that were transferred as part of the reinsurance transaction with Global Atlantic. Overall, the portfolio remains well positioned with modest levels of credit losses and the hedging program continues to perform as expected. On Page 4, you can see the fourth quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding $76 million after tax, of an unfavorable notable item relating to asbestos litigation reserves in 4Q of 2023 that was accounted for in corporate and other. There were no notable items in the prior year quarter. Regarding the asbestos reserve increase of $76 million, based on our latest review, while we continue to observe a declining claim count, the frequency of severe claims related to asbestos has not declined as expected. The total reserve is $364 million at the end of 2023. Adjusted earnings, excluding total notable items were $1.4 billion, up 14% and 12% on a constant currency basis. The primary drivers were strong recurring interest margins, higher variable investment income, or VII, volume growth and favorable underwriting margins. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding total notable items were $1.93, up 21% and 19% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were $466 million, up 19% versus the prior year period. The key drivers were favorable life underwriting margins and solid volume growth. The Group Life mortality ratio was 83.5%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 87.3% and below the bottom end of our 2023 target range of 85% to 90%. Consistent with CDC U.S. mortality data, we saw a much lower number of life claims than typical in the fourth quarter. Regarding non-medical health, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 70.7% in the quarter, and at the low end of its annual target range of 70% to 75%. We expect both the life mortality ratio and the non-medical health ratio to be higher in Q1 given the seasonality of the business. Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs on a full year basis were up 3% year-over-year. Taking participating contracts into account, which dampened growth by roughly 200 basis points. The underlying PFOs were up approximately 5% year-over-year within our 2023 target growth range of 4% to 6%. In addition, Group Benefits 2023 sales were up 9% year-over-year. The continued strong growth is primarily due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. RIS adjusted earnings were $421 million, up 10% year-over-year. The primary drivers were favorable investment margins due to higher recurring interest and variable investment income as well as favorable underwriting margins. RIS investment spreads were 121 basis points. Spreads, excluding VII were 134 basis points, up 10 points versus Q4 of 2022, primarily due to higher interest rates as well as income from in-the-money interest rate caps. RIS adjusted PFOs, excluding pension risk transfers were up 75% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong sales of structured settlement products and post-retirement benefits as well as growth in UK longevity reinsurance. With regards to PRT, we added transactions worth approximately $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year total to roughly $5.3 billion. This marks the third highest PRT sales year for MetLife, and we continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were $296 million, up 12% and 11% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher investment margins and lower taxes. For Asia's key growth metrics, general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis were up 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were essentially flat versus the prior year quarter. For the full year, Asia\u2019s sales were up 13%, driven by strong growth across the region, exceeding its 2023 guidance range of mid to high-single digits. Latin America adjusted earnings were $207 million, up 13% and 4% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to solid volume growth partially offset by less favorable underwriting margins versus a strong Q4 2022. In addition, LatAm had favorable Chilean encaje returns of 7.9% in 4Q of 2023 versus 6.1% in the prior year quarter. Latin America\u2019s top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 29% and 19% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong sales and solid persistency across the region. For the full year, adjusted PFOs were also up 29% on a reported basis and 19% on a constant currency basis, exceeding LatAm\u2019s 2023 guidance of low-double digit growth. EMEA adjusted earnings were $47 million, down 27% on both a reported and constant currency basis, primarily driven by an unfavorable tax charge following a favorable tax benefit in the prior year period, as well as less favorable expense and underwriting margins. This was partially offset by higher recurring interest margins year-over-year. EMEA full year 2023 adjusted earnings of $265 million exceeded our outlook expectations of roughly $55 million per quarter. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 5% on both a reported and constant currency basis and sales were up 18% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong growth across the region. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $156 million, down 15%, largely driven by foregone earnings as a result of the reinsurance transaction that closed in November. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $156 million, excluding the unfavorable notable item of $76 million after-tax that I referenced earlier. This compares to an adjusted loss of $210 million in the prior year. Higher net investment income and favorable taxes were the primary drivers. The company\u2019s effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 19%, which includes favorable tax benefits primarily related to the true up of the federal tax return to provision. On Page 5, this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the four quarters and full year of 2023. VII was $63 million in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by positive returns in our corporate and mortgage loan funds. The private equity portfolio and real estate equity funds had a combined return of essentially zero in the quarter. For the full year, VII was $419 million, well below our 2023 target of approximately $2 billion. That said, while mark-to-market returns were below expectation in 2023, the PE portfolio generated approximately $2 billion in cash distributions during the year. On Page 6, we provide VII post tax by segment for the prior four quarters and full year 2023. As reflected in the chart, RIS, Asia and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest proportion of VII assets, given their long dated liability profile. Now, turning to Page 7, the chart on the left of the page shows the split of our net investment income between recurring and VII for the past three years, as well as Q4 of 2022 versus Q4 of 2023. While VII has had lower than trend returns over the last couple of years, recurring income, which accounted for most of the net investment income in 2023 was up approximately $2.6 billion year-over-year, reflecting higher interest rates and growth in asset balances. The expansion of recurring income in 2023 more than offset the lower VII year-over-year. Shifting your attention to the right of the page, which shows our new money yield versus roll-off yield since 4Q of 2020, new money yields continue to outpace roll-off yields over the past couple of years, consistent with rising rates. In this quarter, our global new money yield continued its upward trajectory coming in at 6.67%, 142 basis points higher than the roll-off yield. Turning to Page 8. I\u2019ll provide a few updates on our commercial mortgage loans. Overall, the CML portfolio continues to perform consistent with expectations, where we expect higher quality assets to outperform the asset sector broadly. The average LTV on our CML portfolio now stands at 64% as of December 31, up slightly from 63% in the third quarter of 2023, and the average debt service coverage ratio remains steady at 2.3 times. The modest increase in LTVs and stable debt service coverage ratio are further indicators of the disciplined approach we take to investing in this asset class. The quality of our CML portfolio remains strong with only 2.6% of loans having LTVs more than 80% and DSCRs less than one times. With regards to CML loan maturities, we resolved 100% of the loans that were scheduled to mature in 2023. Our expectation going forward remains for modest credit losses on the portfolio. Turning to Page 9. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior eight quarters and full year 2022 and 2023. Our direct expense ratio in 4Q of 2023 was up modestly at 12.4%, reflecting the impact from seasonal enrollment costs in group benefits as well as higher employee related costs. That said, as we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. For the full year of 2023, our direct expense ratio was 12.2% below our 2023 target of 12.6%. We believe this result once again demonstrates our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset in a challenging inflationary environment, while continuing to make investments in our businesses. I will now discuss our cash and capital positions on Page 10. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.2 billion at December 31, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of roughly $900 million in the fourth quarter, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, we repurchased shares totaling approximately $500 million in January. For the two-year period 2022 and 2023, our average free cash flow ratio, excluding notable items totaled 74% and was within our 65% to 75% target range. In terms of statutory capital, for our U.S. companies, our combined 2023 NAIC, RBC ratio is still preliminary but expected to be approximately 400% and above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, preliminary 2023 statutory operating earnings were approximately $4.5 billion, while net income was approximately $3.9 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by approximately $1.9 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable underwriting and impacts from the reinsurance transaction. This was partially offset by higher expenses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $19.5 billion as of December 31, 2023, up 10% for September 30, 2023, primarily due to operating earnings and the impacts of the reinsurance transaction. This was partially offset by dividends paid. Finally, we expect that Japan solvency margin ratio to be approximately 720% as of December 31, which will be based on statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks. Before I shift to our near-term outlook starting on Page 12, a few points on what we included in the appendix. The chart on Page 17 reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments from 2018 through 2022. This is the same chart that we showed as part of our 3Q 2023 supplemental slides, but we feel it's worth including again for the sake of completeness. Also, pages 18 through 21 provide interest rate assumptions and key outlook sensitivities by line of business. Now let's turn to Page 12 for further details on our near-term outlook. Starting with the overview. We expect continued uncertainty to persist around inflation and unemployment in 2024. We expect the U.S. dollar to stabilize around current levels. Based on the 12/31/2023 forward curve, we assume long-term interest rates to be largely unchanged in 2024, and the yield curve will move from inverted to modestly upward sloping as short-term interest rates decline and we assume a 5% annual return for the S&P 500. For our near-term targets, we are maintaining our adjusted ROE range of 13% to 15%. We expect to maintain our two-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75% of adjusted earnings. Also, given continued focus on expense discipline, building capacity to reinvest in growth initiatives, and our overall efficiency mindset, we are lowering our direct expense ratio guidance for 2024 from 12.6% to 12.3%. Specifically, for 2024, VII expected to be approximately $1.5 billion. Our corporate and other adjusted loss target is expected to be $750 million to $850 million after tax in 2024. This represents an approximately $100 million increase from our prior adjusted loss guidance of $650 million to $750 million in 2023. The higher range reflects C&O's current run rate given the impact of a higher rate environment on interest expense and pension costs, as well as the impact of lower expected benefits from VII. We are increasing our expected effective tax rate range by two points to 24% to 26% to reflect our expectation for higher earnings in foreign markets with higher tax rates and lower tax credits in the U.S. At the bottom of the page, you will see certain interest rate sensitivities relative to our base case, reflecting a relatively modest impact on adjusted earnings over the near-term. On Page 13, the chart reflects our VII average asset balances from $18 billion in 2022 to $19.7 billion expected in 2024. Private equity investments will continue to represent the vast majority of our VII asset balances. We are reducing our near-term expected annual returns for private equity to be between 7% to 10% and we are also lowering our expected returns for real estate and other funds to be in the range of 5% to 7% over the near-term. We expect PE and real estate returns will remain pressured in the first quarter of 2024 before trending higher. Finally, as a reminder, we include prepayment fees on fixed maturities and mortgage loans in VII. So now, I will discuss our near-term outlook for our business segments. Let's start with the U.S. on Page 14. For group benefits, excluding the excess premium from participating group life contracts of approximately $300 million in 2023, adjusted PFOs are expected to grow at 4% to 6% annually over the near-term. And for 2024 we expect growth to be in the top half of that range. This reflects the strong momentum in the business, particularly in voluntary products, as well as exceptionally strong persistency in our national accounts. Regarding underwriting, we expect 2024 underwriting margins to be generally consistent with 2023. As such, we are reducing our near-term group life mortality ratio and non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio ranges by 1 percentage point to 84% to 89% and 69% to 74%, respectively. Finally, keep in mind these are annual ratios and both typically skew to the higher end of the ranges in the first quarter given the seasonality of the business. For RAS, we are maintaining our 2% to 4% expected annual growth for total liability exposures across our general account spread and fee-based businesses. Regarding investment spread, full year 2023 was 125 basis points and is expected to be relatively flat for the full year of 2024. This incorporates both the impact of the roll off of our interest rate caps with maturities throughout 2024 and the offsetting benefit of VII re-emerging over the year as a more meaningful contributor. As such, we expect the investment spread range for 2024 is 115 to 140 basis points. We have also provided updated RAS sensitivities for interest rate movements in the appendix. Sensitivities reflect the anticipated impact from interest rate cap maturities throughout 2024. As such, our sensitivity to SOFR declines throughout the year. For MetLife Holdings, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to decline by approximately 13% to 15% in 2024 and then declining 4% to 6% annually thereafter. And we are lowering the adjusted earnings guidance range to $700 million to $900 million in 2024 to reflect the foregone earnings from the reinsurance transaction as well as lower expected PE returns and natural runoff of the business. Now, let\u2019s look at the near-term guidance of our businesses outside the U.S. on Page 15. For Asia, we expect the recent sales momentum to continue and generate mid-single digit growth over the near-term. In addition, we expect general account AUM to maintain mid-single digit growth. We are expecting adjusted earnings to grow roughly 20% in 2024 as we assume VII to have a greater impact throughout the year. We are maintaining mid-single digit adjusted earnings growth expectation over the remainder of the near-term. For Latin America, we expect both adjusted PFOs and adjusted earnings to grow by high single digits over the near-term. Finally, for EMEA, we\u2019re expecting sales to grow mid- to high-single digits and adjusted PFOs to grow mid-single digits over the near-term. The forward curve assumes a strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in EMEA. As such, we project EMEA\u2019s adjusted earnings run rate to be roughly $60 million to $65 million per quarter in 2024 and then grow by mid-single digits in 2025 and 2026 based on the forward curve for these currencies. Let me conclude by saying that MetLife delivered a solid quarter to close out another strong year. The underlying strength of our business fundamentals remains on display with strong top line growth coupled with disciplined underwriting and expense management. While VII remains below historical returns, core spreads remain robust and continue to benefit from the higher yield environment. While the current environment remains uncertain, we are excited about the outlook and growth prospects for our businesses over the near-term and beyond. MetLife continues to move forward from a position of strength with a strong balance sheet, recurring free cash flow generation and a diversified set of our market leading businesses. And we are committed to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth and build sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.\nRyan Krueger: Hey, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the ROE target. And I recognize that you just raised the target by 100 basis points a year ago to 13% to 15%. But it seems like your segment outlook would suggest something at least a bit above 15%, maybe something closer to 15.5%. So I guess I just wanted to hear your perspective on, am I thinking about that incorrectly or is there some potential upside to this ROE based on the current trends you\u2019re seeing?\nJohn McCallion: Good morning, Ryan, it\u2019s John. I think we wouldn\u2019t debate your model calculations there. I think it\u2019s fair to say that we certainly are trending to the high end of that range, if not with a plus sign. But we just moved it a year ago and I think we\u2019ll take a year here and take stock at that time. But I\u2019d say \u2013 I think just maybe just to help you with that. One other thing is, like I said, we\u2019ll take stock. We think over time, and we\u2019ve been talking about this, that there has been kind of \u2013 as a result of higher rates, there has been a shift in volume and returns on our business. So it wouldn\u2019t preclude us from doing it again. I think we want to take some time to take stock.\nRyan Krueger: Understood. Makes sense. And then I think you said you expected the RBC ratio to be around 400%. Would have thought it would have been maybe a little higher than that following the reinsurance transaction. Do you have any more color on if there were any offsets?\nMichel Khalaf: Yes, I think when we announced the deal, we thought this would give us 50 points to 60 points. We still think it will. There\u2019s a little bit of what happens immediately and then how things trend in over time. Also, there\u2019s a lot of other things going on, fungibility, growth. We had some very sizable growth in RAS. So, we deployed some extra capital this year. So, I think a lot of those things. But in terms of the deal economics that we outlined at time of signing, everything came in as expected.\nRyan Krueger: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Next we go to the line of Suneet Kamath with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSuneet Kamath: Yes, thanks, and appreciate all the color on the guidance. But maybe if we could just circle back to consolidated recurring NII, I think you talked about a pretty big lift in 2023 relative to 2022, that $19.3 billion. Any help in terms of what you think that could look like given all of the moving pieces as we think about 2024?\nJohn McCallion: Hey, Suneet, it\u2019s John. It\u2019s a good question. I mean, sometimes, NII, it\u2019s a helpful metric, certainly from, I\u2019d say mix and just to show that higher rates have more than offset or actually offset some of the depression and VII. And I think the point of that slide is to show that there\u2019s more power there once things kind of re emerge on the VII front. Sometimes it\u2019s a little hard with just translating NII to earnings. So, we\u2019re a little cautious on necessarily given a target around that because, we have different products that perform well in different environments and ultimately to spread. So I think we\u2019re a little hesitant to kind of forecast for you. I think the point of that slide was to indicate that it shows the growth in our business. It shows that we\u2019re well diversified. We can perform well in a variety of economic environments. And I think that\u2019s really probably the theme to take away. So sorry, I didn\u2019t get to maybe your exact question or answer, but that\u2019s probably the best I can do.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. Got it. And then as we think about the benefit of the caps in 2023 and what that looks like in 2024 as they roll off? Should we think about the improvement in VII as essentially like those two kind of net as a wash? Or is one kind of greater than the other? I just want to get some additional color on that if we could.\nJohn McCallion: Yes, it\u2019s a great question. I think what you just said at the end around in terms of them being a wash is a pretty good way of thinking about it. So, we had 125 basis points last year, all-in for 2023. We gave a range of 115 basis points to 140 basis points for next year. I think the midpoint is a little above. It\u2019s at 127 basis points, I guess if you did the math. And our view is the interest rate caps will roll off throughout the year and then VII will emerge throughout the year and essentially offset the decline there. And so we think the best way to think about the spreads for the year is relatively flat to what you saw for the full year of 2023. It will give and take here and there. As we point out on the slide, we think VII in the first quarter will continue to be pressured. Obviously, the caps haven\u2019t fully rolled off yet, so we\u2019ll still have income from them. And then as VII merges, you\u2019ll see the caps roll off and they\u2019ll essentially offset.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Next, we have a question from Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nTom Gallagher: Hi. So your assumed alternative returns are now around 7.5% for 2024. And I think the RBC risk charge, if I was to do a weighted average, would be 15% to 20% on most of that portfolio. Have you considered pivoting some of the portfolio into assets with comparable, let\u2019s say, 7% yields, like private credit or just other fixed income, but much lower risk charges? I\u2019m just thinking about it from the perspective of we\u2019ve had two years of underperformance, your outlook for a third year is below those levels, and rates are higher. And if I think about both your cost of capital and ROE, I think it would be a fairly meaningful positive. Not recognizing you can\u2019t do this overnight, but is that something you consider pivoting or shifting to? Thanks.\nJohn McCallion: Hey good morning, Tom, it\u2019s John. I think the last point you made around you can\u2019t do this overnight is an important piece, but I think direction of travel, that\u2019s probably fair point. And I think we\u2019ve talked about the fact that we are in a different rate environment. So the relative value of investments are probably different than where they were when it was lower for longer. We pride ourselves in diversification. So it\u2019s not that we would make an abrupt shift, but we do believe that making some tweaks to allocations is appropriate in different environments. And I think what you\u2019re referencing is one that we would lean towards. It\u2019s an asset class where you have prior commitments and those \u2013 then get deployed judiciously. And actually there's probably some really good opportunities right now that we're leveraging. Having said that, we think distributions will likely outpace new contributions just given our revised level of new commitments. And I think over time you would see a moderate shift in allocation in that asset class versus others.\nTom Gallagher: Okay, thanks. And then just a question on Group Benefits, the 100 basis point improvement in the margin target, or at least the loss ratio targets. Can you comment on what's driving that? Is that stable pricing, sustainably higher disability or lower disability loss ratios, and maybe a little bit on the Group Life side, what you're thinking? Thanks.\nRamy Tadros: Good morning, Tom. It's Ramy here. And I would say at the highest level in terms of our near-term outlook here is, this is driven by the changing business mix, both in terms of the customer segments that we serve as well as the products that we offer. So from a customer perspective, we've executed well on our strategy to target higher growth in regional markets. We're seeing the benefits of that. In terms of growth, regional markets has grown two to three percentage points higher than the overall average, and we see a clear path for that growth to continue. And regional market is a segment that does carry a lower loss ratio across both the life underwriting ratio and non-medical health. And we're also seeing a shift from a product perspective. We've executed well on our employee paid strategy in general, and voluntary strategy in particular and in voluntary we've seen double-digit growth over many years and we expect that to persist in the future given customer needs and the opportunity to drive penetration in the workplace. And the loss ratio here tends to be also more favorable to the overall portfolio. So between that customer segment and that product view, if you think about this over time, we feel kind of a shift to the outlook is warranted. Let me tell you what it's not been driven by. On the Life ratio, this quarter was very favorable and it's really driven, as John pointed out, to the population mortality experience. So this is not one quarter makes a trend, this is one quarter here that was favorable. And we do expect the Q1 numbers to tick up given the seasonality of Life claims. And then on the disability side, our outlook in terms of the ratios does include an expectation that the profitability of our disability line of business will moderate over time. But that is outweighed by the other factors that I've just mentioned. And back to Q1 as well, there \u2013 just remember, there's also seasonality in that ratio in Q1 given the seasonality of the dental business. So net-net, think about it as business mix, customer and product mix. That's really driving this shift downwards in the ranges.\nTom Gallagher: That's helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Next, we go to the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJimmy Bhullar: So the first question on retirement spreads. Can you discuss the driver of the sequential decline in spreads each of the last two quarters? And how much of this is being driven by mix of business versus maybe competition, because what we're seeing is your yields have gone up, but crediting rates seem to be rising even faster than that?\nJohn McCallion: Good morning, Jimmy. It's John. The simple answer just sequentially for us is the lower rates late in the quarter caused a bit of compression on the spread number. Just how \u2013 we had the caps were in the money and lower rates were \u2013 came in. So it was different than the forward curve at the time of the third quarter when we gave the 135 to 140 range came in at 134 xviii. So that's the main driver. It's not pricing. Pricing has actually been pretty healthy, relatively speaking, we haven't seen any change in pricing. So anything \u2013 if anything, it's really just a simple change in the curve.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then on the CRE portfolio, you mentioned resolving all of the maturities for 2023. Can you give us a sense of how much of your book is coming due over the next one to two years, especially in office properties? And as you're resolving these loans, are you having to extend more of them than you've done in the past, or are you resolving them similar to how you would have done it over the last several years?\nJohn McCallion: Yes, sure. Jimmy, it's John again. So, just as a reminder, for 2023, just rough percentages of the resolution. About 30% was payoff or refinance. Another 60% was these contractual extensions where the borrower has to be in good financial condition. We have some pretty high level of requirements there. So those are contractual. If you meet those requirements, then you have the right. And they generally be \u2013 tend to be more floating rate nature loans, where they're just waiting to lock in fixed rates. There's less than 10% on just, I'll say, maturity extensions. Where we agree with the borrower, there's a good positive situation for us to extend, and then there's kind of a couple of points of foreclosures. In terms of 2024, about 10% of the balance comes due. In terms of maturities, the overall PBO that we have, I'd say that in terms of resolutions, probably a similar mix to what we saw in terms of percentage. And I think in terms of \u2013 we gave a little bit of magnitude this past year in terms of what we thought were at risk loans and level of charge offs. Our view in 2024 is that we'd see a similar order of magnitude on both loans at risks and level of charge offs as well.\nJimmy Bhullar: Thank you.\nOperator: Next we go to the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the PRT side. I think we've stopped seeing why the seasonality where deals know much more weighted to the fourth quarter. So just trying to get a sense of your outlook for 2024 and how we should think about the cadence of potential transactions there?\nRamy Tadros: Good morning, Elyse. It's Ramy here. I think you're right to point out that kind of the, we've seen less of that seasonality where we're seeing deals being done throughout the year. Our outlook there remains pretty positive. We continue to see a very healthy pipeline, in particular, a pipeline at the larger end of the market where we are most competitive. And all the macro indicators in terms of what DB plan sponsors are saying, in terms of the funding level, the magnitude of assets sitting in frozen defined benefit plan all kind of indicate expectations of continued kind of high level of activity in this market into 2024. So no change in terms of our view of the robustness of the pipeline and look, if you step back and look at RIS more broadly, the liability exposures are up 3% year-over-year. And most of that growth is coming from our spread and in general account business, which is actually growing at 4%, and that's coming off 2022, where we had the $8 billion PRT deal. And that growth is not just PRT. I mean, PRT was about $5.3 billion, but we're also seeing continued strength across a range of spread-based products, be they structured settlements and be they some of our products in our risk solutions business, and so on.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my second question: how should we think about dividends to parent that you guys could take in 2024, as you could look to upstream the capital that you guys are getting from the Holdings transaction?\nMichel Khalaf: Yes. Hi, Elyse, it's Michel. Thanks for the question. So we talked about the reinsurance transaction as providing us with significant financial flexibility. And as you heard from John, our RBC ratio is approximately 400%. And I would just note here that the 5.2 Holdco cash does not yet include any of the reinsurance proceeds. So the excess capital is sitting in our statutory entities and it will ultimately migrate to the Holdco. We view excess capital as fungible and we will redeploy it over time. And in the absence of attractive organic or inorganic growth opportunities as I think we've built a good track record in terms of being deliberate and expeditious, post major divestitures and how we return capital to shareholders. And as you've seen since we closed on the transaction, we've leaned into buybacks especially in January. I wouldn't sort of consider January as monthly run rate for the full year, but we're going to continue to be opportunistic here. Hope that helps.\nJohn McCallion: And I would just add Elyse, I mean, just too kind of put a finer point on just the financial flexibility and the fungibility of that, I mean, we might, because we have excess capital at the OpCo, we might think differently at the Holdco, it'll depend, right? I mean, I don't think we have to necessarily have it all at the Holdco. We have a range of 3 to 4. It might give us some ability to manage more differently within that range because we have access at the OpCos, I think we just want to, I think the flexibility is the key point.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nOperator: Next we go to the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlex Scott: Hi, good morning. First, what I have for you is just going back to the VII guide quickly. Could you frame for us how much of the lower VII guide is maybe a little more specific to first quarter VII and what you see in results that you sort of already have eyes on since it's lagged, as opposed level setting, like the ongoing expectation?\nJohn McCallion: Hey, good morning, Alex, it's John. I'd love to say that we have great insights into the, as a result of having the lag, but I'm not so sure that has proven out the way we thought it would each quarter. I think all we know is that we think, we kind of believe that it'll bump along the, kind of the bottom again before becoming a more meaningful contributor in the outer quarters. We think managers, even though the S&P jumped up in the quarter; it was kind of late in the quarter. We believe managers will be a bit cautious in their yearend remarks and maybe remain conservative before writing investments up based on some of the public market multiples. So that's kind of our base case assumption. We don't have a lot of insight yet in actual financial statements that have come through. So obviously those will come through as we move through the quarter.\nAlex Scott: Got it. Okay, that's helpful. Maybe for a second one just on what you saw around pricing in group benefits, maybe in the U.S., and LatAm, around yearend enrollment and so forth. I mean, margins are really good. Are you seeing any competition that's starting to heat up there?\nRamy Tadros: Thanks, Alex. It's Ramy here. I would say we're really off to a strong start in 2024. If you look at 2023, overall sales were up 9% year-over-year, as John mentioned. And we saw a very strong persistency in line with our expectations. And we also saw the rate actions that we were able to take also in line with our expectations across market segments. So while there is competition and it is a competitive market, when we think about pricing as well as persistency, I think all the non price factors of differentiations that we've talked about in the past are playing into our favor here. And we've been able to hold margins and as you've seen, we've expanded the margin outlook. One, [ph] I can give you a bit of a flavor on that. We're still in the midst of it, but initial indications in terms of our sales growth are in the 5% to 10% again year-over-year with really solid growth across the product portfolio, across both core and voluntary. So these are really good indicators for us both in terms of volume and margin as we look into 2024.\nAlex Scott: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one last question from John Barnidge with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nJohn Barnidge: Good morning. Thank you very much for the opportunity. Maybe sticking with group benefits. Can you maybe talk about growth in employee counts among your corporate partners, whether it's larger and the small or the jumbo in maybe a viewpoint of one-one renewals with that. Thank you.\nMichel Khalaf: Yes. Hey, John, I don't have that number handy. Specifically in terms of employee count. The best thing you could look at for an indicator for that is just overall employment levels because we have a very diversified book up and down market. It's highly diversified by industry. So you could think of us as reflecting the broader economy in terms of our employee count. But the one that I would look at more closely is, and this is where we see a lot of white space with respect to employee counts, is the penetration rate in the workspace. We still see plenty of opportunity to drive penetration of our own products, be they voluntary or employee paid. And that's through the deployment of the right technology, the right tools, the right engagement capabilities. And that's really what's been fueling our voluntary growth over the past few years. And that's where we see continued future growth opportunities.\nJohn Barnidge: Thank you for that. My follow up question you talked about the frequency of asbestos claims hasn't declined as expected. Can you maybe talk about that versus what the assumption was? Thank you.\nJohn McCallion: Yes. Hey, good morning, John. It's John. So, as we said, this is something that we look at each third or fourth quarter where we conduct our experience study. This is an exposure where there is a declining claim count, but what hasn't declined as expected or as fast as expected is some of the severe claims. So the larger claims, and that's really what we trued up this quarter. Again, it's kind of a runoff claim count exposure. We've been seeing that for some time. But in the last 12 months, we just saw a slightly different trend that we needed to adjust for. I mean the overall reserves just above 350 million.\nJohn Barnidge: Thank you very much.\nOperator: And I'll now turn the conference back to John hall for closing remarks.\nJohn Hall: Great. Thank you, Operator. And thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Michel Khalaf",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As we begin 2023, I shared our conviction that despite the uncertain times, MetLife would exit the year stronger than we entered it. We accomplished this by countering the challenging environment with the actions we've taken to focus, simplify, and differentiate our business. We maintained an accelerated momentum in MetLife's diversified set of market-leading businesses, driving strong results for the year and the quarter. And we illustrated our financial strength and flexibility with sound transactions and well-timed capital management, ending the year with solid capital ratios and robust cash on hand. Clearly, our all-weather strategy stood up again in 2023. We remain steadfastly focused on what matters most in delivering for our customers and shareholders. In 2023, we exited a pandemic and have yet to enter a widely expected U.S. recession. We managed through a bank liquidity crisis and the resulting credit concerns. And we adapted to an inverted yield curve that has persisted longer than any in history. Against this backdrop, the fundamentals of our businesses are as strong as I have ever seen. Our successful 2023 is a testament to the resilience and durability of our business model, a relentless focus on execution, concentrating on the factors we control, our risk management culture and processes, the discipline we apply to managing our assets and liabilities, and the prudence of our investment portfolio. On that last point, the strength and stability of our commercial real estate portfolio, which we detailed a year ago, has borne out, as we said, a modest increase in LTVs and stable debt service coverage ratios, and we expect that to remain true in 2024. For the year, we delivered an adjusted return on equity, excluding notable items, of 13.8%, achieving our target for this all-important metric. We were unwavering in our expense discipline, employing efficiency and agility to post a full year direct expense ratio of 12.2%. We upheld our commitment to responsible growth, directing capital to its highest and best use, with high teen IRRs and mid single-digit payback periods on new business. We returned $4.7 billion to shareholders via common stock dividends and share repurchases, and we continued to generate strong, recurring free cash flow and remain financially flexible with significant liquidity at our holding companies. The resilience of our strategy and the clarity of our purpose remain powerful drivers of MetLife's success. Our diversified portfolio of market-leading businesses is well positioned to perform for years to come. Backed by a strong balance sheet and our demonstrated ability to generate cash flow, I am confident in MetLife's ability to create value for shareholders and other stakeholders, and to deliver financial security to our customers as we have for over a century and a half. Now turning to our fourth quarter 2023 results, last night we reported quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion, or $1.83 per share. Excluding notable items, we reported $1.93 per share, up 21% compared to $1.59 per share a year ago. Again, this quarter, our businesses showed strong underlying momentum with excellent underwriting results. Also, our recurring investment income grew on higher balances and higher new money rates. Shifting to the full year 2023, the differentiation and scale across our market-leading businesses were among the factors that helped to fuel our underlying business fundamentals. We generated adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, of $5.6 billion. On the strength of new money yields, our adjusted net investment income grew 9% year-over-year to almost $20 billion, despite variable investment income falling below expectations. Adjusted PFOs, excluding pension risk transfers climbed 6%, with healthy growth across most business segments. Group Benefits posted adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, of $1.6 billion, up 22% from the prior year. The scale and breadth of this franchise business continues to drive organic growth and represents a clear point of competitive advantage. Sales gained 9%, while adjusted PFOs, excluding the impact of participating policies, rose roughly at 5%. We believe group PFO growth is sustainable at more than $1 billion per year. Higher interest rates serve as a tailwind to our leading Retirement and Income Solutions business, with new money yields exceeding roll-off rates for the past seven consecutive quarters. Volume growth in RIS away from PRT was very strong, with more than $5 billion of longevity, reinsurance sales and more than $3 billion of structured settlements. Pension risk transfers totaled $5.3 billion for the year, the third largest annual total in MetLife's history. This followed an all-time record year in 2022, and we have a strong pipeline of new opportunities in 2024 and beyond. Sales growth in Asia remained strong, propelled by market demand in Japan for FX denominated life insurance products and a new cash value life product in Korea. Finally, Latin America continues to be a growing and important region for MetLife. Adjusted earnings on a reported basis in 2023 grew 15% over the prior year, and we've expanded our distribution capabilities as well as our product portfolio. One of the ways we hold ourselves accountable is against the Next Horizon commitments we made in 2019. On that basis, we are ahead of schedule to meet all criteria. In fact, we have even moved the goalpost on ourselves and raised the bar on certain of our Next Horizon commitments. For instance, we initially committed to an adjusted return on equity of 12% to 14%, and last year we chose to push that target even higher, to 13% to 15%. And as you've seen within our outlook disclosure, we've further tightened our expense ratio target from 12.6% to 12.3%. While we have the strongest conviction in our Next Horizon strategy, we do not view it as a ceiling on our aspirations. We constantly look to set higher standards and position MetLife for even greater success. When I spoke of emerging from 2023 stronger our capital and cash is another prime example. During a year marked by periods of financial and geopolitical turmoil, our balance sheet strength enabled us to repurchase $3.1 billion of our common stock and increase our common stock dividend per share, paying out roughly $1.6 billion in common stock dividends. Even still, we enter 2024 with robust levels of cash and higher capital ratios in our key markets. Our capital management has carried into 2024, and we have repurchased roughly $0.5 billion of MET common shares in the month of January. We continue to have capacity for further action with approximately $1.6 billion remaining on our repurchase authorization. There is no doubt MetLife's financial strength and financial flexibility was on full view during 2023, particularly with the execution of our $19 billion risk transfer transaction that closed in November. This will free up more than $3 billion of capital over time and illustrates the disciplined approach we apply to evaluating our portfolio of businesses. We ended the year with $5.2 billion of cash and liquid assets on our balance sheet, which is comfortably above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. We have consistently said that when responsible growth is attractive and available, we will deploy capital organically or inorganically. If not, we will return capital to our shareholders. I am pleased our Next Horizon strategy continues to prove its metal amid uncertainty. Looking ahead, whether driven by Fed policy and changes to the yield curve, geopolitical events, or the unfolding U.S. election cycle, it is prudent to anticipate more uncertainty in 2024. The supplemental slides we published last night include some near-term targets and elements of guidance. It should be playing to see that we anticipate the underlying momentum building across our businesses to continue. This is evident in our flagship Group Benefits business, where off a large embedded base we've established a strong growth outlook for premiums, fees and other revenues. And of further note, we've also increased our expectations for both group life and non-medical health margins. Importantly, the outlook that we've provided reflects the world as we see it, not as we wish it to be. In that context, we assume a more modest private equity return of high-single digits in the near term, down from the 12% assumption we have used in prior years. Private equity remains an important contributor to our well-tested asset-liability matching program. It is an asset class well suited to defeat long-term liabilities, and our historical track record has been very strong. In closing, when we launched our Next Horizon strategy in 2019, we could not have predicted the many challenges we would face in the markets where we operate. But our unyielding execution against our strategy is serving us and our many stakeholders well, allowing us to positively impact our customers and live our purpose. Our 2023 results reflect our capacity to move ahead with urgency and deliver on our strategy. We saw very good underlying business performance supported by a strong capital base. We will continue to concentrate on controlling what we can control, balance sheet security, responsible growth, expense efficiency and capital deployment among others. In the final year of the Next Horizon strategy time frame, we believe our past progress positions us to reach for new heights not possible four years ago. I am energized for the future of MetLife driven by the continued momentum I see building in our businesses for 2024 and beyond. Now I'll turn it over to John to cover our performance and outlook in detail. Yes, I think when we announced the deal, we thought this would give us 50 points to 60 points. We still think it will. There's a little bit of what happens immediately and then how things trend in over time. Also, there's a lot of other things going on, fungibility, growth. We had some very sizable growth in RAS. So, we deployed some extra capital this year. So, I think a lot of those things. But in terms of the deal economics that we outlined at time of signing, everything came in as expected. Yes. Hi, Elyse, it's Michel. Thanks for the question. So we talked about the reinsurance transaction as providing us with significant financial flexibility. And as you heard from John, our RBC ratio is approximately 400%. And I would just note here that the 5.2 Holdco cash does not yet include any of the reinsurance proceeds. So the excess capital is sitting in our statutory entities and it will ultimately migrate to the Holdco. We view excess capital as fungible and we will redeploy it over time. And in the absence of attractive organic or inorganic growth opportunities as I think we've built a good track record in terms of being deliberate and expeditious, post major divestitures and how we return capital to shareholders. And as you've seen since we closed on the transaction, we've leaned into buybacks especially in January. I wouldn't sort of consider January as monthly run rate for the full year, but we're going to continue to be opportunistic here. Hope that helps. Yes. Hey, John, I don't have that number handy. Specifically in terms of employee count. The best thing you could look at for an indicator for that is just overall employment levels because we have a very diversified book up and down market. It's highly diversified by industry. So you could think of us as reflecting the broader economy in terms of our employee count. But the one that I would look at more closely is, and this is where we see a lot of white space with respect to employee counts, is the penetration rate in the workspace. We still see plenty of opportunity to drive penetration of our own products, be they voluntary or employee paid. And that's through the deployment of the right technology, the right tools, the right engagement capabilities. And that's really what's been fueling our voluntary growth over the past few years. And that's where we see continued future growth opportunities."

            "name": "Ramy Tadros",
            "content": "Good morning, Tom. It's Ramy here. And I would say at the highest level in terms of our near-term outlook here is, this is driven by the changing business mix, both in terms of the customer segments that we serve as well as the products that we offer. So from a customer perspective, we've executed well on our strategy to target higher growth in regional markets. We're seeing the benefits of that. In terms of growth, regional markets has grown two to three percentage points higher than the overall average, and we see a clear path for that growth to continue. And regional market is a segment that does carry a lower loss ratio across both the life underwriting ratio and non-medical health. And we're also seeing a shift from a product perspective. We've executed well on our employee paid strategy in general, and voluntary strategy in particular and in voluntary we've seen double-digit growth over many years and we expect that to persist in the future given customer needs and the opportunity to drive penetration in the workplace. And the loss ratio here tends to be also more favorable to the overall portfolio. So between that customer segment and that product view, if you think about this over time, we feel kind of a shift to the outlook is warranted. Let me tell you what it's not been driven by. On the Life ratio, this quarter was very favorable and it's really driven, as John pointed out, to the population mortality experience. So this is not one quarter makes a trend, this is one quarter here that was favorable. And we do expect the Q1 numbers to tick up given the seasonality of Life claims. And then on the disability side, our outlook in terms of the ratios does include an expectation that the profitability of our disability line of business will moderate over time. But that is outweighed by the other factors that I've just mentioned. And back to Q1 as well, there \u2013 just remember, there's also seasonality in that ratio in Q1 given the seasonality of the dental business. So net-net, think about it as business mix, customer and product mix. That's really driving this shift downwards in the ranges. Good morning, Elyse. It's Ramy here. I think you're right to point out that kind of the, we've seen less of that seasonality where we're seeing deals being done throughout the year. Our outlook there remains pretty positive. We continue to see a very healthy pipeline, in particular, a pipeline at the larger end of the market where we are most competitive. And all the macro indicators in terms of what DB plan sponsors are saying, in terms of the funding level, the magnitude of assets sitting in frozen defined benefit plan all kind of indicate expectations of continued kind of high level of activity in this market into 2024. So no change in terms of our view of the robustness of the pipeline and look, if you step back and look at RIS more broadly, the liability exposures are up 3% year-over-year. And most of that growth is coming from our spread and in general account business, which is actually growing at 4%, and that's coming off 2022, where we had the $8 billion PRT deal. And that growth is not just PRT. I mean, PRT was about $5.3 billion, but we're also seeing continued strength across a range of spread-based products, be they structured settlements and be they some of our products in our risk solutions business, and so on. Thanks, Alex. It's Ramy here. I would say we're really off to a strong start in 2024. If you look at 2023, overall sales were up 9% year-over-year, as John mentioned. And we saw a very strong persistency in line with our expectations. And we also saw the rate actions that we were able to take also in line with our expectations across market segments. So while there is competition and it is a competitive market, when we think about pricing as well as persistency, I think all the non price factors of differentiations that we've talked about in the past are playing into our favor here. And we've been able to hold margins and as you've seen, we've expanded the margin outlook. One, [ph] I can give you a bit of a flavor on that. We're still in the midst of it, but initial indications in terms of our sales growth are in the 5% to 10% again year-over-year with really solid growth across the product portfolio, across both core and voluntary. So these are really good indicators for us both in terms of volume and margin as we look into 2024."

            "name": "John McCallion",
            "content": "Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 4Q 2023 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, an update of our liquidity and capital positions as well as our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. In addition, I will discuss our near-term outlook in more detail. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year 2023. Market risk benefit or MRB remeasurement losses in the fourth quarter was due to the decline in long-term interest rates. Net derivative gains were only a partial offset as the favorable impact from lower long-term interest rates were mitigated by changes in short-term interest rates and higher equity markets in the quarter. For the full year, the variance between net income and adjusted earnings was mostly attributable to net derivative losses, primarily due to stronger equity markets, changes in foreign currencies and higher interest rates in 2023. In addition, net investment losses were largely the result of normal trading activity on the portfolio in a rising interest rate environment as well as the mark-to-market impact on securities that were transferred as part of the reinsurance transaction with Global Atlantic. Overall, the portfolio remains well positioned with modest levels of credit losses and the hedging program continues to perform as expected. On Page 4, you can see the fourth quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding $76 million after tax, of an unfavorable notable item relating to asbestos litigation reserves in 4Q of 2023 that was accounted for in corporate and other. There were no notable items in the prior year quarter. Regarding the asbestos reserve increase of $76 million, based on our latest review, while we continue to observe a declining claim count, the frequency of severe claims related to asbestos has not declined as expected. The total reserve is $364 million at the end of 2023. Adjusted earnings, excluding total notable items were $1.4 billion, up 14% and 12% on a constant currency basis. The primary drivers were strong recurring interest margins, higher variable investment income, or VII, volume growth and favorable underwriting margins. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding total notable items were $1.93, up 21% and 19% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were $466 million, up 19% versus the prior year period. The key drivers were favorable life underwriting margins and solid volume growth. The Group Life mortality ratio was 83.5%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 87.3% and below the bottom end of our 2023 target range of 85% to 90%. Consistent with CDC U.S. mortality data, we saw a much lower number of life claims than typical in the fourth quarter. Regarding non-medical health, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 70.7% in the quarter, and at the low end of its annual target range of 70% to 75%. We expect both the life mortality ratio and the non-medical health ratio to be higher in Q1 given the seasonality of the business. Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs on a full year basis were up 3% year-over-year. Taking participating contracts into account, which dampened growth by roughly 200 basis points. The underlying PFOs were up approximately 5% year-over-year within our 2023 target growth range of 4% to 6%. In addition, Group Benefits 2023 sales were up 9% year-over-year. The continued strong growth is primarily due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. RIS adjusted earnings were $421 million, up 10% year-over-year. The primary drivers were favorable investment margins due to higher recurring interest and variable investment income as well as favorable underwriting margins. RIS investment spreads were 121 basis points. Spreads, excluding VII were 134 basis points, up 10 points versus Q4 of 2022, primarily due to higher interest rates as well as income from in-the-money interest rate caps. RIS adjusted PFOs, excluding pension risk transfers were up 75% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong sales of structured settlement products and post-retirement benefits as well as growth in UK longevity reinsurance. With regards to PRT, we added transactions worth approximately $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year total to roughly $5.3 billion. This marks the third highest PRT sales year for MetLife, and we continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were $296 million, up 12% and 11% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher investment margins and lower taxes. For Asia's key growth metrics, general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis were up 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were essentially flat versus the prior year quarter. For the full year, Asia's sales were up 13%, driven by strong growth across the region, exceeding its 2023 guidance range of mid to high-single digits. Latin America adjusted earnings were $207 million, up 13% and 4% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to solid volume growth partially offset by less favorable underwriting margins versus a strong Q4 2022. In addition, LatAm had favorable Chilean encaje returns of 7.9% in 4Q of 2023 versus 6.1% in the prior year quarter. Latin America's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 29% and 19% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong sales and solid persistency across the region. For the full year, adjusted PFOs were also up 29% on a reported basis and 19% on a constant currency basis, exceeding LatAm's 2023 guidance of low-double digit growth. EMEA adjusted earnings were $47 million, down 27% on both a reported and constant currency basis, primarily driven by an unfavorable tax charge following a favorable tax benefit in the prior year period, as well as less favorable expense and underwriting margins. This was partially offset by higher recurring interest margins year-over-year. EMEA full year 2023 adjusted earnings of $265 million exceeded our outlook expectations of roughly $55 million per quarter. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 5% on both a reported and constant currency basis and sales were up 18% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong growth across the region. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $156 million, down 15%, largely driven by foregone earnings as a result of the reinsurance transaction that closed in November. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $156 million, excluding the unfavorable notable item of $76 million after-tax that I referenced earlier. This compares to an adjusted loss of $210 million in the prior year. Higher net investment income and favorable taxes were the primary drivers. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 19%, which includes favorable tax benefits primarily related to the true up of the federal tax return to provision. On Page 5, this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the four quarters and full year of 2023. VII was $63 million in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by positive returns in our corporate and mortgage loan funds. The private equity portfolio and real estate equity funds had a combined return of essentially zero in the quarter. For the full year, VII was $419 million, well below our 2023 target of approximately $2 billion. That said, while mark-to-market returns were below expectation in 2023, the PE portfolio generated approximately $2 billion in cash distributions during the year. On Page 6, we provide VII post tax by segment for the prior four quarters and full year 2023. As reflected in the chart, RIS, Asia and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest proportion of VII assets, given their long dated liability profile. Now, turning to Page 7, the chart on the left of the page shows the split of our net investment income between recurring and VII for the past three years, as well as Q4 of 2022 versus Q4 of 2023. While VII has had lower than trend returns over the last couple of years, recurring income, which accounted for most of the net investment income in 2023 was up approximately $2.6 billion year-over-year, reflecting higher interest rates and growth in asset balances. The expansion of recurring income in 2023 more than offset the lower VII year-over-year. Shifting your attention to the right of the page, which shows our new money yield versus roll-off yield since 4Q of 2020, new money yields continue to outpace roll-off yields over the past couple of years, consistent with rising rates. In this quarter, our global new money yield continued its upward trajectory coming in at 6.67%, 142 basis points higher than the roll-off yield. Turning to Page 8. I'll provide a few updates on our commercial mortgage loans. Overall, the CML portfolio continues to perform consistent with expectations, where we expect higher quality assets to outperform the asset sector broadly. The average LTV on our CML portfolio now stands at 64% as of December 31, up slightly from 63% in the third quarter of 2023, and the average debt service coverage ratio remains steady at 2.3 times. The modest increase in LTVs and stable debt service coverage ratio are further indicators of the disciplined approach we take to investing in this asset class. The quality of our CML portfolio remains strong with only 2.6% of loans having LTVs more than 80% and DSCRs less than one times. With regards to CML loan maturities, we resolved 100% of the loans that were scheduled to mature in 2023. Our expectation going forward remains for modest credit losses on the portfolio. Turning to Page 9. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior eight quarters and full year 2022 and 2023. Our direct expense ratio in 4Q of 2023 was up modestly at 12.4%, reflecting the impact from seasonal enrollment costs in group benefits as well as higher employee related costs. That said, as we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. For the full year of 2023, our direct expense ratio was 12.2% below our 2023 target of 12.6%. We believe this result once again demonstrates our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset in a challenging inflationary environment, while continuing to make investments in our businesses. I will now discuss our cash and capital positions on Page 10. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.2 billion at December 31, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of roughly $900 million in the fourth quarter, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, we repurchased shares totaling approximately $500 million in January. For the two-year period 2022 and 2023, our average free cash flow ratio, excluding notable items totaled 74% and was within our 65% to 75% target range. In terms of statutory capital, for our U.S. companies, our combined 2023 NAIC, RBC ratio is still preliminary but expected to be approximately 400% and above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, preliminary 2023 statutory operating earnings were approximately $4.5 billion, while net income was approximately $3.9 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by approximately $1.9 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable underwriting and impacts from the reinsurance transaction. This was partially offset by higher expenses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $19.5 billion as of December 31, 2023, up 10% for September 30, 2023, primarily due to operating earnings and the impacts of the reinsurance transaction. This was partially offset by dividends paid. Finally, we expect that Japan solvency margin ratio to be approximately 720% as of December 31, which will be based on statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks. Before I shift to our near-term outlook starting on Page 12, a few points on what we included in the appendix. The chart on Page 17 reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments from 2018 through 2022. This is the same chart that we showed as part of our 3Q 2023 supplemental slides, but we feel it's worth including again for the sake of completeness. Also, pages 18 through 21 provide interest rate assumptions and key outlook sensitivities by line of business. Now let's turn to Page 12 for further details on our near-term outlook. Starting with the overview. We expect continued uncertainty to persist around inflation and unemployment in 2024. We expect the U.S. dollar to stabilize around current levels. Based on the 12/31/2023 forward curve, we assume long-term interest rates to be largely unchanged in 2024, and the yield curve will move from inverted to modestly upward sloping as short-term interest rates decline and we assume a 5% annual return for the S&P 500. For our near-term targets, we are maintaining our adjusted ROE range of 13% to 15%. We expect to maintain our two-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75% of adjusted earnings. Also, given continued focus on expense discipline, building capacity to reinvest in growth initiatives, and our overall efficiency mindset, we are lowering our direct expense ratio guidance for 2024 from 12.6% to 12.3%. Specifically, for 2024, VII expected to be approximately $1.5 billion. Our corporate and other adjusted loss target is expected to be $750 million to $850 million after tax in 2024. This represents an approximately $100 million increase from our prior adjusted loss guidance of $650 million to $750 million in 2023. The higher range reflects C&O's current run rate given the impact of a higher rate environment on interest expense and pension costs, as well as the impact of lower expected benefits from VII. We are increasing our expected effective tax rate range by two points to 24% to 26% to reflect our expectation for higher earnings in foreign markets with higher tax rates and lower tax credits in the U.S. At the bottom of the page, you will see certain interest rate sensitivities relative to our base case, reflecting a relatively modest impact on adjusted earnings over the near-term. On Page 13, the chart reflects our VII average asset balances from $18 billion in 2022 to $19.7 billion expected in 2024. Private equity investments will continue to represent the vast majority of our VII asset balances. We are reducing our near-term expected annual returns for private equity to be between 7% to 10% and we are also lowering our expected returns for real estate and other funds to be in the range of 5% to 7% over the near-term. We expect PE and real estate returns will remain pressured in the first quarter of 2024 before trending higher. Finally, as a reminder, we include prepayment fees on fixed maturities and mortgage loans in VII. So now, I will discuss our near-term outlook for our business segments. Let's start with the U.S. on Page 14. For group benefits, excluding the excess premium from participating group life contracts of approximately $300 million in 2023, adjusted PFOs are expected to grow at 4% to 6% annually over the near-term. And for 2024 we expect growth to be in the top half of that range. This reflects the strong momentum in the business, particularly in voluntary products, as well as exceptionally strong persistency in our national accounts. Regarding underwriting, we expect 2024 underwriting margins to be generally consistent with 2023. As such, we are reducing our near-term group life mortality ratio and non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio ranges by 1 percentage point to 84% to 89% and 69% to 74%, respectively. Finally, keep in mind these are annual ratios and both typically skew to the higher end of the ranges in the first quarter given the seasonality of the business. For RAS, we are maintaining our 2% to 4% expected annual growth for total liability exposures across our general account spread and fee-based businesses. Regarding investment spread, full year 2023 was 125 basis points and is expected to be relatively flat for the full year of 2024. This incorporates both the impact of the roll off of our interest rate caps with maturities throughout 2024 and the offsetting benefit of VII re-emerging over the year as a more meaningful contributor. As such, we expect the investment spread range for 2024 is 115 to 140 basis points. We have also provided updated RAS sensitivities for interest rate movements in the appendix. Sensitivities reflect the anticipated impact from interest rate cap maturities throughout 2024. As such, our sensitivity to SOFR declines throughout the year. For MetLife Holdings, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to decline by approximately 13% to 15% in 2024 and then declining 4% to 6% annually thereafter. And we are lowering the adjusted earnings guidance range to $700 million to $900 million in 2024 to reflect the foregone earnings from the reinsurance transaction as well as lower expected PE returns and natural runoff of the business. Now, let's look at the near-term guidance of our businesses outside the U.S. on Page 15. For Asia, we expect the recent sales momentum to continue and generate mid-single digit growth over the near-term. In addition, we expect general account AUM to maintain mid-single digit growth. We are expecting adjusted earnings to grow roughly 20% in 2024 as we assume VII to have a greater impact throughout the year. We are maintaining mid-single digit adjusted earnings growth expectation over the remainder of the near-term. For Latin America, we expect both adjusted PFOs and adjusted earnings to grow by high single digits over the near-term. Finally, for EMEA, we're expecting sales to grow mid- to high-single digits and adjusted PFOs to grow mid-single digits over the near-term. The forward curve assumes a strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in EMEA. As such, we project EMEA's adjusted earnings run rate to be roughly $60 million to $65 million per quarter in 2024 and then grow by mid-single digits in 2025 and 2026 based on the forward curve for these currencies. Let me conclude by saying that MetLife delivered a solid quarter to close out another strong year. The underlying strength of our business fundamentals remains on display with strong top line growth coupled with disciplined underwriting and expense management. While VII remains below historical returns, core spreads remain robust and continue to benefit from the higher yield environment. While the current environment remains uncertain, we are excited about the outlook and growth prospects for our businesses over the near-term and beyond. MetLife continues to move forward from a position of strength with a strong balance sheet, recurring free cash flow generation and a diversified set of our market leading businesses. And we are committed to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth and build sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Good morning, Ryan, it's John. I think we wouldn't debate your model calculations there. I think it's fair to say that we certainly are trending to the high end of that range, if not with a plus sign. But we just moved it a year ago and I think we'll take a year here and take stock at that time. But I'd say \u2013 I think just maybe just to help you with that. One other thing is, like I said, we'll take stock. We think over time, and we've been talking about this, that there has been kind of \u2013 as a result of higher rates, there has been a shift in volume and returns on our business. So it wouldn't preclude us from doing it again. I think we want to take some time to take stock. Hey, Suneet, it's John. It's a good question. I mean, sometimes, NII, it's a helpful metric, certainly from, I'd say mix and just to show that higher rates have more than offset or actually offset some of the depression and VII. And I think the point of that slide is to show that there's more power there once things kind of re emerge on the VII front. Sometimes it's a little hard with just translating NII to earnings. So, we're a little cautious on necessarily given a target around that because, we have different products that perform well in different environments and ultimately to spread. So I think we're a little hesitant to kind of forecast for you. I think the point of that slide was to indicate that it shows the growth in our business. It shows that we're well diversified. We can perform well in a variety of economic environments. And I think that's really probably the theme to take away. So sorry, I didn't get to maybe your exact question or answer, but that's probably the best I can do. Yes, it's a great question. I think what you just said at the end around in terms of them being a wash is a pretty good way of thinking about it. So, we had 125 basis points last year, all-in for 2023. We gave a range of 115 basis points to 140 basis points for next year. I think the midpoint is a little above. It's at 127 basis points, I guess if you did the math. And our view is the interest rate caps will roll off throughout the year and then VII will emerge throughout the year and essentially offset the decline there. And so we think the best way to think about the spreads for the year is relatively flat to what you saw for the full year of 2023. It will give and take here and there. As we point out on the slide, we think VII in the first quarter will continue to be pressured. Obviously, the caps haven't fully rolled off yet, so we'll still have income from them. And then as VII merges, you'll see the caps roll off and they'll essentially offset. Hey good morning, Tom, it's John. I think the last point you made around you can't do this overnight is an important piece, but I think direction of travel, that's probably fair point. And I think we've talked about the fact that we are in a different rate environment. So the relative value of investments are probably different than where they were when it was lower for longer. We pride ourselves in diversification. So it's not that we would make an abrupt shift, but we do believe that making some tweaks to allocations is appropriate in different environments. And I think what you're referencing is one that we would lean towards. It's an asset class where you have prior commitments and those \u2013 then get deployed judiciously. And actually there's probably some really good opportunities right now that we're leveraging. Having said that, we think distributions will likely outpace new contributions just given our revised level of new commitments. And I think over time you would see a moderate shift in allocation in that asset class versus others. Good morning, Jimmy. It's John. The simple answer just sequentially for us is the lower rates late in the quarter caused a bit of compression on the spread number. Just how \u2013 we had the caps were in the money and lower rates were \u2013 came in. So it was different than the forward curve at the time of the third quarter when we gave the 135 to 140 range came in at 134 xviii. So that's the main driver. It's not pricing. Pricing has actually been pretty healthy, relatively speaking, we haven't seen any change in pricing. So anything \u2013 if anything, it's really just a simple change in the curve. Yes, sure. Jimmy, it's John again. So, just as a reminder, for 2023, just rough percentages of the resolution. About 30% was payoff or refinance. Another 60% was these contractual extensions where the borrower has to be in good financial condition. We have some pretty high level of requirements there. So those are contractual. If you meet those requirements, then you have the right. And they generally be \u2013 tend to be more floating rate nature loans, where they're just waiting to lock in fixed rates. There's less than 10% on just, I'll say, maturity extensions. Where we agree with the borrower, there's a good positive situation for us to extend, and then there's kind of a couple of points of foreclosures. In terms of 2024, about 10% of the balance comes due. In terms of maturities, the overall PBO that we have, I'd say that in terms of resolutions, probably a similar mix to what we saw in terms of percentage. And I think in terms of \u2013 we gave a little bit of magnitude this past year in terms of what we thought were at risk loans and level of charge offs. Our view in 2024 is that we'd see a similar order of magnitude on both loans at risks and level of charge offs as well. And I would just add Elyse, I mean, just too kind of put a finer point on just the financial flexibility and the fungibility of that, I mean, we might, because we have excess capital at the OpCo, we might think differently at the Holdco, it'll depend, right? I mean, I don't think we have to necessarily have it all at the Holdco. We have a range of 3 to 4. It might give us some ability to manage more differently within that range because we have access at the OpCos, I think we just want to, I think the flexibility is the key point. Hey, good morning, Alex, it's John. I'd love to say that we have great insights into the, as a result of having the lag, but I'm not so sure that has proven out the way we thought it would each quarter. I think all we know is that we think, we kind of believe that it'll bump along the, kind of the bottom again before becoming a more meaningful contributor in the outer quarters. We think managers, even though the S&P jumped up in the quarter; it was kind of late in the quarter. We believe managers will be a bit cautious in their yearend remarks and maybe remain conservative before writing investments up based on some of the public market multiples. So that's kind of our base case assumption. We don't have a lot of insight yet in actual financial statements that have come through. So obviously those will come through as we move through the quarter. Yes. Hey, good morning, John. It's John. So, as we said, this is something that we look at each third or fourth quarter where we conduct our experience study. This is an exposure where there is a declining claim count, but what hasn't declined as expected or as fast as expected is some of the severe claims. So the larger claims, and that's really what we trued up this quarter. Again, it's kind of a runoff claim count exposure. We've been seeing that for some time. But in the last 12 months, we just saw a slightly different trend that we needed to adjust for. I mean the overall reserves just above 350 million."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will now turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.\nJohn Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife's third quarter 2023 earnings call. Before we begin, I\u2019d point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management. Also last night, we released a set of supplemental slides which addressed the quarter. The slides are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to them in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. An appendix to these slides features GAAP reconciliations and other information which you should similarly review. As usual, after prepared remarks, we will host a Q&A session. We will end Q&A just prior to the top of the hour. In fairness to everyone, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michel.\nMichel Khalaf: Thank you, John and good morning, everyone. As you can see from the report we posted last night, MetLife delivered another quarter of strong underlying results with sustained business momentum. MetLife's capacity to perform across a wide range of economic scenarios, there's a testament to the resilience of our all-weather strategy and is characterized by our unyielding focus on execution. And concentrating on those elements within our control, such as balance sheet security, investment performance, reserve adequacy, responsible growth, expense efficiency and capital deployment to name just a few, we have positioned MetLife to generate significant value for our shareholders and other stakeholders for many years to come. Turning to the quarter. We reported adjusted earnings of $1.5 billion or $1.97 per share. Notable items in the quarter included our annual actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments, which had a positive impact of only $14 million or $0.02 per share on adjusted earnings. Excluding notable items, adjusted earnings per share were $1.95, up 43% from a year ago. As we previously indicated Variable investment income of $179 million fell below our quarterly outlook expectation. Private equity returns totaled 1.4%, while real estate equity risk trailed at minus 3%. In the aggregate, net income for the third quarter was $422 million compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year period. The third quarter result reflects the negative impact of certain required accounting adjustments associated with our previously announced reinsurance transaction. Net derivative losses related to interest rate and foreign exchange hedges helped to protect our balance sheet further reduce net income. Our investment portfolio has stayed up in quality and continues to perform well. Underscoring that quality, the credit metrics associated with our real estate portfolio remain largely unchanged sequentially and we did not incur material credit losses during the third quarter. Moving to MetLife's business performance in the quarter. I will start with our US Group Benefits results. Adjusted earnings excluding notable items totaled $483 million an all-time high and up 16% from a year ago. Underwriting results in the quarter for both Group Life and Non-Medical Health were outstanding. Year-to-date sales are up 11% while adjusted PFOs are up more than 4% in the quarter reflecting the impact of our contracts and within our 4% to 6% outlook range which we expect to achieve for the full year. In Group Benefits, we have invested significantly to integrate with the employer benefits ecosystem and enhance our enrollment capabilities and perhaps more important our reenrollment capabilities. With a significant portion of our overall sales and group benefits coming from employee paid products, our efforts to enhance enrollment and take-up rates are critical. Speaking of enrollment we are about to enter open enrollment season. This is an important opportunity to review our employee benefit needs and refresh selections for the upcoming year something I encourage all of you to do. Several of the investments that I referenced aim to make this process easier for participants. Further, we are activating emerging technologies that will help accelerate some of our group benefits initiatives particularly around underwriting claims and the customer experience. We believe the impact of these investments will enable us over time to further leverage our size to drive greater scale advantage. Looking to Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS adjusted earnings excluding notable items totaled $409 million up 60% from the prior year driven by higher recurring interest margins, better variable investment income and higher asset bases. Sales in the quarter were very strong across a range of products including pension risk transfer with roughly $1.5 billion booked as well as structured settlements and UK longevity reinsurance. We are poised to generate close to $3 billion or more of sales in each of these two high-return product categories for the full year.  Just after the close of the third quarter we released our 2023 pension risk transfer poll an example of our thought leadership in the space which we have been publishing for the past eight years. The poll which serve plan sponsors with derisking goals revealed several important observations relevant to the growth prospect for the PRT market. Let me offer some examples. Following record PRT sales in 2022, market activity is expected to remain strong for the foreseeable future. Among companies who plan to derisk nine of 10 companies plan to completely divest all their defined benefit pension plan liabilities. And finally, 85% of plan sponsors expressed concern over missing an attractive window to secure an annuity buyout at competitive rates. These findings confirm what I have said before we should continue to see a strong pipeline for our pension risk transfer business. Now shifting over to Asia. Adjusted earnings excluding notable items of $369 million were 23% above a year ago on better variable investment income. Sales in the region on a constant currency basis were up 5% led by life insurance in Japan and Korea. For Latin America, adjusted earnings excluding notable items totaled $199 million. Further Latin America posted healthy 16% gains in both sales and adjusted PFOs on a constant currency basis. Our digital initiatives don't stop at the U.S. border they extend around the world for instance in Latin America we launched a digital platform that seamlessly integrates insurance solutions into the customer journeys of our LatAm business partners, such as banks, financial institutions, retailers and others, which we expect will lead to even more responsible growth in the region over time. Expanding on the subject of responsible growth. In the third quarter, we released our Value of New Business, or VNB statistics for the full year 2022. And the results are powerful. To summarize, MetLife's deployed roughly $3.7 billion of capital to support the origination of new business in 2022. This capital was put to work at an average internal rate of return of 17% with an expected payback period of approximately six years. The value of new business generated in 2022 is around $2.3 billion which represents the net present value of distributable cash flows in excess of the hurdle rate. When we reference terms of MetLife like responsible growth and disciplined capital deployment their application in our business is grounded in the systematic use of VNB. It is hard to overestimate the positive impact this analytical tool has had in managing our business starting with the deeply embedded practice of using IRRs and product pricing and ending with the establishment of business unit level VNB goals and targets. Simply put VNB guides our effort to target and prioritize capital efficient and shorter payback business and measure our progress and success in doing so. Over time, we've sought to maintain the right balance of capital deployment across organic growth acquisitions and share repurchase to drive value for shareholders. While we bought back $11.1 billion of our shares and executed $2 billion of acquisitions from 2019 to 2022. We similarly deployed $13.5 billion to support responsible growth over the same period. Moving to quarterly capital and cash MetLife remained active with capital management during the third quarter. We paid about $400 million of common stock dividends to shareholders and we repurchased nearly $800 million of our common stock. In addition to our activity in the third quarter, we repurchased roughly another $250 million of our common stock during the month of October. Year-to-date through October we have repurchased about $2.5 billion of our common shares and there is approximately $2.7 billion remaining on our repurchase authorization. At the end of the quarter, we had $4.9 billion of cash at our holding companies, which is above the top end of the $3 billion to $4 billion liquidity buffer we maintain. Before I close, let me provide a quick update on our pending reinsurance transaction with Global Atlantic. At this juncture, we have received all necessary regulatory approvals and we expect to close in short order. We do not anticipate any material changes to the terms announced in May. In closing, we hosted a strategy session with our Board of Directors during the first week of October. This recurring annual meeting presents us with an opportunity to pressure test our strategy and to assess progress made toward our next Horizon investor commitments. On that front, we are on track to exceed each commitment made at our December 2019 Investor Day and I am confident. we will continue to deliver for our shareholders and other stakeholders. Now I'll turn it over to John to cover our performance in greater detail.\nJohn McCallion : Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 3Q '23 supplemental slides which provide highlights of our financial performance including details of our Annual Global Actuarial assumption review. In addition, I'll provide updates on our value of new business metrics, our liquidity and capital positions, as well as our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. Starting on page three, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the third quarter. Net investment losses include the mark-to-market impact on securities that are expected to be transferred with the pending reinsurance transaction with Global Atlantic that we announced at the end of May. For GAAP purposes any increase in gross unrealized losses on these securities are required to be realized through net income until we close the transaction. Also, we had net investment losses from our normal trading activity in the portfolio, given the rising interest rate environment. In addition, we had net derivative losses due to higher interest rates and strengthening of the US dollar versus multiple currencies, primarily the Chilean peso and yen. That said, net derivative losses were partially offset this quarter by market risk benefit or MRB remeasurement gains due to higher interest rates. Overall, the portfolio remains well positioned. Credit losses continued to be modest and the hedging program performed as expected. The table on page four provides highlights of our Annual Actuarial Assumption Review and other insurance adjustments with a breakdown of the adjusted earnings and net income impact by business. Overall, the impact to adjusted earnings and net income was negligible. In Group Benefits, we had a favorable impact from assumption changes in individual disability, primarily due to lower incident rates and favorable recoveries. In Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS, we lowered our near-term assumption for mortality improvement which resulted in an economic benefit, given the longevity products in this business. In Asia, the net unfavorable impact was due to lapse rate changes across life and accident & health products in Japan, as well as lowering lapse rates and expected fund returns for variable life products in Korea. On page five, you can see the third quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items associated with the Annual Assumption Review and other insurance adjustments in both periods. Adjusted earnings were $1.5 billion up 35% and 33% on a constant currency basis. The primary drivers were higher variable investment income or VII, strong recurring interest margins and favorable underwriting margins. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.95, up 43% and 40% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, starting with the US. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were $483 million, up 16% versus the prior year period. The key drivers were favorable underwriting margins and solid volume growth. The Group Life mortality ratio was 83.6% favorable to the prior year quarter of 85.7% and below the bottom end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. As a reminder, mortality results tend to be more favorable in the third quarter, so we would expect our Group Life ratio to be back within the 85% to 90% range in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 69% in the quarter or 70.4% excluding the favorable impact related to the annual assumption review that I mentioned earlier and at the low end of its annual target range of 70% to 75%. Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 3% year-over-year. Taking participating contracts into account which dampened growth by roughly 1%, the underlying PFO were up approximately 4% year-over-year, primarily due to solid growth across most products. Including continued strong momentum in voluntary and was within our 2023 target growth range of 4% to 6%. In addition Group Benefit sales were up 11% year-to-date driven by strong growth across most products and markets. RIS adjusted earnings were $409 million, up 60% year-over-year. The primary driver was favorable investment margins due to higher recurring interest and variable investment income. Solid volume growth year-over-year also contributed to the strong performance. RIS investment spreads were 130 basis points. Spreads excluding VII were 138 basis points, up 26 points versus Q3 of 2022 primarily due to higher interest rates as well as income from in-the-money interest rate caps. RIS adjusted PFOs excluding pension risk transfers were up 75% primarily driven by strong sales of structured settlement products, growth in UK longevity reinsurance, and postretirement benefits. With regards to PRT we added transactions worth approximately $1.5 billion in Q3 of 2023, bringing our year-to-date total to roughly $3.5 billion. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were $369 million, up 23% and 25% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher investment margins. Asia's key growth metrics were solid as journal on assets under management on an amortized cost basis as well as sales both grew 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across most of the region. In Japan, sales on a constant currency basis were up 3% year-over-year, driven by strong life sales due to the ongoing momentum of a single premium FX Life product that was relaunched April 1st of this year. In other Asia sales on a constant currency basis were up 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong life sales in Korea in advance of a prospective regulatory change that took place on September 1st, that impacts low cash value whole life products. Looking ahead, while we anticipate Asia year-over-year sales will decline in the fourth quarter, we expect full year 2023 sales growth to be at the top end or exceed our annual guidance range of mid- to high single-digits. Latin America adjusted earnings were $199 million up 26% and 8% on a constant currency basis primarily due to solid volume growth and favorable underwriting margins. Latin America's topline continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 32% and 16% on a constant currency basis. And sales were also up 16% on a constant currency basis driven by strong growth in Mexico and Chile and solid persistency across the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were $70 million, up 43% and 40% on a constant currency basis primarily due to higher volume growth recurring interest margins as well as underwriting margins running favorable to expectations. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins year-over-year. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 9% on both a reported and constant currency basis and sales were up 20% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong growth across the region. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $206 million, up 23%, primarily driven by higher variable investment income. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $262 million compared to an adjusted loss of $258 million in the prior year quarter. Higher expenses, including interest on incremental debt, were partially offset by higher net investment income. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 23% and within our 2023 guidance of 22% to 24%. On page 6, this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the prior five quarters including $179 million in Q3 of 2023. The private equity portfolio of $14.9 billion had a plus 1.4% return in the quarter. Real estate equity funds of $2.2 billion had a minus 3% return. As of now, we anticipate PE returns to remain consistent with the second and third quarter with a modest improvement in real estate funds in the fourth quarter. Therefore, VII would more closely resemble second quarter results. On page 7 we provide VII post-tax by segment for the prior five quarters. As we have noted previously each of the businesses hold its own discrete investment portfolios, which have been built to match its liabilities. As reflected in the chart, Asia, RIS and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest proportion of VII assets given their long-dated liability profile while Corporate and Other continues to hold higher VII assets than historical levels. Now turning to page 8. The chart on the left of the page shows the split of our net investment income between recurring and VII for the past three years and Q3 of 2022 versus Q3 of 2023. While VII has had lower than trend returns over the last few quarters, recurring income, which accounts for approximately 96% of net investment income, was up approximately $700 million year-over-year, reflecting higher interest rates and growth in asset balances. Shifting your attention to the right of the page, which shows our new money yield versus roll-off yield over the past three years, new money yields continue to outpace roll-off yields in the recent quarters. In this quarter, our global new money yield continued its upward trajectory coming in at 6.26%, 156 basis points higher than the roll-off yield. We expect this favorable trend to continue assuming interest rates remain near current levels. Turning to page 9. I'll provide a few updates on our commercial mortgage loans. First, let me say that we are pleased with the commercial mortgage loan or CML portfolio, which continues to perform as expected. As we have noted last quarter our real estate team updated all US office valuations through June 30, assuming a 25% peak to trough valuation decline. In this quarter, the team shifted its effort to revaluing other CML asset classes, which have not been under the pressure seen in the office sector. Not surprisingly, the average LTV increased only slightly as a result with our CML portfolio now at an average LTV of 63%, up from 62% in the second quarter of 2023 and an average debt service coverage ratio of 2.3 times, which represents no change versus 2Q 2023. The modest increase in LTVs and stable debt service coverage ratio are further indicators of the disciplined approach we take to investing in this asset class. The quality of our CML portfolio remains strong with only 1.6% of loans having LTVs more than 80% and DSCRs less than one times. With regards to CML loan maturities, we now have successfully resolved almost 90% of the portfolio scheduled to mature in 2023 and our expectation remains for minimal losses on the portfolio. Our CML portfolio scheduled maturities over the next three years are very manageable, 10% in 2024 13% in 2025 and 16% in 2026. Now, let's switch gears to discuss expenses on page 10. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio for the full year of 2022 as well as the first three quarters of 2023. In Q3 of 2023, the ratio was 12.3%. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our Q3 direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline. While we would expect our direct expense ratio to be higher in Q4 consistent with the seasonality of our business, we are confident we will beat our full year direct expense ratio target of 12.6% in 2023 despite the challenging inflationary environment. We believe this demonstrates our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. Now let's turn to page 11. This chart reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments for the past five years including an update for 2022. As mentioned by Michel, MetLife invested $3.7 billion of capital in 2022 to support new business. This was deployed at an average unlevered IRR of approximately 17% with a payback period of six years, generating roughly $2.3 billion in value. I will now discuss our cash and capital position on page 12. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.9 billion at September 30th, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion and higher than our $4.2 billion at June 30th. The cash of the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, a $1 billion senior debt issuance in July, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchase of roughly $800 million in the third quarter, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, we have repurchased shares holding approximately $250 million in October. For our US companies preliminary third quarter year-to-date 2023 statutory operating earnings were approximately $3.1 billion, while net income was approximately $2.1 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by approximately $1.6 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable underwriting partially offset by higher expenses. We estimate that our total US statutory adjusted capital was approximately $17.7 billion as of September 30, 2023, up 2% from June 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to operating earnings partially offset by dividends paid and net investment losses. Total US statutory adjusted capital has absorbed a negative impact of roughly $300 million associated with the investments expected to be transferred to Global Atlantic, which will be recovered upon closing. Finally we expect the Japan solvency margin ratio to be approximately 600% as of September 30th, which we based on statutory statements that will be filed over the next few weeks. Let me conclude with a few points. First, while VII remains below historical returns, core spreads remain robust and continue to benefit from higher yield environment. Second, the underlying strength of our business fundamentals continues to be displayed with strong top line growth coupled with disciplined underwriting and expense management. Finally, our strong value of new business metrics provide further evidence of our disciplined approach to deploying capital to its highest and best use consistent with our all-weather strategy. To close, MetLife remains in a position of strength given our balance sheet, free cash flow generation and diversification of our market-leading businesses and we are committed to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth and building sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.\nRyan Krueger: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Can you provide some color on how January 1 renewals are shaping up so far in Group Benefits and also both in terms of persistency in the pricing dynamic in the market?\nRamy Tadro: Good morning, Ryan. It's Ramy here. I would say we're still in the middle of the season. Recall the middle part of the market is still kind of active right now. But from everything we can see so far, we are doing extremely well here. Persistency in national accounts continues to be exceptionally high. We are seeing a tick up in the jumbo activity into next year as well building on what we're doing this year. And with respect to our rate actions, we are getting the rates that the book needs in the market and continue to see that both in terms of new business as well as persistency.\nRyan Krueger: Thanks. And then in terms of capabilities within in Group Benefits and M&A, you've done a couple of things to round out the portfolio. Is there anything else you'd be interested in at this point? Or do you feel like you have what you need to grow organically?\nMichel Khalaf: Yeah. Hi, Ryan, it's Michel. Yeah. I mean, I think we're very pleased with the capabilities that we've built with the transactions that we've done in the last few years in Group Benefits. I think they've been highly complementary and we're very pleased in how they've performed. Think about our Pet First acquisition our Versant acquisition. And we'll continue to invest in this business. We've said all along that this is a business where scale matters, and to continue to meet customer expectations, you have to continue to make meaningful investment, something that we've done, and I think that's translating in terms of the momentum we're seeing whether it's in variable benefits or in other areas. Whereas, we don't see any gaps, when it comes to our product set or our capabilities. We're always open to opportunities, if we think those make strategic sense, if we think they can help us accelerate revenue growth, whereas we see a path to continue to grow at within the range that we provided organically, if there was something that would help us accelerate that that would make sense strategically. And that would make sense from a valuation perspective as well. We look for the type of transactions that are accretive over time that clear a minimum risk-adjusted hurdle rate. And we're always going to also compare any transaction to other potential uses of capital. At the end of the day, our focus pillar is about deploying capital to its highest and best use. So hopefully, this helps.\nRyan Krueger: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Next, we go to the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nTom Gallagher: Good morning. A couple of questions on capital. The SMR in Japan seems kind of low at 600% now. Is that something to watch? Or should we really be more focused on ESR since we're going to be pivoting to that new regime pretty soon. So that's the first question. The second is just the $1 billion increase in debt. Is that part of the permanent capital structure? Or are you pre-funding a maturity there?\nJohn McCallion: Good morning, Tom it's John. Thanks. So first question on SMR. Yes, I think it's a balance when you start to look at these metrics. Obviously, we're looking forward at ESR higher rates are positive to ESR. So I think there's a transition happening in the market. We don't have any concerns with being at of roughly 600% right now. Also we have other tools if needed to the extent that rates would rise further we have other internal reinsurance transactions we could do as of now. So no concerns from a capital perspective or dividend capacity perspective. What was your second question?\nTom Gallagher: The $1 billion debt increase.\nJohn McCallion: On debt, yes, so we issued the debt in July. That is not considered permanent capital. That is to pre-fund a maturity in the first quarter of next year.\nTom Gallagher: Okay. Thanks. And then just one other quick one. The slightly improved real estate returns expected for alternatives in 4Q. Is that because you have some property sales resuming and related gains? Or is that just marks being stable?\nJohn McCallion: Yes. I think it's more of the latter. I think it's just we've in a way it's trailing a little bit of what's happened in PE, where we had kind of the markdown and then we've built \u2013 you've kind of gotten to a trough. And as we\u2019ve said before we feel like we bump along the bottom here for a little bit on some of these fund related returns for sometime. So before we see kind of that U-shaped recovery. So it's more of that.\nTom Gallagher: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Next we move on to Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. So first I had a question on just retirement spreads. Should we assume that core spreads in the RIS business will maybe compress a little bit as you go through 2024, given expiration of caps? Or are there other puts and takes?\nJohn McCallion: Good morning, Jimmy, it's John. As you said so good strong core spreads this quarter similar to last quarter just to you guide to fourth. We think something in the same vicinity maybe 135 to 40 is a good range to think about for fourth quarter. And then as you mentioned over the course of 2024 we will have some expiration of some of the caps. As we said before, this whole thing was constructed in a way for the caps to provide us time for the long rates to find their way into spreads. And those things you've seen that come through in a healthy way. So we'll give some more guidance on that on the outlook call and provide some more detail as to how to think about 2024.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then on the CRE portfolio, the metrics almost seem deceptively too good and stable. But you mentioned you've resolved 88% of your 2023 maturities. Are you resolving them similar to how you would have done in the past like in terms of either extending them yourself or third-party financing or stuff? Or are there differences in how the loans are being \u2013 how the maturities are being resolved now versus maybe a few years ago when things were much more stable than CRE?\nJohn McCallion: Yes, it's John, again. Thanks. I take issue with your deceptively comments. But besides that only kidding. But on the maturities, it's roughly speaking, we've talked about these contractual extension options. That's been about 60% of the maturities and how they've all had contractual right. If you're in good standing, you meet all the financial tests. They tend to be in the mid-50s LTV. So strong financial metrics, almost 30% as well in terms of paid off or refinanced. And then the remainder is probably 10% of that is loan modifications, and then the remaining small single digits is the foreclosure or net payoff, which is honestly that level is somewhat similar to what we've seen in the past. So, nothing out of the ordinary given the environment. So I think overall, roughly in line with historical, maybe the people on the contractual options those are floating rate. They're tending to wait to see when they lock in their long-term rates. So, maybe there's been a little extra, in terms of contractual extension options, but nothing out of the ordinary. I think is the way to think about it.\nJimmy Bhullar: And the remaining 12% that's just like a matter of time and you're going through stuff? Or is there something unique about those properties, either by property location or otherwise?\nJohn McCallion: Yes. And the -- the levels I gave you just now, they incorporate what we expect for the remaining 12%. So nothing unique or out of the ordinary. So I think -- I think the punchline, we would share is everything is effectively in line, with what we said in the first quarter when we gave an outline of what our expectation was for the year.\nJimmy Bhullar: Thank you. \nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Suneet Kamath with Jefferies. Please go ahead. \nSuneet Kamath: Thanks. Just first question on the value of new business side. So the amount of capital, you've been deploying has sort of been the $3.7 billion. It's pretty similar to what you did in 2018 and 2019. But given where interest rates are, are you seeing incremental opportunities to deploy more capital in the business? And then relatedly, should we expect that IRR of 17% which I acknowledge is pretty healthy, does that have upside in this rate environment?\nJohn McCallion: Good morning. Sumeet. It's John. Good question. So just in terms of deployment of capital remember last year, I mean just one reason for that I,s we had IBM case that came through in the third quarter of last year. But nonetheless, like you pointed out, very strong unlevered IRRs strong payback periods. Very pleased with the results. We saw some great results actually in Japan as well. That's actually helping boost the VNB as well over the course of 2022. In terms of IRRs, some of the things we've talked about is we do see I think broadly speaking yes I mean we're starting to see demand for these annuity-type products to pick up, right? So I think a volume aspect is emerging. I'd say, it's still emerging in the institutional and retail space broadly speaking. In terms of IRR and pricing, typically the rate environment will price in. These -- the counterparties were buying or selling however you want to look at it, they're pricing in the current rate environment. So I wouldn't expect a big uptick in IRRs. I think 17% IRR is a pretty healthy level to be at. But we'll see how things evolve.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. Got it. And then just on capital should we expect a pickup in the sort of the pace of buyback once you close the Global Atlantic deal?\nMichel Khalaf: Yes. Hi, Suneet. It's Michel. So really pleased, with the fact that we've secured all regulatory approvals for the Global Atlantic transaction. As we had mentioned, we expect that to add about 60 points to our RBC and we consider that to be excess capital. When we announced the transaction we increased the authorization by $1 billion and that was to signal the sustainability of our buyback activity. We also have a track record post major divestitures of returning capital and a deliberate and expeditious manner. So I would suggest that we would conduct ourselves in the same manner here.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Wes Carmichael with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nWes Carmichael: Hey, Good morning. A follow-up on the Group business. It seems like we're seeing pretty favorable results across the industry maybe not deceptively good but definitely good. But just wondering what your outlook is for the industry to retain better margins in that business or if it's kind of given back over pricing in the next couple of years?\nRamy Tadros: Good morning, Wes. It's Ramy here. I mean, look, I think a couple of points to note here. So one we're of course extremely pleased with our record quarter here which is by the way a record even, if you exclude the notable in the quarter. In general, what we tend to see in our results is there's seasonality. And while the dynamics are different by product line in aggregate the third quarter tends to be the most favorable over the course of the year. If I think for us specifically on a go-forward basis, you should think about the mortality ratio which is below the guidance for this quarter. Think about that coming back in the fourth quarter to be within line for our guidance range. The other one, I would perhaps talk about here is disability. I mean, disability continues to perform really well both with respect to incidents and recovery levels. Some of this favorability is stemming from a favorable macro environment. And we believe that, favorability will over time. It's not going to happen in any given quarter but will over time come back into pricing. But having said that, and I'll refer back to kind of Michel's comments on having real focus and strategic intent here in terms of how we're investing in this business. The favorability we're seeing in disability is coming from solid underwriting return to health capabilities deployment of data technology, predictive analytics in how we're running this business in particular investments we're also making in the live and absent space. Those are resonating really well in the market. And we believe over time, will allow us to fuel further growth and maintain very robust margins here. And those are not going away. Those are differentiating capabilities that we have and distinct competitive advantages that we will maintain and continue to invest in.\nWes Carmichael: Thanks, Ramy. And maybe sticking with the US on the pension risk transfer market, it seems like maybe the market for full plan terminations has been heating up a little bit. I'm just wondering, if you're willing to participate in those deals and also what the pipeline looks like as the fourth quarter has been pretty busy historically.\nRamy Tadros: Thanks. So we're pretty pleased with our performance this quarter. So year-to-date we've had $3.5 billion worth of sales. We've also added another $600 million of premium so far in the fourth quarter. And we see a very healthy pipeline ahead and really with a lot of visibility into 2024. And in particular in the jumbo end of the market which is where we focus and where we have distinct competitive advantages. Our focus so far has been on the immediate with RV only part of the market and we see significant pipeline there and we're able to win business at healthy IRRs. But we always continuously evaluate opportunities here. And as we've always stated it's value over volume here. And so if we see opportunities with the right IRRs and the right returns and the right risk profile we're always going to be looking to evaluate those as we go forward.\nWes Carmichael: Thank you.\nOperator: Next we go to the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlex Scott: First one I had for you on is LatAm. We continue to see good growth there. I think in the comments you mentioned some of the digital initiatives and things like that. But I wanted to see if you could extrapolate further just on the sustainability of the really robust growth that you've seen in PFOs and how we should think about that business going into?\nEric Clurfain: Yes. H, Alex. Thanks for the question. This is Eric. So we're overall very pleased with our results for the quarter. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of adjusted earnings in the $200 million range. The quarter's results are primarily driven by volume growth, favorable underwriting as well as foreign currency tailwinds which were partially offset by lower recurring interest margins. And on the top-line side, the positive trajectory continues as you mentioned with solid double-digit growth consistent with our expectations. We're seeing growth across the region in both our retail and group business. We've been very deliberate in expanding beyond our core avenues of growth developing third-party distribution channels such as banks financial institutions retailers and others. And we've made significant technology-related investments in that space. And a good example is what you referred to that Michel mentioned and is opening around the launch of our new integrated platform, which provides embedded insurance capabilities for our distribution partners and thus creating a differentiating competitive advantage for us across the region. So all these factors combined with our disciplined underwriting pricing as well as efficiency focus are contributing to the solid earnings performance and sustained momentum.\nAlex Scott: Very helpful. And then second question was on net investment income. Wanted to see if you could help us just with the benefits of higher interest rates and what it means really for net investment income trajectory more broadly across the organization. And then also interested if there's any tactical things you can do anything you're doing allocation-wise that we should consider related to net investment income?\nJohn McCallion: Good morning, Alex. It's John. So a couple of things to point to for your question. We've given some sensitivities to interest rate movements in the past. And I think those are still fair approach to thinking about the impact generally driven by the benefits of roll-off and reinvest and you're seeing that on the slides we shared. So that has an incremental benefit. Obviously, we've also done a lot to reduce our interest rate sensitivity over the years. So it's not a hockey stick per se but there's inertia there as you look at some of those sensitivities. So I don't know if I have a number to give, because gross numbers maybe get lost, but those sensitivities are more from an earnings perspective and those are probably pretty good things to follow and think through as you kind of model out earnings growth. In terms of tactical. I think, there's always tactical asset allocations that occur. We have a view of relative values that we take into account. But certainly as rates grow fixed-oriented products going to grow in relative value. And we're seeing some unique opportunities out there. It's very helpful to have a wide breadth of product and expertise to work through the opportunities that are in the space and that's scale. That scale is a big benefit. So we're excited for the opportunities that are out there. And having done that we've been maintaining an up in quality mentality when it comes to investments. And with these rates it's worked pretty well.\nAlex Scott: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nJohn Barnidge : Good morning. Thank you. Question about the value of new business slide that's updated not around IRRs, but can you talk about how higher rates in your outlook for that volume to possibly increase along with the value of new business? Thank you.\nJohn McCallion : Hey, John, it's John. Thanks for the question. I think there's a couple of ways to think through that as I mentioned in the earlier comment, I mean, we are seeing an increase in demand. And that is -- we've been able to solve that fairly efficiently with just annual capital generation. And that -- but we do think that it is going to grow and we are constantly considering different ways to take advantage of that. I think eventually as -- and maybe a little bit to an earlier question as volume and demand grows that could improve pricing to some degree. Right now I think it's fairly consistent and adjust with interest rates. But there is dynamics between volume and how that can also improve value but that will take some time.\nJohn Barnidge : Thank you very much. And my follow-up question. I know we're in the thick of renewal season for group benefits, but some retailers have started to comment about the impact from GLP or obesity treatment. How do you -- is that something that's come up within the renewal conversation at all? Just wanted to ask that. Thank you.\nRamy Tadros : Yes. We're not really -- it's Ramy, here John. We're not really seeing any of those having any kind of material effect on our book of business. And remember, we're not in the major medical we're not providing Rx. We are group life players and none of that is really having any material impact at this point.\nJohn Barnidge : Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Mike Ward with Citi. Please go ahead.\nMike Ward : Thanks guys. Good morning. I was just wondering if you could comment on the trends in Asia. It seems like the economy in Japan at least is reengaging or reopening. So any thoughts on maybe the near-term outlook there?\nLyndon Oliver : Hey, Mike it's Lyndon here. So just as we look at broadly Asia, I'll just comment on sales and then maybe we can getting Japan more specifically. Overall, we've had a very strong quarter and year-over-year sales continue to be very strong. We've seen a 5% growth overall and in Japan 3%. In Asia, in total we've been up 8% and that's driven broadly between Korea and China. If we look at the economy in Japan, it is really strong but our sales are primarily driven by interest rates. And so the stronger interest rates have really helped us. So as long as that continues, we think we've got a really solid platform on which to leverage the higher sales.\nMike Ward: Thanks. And then, maybe just could you guys maybe speak to your appetite, specifically for inorganic growth in the US around voluntary benefits that would be helpful. Thanks.\nMichel Khalaf: Hi Mike. It's Michel. So, as I mentioned earlier, whereas we don't see any gaps when it comes to our Group Benefits business here. We've been growing voluntary at -- in the high-teens for a number of years. The employee paid component of our sales is also growing. We're always open to do something inorganically, if we feel that it fits strategically, if it adds the capability, if it helps us accelerate revenue growth, provided it is accretive over time and provided it also compares favorably to other potential uses of capital. So whereas there are no gaps, we have M&A as a strategic capability here and we'll deploy it as we believe it makes sense to do so. And if it's a better use of capital compared to other potential uses.\nMike Ward: Thanks Michel. Maybe just one follow-up on that. Is capesize something that makes you consider or not consider M&A in group overall?\nMichel Khalaf: Meaning, Mike, you're referring to sort of deal size?\nMike Ward: No, sorry, like the target market employer size?\nMichel Khalaf: I mean not really. I mean I would say, we have scale across our businesses and across markets. It's more around does one plus one equal more than two, if you like in terms of what we have and what we are potentially acquiring.\nMike Ward: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And we will turn the conference back to John Hall.\nJohn Hall: Great. Thank you everybody for joining us on this very busy morning for insurance earnings and have a nice day. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Michel Khalaf",
            "content": "Thank you, John and good morning, everyone. As you can see from the report we posted last night, MetLife delivered another quarter of strong underlying results with sustained business momentum. MetLife's capacity to perform across a wide range of economic scenarios, there's a testament to the resilience of our all-weather strategy and is characterized by our unyielding focus on execution. And concentrating on those elements within our control, such as balance sheet security, investment performance, reserve adequacy, responsible growth, expense efficiency and capital deployment to name just a few, we have positioned MetLife to generate significant value for our shareholders and other stakeholders for many years to come. Turning to the quarter. We reported adjusted earnings of $1.5 billion or $1.97 per share. Notable items in the quarter included our annual actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments, which had a positive impact of only $14 million or $0.02 per share on adjusted earnings. Excluding notable items, adjusted earnings per share were $1.95, up 43% from a year ago. As we previously indicated Variable investment income of $179 million fell below our quarterly outlook expectation. Private equity returns totaled 1.4%, while real estate equity risk trailed at minus 3%. In the aggregate, net income for the third quarter was $422 million compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year period. The third quarter result reflects the negative impact of certain required accounting adjustments associated with our previously announced reinsurance transaction. Net derivative losses related to interest rate and foreign exchange hedges helped to protect our balance sheet further reduce net income. Our investment portfolio has stayed up in quality and continues to perform well. Underscoring that quality, the credit metrics associated with our real estate portfolio remain largely unchanged sequentially and we did not incur material credit losses during the third quarter. Moving to MetLife's business performance in the quarter. I will start with our US Group Benefits results. Adjusted earnings excluding notable items totaled $483 million an all-time high and up 16% from a year ago. Underwriting results in the quarter for both Group Life and Non-Medical Health were outstanding. Year-to-date sales are up 11% while adjusted PFOs are up more than 4% in the quarter reflecting the impact of our contracts and within our 4% to 6% outlook range which we expect to achieve for the full year. In Group Benefits, we have invested significantly to integrate with the employer benefits ecosystem and enhance our enrollment capabilities and perhaps more important our reenrollment capabilities. With a significant portion of our overall sales and group benefits coming from employee paid products, our efforts to enhance enrollment and take-up rates are critical. Speaking of enrollment we are about to enter open enrollment season. This is an important opportunity to review our employee benefit needs and refresh selections for the upcoming year something I encourage all of you to do. Several of the investments that I referenced aim to make this process easier for participants. Further, we are activating emerging technologies that will help accelerate some of our group benefits initiatives particularly around underwriting claims and the customer experience. We believe the impact of these investments will enable us over time to further leverage our size to drive greater scale advantage. Looking to Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS adjusted earnings excluding notable items totaled $409 million up 60% from the prior year driven by higher recurring interest margins, better variable investment income and higher asset bases. Sales in the quarter were very strong across a range of products including pension risk transfer with roughly $1.5 billion booked as well as structured settlements and UK longevity reinsurance. We are poised to generate close to $3 billion or more of sales in each of these two high-return product categories for the full year.  Just after the close of the third quarter we released our 2023 pension risk transfer poll an example of our thought leadership in the space which we have been publishing for the past eight years. The poll which serve plan sponsors with derisking goals revealed several important observations relevant to the growth prospect for the PRT market. Let me offer some examples. Following record PRT sales in 2022, market activity is expected to remain strong for the foreseeable future. Among companies who plan to derisk nine of 10 companies plan to completely divest all their defined benefit pension plan liabilities. And finally, 85% of plan sponsors expressed concern over missing an attractive window to secure an annuity buyout at competitive rates. These findings confirm what I have said before we should continue to see a strong pipeline for our pension risk transfer business. Now shifting over to Asia. Adjusted earnings excluding notable items of $369 million were 23% above a year ago on better variable investment income. Sales in the region on a constant currency basis were up 5% led by life insurance in Japan and Korea. For Latin America, adjusted earnings excluding notable items totaled $199 million. Further Latin America posted healthy 16% gains in both sales and adjusted PFOs on a constant currency basis. Our digital initiatives don't stop at the U.S. border they extend around the world for instance in Latin America we launched a digital platform that seamlessly integrates insurance solutions into the customer journeys of our LatAm business partners, such as banks, financial institutions, retailers and others, which we expect will lead to even more responsible growth in the region over time. Expanding on the subject of responsible growth. In the third quarter, we released our Value of New Business, or VNB statistics for the full year 2022. And the results are powerful. To summarize, MetLife's deployed roughly $3.7 billion of capital to support the origination of new business in 2022. This capital was put to work at an average internal rate of return of 17% with an expected payback period of approximately six years. The value of new business generated in 2022 is around $2.3 billion which represents the net present value of distributable cash flows in excess of the hurdle rate. When we reference terms of MetLife like responsible growth and disciplined capital deployment their application in our business is grounded in the systematic use of VNB. It is hard to overestimate the positive impact this analytical tool has had in managing our business starting with the deeply embedded practice of using IRRs and product pricing and ending with the establishment of business unit level VNB goals and targets. Simply put VNB guides our effort to target and prioritize capital efficient and shorter payback business and measure our progress and success in doing so. Over time, we've sought to maintain the right balance of capital deployment across organic growth acquisitions and share repurchase to drive value for shareholders. While we bought back $11.1 billion of our shares and executed $2 billion of acquisitions from 2019 to 2022. We similarly deployed $13.5 billion to support responsible growth over the same period. Moving to quarterly capital and cash MetLife remained active with capital management during the third quarter. We paid about $400 million of common stock dividends to shareholders and we repurchased nearly $800 million of our common stock. In addition to our activity in the third quarter, we repurchased roughly another $250 million of our common stock during the month of October. Year-to-date through October we have repurchased about $2.5 billion of our common shares and there is approximately $2.7 billion remaining on our repurchase authorization. At the end of the quarter, we had $4.9 billion of cash at our holding companies, which is above the top end of the $3 billion to $4 billion liquidity buffer we maintain. Before I close, let me provide a quick update on our pending reinsurance transaction with Global Atlantic. At this juncture, we have received all necessary regulatory approvals and we expect to close in short order. We do not anticipate any material changes to the terms announced in May. In closing, we hosted a strategy session with our Board of Directors during the first week of October. This recurring annual meeting presents us with an opportunity to pressure test our strategy and to assess progress made toward our next Horizon investor commitments. On that front, we are on track to exceed each commitment made at our December 2019 Investor Day and I am confident. we will continue to deliver for our shareholders and other stakeholders. Now I'll turn it over to John to cover our performance in greater detail. Yeah. Hi, Ryan, it's Michel. Yeah. I mean, I think we're very pleased with the capabilities that we've built with the transactions that we've done in the last few years in Group Benefits. I think they've been highly complementary and we're very pleased in how they've performed. Think about our Pet First acquisition our Versant acquisition. And we'll continue to invest in this business. We've said all along that this is a business where scale matters, and to continue to meet customer expectations, you have to continue to make meaningful investment, something that we've done, and I think that's translating in terms of the momentum we're seeing whether it's in variable benefits or in other areas. Whereas, we don't see any gaps, when it comes to our product set or our capabilities. We're always open to opportunities, if we think those make strategic sense, if we think they can help us accelerate revenue growth, whereas we see a path to continue to grow at within the range that we provided organically, if there was something that would help us accelerate that that would make sense strategically. And that would make sense from a valuation perspective as well. We look for the type of transactions that are accretive over time that clear a minimum risk-adjusted hurdle rate. And we're always going to also compare any transaction to other potential uses of capital. At the end of the day, our focus pillar is about deploying capital to its highest and best use. So hopefully, this helps. Yes. Hi, Suneet. It's Michel. So really pleased, with the fact that we've secured all regulatory approvals for the Global Atlantic transaction. As we had mentioned, we expect that to add about 60 points to our RBC and we consider that to be excess capital. When we announced the transaction we increased the authorization by $1 billion and that was to signal the sustainability of our buyback activity. We also have a track record post major divestitures of returning capital and a deliberate and expeditious manner. So I would suggest that we would conduct ourselves in the same manner here. Hi Mike. It's Michel. So, as I mentioned earlier, whereas we don't see any gaps when it comes to our Group Benefits business here. We've been growing voluntary at -- in the high-teens for a number of years. The employee paid component of our sales is also growing. We're always open to do something inorganically, if we feel that it fits strategically, if it adds the capability, if it helps us accelerate revenue growth, provided it is accretive over time and provided it also compares favorably to other potential uses of capital. So whereas there are no gaps, we have M&A as a strategic capability here and we'll deploy it as we believe it makes sense to do so. And if it's a better use of capital compared to other potential uses. Meaning, Mike, you're referring to sort of deal size? I mean not really. I mean I would say, we have scale across our businesses and across markets. It's more around does one plus one equal more than two, if you like in terms of what we have and what we are potentially acquiring."

            "content": "Good morning, Wes. It's Ramy here. I mean, look, I think a couple of points to note here. So one we're of course extremely pleased with our record quarter here which is by the way a record even, if you exclude the notable in the quarter. In general, what we tend to see in our results is there's seasonality. And while the dynamics are different by product line in aggregate the third quarter tends to be the most favorable over the course of the year. If I think for us specifically on a go-forward basis, you should think about the mortality ratio which is below the guidance for this quarter. Think about that coming back in the fourth quarter to be within line for our guidance range. The other one, I would perhaps talk about here is disability. I mean, disability continues to perform really well both with respect to incidents and recovery levels. Some of this favorability is stemming from a favorable macro environment. And we believe that, favorability will over time. It's not going to happen in any given quarter but will over time come back into pricing. But having said that, and I'll refer back to kind of Michel's comments on having real focus and strategic intent here in terms of how we're investing in this business. The favorability we're seeing in disability is coming from solid underwriting return to health capabilities deployment of data technology, predictive analytics in how we're running this business in particular investments we're also making in the live and absent space. Those are resonating really well in the market. And we believe over time, will allow us to fuel further growth and maintain very robust margins here. And those are not going away. Those are differentiating capabilities that we have and distinct competitive advantages that we will maintain and continue to invest in. Thanks. So we're pretty pleased with our performance this quarter. So year-to-date we've had $3.5 billion worth of sales. We've also added another $600 million of premium so far in the fourth quarter. And we see a very healthy pipeline ahead and really with a lot of visibility into 2024. And in particular in the jumbo end of the market which is where we focus and where we have distinct competitive advantages. Our focus so far has been on the immediate with RV only part of the market and we see significant pipeline there and we're able to win business at healthy IRRs. But we always continuously evaluate opportunities here. And as we've always stated it's value over volume here. And so if we see opportunities with the right IRRs and the right returns and the right risk profile we're always going to be looking to evaluate those as we go forward. Yes. We're not really -- it's Ramy, here John. We're not really seeing any of those having any kind of material effect on our book of business. And remember, we're not in the major medical we're not providing Rx. We are group life players and none of that is really having any material impact at this point."

            "content": "Hey, Mike it's Lyndon here. So just as we look at broadly Asia, I'll just comment on sales and then maybe we can getting Japan more specifically. Overall, we've had a very strong quarter and year-over-year sales continue to be very strong. We've seen a 5% growth overall and in Japan 3%. In Asia, in total we've been up 8% and that's driven broadly between Korea and China. If we look at the economy in Japan, it is really strong but our sales are primarily driven by interest rates. And so the stronger interest rates have really helped us. So as long as that continues, we think we've got a really solid platform on which to leverage the higher sales."

            "name": "John McCallion",
            "content": "Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 3Q '23 supplemental slides which provide highlights of our financial performance including details of our Annual Global Actuarial assumption review. In addition, I'll provide updates on our value of new business metrics, our liquidity and capital positions, as well as our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. Starting on page three, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the third quarter. Net investment losses include the mark-to-market impact on securities that are expected to be transferred with the pending reinsurance transaction with Global Atlantic that we announced at the end of May. For GAAP purposes any increase in gross unrealized losses on these securities are required to be realized through net income until we close the transaction. Also, we had net investment losses from our normal trading activity in the portfolio, given the rising interest rate environment. In addition, we had net derivative losses due to higher interest rates and strengthening of the US dollar versus multiple currencies, primarily the Chilean peso and yen. That said, net derivative losses were partially offset this quarter by market risk benefit or MRB remeasurement gains due to higher interest rates. Overall, the portfolio remains well positioned. Credit losses continued to be modest and the hedging program performed as expected. The table on page four provides highlights of our Annual Actuarial Assumption Review and other insurance adjustments with a breakdown of the adjusted earnings and net income impact by business. Overall, the impact to adjusted earnings and net income was negligible. In Group Benefits, we had a favorable impact from assumption changes in individual disability, primarily due to lower incident rates and favorable recoveries. In Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS, we lowered our near-term assumption for mortality improvement which resulted in an economic benefit, given the longevity products in this business. In Asia, the net unfavorable impact was due to lapse rate changes across life and accident & health products in Japan, as well as lowering lapse rates and expected fund returns for variable life products in Korea. On page five, you can see the third quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items associated with the Annual Assumption Review and other insurance adjustments in both periods. Adjusted earnings were $1.5 billion up 35% and 33% on a constant currency basis. The primary drivers were higher variable investment income or VII, strong recurring interest margins and favorable underwriting margins. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.95, up 43% and 40% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, starting with the US. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were $483 million, up 16% versus the prior year period. The key drivers were favorable underwriting margins and solid volume growth. The Group Life mortality ratio was 83.6% favorable to the prior year quarter of 85.7% and below the bottom end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. As a reminder, mortality results tend to be more favorable in the third quarter, so we would expect our Group Life ratio to be back within the 85% to 90% range in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 69% in the quarter or 70.4% excluding the favorable impact related to the annual assumption review that I mentioned earlier and at the low end of its annual target range of 70% to 75%. Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 3% year-over-year. Taking participating contracts into account which dampened growth by roughly 1%, the underlying PFO were up approximately 4% year-over-year, primarily due to solid growth across most products. Including continued strong momentum in voluntary and was within our 2023 target growth range of 4% to 6%. In addition Group Benefit sales were up 11% year-to-date driven by strong growth across most products and markets. RIS adjusted earnings were $409 million, up 60% year-over-year. The primary driver was favorable investment margins due to higher recurring interest and variable investment income. Solid volume growth year-over-year also contributed to the strong performance. RIS investment spreads were 130 basis points. Spreads excluding VII were 138 basis points, up 26 points versus Q3 of 2022 primarily due to higher interest rates as well as income from in-the-money interest rate caps. RIS adjusted PFOs excluding pension risk transfers were up 75% primarily driven by strong sales of structured settlement products, growth in UK longevity reinsurance, and postretirement benefits. With regards to PRT we added transactions worth approximately $1.5 billion in Q3 of 2023, bringing our year-to-date total to roughly $3.5 billion. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were $369 million, up 23% and 25% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher investment margins. Asia's key growth metrics were solid as journal on assets under management on an amortized cost basis as well as sales both grew 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across most of the region. In Japan, sales on a constant currency basis were up 3% year-over-year, driven by strong life sales due to the ongoing momentum of a single premium FX Life product that was relaunched April 1st of this year. In other Asia sales on a constant currency basis were up 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong life sales in Korea in advance of a prospective regulatory change that took place on September 1st, that impacts low cash value whole life products. Looking ahead, while we anticipate Asia year-over-year sales will decline in the fourth quarter, we expect full year 2023 sales growth to be at the top end or exceed our annual guidance range of mid- to high single-digits. Latin America adjusted earnings were $199 million up 26% and 8% on a constant currency basis primarily due to solid volume growth and favorable underwriting margins. Latin America's topline continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 32% and 16% on a constant currency basis. And sales were also up 16% on a constant currency basis driven by strong growth in Mexico and Chile and solid persistency across the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were $70 million, up 43% and 40% on a constant currency basis primarily due to higher volume growth recurring interest margins as well as underwriting margins running favorable to expectations. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins year-over-year. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 9% on both a reported and constant currency basis and sales were up 20% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong growth across the region. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $206 million, up 23%, primarily driven by higher variable investment income. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $262 million compared to an adjusted loss of $258 million in the prior year quarter. Higher expenses, including interest on incremental debt, were partially offset by higher net investment income. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 23% and within our 2023 guidance of 22% to 24%. On page 6, this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the prior five quarters including $179 million in Q3 of 2023. The private equity portfolio of $14.9 billion had a plus 1.4% return in the quarter. Real estate equity funds of $2.2 billion had a minus 3% return. As of now, we anticipate PE returns to remain consistent with the second and third quarter with a modest improvement in real estate funds in the fourth quarter. Therefore, VII would more closely resemble second quarter results. On page 7 we provide VII post-tax by segment for the prior five quarters. As we have noted previously each of the businesses hold its own discrete investment portfolios, which have been built to match its liabilities. As reflected in the chart, Asia, RIS and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest proportion of VII assets given their long-dated liability profile while Corporate and Other continues to hold higher VII assets than historical levels. Now turning to page 8. The chart on the left of the page shows the split of our net investment income between recurring and VII for the past three years and Q3 of 2022 versus Q3 of 2023. While VII has had lower than trend returns over the last few quarters, recurring income, which accounts for approximately 96% of net investment income, was up approximately $700 million year-over-year, reflecting higher interest rates and growth in asset balances. Shifting your attention to the right of the page, which shows our new money yield versus roll-off yield over the past three years, new money yields continue to outpace roll-off yields in the recent quarters. In this quarter, our global new money yield continued its upward trajectory coming in at 6.26%, 156 basis points higher than the roll-off yield. We expect this favorable trend to continue assuming interest rates remain near current levels. Turning to page 9. I'll provide a few updates on our commercial mortgage loans. First, let me say that we are pleased with the commercial mortgage loan or CML portfolio, which continues to perform as expected. As we have noted last quarter our real estate team updated all US office valuations through June 30, assuming a 25% peak to trough valuation decline. In this quarter, the team shifted its effort to revaluing other CML asset classes, which have not been under the pressure seen in the office sector. Not surprisingly, the average LTV increased only slightly as a result with our CML portfolio now at an average LTV of 63%, up from 62% in the second quarter of 2023 and an average debt service coverage ratio of 2.3 times, which represents no change versus 2Q 2023. The modest increase in LTVs and stable debt service coverage ratio are further indicators of the disciplined approach we take to investing in this asset class. The quality of our CML portfolio remains strong with only 1.6% of loans having LTVs more than 80% and DSCRs less than one times. With regards to CML loan maturities, we now have successfully resolved almost 90% of the portfolio scheduled to mature in 2023 and our expectation remains for minimal losses on the portfolio. Our CML portfolio scheduled maturities over the next three years are very manageable, 10% in 2024 13% in 2025 and 16% in 2026. Now, let's switch gears to discuss expenses on page 10. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio for the full year of 2022 as well as the first three quarters of 2023. In Q3 of 2023, the ratio was 12.3%. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our Q3 direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline. While we would expect our direct expense ratio to be higher in Q4 consistent with the seasonality of our business, we are confident we will beat our full year direct expense ratio target of 12.6% in 2023 despite the challenging inflationary environment. We believe this demonstrates our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. Now let's turn to page 11. This chart reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments for the past five years including an update for 2022. As mentioned by Michel, MetLife invested $3.7 billion of capital in 2022 to support new business. This was deployed at an average unlevered IRR of approximately 17% with a payback period of six years, generating roughly $2.3 billion in value. I will now discuss our cash and capital position on page 12. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.9 billion at September 30th, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion and higher than our $4.2 billion at June 30th. The cash of the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, a $1 billion senior debt issuance in July, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchase of roughly $800 million in the third quarter, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, we have repurchased shares holding approximately $250 million in October. For our US companies preliminary third quarter year-to-date 2023 statutory operating earnings were approximately $3.1 billion, while net income was approximately $2.1 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by approximately $1.6 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable underwriting partially offset by higher expenses. We estimate that our total US statutory adjusted capital was approximately $17.7 billion as of September 30, 2023, up 2% from June 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to operating earnings partially offset by dividends paid and net investment losses. Total US statutory adjusted capital has absorbed a negative impact of roughly $300 million associated with the investments expected to be transferred to Global Atlantic, which will be recovered upon closing. Finally we expect the Japan solvency margin ratio to be approximately 600% as of September 30th, which we based on statutory statements that will be filed over the next few weeks. Let me conclude with a few points. First, while VII remains below historical returns, core spreads remain robust and continue to benefit from higher yield environment. Second, the underlying strength of our business fundamentals continues to be displayed with strong top line growth coupled with disciplined underwriting and expense management. Finally, our strong value of new business metrics provide further evidence of our disciplined approach to deploying capital to its highest and best use consistent with our all-weather strategy. To close, MetLife remains in a position of strength given our balance sheet, free cash flow generation and diversification of our market-leading businesses and we are committed to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth and building sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Good morning, Tom it's John. Thanks. So first question on SMR. Yes, I think it's a balance when you start to look at these metrics. Obviously, we're looking forward at ESR higher rates are positive to ESR. So I think there's a transition happening in the market. We don't have any concerns with being at of roughly 600% right now. Also we have other tools if needed to the extent that rates would rise further we have other internal reinsurance transactions we could do as of now. So no concerns from a capital perspective or dividend capacity perspective. What was your second question? On debt, yes, so we issued the debt in July. That is not considered permanent capital. That is to pre-fund a maturity in the first quarter of next year. Yes. I think it's more of the latter. I think it's just we've in a way it's trailing a little bit of what's happened in PE, where we had kind of the markdown and then we've built \u2013 you've kind of gotten to a trough. And as we've said before we feel like we bump along the bottom here for a little bit on some of these fund related returns for sometime. So before we see kind of that U-shaped recovery. So it's more of that. Good morning, Jimmy, it's John. As you said so good strong core spreads this quarter similar to last quarter just to you guide to fourth. We think something in the same vicinity maybe 135 to 40 is a good range to think about for fourth quarter. And then as you mentioned over the course of 2024 we will have some expiration of some of the caps. As we said before, this whole thing was constructed in a way for the caps to provide us time for the long rates to find their way into spreads. And those things you've seen that come through in a healthy way. So we'll give some more guidance on that on the outlook call and provide some more detail as to how to think about 2024. Yes, it's John, again. Thanks. I take issue with your deceptively comments. But besides that only kidding. But on the maturities, it's roughly speaking, we've talked about these contractual extension options. That's been about 60% of the maturities and how they've all had contractual right. If you're in good standing, you meet all the financial tests. They tend to be in the mid-50s LTV. So strong financial metrics, almost 30% as well in terms of paid off or refinanced. And then the remainder is probably 10% of that is loan modifications, and then the remaining small single digits is the foreclosure or net payoff, which is honestly that level is somewhat similar to what we've seen in the past. So, nothing out of the ordinary given the environment. So I think overall, roughly in line with historical, maybe the people on the contractual options those are floating rate. They're tending to wait to see when they lock in their long-term rates. So, maybe there's been a little extra, in terms of contractual extension options, but nothing out of the ordinary. I think is the way to think about it. Yes. And the -- the levels I gave you just now, they incorporate what we expect for the remaining 12%. So nothing unique or out of the ordinary. So I think -- I think the punchline, we would share is everything is effectively in line, with what we said in the first quarter when we gave an outline of what our expectation was for the year. Good morning. Sumeet. It's John. Good question. So just in terms of deployment of capital remember last year, I mean just one reason for that I,s we had IBM case that came through in the third quarter of last year. But nonetheless, like you pointed out, very strong unlevered IRRs strong payback periods. Very pleased with the results. We saw some great results actually in Japan as well. That's actually helping boost the VNB as well over the course of 2022. In terms of IRRs, some of the things we've talked about is we do see I think broadly speaking yes I mean we're starting to see demand for these annuity-type products to pick up, right? So I think a volume aspect is emerging. I'd say, it's still emerging in the institutional and retail space broadly speaking. In terms of IRR and pricing, typically the rate environment will price in. These -- the counterparties were buying or selling however you want to look at it, they're pricing in the current rate environment. So I wouldn't expect a big uptick in IRRs. I think 17% IRR is a pretty healthy level to be at. But we'll see how things evolve. Good morning, Alex. It's John. So a couple of things to point to for your question. We've given some sensitivities to interest rate movements in the past. And I think those are still fair approach to thinking about the impact generally driven by the benefits of roll-off and reinvest and you're seeing that on the slides we shared. So that has an incremental benefit. Obviously, we've also done a lot to reduce our interest rate sensitivity over the years. So it's not a hockey stick per se but there's inertia there as you look at some of those sensitivities. So I don't know if I have a number to give, because gross numbers maybe get lost, but those sensitivities are more from an earnings perspective and those are probably pretty good things to follow and think through as you kind of model out earnings growth. In terms of tactical. I think, there's always tactical asset allocations that occur. We have a view of relative values that we take into account. But certainly as rates grow fixed-oriented products going to grow in relative value. And we're seeing some unique opportunities out there. It's very helpful to have a wide breadth of product and expertise to work through the opportunities that are in the space and that's scale. That scale is a big benefit. So we're excited for the opportunities that are out there. And having done that we've been maintaining an up in quality mentality when it comes to investments. And with these rates it's worked pretty well. Hey, John, it's John. Thanks for the question. I think there's a couple of ways to think through that as I mentioned in the earlier comment, I mean, we are seeing an increase in demand. And that is -- we've been able to solve that fairly efficiently with just annual capital generation. And that -- but we do think that it is going to grow and we are constantly considering different ways to take advantage of that. I think eventually as -- and maybe a little bit to an earlier question as volume and demand grows that could improve pricing to some degree. Right now I think it's fairly consistent and adjust with interest rates. But there is dynamics between volume and how that can also improve value but that will take some time."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.\nJohn Hall: Thank you operator. Good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife's second quarter 2022 earnings call. Before we begin, I'd point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of MetLife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides, which address the quarter. The slides are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to them in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. An appendix to the slides features disclosures, GAAP reconciliations, and other information, which you should similarly review. As usual, after prepared remarks, we will host the Q&A session, which will end promptly just prior to the top of the hour. In fairness to everyone, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michelle.\nMichel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As market conditions continue to fluctuate, what has been a constant is the underlying performance of MetLife's diversified set of market-leading businesses. What has also been constant is the relentless execution of our strategy, which includes delivering in the second quarter on our commitment to accelerate the runoff of our legacy business through a financially attractive deal that also reduces enterprise risk. Our strong risk management capabilities are the bedrock of MetLife. This foundation enables us to successfully navigate shifting currents. We are confident in the prudence of our investment portfolio. We are secure in the effectiveness of our asset liability matching. We are certain of the safety and soundness of our capital and liquidity, and we are convinced of our balance sheet's strength. Shifting to second quarter results, last night we reported adjusted earnings of $1.5 billion, or $1.94 per share, which compares to $1.7 billion, or $2.13 per share a year ago. We continue to be pleased with the underlying momentum of our core businesses, which was evident in the quarter. Our sales were strong across the board with impressive results in group, retirement and income solutions, Asia and Latin America. Our underwriting results were well within targeted levels. Our direct expense ratio totaled 12.2%, illustrating our capacity to generate further operating leverage. Our recurring investment income continues to climb with new money rates pushing past 6%, and our adjusted return on equity of 14.6%, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, met our target range of 13% to 15%. For the quarter, variable investment income of $221 million came in below our outlook expectation. In the aggregate, private equity returns were about 1.5%, inclusive of a positive 40 basis point return on our venture capital portfolio. We generated a minus 1.9% return on real estate equity funds, an asset class that remains under some cyclical pressure. Nonetheless, we believe we've reached the trough relative to VIIs contribution to our quarterly adjusted earnings. In total, net income for the second quarter was $370 million, which reflects certain required accounting adjustments following the announcement of our pending re-insurance transaction with Global Atlantic. We did not incur material credit losses in our real estate portfolio or elsewhere during the second quarter.  Shifting to MetLife's business performance in the quarter, I will start with our US group benefits results. Adjusted earnings totaled $372 million with underwriting results in line with our expectations after reflecting certain unfavorable items. In total, year-to-date sales are up 13% while year-to-date adjusted PFOs are up 5%, reflecting the impact of par firmly within our 4% to 6% outlook range, which we expect to achieve for the full year 2023. Looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to sustain our growth trajectory in this attractive capital-light business for many reasons. The strength of our relationships with our largest national accounts, where our average customer has been with us for more than 20 years, is well-known. The power behind this strength is apparent when you consider that 75% of new sales are made to existing customers through product additions and enrollment growth. Our efforts to accelerate growth in regional business is evident in our market share gains. A key element of this success is driven by our expansive product portfolio, the broadest across the benefits universe. As a proof point, more than half of our new regional business customers purchase multiple products. And again, this can also be seen in our success with voluntary products, which we've been able to grow at a mid-to-high-teens rate for many years now. For retirement and income solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings totaled $417 million, up 11% from the prior year, driven by higher recurring investment margins and higher asset balances. Sales in the quarter were very strong across a range of products, including pension risk transfer with more than $2 billion booked, structured settlements, longevity reinsurance, and post-retirement benefits. We see good run rates for growth in all these areas. In Asia, adjusted earnings of $431 million were below a year ago on lower variable investment income. Our ability to bring new products quickly to market was on full display in the quarter. Sales on a constant currency basis were up 34% in the region, led by Japan, where sales jumped 42% year-over-year, led by the introduction of a foreign currency life insurance product. Turning to Latin America, which put up another strong quarter, adjusted earnings totaled $219 million. Further, Latin America posted gains in both sales and adjusted PFOs of 13% and 14% respectively on a constant currency basis. Taking a wider lens on the momentum in our business, we managed through the pandemic expecting to emerge from the turmoil stronger than we entered. With the fullness of time, we can now see that is true. Some numbers can help. In full year 2019, our group benefits business generated premiums, fees, and other revenues of roughly $19 billion. We are on track to generate group benefits PFOs of roughly $24 billion in 2023, representing $5 billion of growth at a CAGR of more than 5%. In 2019, our retirement income solutions business generated average quarterly adjusted earnings of $310 million, with variable investment income matching outlook expectations. So far in 2023, RIS has averaged about $410 million of adjusted earnings per quarter, without the benefit of normal VII. Similarly, our Latin America business averaged roughly $150 million of adjusted earnings per quarter in 2019, which has grown to an average of more than $200 million per quarter in 2023. To me, the message is clear. The fundamentals associated with our market leading businesses continue to gather steam. Moving to capital and cash, MetLife remained active with capital management during the second quarter. Following the increase to our common stock dividend, we paid roughly $400 million of common stock dividends to shareholders, and we repurchased $672 million of our common stock. The pace of repurchases in the second quarter slowed due to the impending announcement of our reinsurance deal. In addition to our activity in the second quarter, we repurchased roughly another $300 million of our common stock during the month of July. Here today through July, we have repurchased about $1.8 billion of our common shares, which leaves approximately $3.5 billion remaining on our expanded repurchase authorization. As we have done consistently over time, we carefully assess every use of capital with the goal of achieving the right balance between investing in responsible growth for the future and returning capital to generate sustainable long-term value for our shareholders. At the end of the quarter, we held $4.2 billion of cash at our holding companies, which is above the top end of the $3 billion to $4 billion liquidity buffer we maintained. In the beginning of July, we issued $1 billion of senior debt on attractive terms, which will be included in our cash balance in the third quarter. Beyond this, the dynamics of our reinsurance transaction will further add to cash as we move through the remainder of this year. During the quarter, we announced that Steve Goulart will retire at the end of August. Today will be his last earnings call with us. So feel free to pepper him with questions. You will not get another chance. I would like to take this moment to thank Steve for his 17 years of distinguished service to MetLife. In that time span, he led our corporate development and mergers and acquisitions team and served as treasurer before taking on his roles as MetLife's chief investment officer and the president of MetLife Investment Management. From a standing start in 2012, Steve established MetLife Investment Management and fostered its growth to its present status as a $167 billion institutional fixed income and real estate manager. I believe the talent at MetLife truly sets us apart and serves as a clear differentiator for our company. Steve's retirement provides the opportunity to broaden the roles and responsibilities of some of our top leaders. In addition to her role as chief risk officer, Marlene Debel will lead MetLife Insurance Investments with chief investment officer Chuck Scully reporting directly to Marlene. John McCallion, MetLife's chief financial officer will take on additional responsibility as the head of MetLife Investment Management. And Ramy Tadros, regional president to us business, will add head of MetLife Holdings to his portfolio. These moves draw upon MetLife's deep bench and illustrate our ability to deploy top talent to the areas of greatest impact for our customers and shareholders. In closing, MetLife's all weather strategy positions us to perform across a range of economic cycles. By focusing on what we can control, how we execute, how we invest, and how we deploy capital, we will continue to create long-term value for our shareholders and other stakeholders. Now I'll turn it over to John to cover our performance in greater detail.\nJohn McCallion: Thank you, Michelle, and good morning. I will start with the 2Q '23 supplemental slides which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our liquidity and capital positions. In addition, I'll provide an update on our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. Starting on Page three, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the second quarter. Net investment losses were primarily the result of securities that were associated with the pending reinsurance transaction with Global Atlantic that we announced at the end of May. For GAAP purposes, gross unrealized losses as of June 30 on securities expected to be transferred to Global Atlantic at closing are required to be realized through net income this quarter. In addition, we had net derivative losses due to the favorable equity markets, strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the Yen, and higher interest rates. That said, derivative losses were mostly offset this quarter by market risk benefit, or MRB remeasurement gains, due to higher equity markets and interest rates. Overall, the portfolio remains well positioned, credit losses continue to be modest, and the hedging program performed as expected. On Page four, you can see the second quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding a favorable notable item of $77 million in 2Q of '22, primarily related to a reinsurance settlement, which was accounted for in MetLife Holdings. There were no notable items in the current quarter. Adjusted earnings were $1.5 billion down 10%, and down 11% on a constant currency basis. The primary driver was lower variable investment income. Underwriting margins were also less favorable than the prior year, but within our targeted ranges. Higher recurring interest margins and solid volume growth were partial offsets. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.94 down 5% year-over-year on a reported and constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses starting with the U.S., group benefits adjusted earnings were $372 million, down 8% versus the prior year period. Results were below run rate expectations for the quarter due to certain unfavorable expense, reinsurance, and reserve related items, which reduced group benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $40 million, and were specific to this quarter. The group-life mortality ratio was 85.3%, essentially in line with the prior year quarter, and at the bottom end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 73.7% in the quarter, above the midpoint of its annual target range of 70% to 75%. We had a disability reserve refinement of approximately $15 million after tax, which increased the ratio by 0.8 percentage points, and was included in the items totaling $40 million that I just referenced. Turning to the top line, group benefits adjusted PFOs were up 4% year-over-year. Taking participating contracts into account, which dampened growth by roughly 1%, the underlying PFOs were up approximately 5% year-over-year, primarily due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum and voluntary, and was within our 2023 target growth range of 4% to 6%. In addition, group benefit sales were up 13% year-to-date, driven by strong growth across most products end markets. Retirement and income solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were $417 million, up 11% year-over-year. The primary drivers were higher recurring interest margins and solid volume growth. This was partially offset by lower variable investment income year-over-year. RIS investment spreads were 132 basis points. Spreads excluding VII were 142 basis points, up 29 basis points versus Q2 of '22, primarily due to higher interest rates, as well as income from in the money interest rate caps. RIS liability exposures were up 5% year-over-year, driven by general account liabilities, which grew 7% due to strong net flows. RIS adjusted PFOs excluding pension risk transfers were up 73%, primarily driven by strong sales of structured settlement products and growth in UK longevity reinsurance. With regards to PRT, we completed two transactions worth approximately $2 billion in the quarter, and continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia, adjusted earnings were $431 million, down 11% and 9% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower variable investment income. Adjusted earnings ran approximately $25 million above expectation due to certain reserve refinements and tax related true ups. Asia's key growth metrics were strong as general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 5% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 34% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by strong growth across the region. In Japan, sales were up 42% year-over-year, driven by continued strong momentum in FX annuities through our face-to-face channels, as well as life sales due to a relaunch of a single premium FX life product on April 1. We continue to see Japanese consumer interest for FX products given the attractive higher U.S. interest rates. Latin America adjusted earnings were $219 million, down 13% and 21% on a constant currency basis, due to less favorable underwriting margin versus 2Q of '22. The prior year quarter had a roughly $40 million benefit to adjusted earnings from a release of a COVID related IB&R reserve. In addition, investment margins were down year-over-year, partially offset by solid volume growth. Latin America's top line continues to perform well, as adjusted PFOs were up 23% and 14% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 13% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were $70 million, up 6% and up 15% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by higher recurring interest margins. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 4% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 13% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong growth across the region. MetLife holdings adjusted earnings were $211 million, down 31%. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $228 million, essentially flat versus an adjusted loss of $227 million in the prior year. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 22%, and at the low end of our 2023 guidance of 22% to 24%. On Page five, this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the prior five quarters, including $221 million in Q2 of \u201823. Private equity portfolio, $14.6 billion, had a plus 1.5% return in the quarter. Real estate equity funds of $2.2 billion had a minus 1.9% return, while both PE and real estate equity funds are reported on a one quarter lag. As of now, we anticipate that VII in the third quarter will generally be in line with the second quarter result. On Page six, we provide VII post tax by segment for the prior five quarters. As you've noted previously, each of the businesses holds its own discrete investment portfolios, which have been built to match its liabilities. As reflected in the chart, Asia, RAS, and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest portion of VII assets given their long dated liability profile. For 2Q of \u201823, Asia's VII portfolio generated the highest returns at 2.2%, outperforming MetLife Holdings at 1.5% and RAS at 0.9%. Now turning to Page seven, the chart on the left of the Page shows the split of our net investment income between recurring and VII for the past three years in Q2 of \u201822 versus Q2 of \u201823. While VII has had the lower than trend returns over the last few quarters, recurring income, which accounts for approximately 96% of net investment income, was up $700 million year-over-year, reflecting higher interest rates and growth in asset balances. Shifting your attention to the chart on the right of the Page, which shows our new money yield versus roll off yield over the past three years, new money yields continue to outpace roll off yields in the recent quarters. In this quarter, our global new money yield reached its highest level in more than a decade of 6.06%, 157 basis points higher than the roll off yield. We expect this favorable trend to continue assuming interest rates remain near current levels. Turning to Page eight, I'll provide a few updates on our commercial mortgage loans, which you can find further details in our quarterly financial supplement. As of June 30, our commercial mortgage loan, or CML portfolio, carrying value of approximately $53 billion is well diversified by geography and property type. The CML portfolio is concentrated in high quality properties and in larger primary markets. These loans are typically to the larger and stronger institutional sponsors who are better positioned to effectively manage assets through periods of stress. Given the focus on the office sector, our real estate team updated all U.S. office valuation through June 30, assuming a 25% peak to trough valuation decline. We believe it was prudent to focus our efforts here in the quarter given the heightened attention this has received. As expected, LTVs increased slightly as a result with our CML portfolio now in an average LTV of 62%, up from 58% in the first quarter of \u201823, and an average debt service coverage ratio of 2.3 times down slightly from 2.4 times in 1Q \u201823. The modest increase in LTVs coupled with the resiliency and robustness of the debt service coverage ratio is another indicator of the disciplined approach we take to investing in this asset class. The quality of our CML portfolio remains strong with only 2% of the loans having LTVs more than 80% and DSCRs less than one times. With regards to CML loan maturities, we now have successfully resolved 69% of the portfolio's schedule to mature in 2023, and our expectation is for minimal losses on the portfolio. Now let's switch gears to discuss expenses on Page 9.  This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio for full year 2022, as well as Q1 of '23 and Q2 of '23, which had a ratio of 12.2%. As you have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our Q2 direct expense ratio benefited from solid top-line growth and ongoing expense discipline. We remain committed to achieving a full year direct expense ratio of 12.6% or below in 2023, demonstrating our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. I will now discuss our cash and capital positions on Page 10. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.2 billion at June 30, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 to $4 billion and consistent with March 31. The cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, and share repurchases of roughly $700 million in the second quarter, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. The buybacks in Q2 of '23 were lower than our recent trend as we were in a blackout period for most of May in advance of our pending reinsurance transaction with Global Atlantic. That said, we have repurchased shares totaling approximately $300 million in July. For our U.S. companies, preliminary second quarter, year-to-date 2023 statutory operating earnings were approximately $2 billion, while net income was approximately $1.3 billion, statutory operating earnings increased by approximately $1.3 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable underwriting, partially offset by higher expenses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $17.4 billion as of June 30, 2023, down 2% from March 31, 2023, primarily due to the temporary impact of roughly $300 million associated with the investments expected to be transferred to Global Atlantic. We expect these impacts to reverse at close, which remains on target by year-end. In addition, as previously disclosed, we expect the transaction to add approximately 60 combined RBC points. Finally, we expect the Japan-Solvency Margin Ratio to be approximately 700% as of June 30, which will be based on statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks. Let me conclude with a few points. First, while VII remains below historical returns, we believe we reached a trough. In addition, core spreads remain robust and continue to benefit from a higher yielding environment. Second, the underlying strength of our business fundamentals continues to be displayed with strong top-line growth coupled with disciplined underwriting and expense management. Lastly, MetLife remains in a position of strength, given our balance sheet, investment portfolio, free cash flow generation, and the diversification of our market-leading businesses. And we are committed to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth and building sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we first go to the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.\nRyan Krueger: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question was, following the recent risk transfer deal, do you see further opportunities for additional risk transfer in MetLife holdings over time? \nJohn McCallion: Good morning, Ryan. It's John. I think we would probably follow the same commentary we've given before. We are continuing to look for ways to optimize. We look internally for ways to optimize, and we continue to have external communications around different opportunities. I think at the end of the day, similar to what we did with this transaction, it needs to fit the right profile for us. It needs to be value-creative. It needs to be risk-reducing. And by the end of the day, we don't have to. We're very comfortable managing these blocks of businesses ourselves. We have the expertise. And I think there are different ways to find ways to optimize that book. But nonetheless, it's a healthy process for us continuing to have these conversations.\nRyan Krueger: Thanks. And then I had to ask one for Steve on his last call. Could you provide some additional details on the office loans that have been resolved year-to-date, the mix of paydowns versus extensions and any more color on what the terms of the extensions are? \nSteven Goulart: Hey, Ryan, thanks for the question. I would hate to go through my last earnings call without a question. But on your question, let me talk about the total portfolio. Again, John mentioned 69% of the loans scheduled to mature this year have already been resolved. Of that, 31% of them were actually paid off. So very positive. And 57% of them were resolved through the borrower extension of contractual loan extensions. And we've talked about that a little bit in the past. But again, those are not financially distressed loans. I mean, the average LTV on those loans is 51%. And again, they have contractual extensions that allow the borrower to choose to extend. And that's what has happened with those. And again, when they do, they have to meet financial performance tests related to debt yield, related to LTV, sometimes both. We also get fees paid on those extensions. And so it's not a surprise, it's given where interest rates are, that this is what the borrowers would choose to do. The office portfolio is very similar in those statistics that I just gave. So we're very comfortable looking out the rest of the year. We would expect similar resolutions and are very pleased with how it's moving forward.\nRyan Krueger: Okay, great. Thank you Steve.\nOperator: And our next question is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, John, I think you pointed out that there was around 40 million of one-off items within groups. So just thinking about going forward, should we just normalize for that and think about that as the run-rate earnings power of the segment? Or is there any other seasonality that we should take in mind in the back half of the year? \nRamy Tadros: Hi, Elyse. It's Ramy. So the short answer to your question is yes. So these were unfavorable items that we don't expect to reoccur. Just to give you a flavor of what the items were. So the first one is an expense item which is related to a catch-up on state tax assessment. The second one is an adjustment on the life-free insurance policy. And the third one is a reserve refinement in our disability line which as John indicated impacted our non-medical health ratio by just about a point. So we don't expect these to be recurring as I mentioned. And so, you could essentially normalize for those on a go-forward basis.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my second question, you guys saw buyback pick up in July. So is that July level kind of a good run rate from here? As we think about the holding transaction closing and then I also believe, your subsidiary dividends are typically, greater in the back half of the year?\nMichel Khalaf: Hi. Good morning, Elyse. Michelle here. So I would say that there was a bit of catch-up in July given the fact that we were in blackout for, part of the second quarter due to the re-insurance transaction. So, if you look at probably the sort of run rate up to July here to date, I think that gives you a good sense of sort of pacing. We obviously we're looking to close the transaction in the second half of the year. And one we do, we'll assess the environment at the time. I think we've built a good track record here in terms of, after major divestitures in terms of how we we're deliberate and expeditious and returning access capital and, expect the same here.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks, Michelle.\nOperator: And next we go to Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nErik Bass: Hi, thank you. Can you provide some more color on your non-medical health underwriting results this quarter, in particular, the experience in dental and disability and how you're thinking about those going forward?\nRamy Tadros: Sure, Erik. It's Ramy here. So, I'll start with disability. So, all results this quarter were favorable year-over-year. We're seeing favorable incidents and very strong recovery levels and I'm very pleased with the performance of that line this quarter. And as I just noted before, we have seen about a one-point impact on the ratio given some of those reserve refinements which we referred to earlier. On disability, we're continuing to benefit from tailwinds here in terms of favorable macroenvironment and interest rates and tight labor markets. But aside from the macro factors, we're also benefiting from our strong underwriting, our return to health capabilities, the deployment of data and technology and how we run this business. And we also continue to invest in our leave and absence capabilities which give us pricing power and continue to resonate well in the marketplace. From a dental perspective, we have seen a slight elevation, our trend this quarter, driven by an increase in our claims costs. As part of the normal course of managing this product, we adjust our pricing to make sure we meet our target margins. So as a reminder, we reprice the majority of our dental book, call it about 80% annually and we're always monitoring the trend and adjusting our pricing accordingly. So this is part of the course in terms of managing a dental book. And maybe if you want to kind of step back and look at the non-medical health benefit ratio for the full year which is inclusive of dental and disability, we expect to be at the midpoint of our guidance range for the full year here.\nErik Bass: Thank you. And then if it could pivot to Asia, Japan sales continue to be very strong. So we could talk a little bit more about what's driving this, the current competitive dynamics in the market and what impact a change in BOJ policy could have on the business.\nLyndon Oliver: Hey, yes, thanks Erik. It's Lyndon here. So look, we're very pleased with the overall sales performance we've seen in Asia in the second quarter. You've seen Asia's sales overall have grown 34%. And Japan in particular is up 42% and the rest of Asia up 17%. Now if we look a little deeper in Japan, foreign currency products continue to drive our sales growth over there. The market for single premium foreign currency products has been strong given the higher rate environment. And we continue to sustain our market position in the annuity segment. Michele pointed out in his opening remarks, our ability to bring new products to market quickly has really helped us in terms of launching our single premium foreign currency product. We've also optimized our capital structure for these products by leveraging our internal reinsurance in Bermuda. So the combination of both the product differentiation, the speed to market, as well as the strength of our distribution in the face to face as well as bank assurance has really been a strong factor in growing sales. If we look the rest of Asia, we've recovered really well this year. We've seen broad based improvement in China, India and Korea. And overall, all the initiatives we've taken on the customer side, the distribution side, as well as on the product, the new product launches have really helped in these markets. And if we look ahead to the outlook, our management actions have really continued to drive the sales momentum. But when we look at the year over year comparison for the second half, we're going to be challenged given we had a strong second half of the year last year. However, we're on track to be at the high end of the full year guidance of mid to high single digits.\nErik Bass: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we move to a question from Jamminder Bhullar with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. \nJamminder Bhullar: Good morning. So first, just a question on threads in the retirement business. Assuming that interest rates sort of followed the forward yield curve, it would be reasonable that your yield would pick up, but should we assume that spreads would improve as well? Or are you at a point where now any incremental increases in yield in the retirement business would need to be passed through to customers through higher productivity?\nJohn McCallion: Hey, Jimmy, it's John. Good morning. Look, as we think about yield, as you said, we had a really strong quarter and certainly an RIS. We were 132 all in. And if you exclude VI, we're a healthy 142. And probably if you kind of normalize for VII, that puts us at the high end of the range, it's very much in line with what we gave at our outlook. We thought the first half of the year, even though the Ford curves have moved around and things like that, that we would have kind of a higher level in Q1 and Q2. I think as you look forward, we would think spreads kind of hover around this point. I'm not so sure it would kind of -- now, why it does that is not necessarily exactly, I'd say, perfectly aligned with the pass-through comment you made. I think there's a variety of other factors. I think it's just as the curve begins to shift, how the impact of the caps versus the long end start to manifest itself in spreads. But I think right now we would view the kind of the third quarter outlook would be somewhere in this vicinity or maybe the average of Q1 and Q2.\nMichel Khalaf: And my comment was around this competition as well because there's a limit, obviously, to how much they can reasonably improve.\nJamminder Bhullar: Yes, what I meant was if the rates keep going up, you're already at a pretty good point in terms of spread. So I'm assuming it's unreasonable to assume that they keep improving a lot more from here.\nJohn McCallion: Yes, that's fair. I think the key for us is, I'd say to your point, new business pricing is, that's where I think your point lies. I think, we still are on an overall basis have some -- we're short. So I think as there's roll-off reinvest, that's where my point was.\nJamminder Bhullar: Okay. And then in Japan, you've been selling a lot of 4x products some of your peers have as well. And I think with changes in the economic solvency margin, that product becomes more sort of capital unfriendly or not as friendly as it is right now. So I'm wondering if you are planning on making any changes to your products or you could actually manage around that through offshore reinsurance. And then relatedly, I don't know if there's a limit to how much the FSA would let companies use in terms of or use offshore reinsurance to shift business out of Japan.\nLyndon Oliver: Yes, look, hey, it's Lyndon here. Let me make a couple of comments around this. So the ESR implementation is a couple of years away. And we continue to make very good progress looking at all these products under the new regime. But we're still early in the work and the regulations are still evolving. The second point here is we currently price our products on the MetLife's economic solvency and on a local statutory basis. So to some extent, we're already using an economic lens as we analyze product profitability. But as I said, it's a little early regulations continue to go to evolve. We're in the middle of field testing. So I think as our implementation plan progresses, we will start to make adjustments as needed. This would include reinsurance or product modifications or anything like that. But it would still be too early given it's a couple of years away.\nJamminder Bhullar: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Thomas Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nThomas Gallagher: Good morning. First one is just on a trend, peers have seen which has been elevated long-term care claims. It looked to me like holdings, underwriting and underlying earnings were actually pretty favorable. So I wanted to see if you also experienced elevated long-term care claims within that and if so, how much?\nJohn McCallion: Thanks. Good morning, Tom. It's John. We did see some unfavorability kind of towards the end of Q1 and into Q2 and maybe the first couple months of Q2 higher claims as well as some lower terminations on just on a relative trend perspective. Towards the end of Q1 or Q2, I should say, and then into July, we've seen those trends revert back. So right now, we probably would account for that as an aberration, a short-term aberration, but we'll obviously still monitor I think just an overall point around results for holding. While that's the case, we had favorable mortality in the segment. So that was a positive, but specifically the long-term care. That's the case. I think on the flip side, the team has been doing a really, really good job continuing to get rate increases. We've already met our typical run rate of rate increases this year at 4.5% of premium year-to-date. That's what we typically assume each year. So we're off to a great start there.\nThomas Gallagher: Great. Thanks. And then my follow-up is, so last quarter, I think you all had mentioned 200 million of potential foreclosures on CRE or CMLs with 15 million of related losses, as I guess that was a stress test. What would the update be now? It sounds like it's probably going to be less than that, but curious what you think now. And then also, have you seen any meaningful credit migration into 2Q on your CNBS portfolio? Thanks.\nSteven Goulart: Hey, Tom. It's Steven Goulart. Thanks for the question. And I think you were headed in the right direction basically. Obviously, we continue to do stress testing, but really nothing to note on that. We're very comfortable with the portfolio, very comfortable with the results of the stress testing. Certainly nothing's different. Anything may be marginally better than last time. You talked about foreclosures also. We did use a number. Frankly, it's going to come in materially less than that. We think we're going to have very small charge-offs in the portfolio as well. The portfolio is very well positioned. So I think we're very comfortable with it. And it will continue to perform through this. I'm sorry. The last part of the question was related to CNBS migration. Can you repeat the last question?\nThomas Gallagher: Sure. Steve, CNBS, did you see credit migration on that portfolio, downgrades, or did you have losses on that portfolio that you took this quarter? \nSteven Goulart: No. We haven't had any material losses in that portfolio.\nMichel Khalaf: I'll just add two things, Tom. So I think to Steve's point around just losses, I think his reference to just materially less was relative to the stress that we had put out. The comments I made in the first quarter around what our expectations for kind of the maturities and kind of the potential loss there, I'd say no change is one. And then two, just maybe broadly speaking around just credit losses were very modest this quarter, as we said. And actually, I don't know if we even had any in real estate and CECL went down because there was a revaluation of a hotel that actually went up. So there's a lot of factors there. But I think all in all, the portfolio is performing well.\nThomas Gallagher: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Suneet Kamath from Jeffries. Please go ahead.\nSuneet Kamath: Thanks. Good morning. Just start out the best of luck to Steve. Just on the 69% of CML maturities that were, I guess, resolved here. I don't know if you mentioned this, but what percentage of those were office, if you can disclose that?\nJohn McCallion: Yes. Let's see. The resolution was basically in line with the overall portfolio. And of the office loans, roughly the same percentage were resolved. Trying to get the actual percentage of the office. I'll get that in one second for you. \nSuneet Kamath: Okay. I can give it to my second question and then maybe circle back. I guess, for Ramy, we've seen good disability results sort of across the board, I guess, for a couple quarters now. Just curious, based on your experience, when do you think that some of these results might start to feather into pricing and we could start to see greater competition? I would imagine at some point, it would need to work its way through. Just wondering any thoughts on the timing of that. Thanks.\nRamy Tadros: Sure. I mean, I think if you're thinking about this over kind of the short to medium term, and I would say that like four factors, driving disability margins, you've got very disciplined underwriting, you've got strong claim management, you've got customer service that drives persistency and the ability to get appropriate rates at renewal. And this one is particularly important if you're in the business of providing bundled solutions, including absence and leave capabilities, which we are a market leader in. And then, of course, you got the macro factors in terms of the employment levels as well as the competitive environment. I would say for us, the first three drivers of this underwriting claims and capabilities are a core competitive advantage and will continue to be so as we continue to invest in this business. If you think about the macro environment, we're seeing some of those tailwinds right now, but we continue to be disciplined in our pricing because there's a fair bit of uncertainty in the environment going forward. And we're certainly continuing to bake that into our pricing as we look into '24.\nSuneet Kamath: So pretty rational environment in terms of pricing, not just you guys, but just in terms of what you're seeing from a competitive perspective?\nRamy Tadros: Yes, I would say it's competitive. It's rational. And there's also multiple levers to differentiate beyond price. And we're certainly pulling on every single one of those levers given our scale and capabilities in this business.\nSteven Goulart: Hey, Suneet, this is Steve too. And I just wanted to follow up. We did, sorry, I didn't have that answer at the tip of my fingers. But basically, it's just over five billion of total resolutions. And of that, nearly half were office.\nSuneet Kamath: Got it. Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question is from Michael Ward with Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ward: Thanks, guys. Good morning. Maybe just on VII or [also] overall, pretty solid result, I think, considering the macro and real estate dynamic. Just wondering if you can expand on your competence in that trough, the trough dynamic, thinking about the real estate equity, or I guess overall non-cash sort of gains, just hoping you can expand on that competence.\nJohn McCallion: Hey, good morning, Mike. It's John. Yes, I think, as both Michelle and I mentioned in our opening remarks, our view is, yes, we've come to a trough. I think, different assets are in kind of different positions. But all in all, in the trough, we've seen some headwinds in real estate, the funds that I mentioned, minus 1.9, but we saw some positive offsets in the PE portfolio. We think that dynamic continues into the next quarter, which is why I mentioned we would generally be in line with now. Obviously it's early. We don't have a ton of, I'll say, objective insight. We have some qualitative commentary and views. We've seen a positive, equity markets, although might be driven by a small number of stocks, depending on how you look at the second quarter. So, but, and that typically directionally translates into some level of, I'll say, the positive in line return, but the betas are typically lower. So that's kind of where we are. We kind of view this trough as more of a U-shaped recovery in this asset class versus kind of a sharp V. But, and we just don't want to get ahead of ourselves. So right now we're, we kind of view that the best view would be kind of in line with Q2.\nMichael Ward: Thanks, John. And then maybe for just career benefits overall in the U.S., just curious from your guys' perspective about the climate or the sentiment for U.S. employers, labor market's been pretty resilient. Some headlines around headcount reductions. Just curious what you guys are hearing in that regard and also on wages or, and how that flows into demand for overall benefits. Thanks.\nMichel Khalaf: Thanks. I would say from a top line perspective, we're still seeing significant strength across the portfolio. So we're very pleased with our PFO growth. And that's a combination of new customers. It's a combination of good persistency, rate actions for a portion of our portfolio. We've got some tailwinds in terms of wage growth. So we're still seeing very strong momentum there. As Michelle alluded to, we're still seeing double digit growth in our voluntary portfolio. And with a lot of white space, both in terms of customers who don't offer voluntary as well as increasing opportunities to increase penetration within the work site as well. And then I would also just point to the below 5,000 space, which we define as our regional market. National is above 5,000. That is emerging as a particularly bright spot for us. Our PFO growth there is high single digits. We do a fair bit of internal research where we cut the data by market segment. And when you look at that data below 5,000, we're a top three player in that segment, and we're continuing to take share in the fragmented market. So all in all, we're still seeing really positive tailwinds both from the macro environment as well as how we're positioned in this business that's driving PFO growth. That's kind of well within the 4% to 6% range that we have.\nMichael Ward: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: And next we go to a question from Alexander Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlexander Scott: Hi. First one is a little bit of a housekeeping question. I was just interested in the corporate expense load. It looks a little bit elevated. I know some of that. I know some of that is just part of VII, but even other expenses a bit elevated. So I just wanted to get a feel for if there's anything nuanced going on there in the investment in the business or something we need to be aware of and just confidence around the 650 to 750 annualized number heading  in the back half and into next year.\nJohn McCallion: Good morning, Alex. It's John. As you point out a couple things. One, obviously, VII being below the kind of historical returns puts pressure on C&O as well. So that's probably one driver to maybe the elevated loss that you're referencing. We did have higher expenses in C&O. Obviously, our direct expense ratio came in well. Overall expenses would were very good along with strong top line growth. So our ratio at 12.2 was well below the 12.6. We're still obviously targeting below the 12.6 for full year and it can fluctuate from quarter to quarter, but a good quarter nonetheless. In terms of the expenses, if you kind of compare to last year, I'd say probably two main things to highlight. One, interest on debt. It was one item year-over-year. That's a relatively big piece of that. And then the second one is we did have some higher one-time costs in C&O this quarter due to some corporate initiatives. I'll call it that, it was part of just kind of our general efficiency mindset. We don't ever exclude those things. Those are all part of our direct expense ratio, but their investments that we've made to kind of improve our run rate go forward. So hopefully that helps with C&O.\nAlexander Scott: Yes, that is helpful. The second one I had for you is just on the pitch downgrade of U.S. debt. I think having two out of three below AAA now probably moves the you know, the composite rating and so maybe that would affect risk rates and yes, it seems like it should be reasonably limited, but just wanted to get your thoughts on, we should expect any material impact RBC from that and, if it affects anything else in your business?\nJohn McCallion: Hey Alex, it's John. Obviously, very recent news. I'm not so sure I saw a ton of reaction yesterday on it and nor do we really think that it has a broad-based impact on, how we run our business or we wouldn't expect capital impacts, but I guess you never know, but right now, we wouldn't expect any impact one way or the other in terms of our, how we run our investment portfolio and our outlooks there. It doesn't change anything.\nAlexander Scott: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, for final remarks, I'd like to turn the call back to MetLife's Global Head of Investor Relations, John Hall.\nJohn Hall: Well, thank you everybody for joining us and you know where to find us with any follow-up questions. Thanks very much and have a good day. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Michel Khalaf",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As market conditions continue to fluctuate, what has been a constant is the underlying performance of MetLife's diversified set of market-leading businesses. What has also been constant is the relentless execution of our strategy, which includes delivering in the second quarter on our commitment to accelerate the runoff of our legacy business through a financially attractive deal that also reduces enterprise risk. Our strong risk management capabilities are the bedrock of MetLife. This foundation enables us to successfully navigate shifting currents. We are confident in the prudence of our investment portfolio. We are secure in the effectiveness of our asset liability matching. We are certain of the safety and soundness of our capital and liquidity, and we are convinced of our balance sheet's strength. Shifting to second quarter results, last night we reported adjusted earnings of $1.5 billion, or $1.94 per share, which compares to $1.7 billion, or $2.13 per share a year ago. We continue to be pleased with the underlying momentum of our core businesses, which was evident in the quarter. Our sales were strong across the board with impressive results in group, retirement and income solutions, Asia and Latin America. Our underwriting results were well within targeted levels. Our direct expense ratio totaled 12.2%, illustrating our capacity to generate further operating leverage. Our recurring investment income continues to climb with new money rates pushing past 6%, and our adjusted return on equity of 14.6%, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, met our target range of 13% to 15%. For the quarter, variable investment income of $221 million came in below our outlook expectation. In the aggregate, private equity returns were about 1.5%, inclusive of a positive 40 basis point return on our venture capital portfolio. We generated a minus 1.9% return on real estate equity funds, an asset class that remains under some cyclical pressure. Nonetheless, we believe we've reached the trough relative to VIIs contribution to our quarterly adjusted earnings. In total, net income for the second quarter was $370 million, which reflects certain required accounting adjustments following the announcement of our pending re-insurance transaction with Global Atlantic. We did not incur material credit losses in our real estate portfolio or elsewhere during the second quarter.  Shifting to MetLife's business performance in the quarter, I will start with our US group benefits results. Adjusted earnings totaled $372 million with underwriting results in line with our expectations after reflecting certain unfavorable items. In total, year-to-date sales are up 13% while year-to-date adjusted PFOs are up 5%, reflecting the impact of par firmly within our 4% to 6% outlook range, which we expect to achieve for the full year 2023. Looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to sustain our growth trajectory in this attractive capital-light business for many reasons. The strength of our relationships with our largest national accounts, where our average customer has been with us for more than 20 years, is well-known. The power behind this strength is apparent when you consider that 75% of new sales are made to existing customers through product additions and enrollment growth. Our efforts to accelerate growth in regional business is evident in our market share gains. A key element of this success is driven by our expansive product portfolio, the broadest across the benefits universe. As a proof point, more than half of our new regional business customers purchase multiple products. And again, this can also be seen in our success with voluntary products, which we've been able to grow at a mid-to-high-teens rate for many years now. For retirement and income solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings totaled $417 million, up 11% from the prior year, driven by higher recurring investment margins and higher asset balances. Sales in the quarter were very strong across a range of products, including pension risk transfer with more than $2 billion booked, structured settlements, longevity reinsurance, and post-retirement benefits. We see good run rates for growth in all these areas. In Asia, adjusted earnings of $431 million were below a year ago on lower variable investment income. Our ability to bring new products quickly to market was on full display in the quarter. Sales on a constant currency basis were up 34% in the region, led by Japan, where sales jumped 42% year-over-year, led by the introduction of a foreign currency life insurance product. Turning to Latin America, which put up another strong quarter, adjusted earnings totaled $219 million. Further, Latin America posted gains in both sales and adjusted PFOs of 13% and 14% respectively on a constant currency basis. Taking a wider lens on the momentum in our business, we managed through the pandemic expecting to emerge from the turmoil stronger than we entered. With the fullness of time, we can now see that is true. Some numbers can help. In full year 2019, our group benefits business generated premiums, fees, and other revenues of roughly $19 billion. We are on track to generate group benefits PFOs of roughly $24 billion in 2023, representing $5 billion of growth at a CAGR of more than 5%. In 2019, our retirement income solutions business generated average quarterly adjusted earnings of $310 million, with variable investment income matching outlook expectations. So far in 2023, RIS has averaged about $410 million of adjusted earnings per quarter, without the benefit of normal VII. Similarly, our Latin America business averaged roughly $150 million of adjusted earnings per quarter in 2019, which has grown to an average of more than $200 million per quarter in 2023. To me, the message is clear. The fundamentals associated with our market leading businesses continue to gather steam. Moving to capital and cash, MetLife remained active with capital management during the second quarter. Following the increase to our common stock dividend, we paid roughly $400 million of common stock dividends to shareholders, and we repurchased $672 million of our common stock. The pace of repurchases in the second quarter slowed due to the impending announcement of our reinsurance deal. In addition to our activity in the second quarter, we repurchased roughly another $300 million of our common stock during the month of July. Here today through July, we have repurchased about $1.8 billion of our common shares, which leaves approximately $3.5 billion remaining on our expanded repurchase authorization. As we have done consistently over time, we carefully assess every use of capital with the goal of achieving the right balance between investing in responsible growth for the future and returning capital to generate sustainable long-term value for our shareholders. At the end of the quarter, we held $4.2 billion of cash at our holding companies, which is above the top end of the $3 billion to $4 billion liquidity buffer we maintained. In the beginning of July, we issued $1 billion of senior debt on attractive terms, which will be included in our cash balance in the third quarter. Beyond this, the dynamics of our reinsurance transaction will further add to cash as we move through the remainder of this year. During the quarter, we announced that Steve Goulart will retire at the end of August. Today will be his last earnings call with us. So feel free to pepper him with questions. You will not get another chance. I would like to take this moment to thank Steve for his 17 years of distinguished service to MetLife. In that time span, he led our corporate development and mergers and acquisitions team and served as treasurer before taking on his roles as MetLife's chief investment officer and the president of MetLife Investment Management. From a standing start in 2012, Steve established MetLife Investment Management and fostered its growth to its present status as a $167 billion institutional fixed income and real estate manager. I believe the talent at MetLife truly sets us apart and serves as a clear differentiator for our company. Steve's retirement provides the opportunity to broaden the roles and responsibilities of some of our top leaders. In addition to her role as chief risk officer, Marlene Debel will lead MetLife Insurance Investments with chief investment officer Chuck Scully reporting directly to Marlene. John McCallion, MetLife's chief financial officer will take on additional responsibility as the head of MetLife Investment Management. And Ramy Tadros, regional president to us business, will add head of MetLife Holdings to his portfolio. These moves draw upon MetLife's deep bench and illustrate our ability to deploy top talent to the areas of greatest impact for our customers and shareholders. In closing, MetLife's all weather strategy positions us to perform across a range of economic cycles. By focusing on what we can control, how we execute, how we invest, and how we deploy capital, we will continue to create long-term value for our shareholders and other stakeholders. Now I'll turn it over to John to cover our performance in greater detail. Hi. Good morning, Elyse. Michelle here. So I would say that there was a bit of catch-up in July given the fact that we were in blackout for, part of the second quarter due to the re-insurance transaction. So, if you look at probably the sort of run rate up to July here to date, I think that gives you a good sense of sort of pacing. We obviously we're looking to close the transaction in the second half of the year. And one we do, we'll assess the environment at the time. I think we've built a good track record here in terms of, after major divestitures in terms of how we we're deliberate and expeditious and returning access capital and, expect the same here. And my comment was around this competition as well because there's a limit, obviously, to how much they can reasonably improve. I'll just add two things, Tom. So I think to Steve's point around just losses, I think his reference to just materially less was relative to the stress that we had put out. The comments I made in the first quarter around what our expectations for kind of the maturities and kind of the potential loss there, I'd say no change is one. And then two, just maybe broadly speaking around just credit losses were very modest this quarter, as we said. And actually, I don't know if we even had any in real estate and CECL went down because there was a revaluation of a hotel that actually went up. So there's a lot of factors there. But I think all in all, the portfolio is performing well. Thanks. I would say from a top line perspective, we're still seeing significant strength across the portfolio. So we're very pleased with our PFO growth. And that's a combination of new customers. It's a combination of good persistency, rate actions for a portion of our portfolio. We've got some tailwinds in terms of wage growth. So we're still seeing very strong momentum there. As Michelle alluded to, we're still seeing double digit growth in our voluntary portfolio. And with a lot of white space, both in terms of customers who don't offer voluntary as well as increasing opportunities to increase penetration within the work site as well. And then I would also just point to the below 5,000 space, which we define as our regional market. National is above 5,000. That is emerging as a particularly bright spot for us. Our PFO growth there is high single digits. We do a fair bit of internal research where we cut the data by market segment. And when you look at that data below 5,000, we're a top three player in that segment, and we're continuing to take share in the fragmented market. So all in all, we're still seeing really positive tailwinds both from the macro environment as well as how we're positioned in this business that's driving PFO growth. That's kind of well within the 4% to 6% range that we have."

            "name": "Ramy Tadros",
            "content": "Hi, Elyse. It's Ramy. So the short answer to your question is yes. So these were unfavorable items that we don't expect to reoccur. Just to give you a flavor of what the items were. So the first one is an expense item which is related to a catch-up on state tax assessment. The second one is an adjustment on the life-free insurance policy. And the third one is a reserve refinement in our disability line which as John indicated impacted our non-medical health ratio by just about a point. So we don't expect these to be recurring as I mentioned. And so, you could essentially normalize for those on a go-forward basis. Sure, Erik. It's Ramy here. So, I'll start with disability. So, all results this quarter were favorable year-over-year. We're seeing favorable incidents and very strong recovery levels and I'm very pleased with the performance of that line this quarter. And as I just noted before, we have seen about a one-point impact on the ratio given some of those reserve refinements which we referred to earlier. On disability, we're continuing to benefit from tailwinds here in terms of favorable macroenvironment and interest rates and tight labor markets. But aside from the macro factors, we're also benefiting from our strong underwriting, our return to health capabilities, the deployment of data and technology and how we run this business. And we also continue to invest in our leave and absence capabilities which give us pricing power and continue to resonate well in the marketplace. From a dental perspective, we have seen a slight elevation, our trend this quarter, driven by an increase in our claims costs. As part of the normal course of managing this product, we adjust our pricing to make sure we meet our target margins. So as a reminder, we reprice the majority of our dental book, call it about 80% annually and we're always monitoring the trend and adjusting our pricing accordingly. So this is part of the course in terms of managing a dental book. And maybe if you want to kind of step back and look at the non-medical health benefit ratio for the full year which is inclusive of dental and disability, we expect to be at the midpoint of our guidance range for the full year here. Sure. I mean, I think if you're thinking about this over kind of the short to medium term, and I would say that like four factors, driving disability margins, you've got very disciplined underwriting, you've got strong claim management, you've got customer service that drives persistency and the ability to get appropriate rates at renewal. And this one is particularly important if you're in the business of providing bundled solutions, including absence and leave capabilities, which we are a market leader in.

And we're certainly pulling on every single one of those levers given our scale and capabilities in this business."

            "name": "Lyndon Oliver",
            "content": "Hey, yes, thanks Erik. It's Lyndon here. So look, we're very pleased with the overall sales performance we've seen in Asia in the second quarter. You've seen Asia's sales overall have grown 34%. And Japan in particular is up 42% and the rest of Asia up 17%. Now if we look a little deeper in Japan, foreign currency products continue to drive our sales growth over there. The market for single premium foreign currency products has been strong given the higher rate environment. And we continue to sustain our market position in the annuity segment. Michele pointed out in his opening remarks, our ability to bring new products to market quickly has really helped us in terms of launching our single premium foreign currency product. We've also optimized our capital structure for these products by leveraging our internal reinsurance in Bermuda. So the combination of both the product differentiation, the speed to market, as well as the strength of our distribution in the face to face as well as bank assurance has really been a strong factor in growing sales. If we look the rest of Asia, we've recovered really well this year. We've seen broad based improvement in China, India and Korea. And overall, all the initiatives we've taken on the customer side, the distribution side, as well as on the product, the new product launches have really helped in these markets. And if we look ahead to the outlook, our management actions have really continued to drive the sales momentum. But when we look at the year over year comparison for the second half, we're going to be challenged given we had a strong second half of the year last year. However, we're on track to be at the high end of the full year guidance of mid to high single digits. Yes, look, hey, it's Lyndon here. Let me make a couple of comments around this. So the ESR implementation is a couple of years away. And we continue to make very good progress looking at all these products under the new regime. But we're still early in the work and the regulations are still evolving. The second point here is we currently price our products on the MetLife's economic solvency and on a local statutory basis. So to some extent, we're already using an economic lens as we analyze product profitability. But as I said, it's a little early regulations continue to go to evolve. We're in the middle of field testing. So I think as our implementation plan progresses, we will start to make adjustments as needed. This would include reinsurance or product modifications or anything like that. But it would still be too early given it's a couple of years away."

            "name": "John McCallion",
            "content": "Thank you, Michelle, and good morning. I will start with the 2Q '23 supplemental slides which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our liquidity and capital positions. In addition, I'll provide an update on our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. Starting on Page three, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the second quarter. Net investment losses were primarily the result of securities that were associated with the pending reinsurance transaction with Global Atlantic that we announced at the end of May. For GAAP purposes, gross unrealized losses as of June 30 on securities expected to be transferred to Global Atlantic at closing are required to be realized through net income this quarter. In addition, we had net derivative losses due to the favorable equity markets, strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the Yen, and higher interest rates. That said, derivative losses were mostly offset this quarter by market risk benefit, or MRB remeasurement gains, due to higher equity markets and interest rates. Overall, the portfolio remains well positioned, credit losses continue to be modest, and the hedging program performed as expected. On Page four, you can see the second quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding a favorable notable item of $77 million in 2Q of '22, primarily related to a reinsurance settlement, which was accounted for in MetLife Holdings. There were no notable items in the current quarter. Adjusted earnings were $1.5 billion down 10%, and down 11% on a constant currency basis. The primary driver was lower variable investment income. Underwriting margins were also less favorable than the prior year, but within our targeted ranges. Higher recurring interest margins and solid volume growth were partial offsets. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.94 down 5% year-over-year on a reported and constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses starting with the U.S., group benefits adjusted earnings were $372 million, down 8% versus the prior year period. Results were below run rate expectations for the quarter due to certain unfavorable expense, reinsurance, and reserve related items, which reduced group benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $40 million, and were specific to this quarter. The group-life mortality ratio was 85.3%, essentially in line with the prior year quarter, and at the bottom end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 73.7% in the quarter, above the midpoint of its annual target range of 70% to 75%. We had a disability reserve refinement of approximately $15 million after tax, which increased the ratio by 0.8 percentage points, and was included in the items totaling $40 million that I just referenced. Turning to the top line, group benefits adjusted PFOs were up 4% year-over-year. Taking participating contracts into account, which dampened growth by roughly 1%, the underlying PFOs were up approximately 5% year-over-year, primarily due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum and voluntary, and was within our 2023 target growth range of 4% to 6%. In addition, group benefit sales were up 13% year-to-date, driven by strong growth across most products end markets. Retirement and income solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were $417 million, up 11% year-over-year. The primary drivers were higher recurring interest margins and solid volume growth. This was partially offset by lower variable investment income year-over-year. RIS investment spreads were 132 basis points. Spreads excluding VII were 142 basis points, up 29 basis points versus Q2 of '22, primarily due to higher interest rates, as well as income from in the money interest rate caps. RIS liability exposures were up 5% year-over-year, driven by general account liabilities, which grew 7% due to strong net flows. RIS adjusted PFOs excluding pension risk transfers were up 73%, primarily driven by strong sales of structured settlement products and growth in UK longevity reinsurance. With regards to PRT, we completed two transactions worth approximately $2 billion in the quarter, and continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia, adjusted earnings were $431 million, down 11% and 9% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower variable investment income. Adjusted earnings ran approximately $25 million above expectation due to certain reserve refinements and tax related true ups. Asia's key growth metrics were strong as general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 5% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 34% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by strong growth across the region. In Japan, sales were up 42% year-over-year, driven by continued strong momentum in FX annuities through our face-to-face channels, as well as life sales due to a relaunch of a single premium FX life product on April 1. We continue to see Japanese consumer interest for FX products given the attractive higher U.S. interest rates. Latin America adjusted earnings were $219 million, down 13% and 21% on a constant currency basis, due to less favorable underwriting margin versus 2Q of '22. The prior year quarter had a roughly $40 million benefit to adjusted earnings from a release of a COVID related IB&R reserve. In addition, investment margins were down year-over-year, partially offset by solid volume growth. Latin America's top line continues to perform well, as adjusted PFOs were up 23% and 14% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 13% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were $70 million, up 6% and up 15% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by higher recurring interest margins. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 4% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 13% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong growth across the region. MetLife holdings adjusted earnings were $211 million, down 31%. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $228 million, essentially flat versus an adjusted loss of $227 million in the prior year. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 22%, and at the low end of our 2023 guidance of 22% to 24%. On Page five, this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the prior five quarters, including $221 million in Q2 of \u201823. Private equity portfolio, $14.6 billion, had a plus 1.5% return in the quarter. Real estate equity funds of $2.2 billion had a minus 1.9% return, while both PE and real estate equity funds are reported on a one quarter lag. As of now, we anticipate that VII in the third quarter will generally be in line with the second quarter result. On Page six, we provide VII post tax by segment for the prior five quarters. As you've noted previously, each of the businesses holds its own discrete investment portfolios, which have been built to match its liabilities. As reflected in the chart, Asia, RAS, and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest portion of VII assets given their long dated liability profile. For 2Q of \u201823, Asia's VII portfolio generated the highest returns at 2.2%, outperforming MetLife Holdings at 1.5% and RAS at 0.9%. Now turning to Page seven, the chart on the left of the Page shows the split of our net investment income between recurring and VII for the past three years in Q2 of \u201822 versus Q2 of \u201823. While VII has had the lower than trend returns over the last few quarters, recurring income, which accounts for approximately 96% of net investment income, was up $700 million year-over-year, reflecting higher interest rates and growth in asset balances. Shifting your attention to the chart on the right of the Page, which shows our new money yield versus roll off yield over the past three years, new money yields continue to outpace roll off yields in the recent quarters. In this quarter, our global new money yield reached its highest level in more than a decade of 6.06%, 157 basis points higher than the roll off yield. We expect this favorable trend to continue assuming interest rates remain near current levels. Turning to Page eight, I'll provide a few updates on our commercial mortgage loans, which you can find further details in our quarterly financial supplement. As of June 30, our commercial mortgage loan, or CML portfolio, carrying value of approximately $53 billion is well diversified by geography and property type. The CML portfolio is concentrated in high quality properties and in larger primary markets. These loans are typically to the larger and stronger institutional sponsors who are better positioned to effectively manage assets through periods of stress. Given the focus on the office sector, our real estate team updated all U.S. office valuation through June 30, assuming a 25% peak to trough valuation decline. We believe it was prudent to focus our efforts here in the quarter given the heightened attention this has received. As expected, LTVs increased slightly as a result with our CML portfolio now in an average LTV of 62%, up from 58% in the first quarter of \u201823, and an average debt service coverage ratio of 2.3 times down slightly from 2.4 times in 1Q \u201823. The modest increase in LTVs coupled with the resiliency and robustness of the debt service coverage ratio is another indicator of the disciplined approach we take to investing in this asset class. The quality of our CML portfolio remains strong with only 2% of the loans having LTVs more than 80% and DSCRs less than one times. With regards to CML loan maturities, we now have successfully resolved 69% of the portfolio's schedule to mature in 2023, and our expectation is for minimal losses on the portfolio. Now let's switch gears to discuss expenses on Page 9.  This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio for full year 2022, as well as Q1 of '23 and Q2 of '23, which had a ratio of 12.2%. As you have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our Q2 direct expense ratio benefited from solid top-line growth and ongoing expense discipline. We remain committed to achieving a full year direct expense ratio of 12.6% or below in 2023, demonstrating our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. I will now discuss our cash and capital positions on Page 10. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.2 billion at June 30, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 to $4 billion and consistent with March 31. The cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, and share repurchases of roughly $700 million in the second quarter, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. The buybacks in Q2 of '23 were lower than our recent trend as we were in a blackout period for most of May in advance of our pending reinsurance transaction with Global Atlantic. That said, we have repurchased shares totaling approximately $300 million in July. For our U.S. companies, preliminary second quarter, year-to-date 2023 statutory operating earnings were approximately $2 billion, while net income was approximately $1.3 billion, statutory operating earnings increased by approximately $1.3 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable underwriting, partially offset by higher expenses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $17.4 billion as of June 30, 2023, down 2% from March 31, 2023, primarily due to the temporary impact of roughly $300 million associated with the investments expected to be transferred to Global Atlantic. We expect these impacts to reverse at close, which remains on target by year-end. In addition, as previously disclosed, we expect the transaction to add approximately 60 combined RBC points. Finally, we expect the Japan-Solvency Margin Ratio to be approximately 700% as of June 30, which will be based on statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks. Let me conclude with a few points. First, while VII remains below historical returns, we believe we reached a trough. In addition, core spreads remain robust and continue to benefit from a higher yielding environment. Second, the underlying strength of our business fundamentals continues to be displayed with strong top-line growth coupled with disciplined underwriting and expense management. Lastly, MetLife remains in a position of strength, given our balance sheet, investment portfolio, free cash flow generation, and the diversification of our market-leading businesses. And we are committed to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth and building sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Good morning, Ryan. It's John. I think we would probably follow the same commentary we've given before. We are continuing to look for ways to optimize. We look internally for ways to optimize, and we continue to have external communications around different opportunities. I think at the end of the day, similar to what we did with this transaction, it needs to fit the right profile for us. It needs to be value-creative. It needs to be risk-reducing. And by the end of the day, we don't have to. We're very comfortable managing these blocks of businesses ourselves. We have the expertise. And I think there are different ways to find ways to optimize that book. But nonetheless, it's a healthy process for us continuing to have these conversations. Hey, Jimmy, it's John. Good morning. Look, as we think about yield, as you said, we had a really strong quarter and certainly an RIS. We were 132 all in. And if you exclude VI, we're a healthy 142. And probably if you kind of normalize for VII, that puts us at the high end of the range, it's very much in line with what we gave at our outlook. We thought the first half of the year, even though the Ford curves have moved around and things like that, that we would have kind of a higher level in Q1 and Q2. I think as you look forward, we would think spreads kind of hover around this point. I'm not so sure it would kind of -- now, why it does that is not necessarily exactly, I'd say, perfectly aligned with the pass-through comment you made. I think there's a variety of other factors. I think it's just as the curve begins to shift, how the impact of the caps versus the long end start to manifest itself in spreads. But I think right now we would view the kind of the third quarter outlook would be somewhere in this vicinity or maybe the average of Q1 and Q2. Yes, that's fair. I think the key for us is, I'd say to your point, new business pricing is, that's where I think your point lies. I think, we still are on an overall basis have some -- we're short. So I think as there's roll-off reinvest, that's where my point was. Thanks. Good morning, Tom. It's John. We did see some unfavorability kind of towards the end of Q1 and into Q2 and maybe the first couple months of Q2 higher claims as well as some lower terminations on just on a relative trend perspective. Towards the end of Q1 or Q2, I should say, and then into July, we've seen those trends revert back. So right now, we probably would account for that as an aberration, a short-term aberration, but we'll obviously still monitor I think just an overall point around results for holding. While that's the case, we had favorable mortality in the segment. So that was a positive, but specifically the long-term care. That's the case. I think on the flip side, the team has been doing a really, really good job continuing to get rate increases. We've already met our typical run rate of rate increases this year at 4.5% of premium year-to-date. That's what we typically assume each year. So we're off to a great start there. Yes. Let's see. The resolution was basically in line with the overall portfolio. And of the office loans, roughly the same percentage were resolved. Trying to get the actual percentage of the office. I'll get that in one second for you. Hey, good morning, Mike. It's John. Yes, I think, as both Michelle and I mentioned in our opening remarks, our view is, yes, we've come to a trough. I think, different assets are in kind of different positions. But all in all, in the trough, we've seen some headwinds in real estate, the funds that I mentioned, minus 1.9, but we saw some positive offsets in the PE portfolio. We think that dynamic continues into the next quarter, which is why I mentioned we would generally be in line with now. Obviously it's early. We don't have a ton of, I'll say, objective insight. We have some qualitative commentary and views. We've seen a positive, equity markets, although might be driven by a small number of stocks, depending on how you look at the second quarter. So, but, and that typically directionally translates into some level of, I'll say, the positive in line return, but the betas are typically lower. So that's kind of where we are. We kind of view this trough as more of a U-shaped recovery in this asset class versus kind of a sharp V. But, and we just don't want to get ahead of ourselves. So right now we're, we kind of view that the best view would be kind of in line with Q2. Good morning, Alex. It's John. As you point out a couple things. One, obviously, VII being below the kind of historical returns puts pressure on C&O as well. So that's probably one driver to maybe the elevated loss that you're referencing. We did have higher expenses in C&O. Obviously, our direct expense ratio came in well. Overall expenses would were very good along with strong top line growth. So our ratio at 12.2 was well below the 12.6. We're still obviously targeting below the 12.6 for full year and it can fluctuate from quarter to quarter, but a good quarter nonetheless. In terms of the expenses, if you kind of compare to last year, I'd say probably two main things to highlight. One, interest on debt. It was one item year-over-year. That's a relatively big piece of that. And then the second one is we did have some higher one-time costs in C&O this quarter due to some corporate initiatives. I'll call it that, it was part of just kind of our general efficiency mindset. We don't ever exclude those things. Those are all part of our direct expense ratio, but their investments that we've made to kind of improve our run rate go forward. So hopefully that helps with C&O. Hey Alex, it's John. Obviously, very recent news. I'm not so sure I saw a ton of reaction yesterday on it and nor do we really think that it has a broad-based impact on, how we run our business or we wouldn't expect capital impacts, but I guess you never know, but right now, we wouldn't expect any impact one way or the other in terms of our, how we run our investment portfolio and our outlooks there. It doesn't change anything."

            "content": "Hey, Ryan, thanks for the question. I would hate to go through my last earnings call without a question. But on your question, let me talk about the total portfolio. Again, John mentioned 69% of the loans scheduled to mature this year have already been resolved. Of that, 31% of them were actually paid off. So very positive. And 57% of them were resolved through the borrower extension of contractual loan extensions. And we've talked about that a little bit in the past. But again, those are not financially distressed loans. I mean, the average LTV on those loans is 51%. And again, they have contractual extensions that allow the borrower to choose to extend. And that's what has happened with those. And again, when they do, they have to meet financial performance tests related to debt yield, related to LTV, sometimes both. We also get fees paid on those extensions. And so it's not a surprise, it's given where interest rates are, that this is what the borrowers would choose to do. The office portfolio is very similar in those statistics that I just gave. So we're very comfortable looking out the rest of the year. We would expect similar resolutions and are very pleased with how it's moving forward. Hey, Tom. It's Steven Goulart. Thanks for the question. And I think you were headed in the right direction basically. Obviously, we continue to do stress testing, but really nothing to note on that. We're very comfortable with the portfolio, very comfortable with the results of the stress testing. Certainly nothing's different. Anything may be marginally better than last time. You talked about foreclosures also. We did use a number. Frankly, it's going to come in materially less than that. We think we're going to have very small charge-offs in the portfolio as well. The portfolio is very well positioned. So I think we're very comfortable with it. And it will continue to perform through this. I'm sorry. The last part of the question was related to CNBS migration. Can you repeat the last question? No. We haven't had any material losses in that portfolio. Hey, Suneet, this is Steve too. And I just wanted to follow up. We did, sorry, I didn't have that answer at the tip of my fingers. But basically, it's just over five billion of total resolutions. And of that, nearly half were office."

        "date": "2023-05-04 12:45:23",
        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife First Quarter 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations. Pardon me. This is the AT&T operator, we have no sound.\nJohn Hall: [Technical Difficulty] slides that features, disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information, which you should also similarly review. I would like to point out, this is the initial quarter we are reporting our financial results based on the new long duration targeted improvements accounting standard. Please note that prior comparative periods have been recast to conform with LDTI. As usual, after prepared remarks, We will have a Q&A session. In light of the very busy morning, Q&A will end promptly just before the top of the hour. And fairness to everyone, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michel.\nMichel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Throughout MetLife's 155 year history, with risk management at our foundation, we have emerged from times of uncertainty in a stronger position and I expect now to be no different. We remain focused on managing risks across economic cycles and controlling the things we can control to deliver for our shareholders and our other stakeholders. Last night, we reported quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.2 billion or $1.52 per share, which compares to $1.7 billion or $2.04 per share a year ago. The quarter's results illustrate MetLife's resilience and underscore our continued strong business momentum and our ability to execute across what we control. We posted strong sales numbers representing responsible growth for most of our key businesses and markets, including Group Benefits, Asia and Latin America. We generated good underwriting results owing to our rigorous price discipline. We continued to manage our costs with vigilance and to beat our expense targets and prudent risk selection helped push recurring investment income higher while new money rate reached 5.8% for the quarter. Reflecting the market, variable investment income fell below our quarterly outlook expectation on the basis of returns on venture capital and real estate equity funds. In total, net income for the quarter was $14 million, driven by losses on opportunistic investment sales in Japan, which offset the tax impact on the gain generated by our recent Japanese A&H reinsurance transaction. Shifting to MetLife's business performance in the quarter, I will start with our U.S. Group Benefits results. Adjusted earnings totaled $307 million, up substantially from the prior year, when COVID-19 claims were more elevated with benefit ratios reverting to pre-pandemic seasonal norms. The momentum we've seen over the past several years for this franchise business continued in the quarter. We are strategically well-positioned to grow in this attractive business given our scale, distribution reach, broad product portfolio, enrollment capabilities and importantly our thought leadership. Our differentiation in the space led to strong growth in sales and premium fees and other revenues in all market segments and across voluntary products. In total, sales were up 15%, while adjusted PFOs grew 5.4% toward the top end of our outlook expectation after adjusting for participating policies. For Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS, adjusted earnings totaled $400 million (ph), down from the prior year driven by lower variable investment income. Adjusted PFOs in the quarter benefited from our sustained efforts to grow our structured settlement and our longevity reinsurance businesses. While we did not book any pension risk transfer business in the first quarter, funding levels remained strong. And despite the market turmoil during the first quarter, our capital markets investment products business was able to issue $3.7 billion of funding for the spread business, demonstrating the value of MetLife credit and the broader capital markets. In Asia, adjusted earnings of $280 million were below a year ago on lower variable investment income. Sales on a constant currency basis were up across the board in the region. Japan saw sales rise 17% on the strength of FX annuities, while India led the sales gains in other Asia, up 45% followed by Korea, up 21%. Turning to Latin America, adjusted earnings totaled $215 million, up more than 50% from last year. We are the largest life insurer in Latin America and our business continues to put up impressive growth numbers in our major markets with sales jumping 36% and adjusted PFOs rising 26% both on a constant currency basis. Taking a broader view of investments, rising interest rates are a long-term positive for MetLife. We have a long-time horizon and invest with our liabilities in mind. Our liabilities are sticky and are generally not subject to demand, asset liability management matching the duration of our assets with that of our liabilities, reduces reinvestment risk and is critical to our risk management process. Our investment process has stood the test of time successfully guiding us through the global financial crisis. However, we do not have the luxury to wait until a crisis hits. We look around corners and prepare in advance. Our investment portfolio derisking began in 2019 and we remain up in quality. Our core investment strengths have fashioned us as one of the premier private investors in the world, particularly in private credit and in real estate debt and equity. We have leveraged those strengths to support our policyholders, while building from a standing start, MetLife Investment Management, a leading third-party institutional manager of public fixed income private credit, and real estate. Moving to capital and cash. A tactical element of our business that we control. MetLife was active with capital management during the first quarter. We paid $389 million of common stock dividends to shareholders and we repurchased $780 million of our common stock. Also, we repurchased another $223 million of our common stock during the month of April. On the strength of our balance sheet and our free cash flow, we announced last week a 4% increase in our common dividend per share. We think an increasing common dividend per share is the hallmark of a strong life insurer and MetLife's common dividend per share has grown at a compound rate of 9% since 2011, with roughly $200 million left on our current buyback authorization. As you saw last night, our Board of Directors has authorized an incremental $3 billion increase to our buyback authorization. In the quarter, we announced and closed on the acquisition of Raven Capital Management, an alternative investment manager specializing in direct asset based investments. Aided by MetLife's strategic M&A capabilities, we were able to add an important investment product adjacency that we expect MetLife Investment Management to scale over time. Taken together, these actions demonstrate our commitment to being a sound capital steward for our shareholders. In the absence of responsible organic growth or compelling M&A opportunities, we will return capital over time to our shareholders. At the end of the quarter, we had $4.2 billion of cash at our holding companies, which is above the top end of the $3 billion to $4 billion liquidity buffer we maintain. Our holding company cash fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter. The balance in the first quarter typically reflects lower seasonal operating subsidiary dividends and higher seasonal holding company expenses. Before I close, I would like to take a moment to welcome Jeh Johnson to MetLife's Board of Directors. Jeh joined at the end of April and he brings unique perspective to our Board, having served as Secretary of Homeland Security under President Obama. I am certain Jeh\u2019s talents and experience will serve MetLife well. In closing, while 2023 is shaping up to be another year of uncertainty, the successful actions we've taken to focus simplify and differentiate our business can be seen in the quarter's strong underlying business fundamental, particularly in sales, underwriting and recurring investment margins. Raising the bar and demanding more from ourselves is part of the culture we fostered here at MetLife. If we focus on what we can control with the relentless execution in mind, we can stay ahead of the curve and I am confident we will continue to do so. Now, I'll turn it over to John to cover our performance in greater detail.\nJohn McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 1Q \u201823 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our liquidity and capital positions. In addition, we provided some supplemental detail of our investment portfolio given the heightened focus recently. The appendix also includes slides, which provide our full year 2021 and 2022 adjusted earnings re-casted for the new LDTI accounting basis. Starting on Page 3. We provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the first quarter. Net investment losses were above trend, primarily driven by sales of fixed maturity securities in Japan. Management took the opportunity to reposition some of the U.S. dollar portfolio to help mitigate some cash tax relating to our recent A&H reinsurance transaction, enhance net investment income, and improve asset liability management within the Japan business. These sales were neutral to a net positive to Japan's solvency margin ratio which is expected to be approximately 725% at the end of March. In addition, net investment losses in the quarter included an increase in the current expected credit loss or CECL allowance, primarily in our commercial mortgage loan portfolio given the current environment. That said, the portfolio remains well positioned and I'll provide more details shortly. We have itemized a new reconciling item between net income and adjusted earnings as a result of LTDI called market risk benefit, over MRB gains and loss. For certain products such as variable annuities with market related guarantees, the change in fair value excluding changes attributable to non-performance risk is recognized in net income each quarter. Similar to certain variable annuity guarantees previously classified outside of adjusted earnings, we'll also now identify MRB gains and losses as a reconciling item between net income and adjusted earnings. This loss was partially offset by derivative gains relating to lower interest rates. Lower interest rates in the quarter drove an MRB loss. This loss was partially offset by derivative gains relating to lower interest rates. However, we had net derivative losses in the quarter as these gains from lower interest rates were more than offset by derivative losses relating to the strong equity markets in Q1 of '23. On Page 4, you can see the first quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, which did not have any notable items in either period. Adjusted earnings were $1.2 billion, down 30% and down 29% on a constant currency basis. Lower variable investment income drove the year-over-year decline while favorable underwriting and higher recurring interest margins were partial offsets. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.52, down 25% year-over-year on a reported and constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses. Starting with the U.S. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were $307 million versus $117 million in the prior year period, primarily due to lower COVID-19 claims. The Group Life mortality ratio was 90.5% slightly above the top end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. As we have noted before, Group Life's mortality ratio tends to be seasonally highest in the first quarter. The drivers were excess mortality due to claims resulting from the year end, flu spike and higher severity. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 72.9% in the quarter, slightly above the midpoint of its annual target range of 70% to 75%, but generally in line with higher seasonal dental utilization in the first quarter. Turning to the top line. Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 1% year-over-year. As we discussed in prior quarters, excess mortality can result in higher premiums from participating life contracts in the period. The higher excess mortality in Q1 of '22 versus Q1 of '23 resulted in a year-over-year decline in premium from participating contracts, which dampened growth by roughly 4 percentage points. Taking participating contracts into account, the underlying PFO increase of approximately 5% was primarily due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary and was within our 2023 target growth range of 4% to 6%. In addition, Group Benefit sales were up 15% driven by strong growth across all markets. Retirement Income Solutions or RIS adjusted earnings were down 27% year-over-year, the primary driver was lower variable investment income. This was partially offset by favorable recurring interest margins year-over-year. RIS investment spreads were 117 basis points and 137 basis points, excluding VII, up 37 basis points versus Q1 of '22 and up 13 basis points sequentially, primarily due to higher interest rates and income from in the money interest rate caps. RIS liability exposures were up 1% year-over-year, but solid volume growth was masked due to certain accounting adjustments that do not impact fees or spread income. That said, general account liabilities, which comprise future policy benefits and policyholder account balances collectively grew 5% year-over-year and RIS adjusted PFOs, excluding pension risk transfers were up 43%, primarily driven by strong sales of structured settlement products and growth in UK longevity reinsurance. Once again reflecting the power of our diversified set of market leading products in RIS. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were down 53% and 52% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower variable investment income. Asia's key growth metrics remained solid as general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 3% on a constant currency basis and sales were up 18% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by strong growth across the region. In Japan, FX annuity sales continued its strong momentum with growth in our face-to-face and bank channels. Latin America adjusted earnings were $215 million, up 59%and up 51% on a constant currency basis. This strong performance was primarily driven by favorable underwriting and solid volume growth. Overall, COVID-19 related deaths in Mexico were down significantly year-over-year. The favorable Q1 underwriting benefited from seasonality as well as additional claims favorability in the quarter. In addition, higher recurring interest margins were mostly offset by lower variable investment income year-over-year. Latin America's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 26% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and sales were up 36% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were $60 million, up 9% and up 30% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by higher recurring interest margins and solid volume growth. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 5% on a constant currency basis and sales were up 27% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong growth across the region. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $158 million, down 55%. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income. Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $236 million versus an adjusted loss of $105 million in the prior year. Lower variable investment income was the primary driver. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 22% at the low end of our 2023 guidance range of 22% to 24%. On Page 5, this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the prior five quarters, including a $44 million loss in Q1 of '23. Private equity portfolio, which makes up the majority of the VII asset balance and is reported on a one quarter lag, had a positive 0.1% return in the quarter. Venture capital, which now comprises roughly 20% of the $14.2 billion PE portfolio had a negative 6.6% return. The remainder of the PE portfolio had a positive 1.9% return. In addition, real estate equity funds, which comprise roughly $2.3 billion of VII assets, and are also reported on a one quarter lag, had a negative 5.9% return in Q1 of \u201823. While VII underperformed this quarter and is approximately 4% of the portfolio. The three, five and 10 year cumulative private equity annual returns through Q1 of '23 were 19.8%, 17.2% and 16%, respectively. Demonstrating the long-term value of incorporating this asset class into our asset and liability management. On Page 6, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the four quarters of 2022 and Q1 of \u201823. As we have noted previously, each of the businesses holds its own discrete investment portfolios, which have been built to match each liabilities. Although not readily apparent in the chart, RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia continue to hold the largest proportion of VII assets given the long dated liability profile. Also, Corporate & Other currently holds an outsized amount of VII assets. We expect to reduce this balance over time as part of our normal ALM process. Now turning to Page 7. The chart on the left of the page shows the split of our net investment and income between recurring and VII for the past three years and Q1 of '22 versus Q1 of '23. While VII has shown lower than trend returns over the last few quarters, recurring investment income was up roughly $850 million year-over-year, reflecting higher interest rates and growth in asset balances. Shifting your attention to the chart on the right of the page, which shows our new money yield versus roll-off yield over the past three years with new money yields continuing to outpace roll-off yields in recent quarters. In this quarter, our global new money yield reached its highest level in more than a decade at 5.82%, 123 basis points higher than the roll off yield. We expect this favorable trend to continue assuming interest rates remain near current levels. Now let's look at our global investment portfolio on Page 8. As you can see in the chart, MetLife general account AUM shown at fair value as of March 31, 2023 is $424 billion. The portfolio is high quality and well diversified by asset class and geography. In constructing the portfolio, we use a disciplined approach to asset and liability management, in-depth underwriting and risk management. MetLife's global footprint combined with the local market expertise of MetLife Investment Management or MIM allows us to source high quality attractive assets that fit the needs of our businesses. Overall, the portfolio is well positioned and built for resilience through uncertain markets. And we have a strong track record of mitigating losses across all asset classes in the portfolio. From 2008 through Q1 of \u201823, our average annual impairment rate was 13 basis points for fixed maturity securities and only 5 basis points for commercial mortgage loans. Now let's discuss our commercial mortgage loan portfolio in more detail on Page 9. As of March 31, the CML portfolio carrying value of approximately $54 billion is well diversified by geography and property type. The CML portfolio is concentrated in high quality properties and in larger primary markets. These loans are typically to the larger and stronger institutional sponsors who are better positioned to effectively manage assets through periods of stress. In addition, almost all of our CML loans earn first-lien positions with less than 0.5% in subordinated loans. The portfolio has a low average loan to value of 58% with a high average debt service coverage ratio of 2.4 times. As shown on the table, only 0.4% of the CML portfolio has a higher than 80% average loan to value ratio and a below 1 times average debt service coverage ratio. The commercial mortgage loan allowance for credit loss stands at $319 million including the roughly $100 million increase in Q1 of '23 and considers the current environment as well as the risk around the economic outlook. We estimate that our allowance for credit loss is sufficient to cover current expected credit losses in the CML portfolio. The delinquency rate on the portfolio is only 5 basis points and is related to one loan as of March 31, 2023. With regards to loan maturities, only 14% of the CML portfolio are scheduled to mature in 2023 with 36% of these loans already favorably resolved through extensions or payoffs. Of our remaining 2023 maturities, we expect most will be similarly resolved with only 0% to 3% of our 2023 maturities potentially resulting in defaults. If the full 3% or approximately $200 million of loans were to default, this could result in an impairment of up to approximately $15 million. Continuing on Page 10, let's drill down further on our office commercial mortgage portfolio. As of March 31, the office loan portfolio was approximately $21 billion or 4.9% of our total general account AUM. The portfolio is high quality with 89% collateralized by Class A properties, which have seen less market pressure. The portfolio also has an attractive average loan to value ratio of 57% and an average debt service coverage ratio of 2.4 times. As shown on the table, less than 1% of the office CML portfolio has a higher than 80% average loan to value and below 1 time average debt service coverage ratio. The office CML portfolio is geographically diverse across Class A markets in the U.S. and internationally. While we remain confident in the office portfolio given this high quality, we have been very selective on new office loan production in the current environment. In 2022, office loans represented only 8% of our total U.S. commercial mortgage loan production. And since 2016, we have reduced our overall office exposure from approximately 50% of the CML portfolio down to 39% today. Now let's switch gears to discuss expenses on Page 11. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior five quarters, including 12% in Q1 of '23. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our Q1 direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline. We remain committed to achieving a full year direct expense ratio of 12.6% or below in 2023, demonstrating our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. I will now discuss our cash and capital positions on Page 12. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.2 billion at March 31, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion and down from $5.4 billion at December 31. The sequential decline in cash of the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend and share repurchases of roughly $800 million in the first quarter, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. Our first quarter tends to be lower in subsidiary dividends and higher in holding company expenses. As illustrated in the chart, you can see that the same seasonal pattern occurred from 4Q of '21 into Q1 of '22. Regarding our statutory capital. For our U.S. companies, our 2022 combined NAIC RBC ratio was 367% which is above our target ratio of 360%. For our U.S. companies, preliminary first quarter year-to-date, 2023 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1 billion, while net income was approximately $700 million. Statutory operating earnings increased roughly $500 million year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable underwriting, partially offset by lower variable investment income and higher expenses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $17.7 billion as of March 31, 2023, down 3% compared to December 31, 2022 due to derivative losses from certain equity options and dividends paid, partially offset by higher operating earnings. Finally, as I referenced earlier, we expect that Japan\u2019s solvency margin ratio to be approximately 725% as of March 31, which will be based on a statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks. Let me conclude by saying that MetLife's results reflect the strength of our business fundamentals, solid top line growth, favorable underwriting and ongoing expense discipline. While private equity and real estate funds underperformed this quarter, core spreads remained robust. In addition, results in our market leading franchises, Group Benefits and Latin America continued their strong top and bottom line growth. While market fluctuations are expected to continue, MetLife remains in a position of strength given our balance sheet, investment portfolio, free cash flow generation and the diversification of our market leading businesses. Finally, our commitment to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth, positions MetLife to build sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nTom Gallagher: Good morning. Couple of investment questions. So John, the 19% of office CMLs that mature in \u201823, you guys said 36% of them have been resolved so far through the end of April. Can you just elaborate a bit on what's actually happening there? What does resolved mean? I know, I think you mentioned either pay down or extended. As you're going through that process, are you \u2013 are most of them actually paying off a maturity? I assume there's not a lot of liquidity out there, so you're probably extending more than you're seeing payment in principle at the end here? And then also what kind of yields are you getting, assuming you are extending a lot of these or restructuring? Are you getting yields commensurate with the higher risk in the market for that asset class right now or are you having to subsidize amid all? Sorry for the rapid fire questions, but wanted to just get a better sense for what's happening.\nSteven Goulart: Good morning, Tom. It's Steve, and thanks for those questions. And talking about kind of what's happening, how we're managing the portfolio today. And John did give some high-level numbers. And when you look at how we're actually managing the portfolio, and there of course are a number of ways to resolve, most of what we're doing right now is on extending, but those are all extension options that are part of the original contract, where it's the borrowers' option to extend or not. And when they do, they still have to meet all of the various restrictions and requirements of the contract, including financial status, terms and conditions and the like. And there's usually a fee paid with it too. And they're generally all that market. So that's where we do see a lot of the activity in resolving the portfolio. And then looking at the -- we have conversations with virtually every borrower who has a maturity coming up this year. And basically, I think most of the borrowers who have that extension option probably will exercise them. We actually are seeing payoffs though, across the portfolio as well, so I think that that's a strong result too. I think, when we look at sort of numbers of loans, probably on the order of a quarter the loans, we're actually paying off to. So we're actively managing the portfolio as we always do, with obviously a heightened sense of attention today, but very confident. And John gave numbers, we think that there will be a very, very small number of -- or closures likely when we're through this year.\nTom Gallagher: Okay. Thanks.\nSteven Goulart: And your second question was, well, I can expand. I sort of answered your second question just saying the extensions are at market, but -- and also what I'd say is, yeah, this is a market where we're very picky. And looking at all of the office -- well, frankly, across all of the commercial loan space, we're getting kind of a minimum of 200 basis points over likely indices on floating rate loans or on treasury indices. And if we were to do an office, it would probably be at least 100 basis point premium over that too. So it's a market, where again you have to be very cautious, but there are opportunities as we've seen through other cycles in the past.\nTom Gallagher: That's really helpful. And just a quick follow-up. Last year, at the end of '22, I think you had a big increase in CM 3-rated (ph) loans that had an adverse impact on RBC. Can you talk about what you expect for migration positive or negative for '23?\nSteven Goulart: Yeah. And I think, first, we probably want to just address what happened with those numbers for the 2022 migration, because it's a fairly unique circumstance. I mean we do a reasonable amount of floating rate loans about 30% of our portfolio are in floating-rate loans. And just the way the mechanics of those LTV calculations work, there are lags involved. Net operating income is a three-year average, so when you think about something like caps, those basically kind of get delayed in how they work into the actual calculations. And so we do see that migration, but again over time, that cap income will also get incorporated in, obviously depending on the overall interest rate environment, so when we look at it, we're not really concerned that that's a credit issue. It's really just more the mechanics of the formulation and the timing. So that's what really is driving it. We wouldn't expect significant negative deterioration across the portfolio other than just the mechanics.\nTom Gallagher: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: And next, we move on to a question from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nErik Bass: Hi. Thank you. Maybe, Steve sticking with you for one and maybe just stepping back, I was hoping you could provide sort of an estimate as you think of kind of a more severe stress scenario for commercial real estate and office in particular. How do you think about what the potential capital impacts are in total if you add up impairments and ratings migration?\nSteven Goulart: Thanks, Erik. That's certainly is something that we spend a lot of time looking at and we regularly stress test the portfolio. We've just gone through another round of that testing, no surprises, just given what's happening in the market. And what I'd say, summary is, we're very comfortable with the portfolio. The implications of severe stress tests are really very modest. And what we did in our most recent stress test scenario is, we assume that all valuations across the entire commercial mortgage loan portfolio declined by 30% to 35% from where they are today. So think about that. That's pretty severe. And then you work that through in terms of impact on net operating income, loan migrations, foreclosures, REO impacts. The net impact to us from a capital perspective, we estimate, would really only be about 10 to 15 RBC points over three years. So when you really put that in the context of what it means to capital, it's very, very modest impact. And I think that is a very severe stress case as well. So I think it just -- it points to the overall strength of the portfolio and the overall strength of our capital.\nErik Bass: Thank you. Very helpful perspective. I guess, maybe turning to the business. For Latin America, you continue to see strong growth and it looks like you're running well ahead of what your guidance would imply for 2023 earnings even with some of the headwinds from VII and encaje (ph) this quarter. So I guess, is there anything unusually strong in the underwriting results in 1Q or is $200 million plus of run rate earnings kind of a reasonable expectation?\nEric Clurfain: Yes. Hi, Erik. This is Eric. So let me shed a little bit more color around LatAm, first, and then answer your question. So we have, as you know, a significant footprint in the three largest markets in the region. We are market leaders with a very strong brand in Mexico and Chile and a very fast growing presence in Brazil. Our strategy around the region is really centered around three pillars. One is protecting the core. The other one is growth through diversification. And all that underpins through a transformation to meet our customers' and our partners' evolving need. So I can give you a couple of examples that -- of the execution of this strategy around the region. So in Mexico, which is our third largest market globally, we have a very unique worksite government franchise that continues to grow very nicely, but in parallel, we've been very successful in diversifying and expanding that distribution reach into the private sector both in retail and group. In Chile, where we have a very strong face-to-face agency franchise, we're growing very fast our bancassurance and third-party distribution. And then in Brazil, which now represents roughly 20% of the region's sales, we're also growing very, very fast with 60% year-over-year this quarter alone. And there the focus is really on bancassurance and third-party distribution, so that continued momentum across the region really reflects the strength and diversity of our distribution channels and product offerings combined with the technology investments that allow us to continue to differentiate for our customers and our distribution channel. So overall, we believe we're really well positioned in the region to capture the growth opportunities that these markets that are still underpenetrated and underserved have to offer. Now going back to this quarter's results and your question particularly: This was another strong quarter on the heels of a record year, but as mentioned by John, this quarter strong results included about roughly $20 million of favorable underwriting really driven by seasonality and overall favorable claims experience. But that being said, we believe that the guidance we provided is still a reasonable run rate for the remaining of the year for the region. So I hope this helps, I give you a little bit more context around LatAm.\nErik Bass: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Next we go to the line of Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTracy Benguigui: Good morning. Just want to touch upon VII. In today's environment, do you still feel like $500 million of quarterly alternative asset returns is still an appropriate run rate? And if you can also touch upon what you're seeing intra quarter?\nSteven Goulart: Hi, Tracy. It's Steve. I guess I'd go back to how we talk about VII fairly consistently. And recall, we're not trying to predict quarterly, monthly, interim returns. I mean we really set our projection based on our long-term performance track record in the classes. And that's how we've come to the 12% number, 3% a quarter. So that's always our standard projection. Certainly, as we go through the year, we do look and given the lag, we can look and try and make some connections to what's happening in the markets. And I think that kind of relates to a little bit of what John talked about on our performance, although venture capital certainly was something that everyone was focused on for a while, so I think we did see those negative returns come through in the last quarter. So again looking ahead, I mean, I'd still look at what the overall market has done in the previous quarter just given the lag that will serve as some directional indicator for where we are. And I think our view is always that our portfolio should be less volatile and probably less extreme on returns than the overall market. So again I think, compared to last quarter, venture capital took a big hit across the rest of the portfolio. We actually saw pretty decent returns and looking at the LBO portfolio and some of our specialty sector like power, infrastructure, energy and those sorts of portfolios. So there is performance and I guess, I'd just look at the overall market as an indicator.\nJohn McCallion: Yeah. And I would just maybe add, Tracy. I mean I think obviously Q1 is a -- year-end marks. We're moving into now Q1 -- Q2 being off of Q1 results, so I think directionally we would be kind of optimistic that it would improve from Q1. Maybe we don't revert back to plan, but I think we're on kind of an upward trend.\nTracy Benguigui: Got it. And the first quarter was an active FABN quarter, you raised $3.7 billion. And some of these coupons not surprisingly were much higher than what we've seen historically. So my question is, do you feel like this product is attractive in today's environment or you could still earn like a 200, 300 spread by reinvesting or was the first quarter activity more a function of refinancing maturing issues?\nSteven Goulart: I'd say both. It was elevated activity-wise just because of maturities that we wanted to refinance, but we manage the program very actively. And it still meets all of our target thresholds for returns and income on the portfolio, so we're very happy with the returns.\nTracy Benguigui: So what kind of assets are you reinvesting in, in today's environment to make that return?\nSteven Goulart: Yeah. And again you have to go and look at the maturity because again it's still overall match portfolio, but what we're looking at are really mostly fixed maturities, structured finance, some private assets, not much in the way of real estate these days.\nTracy Benguigui: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mr. Bhullar, do you have your phone muted, we don't hear you. We will attempt to come back to him. One moment, please. Next, we'll move on to the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.\nRyan Krueger: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. You addressed most of this, but I just had one more question on CM ratings. When you do extend commercial mortgage loans, does that trigger resetting LTV and all the metrics that go into the CM ratings or does it kind of maintain the prior metrics that already existed?\nSteven Goulart: I mean, Ryan, I'd really relate it more to just our overall valuation process. When loans get refinanced or extended, there's a valuation that's right in line with our normal valuation process, so -- and like I said, most of the extensions we're doing are extensions that are at borrower's options who've met all the financial criteria required for the loan, so we wouldn't expect to see migration as a result of that.\nRyan Krueger: Okay. Got it. And then just one on retirement spreads that came in quite high on a base level excluding VII. Is that a level that you think in the current rate environment can be maintained near term?\nJohn McCallion: Good morning, Ryan. It's John. So like you said RIS spreads, I think overall 117, but ex-VII, were very strong in the first quarter at 137. And just recall, our overall all-in range was 135 to 160. So again, if you kind of add back a normal contribution to VII that would have been certainly high end of the range. And look, I think we highlighted this on the outlook call. We did think that the first half of '23, certainly based on the forward curve would have, I'll say, the higher end of spreads just given our in the money caps. We probably think Q2 has some kind of similarity to Q1 at this point for ex-VII spreads. And then we'll need to see how the forward curve and how rates progress through the rest of the year.\nRyan Krueger: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And next, we move to a question from John Barnidge with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nJohn Barnidge: Good morning. Thank you very much for the opportunity. Can you maybe talk about persistency of renewals in the group business? We've heard other participants talk about letting business walk that didn't match pricing objectives with this renewal season after a couple years of elevated experience, so curious your thoughts there. Thank you.\nRamy Tadros: Thank you, John. It's Ramy here. Maybe let me just give you the punchline in terms of the results we're seeing. Our persistency in terms of the Q1 renewals was extremely strong and it was higher than prior year across all of our major markets. So we're seeing very strong persistency alongside renewal actions that were very much in line with our expectations, so we're very pleased about the outcome as we go into the year. Maybe just to give you a bit of flavor on that: We've always talked about the group business as a business where price is important, but it's also a business where you can differentiate on many factors beyond price, right? And you certainly see that in our national accounts franchise. Our average customer has been with us for more than two decades. You see that in the very wide breadth of our products which allow us to be much more consultative with our customers and meet their needs. And you also see that because of our scale. So our scale has continued to afford us the ability to invest in our capabilities across the business and therefore drive greater persistency and stickiness with our customers, so all in all a very strong persistency as well as a rate action story for us in the first quarter.\nJohn Barnidge: Great. Thank you. And as a follow-up question, on Raven Capital. I see you, you obviously, announced another buyback authorization, but can you talk about market volatility and opportunities that may create to do other acquisitions either in products or geographic interest specifically? Thank you.\nMichel Khalaf: Yeah. Hi, John. It's Michel. The first thing I would point to is really the consistency in terms of our capital deployment. And you can see that over, I would say, a number of years and it was again evident in the first quarter. So if you just look at the first quarter, one, we saw sales growth across most of our key markets and businesses, so we're deploying capital to support responsible growth. We are active from an -- we were active from an M&A perspective. We announced the acquisition of Raven Capital Management, which adds an attractive adjacency to our main business which we think we can scale over time. We deployed $389 million in dividends and we announced a 4% increase in our dividend. Again if you look at the increase since 2011, 9% annual compound rate increase. And then we bought $780 million in our shares in Q1, another $223 million in April. And we have a new $3 billion authorization from our Board. Our liquidity at the -- we're above our liquidity buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion at the Holdco, so if you take all of these together, I think they signal sort of confidence in terms of our financial strength and the free cash flow generation capabilities of our businesses. So again, we're confident in terms of how we're positioned. And we'll continue to sort of explore M&A opportunities, provided those fit strategically or accretive over time, meet our minimum risk adjusted hurdle rates and the like. And we'll remain also disciplined on that front as we always have been. So hopefully, that gives you some color.\nJohn Barnidge: It does. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Next, we go to Suneet Kamath with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSuneet Kamath: Thanks. Good morning. Ramy, I was hoping you could unpack the group disability results a little bit in terms of what you saw in the quarter. We did have one company yesterday talked about sort of a pretty significant improvement in loss ratios and then actually persisting for the balance of the year. I'm just wondering how your business is doing and if there's any expectation for ongoing improvement as we move through '22 -- sorry, '23?\nRamy Tadros: Good morning and thank you for the questions. So inside our non-medical health ratio, disability business is a contributor to that. And we have certainly seen favorability in our disability results this quarter, and that favorability came in through both lower incident rates as well as stronger recoveries. And when we think about that favorability, there are some external factors in the environment and there are some internal drivers as well. So externally, you could look at the low unemployment levels as well as the fact that we're now clearly out of the pandemic environment, which kind of decreased the pressure on the STD line. So a favorable environment in Q1. Internally, when you look at disability, this is a product where our customers have complex needs. And here again, I would point to scale and investment you need to make here to really differentiate yourself in the marketplace and particularly differentiate yourself in terms of outcomes. So in our case, that's come from investments in our human capital. We've built a world-class team of clinicians who diligently work on returning people to health. We deploy data and analytics on our pricing, underwriting and our claims process. We have a world-class capabilities in terms of leave and absence, which again when packaged with LTD drive greater customer value and persistency in our books, so certainly a favorable disability ratio. As we think about the rest of the year, we continue to -- from a pricing perspective, we continue to bake in a load for softness in the environment. I mean it's so, that from a pricing and renewal perspective we continue to look at that and continue to bake in a pricing loan to make sure that our margins are resilient should we see softness from the claims side.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. Got it. And then maybe just pivoting to Steve on the CML portfolio. I know that Class B is a pretty small percentage of the office book, but as we think about those scheduled maturities for '23 and '24, any sense of, is it -- like what's the piece of it related to Class B? Have you resolved any of the Class B loans? Just some color on that would be helpful.\nSteven Goulart: Hey, Suneet. We didn't -- we haven't broken out the maturities. Again I think, if you look at the overall resolution and the path we're down, it's very strong for the overall portfolio, extension options were they are provided at market with fees and a good number of payoffs to -- so I'm sorry. I don't have the specific breakdown, but I'm very pleased with the overall structure of our resolution right now.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Next, we go to a question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question, I believe in your prepared remarks you guys mentioned that you might want to right-size the VII portfolio over time. Was that an overall comment on the portfolio, or was that just related to the corporate segment?\nJohn McCallion: Hey, Elyse. It's John. Yeah. I made the comment. I mean we -- more because, as you've seen, we probably have a little bit of outsized sensitivity in C&O for VII. It was a function of a number of things. Remember, last year, a year ago, we were able to monetize about $1 billion of our private equity portfolio. We also, just with some asset and liability management, moved a bit more into Corporate & Other. I would call that a holding pattern for now. And that's really the comment I'm making. And so it does, I think, on the margin cause us to probably -- we're not stopping our investment, but it's -- relatively speaking, it's the new commitments are a bit slower. But they're -- we're still doing that. We want to always invest through the cycle, but that was the gist of the comment.\nElyse Greenspan: And then your direct expense ratio, 12%, was pretty stable on year-over-year. And outside of group, it doesn't look like expenses moved much. How much active expense management is going on? And how much underlying pressure are you guys seeing from wage inflation or other drivers?\nJohn McCallion: Yeah. It's John again, Elyse. As you said, it was a good result for the quarter. Look, how much -- a lot of active management, a lot. And inflation is -- has been challenging. And I think we've seen that throughout the insurance industry in -- on both sides, and it's a challenging environment. And as a result, it takes active management. And I think our -- the culture here has been really strong around efficiency mindset. We continue to use that mentality to build capacity so that we can continue to invest in -- through these cycles and not let things like inflation slow us down. And it gives us optionality should we see more stressful environment. So I think the team has done a really, really great job, but it's -- every day, it's active management.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlexander Scott: Hi. Good morning. First one I had is for -- on Asia. Can you talk about the organic growth there and particularly how U.S. rates and I guess, JGB (ph) rates are impacting your annuities business there and in particular your ability to sell new product and have attractive product in the market?\nLyndon Oliver: Hi, Alex. It's Lyndon. Yes, look, we really are benefiting from the U.S. rate movement. It's really giving us an advantage as we compare to the Japanese rates. We've seen demand for the foreign currency products go up consistently over the year. If we look at fourth quarter sales, annuities were very strong and that continues as we go into the first quarter. So as far as rates go, it really puts us in an advantage as we're selling this product, but if you look at the fluctuation in the foreign currency, that is -- really kind of makes the market tentative going into the product. So overall I think rates have really benefited us in this environment.\nAlexander Scott: And then along the same lines, just, in LatAm, I just wanted to kind of peel back the organic growth a little bit and see if you can tell us a little bit about what you're doing, whether it's on distribution or actions that you're taking that are allowing for such strong organic growth and seemingly market share taking.\nEric Clurfain: Yeah. Hi. This is Eric. So yeah, as I mentioned earlier, really it\u2019s a combination of diversifying our distribution, combined with the introduction of new digital tools and active distribution growth through different channels. And our \u2013 again, our breadth and depth of our franchises in the key largest markets across the region.\nAlexander Scott: Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have no more time for questions. I will turn the call back to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.\nJohn Hall: Thank you for joining us today. And we appreciate your patience with the technical difficulties at the beginning of our call. We look forward to seeing you over the course of the quarter and have a nice day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation.

            "content": "Yes. Hi, Erik. This is Eric. So let me shed a little bit more color around LatAm, first, and then answer your question. So we have, as you know, a significant footprint in the three largest markets in the region. We are market leaders with a very strong brand in Mexico and Chile and a very fast growing presence in Brazil. Our strategy around the region is really centered around three pillars. One is protecting the core. The other one is growth through diversification. And all that underpins through a transformation to meet our customers' and our partners' evolving need. So I can give you a couple of examples that -- of the execution of this strategy around the region. So in Mexico, which is our third largest market globally, we have a very unique worksite government franchise that continues to grow very nicely, but in parallel, we've been very successful in diversifying and expanding that distribution reach into the private sector both in retail and group. In Chile, where we have a very strong face-to-face agency franchise, we're growing very fast our bancassurance and third-party distribution. And then in Brazil, which now represents roughly 20% of the region's sales, we're also growing very, very fast with 60% year-over-year this quarter alone. And there the focus is really on bancassurance and third-party distribution, so that continued momentum across the region really reflects the strength and diversity of our distribution channels and product offerings combined with the technology investments that allow us to continue to differentiate for our customers and our distribution channel. So overall, we believe we're really well positioned in the region to capture the growth opportunities that these markets that are still underpenetrated and underserved have to offer. Now going back to this quarter's results and your question particularly: This was another strong quarter on the heels of a record year, but as mentioned by John, this quarter strong results included about roughly $20 million of favorable underwriting really driven by seasonality and overall favorable claims experience. But that being said, we believe that the guidance we provided is still a reasonable run rate for the remaining of the year for the region. So I hope this helps, I give you a little bit more context around LatAm. Yeah. Hi. This is Eric. So yeah, as I mentioned earlier, really it's a combination of diversifying our distribution, combined with the introduction of new digital tools and active distribution growth through different channels. And our \u2013 again, our breadth and depth of our franchises in the key largest markets across the region."

            "name": "Michel Khalaf",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Throughout MetLife's 155 year history, with risk management at our foundation, we have emerged from times of uncertainty in a stronger position and I expect now to be no different. We remain focused on managing risks across economic cycles and controlling the things we can control to deliver for our shareholders and our other stakeholders. Last night, we reported quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.2 billion or $1.52 per share, which compares to $1.7 billion or $2.04 per share a year ago. The quarter's results illustrate MetLife's resilience and underscore our continued strong business momentum and our ability to execute across what we control. We posted strong sales numbers representing responsible growth for most of our key businesses and markets, including Group Benefits, Asia and Latin America. We generated good underwriting results owing to our rigorous price discipline. We continued to manage our costs with vigilance and to beat our expense targets and prudent risk selection helped push recurring investment income higher while new money rate reached 5.8% for the quarter. Reflecting the market, variable investment income fell below our quarterly outlook expectation on the basis of returns on venture capital and real estate equity funds. In total, net income for the quarter was $14 million, driven by losses on opportunistic investment sales in Japan, which offset the tax impact on the gain generated by our recent Japanese A&H reinsurance transaction. Shifting to MetLife's business performance in the quarter, I will start with our U.S. Group Benefits results. Adjusted earnings totaled $307 million, up substantially from the prior year, when COVID-19 claims were more elevated with benefit ratios reverting to pre-pandemic seasonal norms. The momentum we've seen over the past several years for this franchise business continued in the quarter. We are strategically well-positioned to grow in this attractive business given our scale, distribution reach, broad product portfolio, enrollment capabilities and importantly our thought leadership. Our differentiation in the space led to strong growth in sales and premium fees and other revenues in all market segments and across voluntary products. In total, sales were up 15%, while adjusted PFOs grew 5.4% toward the top end of our outlook expectation after adjusting for participating policies. For Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS, adjusted earnings totaled $400 million (ph), down from the prior year driven by lower variable investment income. Adjusted PFOs in the quarter benefited from our sustained efforts to grow our structured settlement and our longevity reinsurance businesses. While we did not book any pension risk transfer business in the first quarter, funding levels remained strong. And despite the market turmoil during the first quarter, our capital markets investment products business was able to issue $3.7 billion of funding for the spread business, demonstrating the value of MetLife credit and the broader capital markets. In Asia, adjusted earnings of $280 million were below a year ago on lower variable investment income. Sales on a constant currency basis were up across the board in the region. Japan saw sales rise 17% on the strength of FX annuities, while India led the sales gains in other Asia, up 45% followed by Korea, up 21%. Turning to Latin America, adjusted earnings totaled $215 million, up more than 50% from last year. We are the largest life insurer in Latin America and our business continues to put up impressive growth numbers in our major markets with sales jumping 36% and adjusted PFOs rising 26% both on a constant currency basis. Taking a broader view of investments, rising interest rates are a long-term positive for MetLife. We have a long-time horizon and invest with our liabilities in mind. Our liabilities are sticky and are generally not subject to demand, asset liability management matching the duration of our assets with that of our liabilities, reduces reinvestment risk and is critical to our risk management process. Our investment process has stood the test of time successfully guiding us through the global financial crisis. However, we do not have the luxury to wait until a crisis hits. We look around corners and prepare in advance. Our investment portfolio derisking began in 2019 and we remain up in quality. Our core investment strengths have fashioned us as one of the premier private investors in the world, particularly in private credit and in real estate debt and equity. We have leveraged those strengths to support our policyholders, while building from a standing start, MetLife Investment Management, a leading third-party institutional manager of public fixed income private credit, and real estate. Moving to capital and cash. A tactical element of our business that we control. MetLife was active with capital management during the first quarter. We paid $389 million of common stock dividends to shareholders and we repurchased $780 million of our common stock. Also, we repurchased another $223 million of our common stock during the month of April. On the strength of our balance sheet and our free cash flow, we announced last week a 4% increase in our common dividend per share. We think an increasing common dividend per share is the hallmark of a strong life insurer and MetLife's common dividend per share has grown at a compound rate of 9% since 2011, with roughly $200 million left on our current buyback authorization. As you saw last night, our Board of Directors has authorized an incremental $3 billion increase to our buyback authorization. In the quarter, we announced and closed on the acquisition of Raven Capital Management, an alternative investment manager specializing in direct asset based investments. Aided by MetLife's strategic M&A capabilities, we were able to add an important investment product adjacency that we expect MetLife Investment Management to scale over time. Taken together, these actions demonstrate our commitment to being a sound capital steward for our shareholders. In the absence of responsible organic growth or compelling M&A opportunities, we will return capital over time to our shareholders. At the end of the quarter, we had $4.2 billion of cash at our holding companies, which is above the top end of the $3 billion to $4 billion liquidity buffer we maintain. Our holding company cash fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter. The balance in the first quarter typically reflects lower seasonal operating subsidiary dividends and higher seasonal holding company expenses. Before I close, I would like to take a moment to welcome Jeh Johnson to MetLife's Board of Directors. Jeh joined at the end of April and he brings unique perspective to our Board, having served as Secretary of Homeland Security under President Obama. I am certain Jeh's talents and experience will serve MetLife well. In closing, while 2023 is shaping up to be another year of uncertainty, the successful actions we've taken to focus simplify and differentiate our business can be seen in the quarter's strong underlying business fundamental, particularly in sales, underwriting and recurring investment margins. Raising the bar and demanding more from ourselves is part of the culture we fostered here at MetLife. If we focus on what we can control with the relentless execution in mind, we can stay ahead of the curve and I am confident we will continue to do so. Now, I'll turn it over to John to cover our performance in greater detail. Yeah. Hi, John. It's Michel. The first thing I would point to is really the consistency in terms of our capital deployment. And you can see that over, I would say, a number of years and it was again evident in the first quarter. So if you just look at the first quarter, one, we saw sales growth across most of our key markets and businesses, so we're deploying capital to support responsible growth. We are active from an -- we were active from an M&A perspective. We announced the acquisition of Raven Capital Management, which adds an attractive adjacency to our main business which we think we can scale over time. We deployed $389 million in dividends and we announced a 4% increase in our dividend. Again if you look at the increase since 2011, 9% annual compound rate increase. And then we bought $780 million in our shares in Q1, another $223 million in April. And we have a new $3 billion authorization from our Board. Our liquidity at the -- we're above our liquidity buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion at the Holdco, so if you take all of these together, I think they signal sort of confidence in terms of our financial strength and the free cash flow generation capabilities of our businesses. So again, we're confident in terms of how we're positioned. And we'll continue to sort of explore M&A opportunities, provided those fit strategically or accretive over time, meet our minimum risk adjusted hurdle rates and the like. And we'll remain also disciplined on that front as we always have been. So hopefully, that gives you some color."

            "content": "Thank you, John. It's Ramy here. Maybe let me just give you the punchline in terms of the results we're seeing. Our persistency in terms of the Q1 renewals was extremely strong and it was higher than prior year across all of our major markets. So we're seeing very strong persistency alongside renewal actions that were very much in line with our expectations, so we're very pleased about the outcome as we go into the year. Maybe just to give you a bit of flavor on that: We've always talked about the group business as a business where price is important, but it's also a business where you can differentiate on many factors beyond price, right? And you certainly see that in our national accounts franchise. Our average customer has been with us for more than two decades. You see that in the very wide breadth of our products which allow us to be much more consultative with our customers and meet their needs. And you also see that because of our scale. So our scale has continued to afford us the ability to invest in our capabilities across the business and therefore drive greater persistency and stickiness with our customers, so all in all a very strong persistency as well as a rate action story for us in the first quarter. Good morning and thank you for the questions. So inside our non-medical health ratio, disability business is a contributor to that. And we have certainly seen favorability in our disability results this quarter, and that favorability came in through both lower incident rates as well as stronger recoveries. And when we think about that favorability, there are some external factors in the environment and there are some internal drivers as well. So externally, you could look at the low unemployment levels as well as the fact that we're now clearly out of the pandemic environment, which kind of decreased the pressure on the STD line. So a favorable environment in Q1. Internally, when you look at disability, this is a product where our customers have complex needs. And here again, I would point to scale and investment you need to make here to really differentiate yourself in the marketplace and particularly differentiate yourself in terms of outcomes. So in our case, that's come from investments in our human capital. We've built a world-class team of clinicians who diligently work on returning people to health. We deploy data and analytics on our pricing, underwriting and our claims process. We have a world-class capabilities in terms of leave and absence, which again when packaged with LTD drive greater customer value and persistency in our books, so certainly a favorable disability ratio. As we think about the rest of the year, we continue to -- from a pricing perspective, we continue to bake in a load for softness in the environment. I mean it's so, that from a pricing and renewal perspective we continue to look at that and continue to bake in a pricing loan to make sure that our margins are resilient should we see softness from the claims side."

We've seen demand for the foreign currency products go up consistently over the year. If we look at fourth quarter sales, annuities were very strong and that continues as we go into the first quarter. So as far as rates go, it really puts us in an advantage as we're selling this product, but if you look at the fluctuation in the foreign currency, that is -- really kind of makes the market tentative going into the product. So overall I think rates have really benefited us in this environment."

            "name": "John McCallion",
            "content": "Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 1Q \u201823 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our liquidity and capital positions. In addition, we provided some supplemental detail of our investment portfolio given the heightened focus recently. The appendix also includes slides, which provide our full year 2021 and 2022 adjusted earnings re-casted for the new LDTI accounting basis. Starting on Page 3. We provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the first quarter. Net investment losses were above trend, primarily driven by sales of fixed maturity securities in Japan. Management took the opportunity to reposition some of the U.S. dollar portfolio to help mitigate some cash tax relating to our recent A&H reinsurance transaction, enhance net investment income, and improve asset liability management within the Japan business. These sales were neutral to a net positive to Japan's solvency margin ratio which is expected to be approximately 725% at the end of March. In addition, net investment losses in the quarter included an increase in the current expected credit loss or CECL allowance, primarily in our commercial mortgage loan portfolio given the current environment. That said, the portfolio remains well positioned and I'll provide more details shortly. We have itemized a new reconciling item between net income and adjusted earnings as a result of LTDI called market risk benefit, over MRB gains and loss. For certain products such as variable annuities with market related guarantees, the change in fair value excluding changes attributable to non-performance risk is recognized in net income each quarter. Similar to certain variable annuity guarantees previously classified outside of adjusted earnings, we'll also now identify MRB gains and losses as a reconciling item between net income and adjusted earnings. This loss was partially offset by derivative gains relating to lower interest rates. Lower interest rates in the quarter drove an MRB loss. This loss was partially offset by derivative gains relating to lower interest rates. However, we had net derivative losses in the quarter as these gains from lower interest rates were more than offset by derivative losses relating to the strong equity markets in Q1 of '23. On Page 4, you can see the first quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, which did not have any notable items in either period. Adjusted earnings were $1.2 billion, down 30% and down 29% on a constant currency basis. Lower variable investment income drove the year-over-year decline while favorable underwriting and higher recurring interest margins were partial offsets. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.52, down 25% year-over-year on a reported and constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses. Starting with the U.S. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were $307 million versus $117 million in the prior year period, primarily due to lower COVID-19 claims. The Group Life mortality ratio was 90.5% slightly above the top end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. As we have noted before, Group Life's mortality ratio tends to be seasonally highest in the first quarter. The drivers were excess mortality due to claims resulting from the year end, flu spike and higher severity. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 72.9% in the quarter, slightly above the midpoint of its annual target range of 70% to 75%, but generally in line with higher seasonal dental utilization in the first quarter. Turning to the top line. Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 1% year-over-year. As we discussed in prior quarters, excess mortality can result in higher premiums from participating life contracts in the period. The higher excess mortality in Q1 of '22 versus Q1 of '23 resulted in a year-over-year decline in premium from participating contracts, which dampened growth by roughly 4 percentage points. Taking participating contracts into account, the underlying PFO increase of approximately 5% was primarily due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary and was within our 2023 target growth range of 4% to 6%. In addition, Group Benefit sales were up 15% driven by strong growth across all markets. Retirement Income Solutions or RIS adjusted earnings were down 27% year-over-year, the primary driver was lower variable investment income. This was partially offset by favorable recurring interest margins year-over-year. RIS investment spreads were 117 basis points and 137 basis points, excluding VII, up 37 basis points versus Q1 of '22 and up 13 basis points sequentially, primarily due to higher interest rates and income from in the money interest rate caps. RIS liability exposures were up 1% year-over-year, but solid volume growth was masked due to certain accounting adjustments that do not impact fees or spread income. That said, general account liabilities, which comprise future policy benefits and policyholder account balances collectively grew 5% year-over-year and RIS adjusted PFOs, excluding pension risk transfers were up 43%, primarily driven by strong sales of structured settlement products and growth in UK longevity reinsurance. Once again reflecting the power of our diversified set of market leading products in RIS. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were down 53% and 52% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower variable investment income. Asia's key growth metrics remained solid as general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 3% on a constant currency basis and sales were up 18% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by strong growth across the region. In Japan, FX annuity sales continued its strong momentum with growth in our face-to-face and bank channels. Latin America adjusted earnings were $215 million, up 59%and up 51% on a constant currency basis. This strong performance was primarily driven by favorable underwriting and solid volume growth. Overall, COVID-19 related deaths in Mexico were down significantly year-over-year. The favorable Q1 underwriting benefited from seasonality as well as additional claims favorability in the quarter. In addition, higher recurring interest margins were mostly offset by lower variable investment income year-over-year. Latin America's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 26% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and sales were up 36% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were $60 million, up 9% and up 30% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by higher recurring interest margins and solid volume growth. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 5% on a constant currency basis and sales were up 27% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong growth across the region. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $158 million, down 55%. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income. Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $236 million versus an adjusted loss of $105 million in the prior year. Lower variable investment income was the primary driver. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 22% at the low end of our 2023 guidance range of 22% to 24%. On Page 5, this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the prior five quarters, including a $44 million loss in Q1 of '23. Private equity portfolio, which makes up the majority of the VII asset balance and is reported on a one quarter lag, had a positive 0.1% return in the quarter. Venture capital, which now comprises roughly 20% of the $14.2 billion PE portfolio had a negative 6.6% return. The remainder of the PE portfolio had a positive 1.9% return. In addition, real estate equity funds, which comprise roughly $2.3 billion of VII assets, and are also reported on a one quarter lag, had a negative 5.9% return in Q1 of \u201823. While VII underperformed this quarter and is approximately 4% of the portfolio. The three, five and 10 year cumulative private equity annual returns through Q1 of '23 were 19.8%, 17.2% and 16%, respectively. Demonstrating the long-term value of incorporating this asset class into our asset and liability management. On Page 6, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the four quarters of 2022 and Q1 of \u201823. As we have noted previously, each of the businesses holds its own discrete investment portfolios, which have been built to match each liabilities. Although not readily apparent in the chart, RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia continue to hold the largest proportion of VII assets given the long dated liability profile. Also, Corporate & Other currently holds an outsized amount of VII assets. We expect to reduce this balance over time as part of our normal ALM process. Now turning to Page 7. The chart on the left of the page shows the split of our net investment and income between recurring and VII for the past three years and Q1 of '22 versus Q1 of '23. While VII has shown lower than trend returns over the last few quarters, recurring investment income was up roughly $850 million year-over-year, reflecting higher interest rates and growth in asset balances. Shifting your attention to the chart on the right of the page, which shows our new money yield versus roll-off yield over the past three years with new money yields continuing to outpace roll-off yields in recent quarters. In this quarter, our global new money yield reached its highest level in more than a decade at 5.82%, 123 basis points higher than the roll off yield. We expect this favorable trend to continue assuming interest rates remain near current levels. Now let's look at our global investment portfolio on Page 8. As you can see in the chart, MetLife general account AUM shown at fair value as of March 31, 2023 is $424 billion. The portfolio is high quality and well diversified by asset class and geography. In constructing the portfolio, we use a disciplined approach to asset and liability management, in-depth underwriting and risk management. MetLife's global footprint combined with the local market expertise of MetLife Investment Management or MIM allows us to source high quality attractive assets that fit the needs of our businesses. Overall, the portfolio is well positioned and built for resilience through uncertain markets. And we have a strong track record of mitigating losses across all asset classes in the portfolio. From 2008 through Q1 of \u201823, our average annual impairment rate was 13 basis points for fixed maturity securities and only 5 basis points for commercial mortgage loans. Now let's discuss our commercial mortgage loan portfolio in more detail on Page 9. As of March 31, the CML portfolio carrying value of approximately $54 billion is well diversified by geography and property type. The CML portfolio is concentrated in high quality properties and in larger primary markets. These loans are typically to the larger and stronger institutional sponsors who are better positioned to effectively manage assets through periods of stress. In addition, almost all of our CML loans earn first-lien positions with less than 0.5% in subordinated loans. The portfolio has a low average loan to value of 58% with a high average debt service coverage ratio of 2.4 times. As shown on the table, only 0.4% of the CML portfolio has a higher than 80% average loan to value ratio and a below 1 times average debt service coverage ratio. The commercial mortgage loan allowance for credit loss stands at $319 million including the roughly $100 million increase in Q1 of '23 and considers the current environment as well as the risk around the economic outlook. We estimate that our allowance for credit loss is sufficient to cover current expected credit losses in the CML portfolio. The delinquency rate on the portfolio is only 5 basis points and is related to one loan as of March 31, 2023. With regards to loan maturities, only 14% of the CML portfolio are scheduled to mature in 2023 with 36% of these loans already favorably resolved through extensions or payoffs. Of our remaining 2023 maturities, we expect most will be similarly resolved with only 0% to 3% of our 2023 maturities potentially resulting in defaults. If the full 3% or approximately $200 million of loans were to default, this could result in an impairment of up to approximately $15 million. Continuing on Page 10, let's drill down further on our office commercial mortgage portfolio. As of March 31, the office loan portfolio was approximately $21 billion or 4.9% of our total general account AUM. The portfolio is high quality with 89% collateralized by Class A properties, which have seen less market pressure. The portfolio also has an attractive average loan to value ratio of 57% and an average debt service coverage ratio of 2.4 times. As shown on the table, less than 1% of the office CML portfolio has a higher than 80% average loan to value and below 1 time average debt service coverage ratio. The office CML portfolio is geographically diverse across Class A markets in the U.S. and internationally. While we remain confident in the office portfolio given this high quality, we have been very selective on new office loan production in the current environment. In 2022, office loans represented only 8% of our total U.S. commercial mortgage loan production. And since 2016, we have reduced our overall office exposure from approximately 50% of the CML portfolio down to 39% today. Now let's switch gears to discuss expenses on Page 11. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior five quarters, including 12% in Q1 of '23. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our Q1 direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline. We remain committed to achieving a full year direct expense ratio of 12.6% or below in 2023, demonstrating our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. I will now discuss our cash and capital positions on Page 12. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.2 billion at March 31, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion and down from $5.4 billion at December 31. The sequential decline in cash of the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend and share repurchases of roughly $800 million in the first quarter, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. Our first quarter tends to be lower in subsidiary dividends and higher in holding company expenses. As illustrated in the chart, you can see that the same seasonal pattern occurred from 4Q of '21 into Q1 of '22. Regarding our statutory capital. For our U.S. companies, our 2022 combined NAIC RBC ratio was 367% which is above our target ratio of 360%. For our U.S. companies, preliminary first quarter year-to-date, 2023 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1 billion, while net income was approximately $700 million. Statutory operating earnings increased roughly $500 million year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable underwriting, partially offset by lower variable investment income and higher expenses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $17.7 billion as of March 31, 2023, down 3% compared to December 31, 2022 due to derivative losses from certain equity options and dividends paid, partially offset by higher operating earnings. Finally, as I referenced earlier, we expect that Japan's solvency margin ratio to be approximately 725% as of March 31, which will be based on a statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks. Let me conclude by saying that MetLife's results reflect the strength of our business fundamentals, solid top line growth, favorable underwriting and ongoing expense discipline. While private equity and real estate funds underperformed this quarter, core spreads remained robust. In addition, results in our market leading franchises, Group Benefits and Latin America continued their strong top and bottom line growth. While market fluctuations are expected to continue, MetLife remains in a position of strength given our balance sheet, investment portfolio, free cash flow generation and the diversification of our market leading businesses. Finally, our commitment to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth, positions MetLife to build sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Yeah. And I would just maybe add, Tracy. I mean I think obviously Q1 is a -- year-end marks. We're moving into now Q1 -- Q2 being off of Q1 results, so I think directionally we would be kind of optimistic that it would improve from Q1. Maybe we don't revert back to plan, but I think we're on kind of an upward trend. Good morning, Ryan. It's John. So like you said RIS spreads, I think overall 117, but ex-VII, were very strong in the first quarter at 137. And just recall, our overall all-in range was 135 to 160. So again, if you kind of add back a normal contribution to VII that would have been certainly high end of the range. And look, I think we highlighted this on the outlook call. We did think that the first half of '23, certainly based on the forward curve would have, I'll say, the higher end of spreads just given our in the money caps. We probably think Q2 has some kind of similarity to Q1 at this point for ex-VII spreads. And then we'll need to see how the forward curve and how rates progress through the rest of the year. Hey, Elyse. It's John. Yeah. I made the comment. I mean we -- more because, as you've seen, we probably have a little bit of outsized sensitivity in C&O for VII. It was a function of a number of things. Remember, last year, a year ago, we were able to monetize about $1 billion of our private equity portfolio. We also, just with some asset and liability management, moved a bit more into Corporate & Other. I would call that a holding pattern for now. And that's really the comment I'm making. And so it does, I think, on the margin cause us to probably -- we're not stopping our investment, but it's -- relatively speaking, it's the new commitments are a bit slower. But they're -- we're still doing that. We want to always invest through the cycle, but that was the gist of the comment. Yeah. It's John again, Elyse. As you said, it was a good result for the quarter. Look, how much -- a lot of active management, a lot. And inflation is -- has been challenging. And I think we've seen that throughout the insurance industry in -- on both sides, and it's a challenging environment. And as a result, it takes active management. And I think our -- the culture here has been really strong around efficiency mindset. We continue to use that mentality to build capacity so that we can continue to invest in -- through these cycles and not let things like inflation slow us down. And it gives us optionality should we see more stressful environment. So I think the team has done a really, really great job, but it's -- every day, it's active management."

            "content": "Good morning, Tom. It's Steve, and thanks for those questions. And talking about kind of what's happening, how we're managing the portfolio today. And John did give some high-level numbers. And when you look at how we're actually managing the portfolio, and there of course are a number of ways to resolve, most of what we're doing right now is on extending, but those are all extension options that are part of the original contract, where it's the borrowers' option to extend or not. And when they do, they still have to meet all of the various restrictions and requirements of the contract, including financial status, terms and conditions and the like. And there's usually a fee paid with it too. And they're generally all that market. So that's where we do see a lot of the activity in resolving the portfolio. And then looking at the -- we have conversations with virtually every borrower who has a maturity coming up this year. And basically, I think most of the borrowers who have that extension option probably will exercise them. We actually are seeing payoffs though, across the portfolio as well, so I think that that's a strong result too. I think, when we look at sort of numbers of loans, probably on the order of a quarter the loans, we're actually paying off to. So we're actively managing the portfolio as we always do, with obviously a heightened sense of attention today, but very confident. And John gave numbers, we think that there will be a very, very small number of -- or closures likely when we're through this year. And your second question was, well, I can expand. I sort of answered your second question just saying the extensions are at market, but -- and also what I'd say is, yeah, this is a market where we're very picky. And looking at all of the office -- well, frankly, across all of the commercial loan space, we're getting kind of a minimum of 200 basis points over likely indices on floating rate loans or on treasury indices. And if we were to do an office, it would probably be at least 100 basis point premium over that too. So it's a market, where again you have to be very cautious, but there are opportunities as we've seen through other cycles in the past. Yeah. And I think, first, we probably want to just address what happened with those numbers for the 2022 migration, because it's a fairly unique circumstance. I mean we do a reasonable amount of floating rate loans about 30% of our portfolio are in floating-rate loans. And just the way the mechanics of those LTV calculations work, there are lags involved. Net operating income is a three-year average, so when you think about something like caps, those basically kind of get delayed in how they work into the actual calculations. And so we do see that migration, but again over time, that cap income will also get incorporated in, obviously depending on the overall interest rate environment, so when we look at it, we're not really concerned that that's a credit issue. It's really just more the mechanics of the formulation and the timing. So that's what really is driving it. We wouldn't expect significant negative deterioration across the portfolio other than just the mechanics. Thanks, Erik. That's certainly is something that we spend a lot of time looking at and we regularly stress test the portfolio. We've just gone through another round of that testing, no surprises, just given what's happening in the market. And what I'd say, summary is, we're very comfortable with the portfolio. The implications of severe stress tests are really very modest. And what we did in our most recent stress test scenario is, we assume that all valuations across the entire commercial mortgage loan portfolio declined by 30% to 35% from where they are today. So think about that. That's pretty severe. And then you work that through in terms of impact on net operating income, loan migrations, foreclosures, REO impacts. The net impact to us from a capital perspective, we estimate, would really only be about 10 to 15 RBC points over three years. So when you really put that in the context of what it means to capital, it's very, very modest impact. And I think that is a very severe stress case as well. So I think it just -- it points to the overall strength of the portfolio and the overall strength of our capital. Hi, Tracy. It's Steve. I guess I'd go back to how we talk about VII fairly consistently. And recall, we're not trying to predict quarterly, monthly, interim returns. I mean we really set our projection based on our long-term performance track record in the classes. And that's how we've come to the 12% number, 3% a quarter. So that's always our standard projection. Certainly, as we go through the year, we do look and given the lag, we can look and try and make some connections to what's happening in the markets. And I think that kind of relates to a little bit of what John talked about on our performance, although venture capital certainly was something that everyone was focused on for a while, so I think we did see those negative returns come through in the last quarter. So again looking ahead, I mean, I'd still look at what the overall market has done in the previous quarter just given the lag that will serve as some directional indicator for where we are. And I think our view is always that our portfolio should be less volatile and probably less extreme on returns than the overall market. So again I think, compared to last quarter, venture capital took a big hit across the rest of the portfolio. We actually saw pretty decent returns and looking at the LBO portfolio and some of our specialty sector like power, infrastructure, energy and those sorts of portfolios. So there is performance and I guess, I'd just look at the overall market as an indicator. I'd say both. It was elevated activity-wise just because of maturities that we wanted to refinance, but we manage the program very actively. And it still meets all of our target thresholds for returns and income on the portfolio, so we're very happy with the returns. Yeah. And again you have to go and look at the maturity because again it's still overall match portfolio, but what we're looking at are really mostly fixed maturities, structured finance, some private assets, not much in the way of real estate these days. I mean, Ryan, I'd really relate it more to just our overall valuation process. When loans get refinanced or extended, there's a valuation that's right in line with our normal valuation process, so -- and like I said, most of the extensions we're doing are extensions that are at borrower's options who've met all the financial criteria required for the loan, so we wouldn't expect to see migration as a result of that. Hey, Suneet. We didn't -- we haven't broken out the maturities. Again I think, if you look at the overall resolution and the path we're down, it's very strong for the overall portfolio, extension options were they are provided at market with fees and a good number of payoffs to -- so I'm sorry. I don't have the specific breakdown, but I'm very pleased with the overall structure of our resolution right now."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife\u2019s SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.\nJohn Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, all. We appreciate you joining MetLife's third quarter 2024 earnings call. Before we begin, I point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release, and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Other members of senior management are also available to participate. We released our supplemental slides last night and they are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to them in his prepared remarks. An appendix to the slides features disclosures, GAAP reconciliations, and other information for your review. Q&A will follow prepared remarks and will end just before the top of the hour. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. On to Michel.\nMichel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Last night, MetLife reported third quarter results, which while absorbing pressure on variable investment income, affirmed the financial attractiveness of our businesses. Taking a wider view, year-to-date adjusted earnings per share excluding notable items are up 12%, pointing to our broader based momentum and a favorable underlying environment for our global set of market leading businesses. In the U.S, unemployment remains at historically low levels, inflation appears to be under control and the yield curve has started to see a positive slope beyond two years. These are conditions that favor both our Group Benefits and our Retirement and Income Solutions businesses. Outside the U.S, we are seeing a promising backdrop for many of our key markets. For instance, in Japan, the combination of modest inflation, the 10-year JGB near 1% and government incentives to save has the potential to put money in motion moving from the sidelines and into the investment and insurance products MetLife offers. Elsewhere around the world, in Mexico, near-shoring activities can put more people to work and at higher wages, which is good for the Mexican economy as well as for our business there. While in Brazil, the rapid adoption of digital distribution channels for financial products is democratizing financial services and bringing them to a wider audience of customers. Still, the geopolitical conditions that persist in many regions remain challenging and we have an election here in the U.S. next week. Yet throughout its 156-year history, MetLife has successfully managed risk and found opportunity in uncertain times. Our purpose always with you, building a more confident future resonates at times like these, and I have every confidence that MetLife will continue to create value for our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders going forward. Turning to the quarter, we reported adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.95 per share. After reflecting net positive notable items from our annual actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments, adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.93 per share. Recurring interest margins, underwriting and foreign currency exchange rates were all less favorable than a year ago, partially offset by volume growth and higher equity markets. As we had previously indicated, private equity returns came in below expectations leading variable investment income or VII to dip under the prior year period results. At the same time, real estate and other fund returns improved sequentially, extending the trend we've seen develop through the year. In the quarter, our key performance metrics reflect the power of our business. MetLife posted a 14.6% adjusted return on equity and we are on track to exceed our 13% to 15% target range for the full year. This further demonstrates our focus on deploying capital to generate responsible growth and high returns. And our efficiency mindset was evident in MetLife's third quarter direct expense ratio of 11.7%, an improvement year-over-year and below our 12.3% annual target. Shifting to business segment results. Our Group Benefits business reported adjusted earnings of $431 million excluding notable items, down from a strong underwriting quarter a year ago. On a year-to-date basis also excluding notable items adjusted earnings are up 7%. Our scale and broad product range have long been points of competitive differentiation for our Group Benefits business, contributing to our adjusted premiums, fees and other revenue growth. In the quarter, adjusted PFOs, excluding the [Technical Difficulty] policies, rose 5.3%. For the year-to-date period, adjusted PFOs on the same basis similarly grew 5.5%. With employee benefits enrollment season again upon us, this year, more than 1 million U.S. employees will be able to make their enrollment experiences easier by using MetLife's Upwise, a newly developed tool to help them choose and use their benefits. Upwise simplifies benefits selection by making custom recommendations based on an employee's individual needs and preferences. And Upwise is important because our research shows that more informed benefit selection decisions lead to a more engaged and productive workforce, a win for employees and employers. Moving to Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS. Adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, totaled $368 million in the quarter, reflecting the impact of interest rate caps maturing. Sales of stable value and U.K. longevity reinsurance remains strong, and we maintain our leadership position in the competitive jumbo pension risk transfer space. With a strong start to the fourth quarter, we've now closed $5.6 billion of PRT sales so far in 2024. We published our annual pension risk transfer poll last month, which continues to point to a robust pension risk transfer pipeline. The 2024 poll found that among companies with defined benefit pension derisking goals, a full 93% intend to completely divest their plans, up from 89% in the 2023 poll. Moreover, about half of these companies plan to divest in the next two to five years. Turning to Asia. Adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were $347 million, down 6% from the year ago quarter on market-related items, partially offset by favorable underwriting margins. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted earnings grew 16%. Asia's general account assets under management, a key measure for this region, grew 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Looking to Latin America. We saw strong bottom-line results with adjusted earnings excluding notable items of $217 million, rising 9% from a year ago. On a constant currency basis, sales and adjusted PFOs both grew double digits. Our momentum in Latin America has been building for some time. This can be seen in Brazil, where we have seized upon the growing adoption of digital distribution of financial sales to partner with some of the leading players in that market. To capture this opportunity, we have deployed an integrated technology solution called Accelerator, which allows us to meet customers where they are. MetLife Accelerator helps leading banks, retailers and other companies offer insurance to our customers with a simple, frictionless and fully digital insurance experience. Starting in Brazil. We branched out to bring this innovative technology to other core markets in Latin America, including Mexico and Chile with more than 4 million in-force customers in the region since launching a year ago. For some time now, we have spoken to the importance of value of new business as a critical management tool. Our focus and the intensity of our execution across this metric is impressive. For 2023, we generated a 19% internal rate of return on $3.6 billion of capital deployed, creating VNB of $2.6 billion with a payback period of roughly five years. It is even more impressive when you consider the substantial progress we've made over the course of the Next Horizon time frame, a 400 basis point increase in IRR and a two-year decrease in payback period, all of which adds up to more cash sooner. As you can see from our VNB numbers, MetLife prioritizes organic growth with attractive payback periods and internal rates of return. We also favor strategic inorganic growth with similar financial characteristics. When appropriate organic and inorganic opportunities are not available, we will return capital to shareholders via share repurchase while also generating attractive IRRs. Our track record proves this out. In the third quarter, we were again active in capital management and returned close to $1.2 billion to shareholders via common stock dividends and share repurchase. We distributed common stock dividends of roughly $400 million and bought back approximately $800 million of our common shares. This brings total common stock repurchase through the third quarter to about $2.8 billion. We still have more than $2 billion remaining on our Board authorization. Finally, at the end of the third quarter, we had $4.5 billion of cash and liquid assets at our holding companies, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. To wrap up, we are moving closer to our December 12 Investor Day, where we are excited to roll out our next five-year strategy, New Frontier. As I have mentioned, New Frontier is not a radical change in direction for MetLife. Rather, it takes us to places where we have the right to win. It is a growth platform that builds on the success of Next Horizon and provides a pathway to lead MetLife to even stronger performance in the future. We are in a much different position than we were five years ago, more front-footed and oriented towards offense versus defense. I look forward to expanding on the precepts of New Frontier, which are anchored on accelerating growth, boosting returns and fostering greater consistency. Now, I'll turn it over to John to cover our quarterly performance in more detail.\nJohn McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I'll start with the 3Q '24 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, including details of our annual global actuarial assumption review. In addition, I'll provide updates on our value of new business metrics and our liquidity and capital position. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the third quarter. Net income was $1.3 billion, $100 million lower than adjusted earnings. We had net derivative gains primarily due to the strengthening of the yen versus the U.S. dollar and the decline in interest rates in the third quarter. That said, derivative gains were partially offset by market risk benefit, or MRB, remeasurement losses due to lower interest rates. Net investment losses were modest, reflecting normal trading activity and a continuation of a stable credit environment. Overall, the investment portfolio remains high quality and resilient and our hedging program performed as expected. The table on Page 4 provides highlights of our annual actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments with the breakdown of the adjusted earnings and net income impact by segment. Overall, the impact to adjusted earnings and net income was modest. In Group Benefits, we had an unfavorable impact due to a liability refinement related to an annuity payout feature on a small subset of our Group Life portfolio. There is no ongoing impact due to this refinement. In Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, while we have maintained our long-term mortality trend assumption consistent with pre-COVID. This reflects the impact of higher mortality over the last few years, which resulted in a positive impact to adjusted earnings. And in Asia, the net unfavorable impact was primarily due to three factors: unfavorable changes to lapsed assumptions across life and accident health products in Japan; lower expected fund returns for variable life products in Korea; and these were partially offset by a positive impact from improved morbidity for accident and health products in Japan and Korea. On Page 5, you can see the third quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items. Adjusted earnings were $1.4 billion, down 8% and 6% on a constant currency basis primarily due to lower recurring interest margins, partially offset by solid volume growth year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.93, down 1% on a reported basis but up 1% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were $431 million, down 11% year-over-year, primarily due to less favorable non-medical health underwriting margins versus a strong comparison in Q3 of '23. The Group Life mortality ratio was 85.6% and 82.4% when excluding the notable items discussed earlier. This was below our annual target of 84% to 89%. Our mortality results remain seasonally strong, albeit following record-low life claims in 2Q of '24. Year-to-date, our Group Life mortality ratio remained at the low end of our annual target range, although we would expect the ratio to be toward the middle of the range in the fourth quarter. Regarding nonmedical health, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 72.4% in the quarter, within our annual target range of 69% to 70% but higher than the prior year quarter of 69% or 70.4% excluding a favorable notable item related to disability in 3Q of '23. Turning to the top line. Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 5% year-over-year and at the midpoint of our 2024 target growth range of 4% to 6%. Group Benefits year-to-date sales were up 9% driven by strong growth in national accounts. RIS adjusted earnings were $368 million, down 10% versus the prior year. Lower recurring interest margins were partially offset by strong volume growth and favorable underwriting margins. RIS total investment spreads were 106 basis points, down 15 basis points sequentially mainly due to the continued expiration of interest rate caps and lower variable investment income. As we highlighted in the Q2 earnings call, the continued roll-off of the interest rate caps drove the majority of the sequential decline. Given the vast majority of interest caps have expired and based on the current forward interest rate curve, we expect fourth quarter spreads, excluding variable investment income, to now stabilize and be flat to up 1 to 2 basis points. RIS adjusted PFOs, excluding pension risk transfers, were up 3% year-over-year primarily driven by strong sales in U.K. longevity reinsurance. With regards to PRT, we continue to see an active market. We had premiums of approximately $500 million in the third quarter, and we have already seen a strong start to Q4 with over $1.5 billion in PRT wins in the past month alone. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were $347 million, down 6% and 5% on a constant currency basis primarily due to market-related items in the quarter, partially offset by favorable underwriting margins. For Asia's growth metrics, general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis were up 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Asia sales were down 1% on a constant currency basis. Lower Japan sales were mostly offset by other Asian markets, which were up 10%, most notably due to strong growth in India and China. In Japan, sales were down 7% year-over-year primarily due to the impact of yen volatility on foreign currency products. However, we continue to see a favorable outlook given higher interest rates and positive macro changes in Japan. For example, our refreshed yen-denominated variable life and cancer products introduced earlier this year have been well. Latin America adjusted earnings were $217 million, up 9% and 21% on a constant currency basis primarily driven by strong Chilean encaje returns in the quarter and volume growth in our key markets. Latin America's top line also continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 1% and 11% on a constant currency basis driven by strong sales and solid persistency across the region. Turning to EMEA. Adjusted earnings were $75 million, up 7% on a reported basis and 9% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by strong volume growth year-over-year. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 11% and 14% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region, and sales were up 32% on a constant currency basis primarily from Turkey and Egypt. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $170 million, down 17% versus the prior year quarter. The primary driver was the foregone earnings due to the reinsurance transaction that closed in November of 2023. Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $249 million versus an adjusted loss of $262 million in the prior year. The Company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 24% and within our 2024 guidance range of 24% to 26%. On Page 6, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the prior five quarters, including $162 million in Q3 of '24. This was down $17 million versus Q3 of '23. The private equity portfolio, which had over $14 billion in VII assets as of September 30 had a positive 0.6% return in the quarter. This compared to a 1.4% return in Q3 of '23. While PE returns were below recent trends, our real estate-related and other funds of roughly $4.5 billion continued to improve with a 1.1% return in the quarter. As a reminder, PE, real estate-related and other funds are reported on a one-quarter lag and accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. On Page 7, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the last four quarters and the third quarter of '24. As you can see in the chart, RIS, Asia and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest proportion of VII assets given their long-dated liability profile. Now turning to Page 8. The chart on the left of the page illustrates the split of our adjusted net investment income between recurring and VII for the last three years, including third quarter of 2023 and '24. Adjusted net investment income in Q3 of '24 was essentially flat versus the prior year. While recurring investment income has benefited from asset growth and higher interest rates, it has been offset by the roll-off of interest rate caps. Turning your attention to the right side of the page. This shows our new money rate versus roll-off yield since the third quarter of '21. Over the last 10 quarters, new money yields have outpaced roll-off yields, consistent with higher interest rates. In Q3 of '24, our global new money rate achieved a yield of 6%, 22 basis points higher than the roll-off rate. The narrowing of the spread between new money rates and roll-off yields in 3Q was primarily due to a roughly 70 basis point decline in U.S. interest rates and elevated pay downs in the quarter of recently purchased higher-yield securities. That said, the proceeds from these pay downs in 3Q have been reinvested in high relative value public and private assets with similar yields. I would also note that the new money rate-related purchases in 3Q of roughly $14 billion, more than twice that of the invested assets rolling off. So, while the difference between our new money rates and roll-off yields shown here is as an indicative metric for future investment margin impact, it's only directional in nature and not a perfect depiction of spread impacts. At these levels, we continue to see positive impact of higher yields on our in-force and new business growth. Now moving to expenses on Page 9. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio for the full year of 2023 of 12.2% and the first three quarters to '24 all below 12%, including 11.7% in Q3 of '24. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our Q3 direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline. Looking ahead, we would expect our direct expense ratio to be higher in the fourth quarter, consistent with the seasonal nature of our business. That said, our performance year-to-date positions us to beat our full year 2024 direct expense ratio target of 12.3%, demonstrating our consistent execution and a sustained efficiency mindset. Now let's turn to Page 10. This chart reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments for the past five years, including an update for 2023. MetLife invested $3.6 billion of capital in 2023 to support new business. This was deployed at an average unlevered IRR of approximately 19% with a payback period of five years, generating roughly $2.6 billion in value. I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 11. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were $4.5 billion at September 30, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. Cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend and share repurchases of roughly $800 million in the third quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, we have repurchased shares totaling approximately $130 million in October. For our U.S. companies, preliminary third quarter year-to-date 2024 statutory operating earnings were approximately $2.8 billion, essentially flat year-over-year, while net income was approximately $2 billion. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $17.6 billion as of September 30, 2024, down 2% from June 30, 2024 primarily due to dividends paid and derivative losses, partially offset by operating earnings. Finally, we expect the Japan solvency margin ratio to be approximately 745% as of September 30, which will be based on statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks. Before I wrap up, I would just like to highlight that we have an updated commercial mortgage loan slide as of September 30 in the appendix. Overall, the CML portfolio continues to perform as expected with attractive loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios as well as the expectation of modest losses. In summary, while adjusted earnings were below our expectations primarily due to lower VII, the underlying strength of our business fundamentals was evident with strong top line growth, disciplined underwriting and prudent expense management. In addition, our strong value of new business metrics demonstrates our disciplined approach to deploying capital to its highest and best use, consistent with our all-weather strategy. MetLife remains in a position of strength given our balance sheet, free cash flow generation and diversification of our market-leading businesses, and we are committed to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth and building sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. Finally, let me close by saying that we look forward to seeing many of you on December 12 at our Investor Day, which will focus on the introduction of our New Frontier strategy. As we have in the past several years, we will be offering our near-term outlook in early February as part of our fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSuneet Kamath: I wanted to start with Group Benefits, if I could. I know your adjusted loss ratios are within your guide, but maybe a little bit higher than they've been tracking recently. So, can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about pricing in that business, particularly in dental, where I think you've seen some pressure? And maybe some comments on the competitive environment as well?\nRamy Tadros: Suneet, maybe I'll start with the competitive environment. I would reiterate we're not really seeing any change in the competitive environment in group. The market has been competitive, remains competitive. But having said that, we always did note that the pricing perspective is not an irrational market and the short-term nature of the products that we sell, in particular, also dental, means that any aggressive pricing will shop fairly quickly in earnings, which acts as a kind of a natural check on any irrational pricing. So, the headline for you here, yes, it's competitive, not irrational. And we do see kind of a competitive environment. That also extends beyond price as we've also talked about before in terms of capabilities, digital experiences, breadth of product and what have you. From a ratio perspective, I'll start with life. We're particularly pleased with the life ratio this quarter. It is still below our lower end of our guidance range once you kind of take that notable piece out. And we're benefiting from favorable incidents in the population, and you continue to see that in the CDC population data for the working age population. So, if you look at that life ratio year-to-date, we're at 83.9%. And even if you were to factor in a seasonally higher Q4 on the life side, we would still be close to the bottom end of the range for life. And then finally, moving on to the nonmedical health ratio. We're also within the range, as you pointed. We did have a number of smaller items in the nonmedical health ratio, which were unfavorable to the ratio. Those were worth about a point. So, if you take that out, it would bring us right back in the middle of that range. Then with respect to dental in particular, I did talk about the competitive environment. And we also did talk in the past about a market that's trending back to pre-pandemic seasonality and utilization levels. And we have seen these dynamics play out, and we have been taking actions in terms of pricing. So, think of that as really part and parcel of how we manage our dental block through cycles. The critical point I would make here is going forward, it's really about ability to reprice and maintain persistency. We can reprice about 80% of that business in any given year. So, while this quarter was higher than our seasonal expectations, our pricing for 1/1 reflects these dynamics. And we feel really good about returning back to our target margins for the block in 2025.\nSuneet Kamath: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, for either Michel or John, on the VNB slide, can you just talk a little bit about what's driving the improvement in the IRR and the reduction in the payback period? And have you sort of back-tested these IRRs? Because I'm assuming they're sort of pricing IRRs. And so, when you look at how these blocks have actually developed -- are they pretty close to your pricing assumptions? Or can you just give us some color on that?\nMichel Khalaf: Sure. Thanks, Suneet. I'll start and then I'll let John add some color as well. So really pleased with the journey we've been on here in terms of -- one of our main pillars for Next Horizon was the focus pillar, which is allocating capital to its highest and best use. And I think that's reflected in how we allocate capital in support of organic growth, of new business growth. And if you think about sort of the trajectory we've been on here, think about Group Benefits, Lat Am, two of our higher-return businesses, continuing to show really strong growth there. So that's certainly a contributing factor. We're not getting 19%, I would say, across all of our businesses, but the fact that we have businesses with higher returns growing faster than some of the other businesses, that's certainly contributing to the VNB picture you see on our slide.\nJohn McCallion: Yes. And Suneet, I think your -- it's a good question, the point around just back testing because as you said, this is -- these are IRRs on new business that we've priced based on our best estimate assumptions. And I think -- I have been thinking about that as well. And I think there's a couple of things. Certainly, the environment has been favorable here, right? I mean, in the case of -- if you just think about -- we've been in benign credit environment. Underwriting has generally been in line across our businesses and interest rates have been favorable. So, all of those -- so I think the answer is yes, it's hard to be really precise, give or take, on all of those things. But we think about -- we've asked the same question ourselves because, obviously, we're seeing the positive momentum here. And I think, just thinking a little more about the positive momentum, like Michel said, mix of business is certainly a driver there in terms of our new business. Two, I think the tool itself as a management tool has -- causes everyone to continue to refine things in terms of pricing, capital optimization, how you might use reinsurance. We did get some favorable regulatory changes. Like in Korea, for example, they've moved to an economic framework recently, typically favors up because we tend to follow an economic framework. So that has ultimately given us a lot more excess capital there that will over time be redistributed up into the holding company. And then, I think the third thing is there's been a trend of unit cost improvement there. So, I think all of those factors give rise to why you see this kind of migration occurring. And I think probably the biggest one is what Michel said, which is mix of business, you have high growth in -- certainly in some of our businesses that have had high IRRs from very low capital-intensive businesses like group and Latin America. So hopefully, it helps.\nSuneet Kamath: It does. If I could just throw in one quick follow-up. These IRRs, I mean, I'm assuming, this would give us a directional indication of where your ROE is headed given that they're unlevered returns?\nMichel Khalaf: Yes. I mean, I think that should give a good indication in terms of direction of traffic here, especially if you consider that besides what we just mentioned, the fact that MetLife Holdings, which is a low-ROE business, is running off. So, all of these factors combined, I think, would point to a ROE trending upwards.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJimmy Bhullar: I had a couple of questions. One was just on Japan sales. Should we assume that with the yen-dollar exchange rate moving around that Japan sales, especially dollar-denominated products, will stay weak in the near term? Or are there other sort of products that you're thinking about that should help mitigate the impact? And then secondly, on the portfolio, most of the metrics on your commercial real estate portfolio seems fairly stable with where they've been. But what are you seeing overall in the market? And do you think office and non-office, are they close to bottoming? And then there's been renewed concerns, I think, recently with the single asset, single borrower-type loans back in CMBS. And if you could just give some numbers on your exposure to those.\nLyndon Oliver: Great. Jimmy, it's Lyndon here. Let me take the Japan question. So, let's start with Japan sales, and I'll give you some color on overall Asia. Look, Japan is an attractive market. Look, we're seeing increasing interest rates as well as positive macro trends there. And what we are seeing is an overall environment for FX products that has become more competitive. If you look at Japan sales, they were lower year-over-year in single premium FX products. Now a few reasons. We face a tough comparative against last year. Sales in '23 for the full year were up 14% year-over-year. And then, as you said, while the yen has strengthened in the quarter, we do see continued volatility of FX markets, and that has impacted the sales of foreign currency products. So essentially, what we're seeing are more customers staying on the sideline during these periods of FX volatility. Japan sales for the third quarter sequentially were in line with where they were for the second quarter. Now we do have a diversified portfolio. We have both U.S. dollar as well as yen products in Japan. And we continue to evolve this product portfolio to maintain competitiveness. So, we've introduced several new products. We launched a refreshed yen-denominated variable life product. We've launched a cancer product earlier this year. Both products have performed very well. We've also launched a refreshed A&H medical product this month, and we're planning to launch a new U.S. dollar life product early next year. If we look at the rest of Asia, what we're seeing, our sales have gone up 9% year-over-year, and that's driven primarily from China and India. Solid performance in China, especially as we look across both our channels, bancassurance as well as agency. And if you look in India, we've seen sales increase sharply there with strong growth across all our channels. As far as an outlook goes, look, year-to-date sales have been in line with the prior year, and we expect full year sales for Asia to be close to flat year-over-year.\nJohn McCallion: Jimmy, I'll take your commercial mortgage comment or question. As you pointed out, I think despite the recent pressure, we've kind of commented on a few factors, right? There's been continued -- economic growth has been healthy. That has been good news for fundamentals of real estate. There's some modest trend towards in-office or even office has some kind of backdrop momentum here. And overall, I think as you point out, we feel -- outside of office, we probably feel like we've kind of hit the trough, and we've probably seen a positive outlook. There's healthy fundamentals overall now for the economy. You have like some at least expectation of some declining interest rates. Even steepening of the curve, I think, would be a positive here. You're starting to see increasing transaction activity. Even us in this quarter, we probably -- I think we had five sales of real estate properties for a gain, about $120 million, $150 million of gain in the quarter. So again, we're just starting to see more liquidity come back into the market. So, we think -- overall, there is a positive backdrop that's starting to emerge. I don't think we're out of it. We're not going to see kind of a V-shape recovery per se, but it certainly is setting up for a more positive 2025 environment. I think you asked about single borrower. I don't have the exact number on CMBS, but it's relatively small. I think I'd just give you a few statistics. We have about $10 billion of CMBS. And of that, over 80% or about 80% of that is rated AAA or AA. But the single borrower exposure is relatively small. I just don't have that at my fingertips.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Your line is open.\nTom Gallagher: First, just a follow-up on Group Benefits. Ramy, I think you mentioned, there were certain nonmedical health products that were elevated in the quarter. What were those -- outside of dental, can you -- what risks are those? Are those disability or something else? And is there a reason you would expect those to recover quickly? Or is there going to be some tail to those where you think those might remain elevated? And then also just on dental, how do you see that playing out? Is there -- does it take a year in terms of the way the repricing works versus the margin? Or is it quicker than that?\nRamy Tadros: Tom, thank you for the question. So, the one-timers were about one point in aggregate. So, think of them as -- the small items were about one point in aggregate. So, think of that as about $20 million post tax. And I would largely characterize them as one-timers. So, we've got some of -- small item on the reinsurance true-up, another item on timing of rate approvals. So, think of them as a collection of items that just all went against us in the quarter. Within the -- disability continues to perform very well for us, and we continue to see incidents in line with expectations. We continue to see strong recoveries in that line of business. So, that's a bit of a -- kind of some more color on those smaller items. But in aggregate, I would say, largely think of them as onetime in nature. With dental, we have been putting rate increases in the books since the beginning of the year. And as and when business comes up for renewal, these rate increases kind of will go into place. While we don't have complete visibility into 1/1, the visibility is pretty good at this point. And from what we're seeing so far, we are going to be back to our margin for the full year '25. So, this is not a multiyear issue. We're kind of towards the end of that cycle, and 1/1 would have us back to our target margin.\nTom Gallagher: Got you. And then just a question on risk transfer. A peer of yours recently said they looked into long-term care risk transfer, decided the pricing was too adverse, and they're moving on. They're not going to pursue anything beyond that. Curious if you've looked into that market and if you have, your view of it, do you share that view that the pricing is too onerous? Or is that something you might want to pursue?\nRamy Tadros: Tom, it's Ramy again here. While I can't comment on the specific of any peer. We continue to see activity in that market, I would say, increased activity, in particular over the last 12 months. And I would say, the bid-ask spreads are somewhat narrowing, which is, I think, encouraging as we think about our book and some of the bid-ask spreads that are out there. But as we've always said, our book is well capitalized, it's well managed. It continues to perform in line with expectations. So, we continue to assess risk transfer options. Clearly, any deal needs to create long-term shareholder value. So, price matters, structure matters here. But in general, I would say, active discussions and somewhat narrowing of bid-ask spreads there in terms of what we see.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is open.\nRyan Krueger: I had a question on RIS spreads. John, does your comment on the spreads stabilizing in the fourth quarter also translate into stable spreads in '25 as well based on the forward curve?\nJohn McCallion: Ryan, good morning. Yes, and just as -- just to kind of rehash what I said, right, we had we had a little bit more of a decline this quarter relative to what we had called out in the second quarter of 8 to 10 basis points on the core spreads, and it came in around 11. So, I think a good reminder, which I didn't say in my opening remarks, is that in the second quarter, we said 8 to 10 would occur as well, and we came in under that. So, a little bit of each of those quarters are a function of just what rates did in the quarter. And this quarter, we had we had some lower rates during the quarter. Although as everyone has seen, rates have ticked up, which gives us a little bit of the -- kind of optimism to being flat to up a few basis points come fourth quarter. We'll give more color in the outlook call in February. I think that maybe the -- but I will say that we do feel like we've gotten to a more stable spread, maybe is the way I'd put it. But curve matters. So that will be an aspect of what we do in our outlook. So hesitant to kind of call it now. I think we'll wait and see where the curve is, and also the sensitivities can change and things like that, very dependent upon kind of the outlook of the curve. But all in all, we are seeing more stability now. And so, I think that's a fair assumption for now.\nRyan Krueger: And then do you have any early insight into fourth quarter variable investment income at this point?\nJohn McCallion: I wish I could say yes, but probably -- I don't know if we have really good insights. I mean, look, at the end of the day, we probably have a -- we have a view. And I think the reality is that this portfolio in the sector of PE, they continue to adjust to higher rates and more volatile markets and a constrained set of exit options. That said, it was still positive returns this quarter. We also saw a positive rebound in the real estate and related funds there in the quarter, again, maybe referencing back to some of the comments I made earlier around kind of what we're seeing in real estate. And I think the other thing that I did call out, I think it was at your conference possibly, is that we had another $600 million of distributions occur. So, this is still giving a strong cash flow. I think performance has been good on a relative scale, I think, top -- kind of top half quartile -- top half performance, maybe second-quartile performance. In the quarter, when we went in and dug deep, we saw that there were probably a few one-off situations in certain funds in the quarter, where some of the funds had to mark a particular asset as opposed to broad marks across. We think that those are more one-off factors. So, if we were to normalize for them and use that as our proxy for the fourth quarter, you should think maybe total VII would be north of where we are today, maybe doesn't get us back to 2Q levels. So maybe you take the midpoint of those two as a good estimate for fourth quarter at this juncture.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Scott from Barclays. Your line is open.\nAlex Scott: I just wanted to come back to some of the comments on RIS and maybe even more broadly across the firm. Could you talk about your sensitivity to interest rates? Maybe help us think through what kind of floating rate allocation you have and maybe net of floating rate liabilities and so forth? And would be interested in RIS specifically. The shape of the yield curve changing the way it has, is that a net positive, negative? I just want to get a better feel for rate exposure.\nJohn McCallion: Alex, it's John, and welcome back. Yes, just as a framing, generally, for our portfolio is -- a steeper curve is better. So, we -- higher rates are better, steeper curve is better as well. So, I think that helps with maybe the direction of travel. In terms of like our floating rate assets to liabilities, we're pretty well matched. Sometimes, we have a little bit of floating rate assets in Corporate & Other. So that can be one place where you might see. But ultimately, a lower short end of the curve is better for us, and that's just how we typically manage our collective portfolio. So, I think the outlook slides we provided back in February of this year in terms of just parallel shifts in the curve are probably still pretty good proxies for the impact to our firm. But in terms of shape of the curve, I can probably just give you directional commentary at this juncture.\nAlex Scott: Got it. That's helpful. And as a follow-up, as we think through the strategies that's on the come here in December and thinking through the comments that it should provide further enhancement to returns. Will that come more through revenue growth and growing some of the businesses with higher returns? Or are there further levers that you can pull to take down that expense ratio and drive efficiency across the organization?\nMichel Khalaf: Alex, yes, I would say, it's a combination of continuing to grow high-return businesses, continue with the same discipline that we've -- that's now sort of -- really sort of a muscle that's very strong in the organization, I would say, in terms of how we price, how we bring product to market. And then to the point that John made earlier, our unit cost also has been coming down. So that's another contributing factor there. So, it's both of those things.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Wilma Burdis from Raymond James. Your line is open.\nWilma Burdis: Could you walk us through what you see as a more normalized run rate level of earnings for both group and RIS?\nJohn McCallion: Okay. I think, Wilma, I just want to make sure we were able to hear that. You just said, could you walk through more normalized earnings for group and RIS?\nWilma Burdis: Yes, yes, sorry.\nJohn McCallion: No problem. Okay. I can just start at a high level, and then Ramy can add. I think, obviously, RIS has been impacted by the roll-off of our interest rate caps. And I'd say, we've provided some guidance on that actually in February, roughly 8 to 10 basis points a quarter. I would say, basically, hit that on the mark. We were a little lower in that roll off and impact in the second quarter, a little higher than the third. Net-net, we probably ended where we expected. And now, we'll see -- we should see some stabilization in those levels for the fourth quarter and on. And I think for RIS, you have to take into account VII, right? And if you think about our earnings this quarter, that's obviously a fairly large delta for us relative to what we think our underlying run rate is for the firm. I think for group, you have to be -- seasonality matters a lot. So, it depends on what quarter we're talking about. But I think, as Ramy pointed out in some of his remarks, that we did have a few things that just went against us this quarter. And I think that's the case also in Japan and others. And it's just one of those things where we've got a few things that we don't expect to recur. They just tend to all happen in one quarter, and they all were relatively small but added to some numbers that all went in one direction. So, that's kind of how we probably see the quarter at this juncture. And I know you only said RIS and group, but I thought I'd give you a more holistic view of that.\nWilma Burdis: Okay. And then just maybe related to an earlier question, but could you just talk about the economic environment that would be supportive of VII returning to more normal levels?\nJohn McCallion: Sure. I think, as we were referencing earlier, certainly, higher interest rates have caused the sector to have to adjust, right? I mean it's been a sector that has benefited significantly from the lower-forever environment that no longer is forever. And so, as rates have risen, things have -- firms have had to shift back to kind of the growth model and -- as opposed to just the leverage model. And I think that was a strategy. I don't think it was wrong. It was just it was. And so, it's taking some time, coupled with the fact that the environment needs exit options and M&A or IPO activity, and that also has slowed a bit as a result of the broader macro environment. So, we think with the onetime, it's probably one factor that improves the sector. And the second is I think that as rates start to stabilize and probably the curve starts to stabilize more importantly, that will be kind of a positive aspect to support the sector.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nJohn Barnidge: My question is on real estate. Given the improved positivity in directionality and given it's more of a cycle asset class than anything else, do you think the recovery could be more extended in what goes into VII on a normalized basis post real estate recovery actually could end up being larger on the real estate side?\nJohn McCallion: And John, just to make sure I have that, you're asking whether there could be a larger allocation as a result of maybe the outlook? Is that what you mean?\nJohn Barnidge: No, not allocation. Just as the contribution to real estate in the third quarter of overall VII was larger than it was in the prior counters, as that cycle turns, should we actually think of that actually being larger possibly on the other side, not allocation.\nJohn McCallion: I mean, we've given some outlook -- in our outlook, we gave some views of returns for the asset classes. And obviously, they were predicated on a certain set of assumptions. Not all those assumptions have come true, and they aren't -- and that's expected. I still think using that relative scaling, even if the returns kind of migrate up, is still a good concept. And if you think about our real estate exposure in VII today, it's more in the, call it, core, core plus and maybe some bit of opportunistic. So, in terms of the expected return on those types of investments, you would think they're lower than what you would be expecting for, say, a PE or a venture capital fund.\nJohn Barnidge: That's very helpful. And then my other question, can you talk about the opportunity being opened up due to regulatory reform, not just in Korea but broadly in Asia? Could we be seeing more growth from those markets?\nJohn McCallion: Yes. I think just my -- I'll just say quickly my comment on Korea, and I think you probably caught on to it is, we do tend to work better in a more economic framework because we tend to run our firm very much like that. Obviously, you have to manage to the statutory constraints in any jurisdiction, and so you can't ignore them. But we certainly spend a lot of time thinking about the economic nature of our business. And so, that's one thing we saw in Korea. And I'm not so sure it opens up the environment or for business outlook per se, but we certainly think it's more favorable for us, and it avoids having to manage too many different constraints.\nOperator: Due to time constraints, we're going to have to cut the question-and-answer session short. I will now turn the call back over to John Hall for closing remarks.\nJohn Hall: Great. Thank you, everybody, for joining us today. Have a happy Halloween, and we look forward to seeing you where we can on December 12. Bye.\nOperator: Thank you. The meeting has now concluded. Thank you for joining, and have a pleasant day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michel Khalaf",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Last night, MetLife reported third quarter results, which while absorbing pressure on variable investment income, affirmed the financial attractiveness of our businesses. Taking a wider view, year-to-date adjusted earnings per share excluding notable items are up 12%, pointing to our broader based momentum and a favorable underlying environment for our global set of market leading businesses. In the U.S, unemployment remains at historically low levels, inflation appears to be under control and the yield curve has started to see a positive slope beyond two years. These are conditions that favor both our Group Benefits and our Retirement and Income Solutions businesses. Outside the U.S, we are seeing a promising backdrop for many of our key markets. For instance, in Japan, the combination of modest inflation, the 10-year JGB near 1% and government incentives to save has the potential to put money in motion moving from the sidelines and into the investment and insurance products MetLife offers. Elsewhere around the world, in Mexico, near-shoring activities can put more people to work and at higher wages, which is good for the Mexican economy as well as for our business there. While in Brazil, the rapid adoption of digital distribution channels for financial products is democratizing financial services and bringing them to a wider audience of customers. Still, the geopolitical conditions that persist in many regions remain challenging and we have an election here in the U.S. next week. Yet throughout its 156-year history, MetLife has successfully managed risk and found opportunity in uncertain times. Our purpose always with you, building a more confident future resonates at times like these, and I have every confidence that MetLife will continue to create value for our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders going forward. Turning to the quarter, we reported adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.95 per share. After reflecting net positive notable items from our annual actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments, adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.93 per share. Recurring interest margins, underwriting and foreign currency exchange rates were all less favorable than a year ago, partially offset by volume growth and higher equity markets. As we had previously indicated, private equity returns came in below expectations leading variable investment income or VII to dip under the prior year period results. At the same time, real estate and other fund returns improved sequentially, extending the trend we've seen develop through the year. In the quarter, our key performance metrics reflect the power of our business. MetLife posted a 14.6% adjusted return on equity and we are on track to exceed our 13% to 15% target range for the full year. This further demonstrates our focus on deploying capital to generate responsible growth and high returns. And our efficiency mindset was evident in MetLife's third quarter direct expense ratio of 11.7%, an improvement year-over-year and below our 12.3% annual target. Shifting to business segment results. Our Group Benefits business reported adjusted earnings of $431 million excluding notable items, down from a strong underwriting quarter a year ago. On a year-to-date basis also excluding notable items adjusted earnings are up 7%. Our scale and broad product range have long been points of competitive differentiation for our Group Benefits business, contributing to our adjusted premiums, fees and other revenue growth. In the quarter, adjusted PFOs, excluding the [Technical Difficulty] policies, rose 5.3%. For the year-to-date period, adjusted PFOs on the same basis similarly grew 5.5%. With employee benefits enrollment season again upon us, this year, more than 1 million U.S. employees will be able to make their enrollment experiences easier by using MetLife's Upwise, a newly developed tool to help them choose and use their benefits. Upwise simplifies benefits selection by making custom recommendations based on an employee's individual needs and preferences. And Upwise is important because our research shows that more informed benefit selection decisions lead to a more engaged and productive workforce, a win for employees and employers. Moving to Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS. Adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, totaled $368 million in the quarter, reflecting the impact of interest rate caps maturing. Sales of stable value and U.K. longevity reinsurance remains strong, and we maintain our leadership position in the competitive jumbo pension risk transfer space. With a strong start to the fourth quarter, we've now closed $5.6 billion of PRT sales so far in 2024. We published our annual pension risk transfer poll last month, which continues to point to a robust pension risk transfer pipeline. The 2024 poll found that among companies with defined benefit pension derisking goals, a full 93% intend to completely divest their plans, up from 89% in the 2023 poll. Moreover, about half of these companies plan to divest in the next two to five years. Turning to Asia. Adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were $347 million, down 6% from the year ago quarter on market-related items, partially offset by favorable underwriting margins. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted earnings grew 16%. Asia's general account assets under management, a key measure for this region, grew 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Looking to Latin America. We saw strong bottom-line results with adjusted earnings excluding notable items of $217 million, rising 9% from a year ago. On a constant currency basis, sales and adjusted PFOs both grew double digits. Our momentum in Latin America has been building for some time. This can be seen in Brazil, where we have seized upon the growing adoption of digital distribution of financial sales to partner with some of the leading players in that market. To capture this opportunity, we have deployed an integrated technology solution called Accelerator, which allows us to meet customers where they are. MetLife Accelerator helps leading banks, retailers and other companies offer insurance to our customers with a simple, frictionless and fully digital insurance experience. Starting in Brazil. We branched out to bring this innovative technology to other core markets in Latin America, including Mexico and Chile with more than 4 million in-force customers in the region since launching a year ago. For some time now, we have spoken to the importance of value of new business as a critical management tool. Our focus and the intensity of our execution across this metric is impressive. For 2023, we generated a 19% internal rate of return on $3.6 billion of capital deployed, creating VNB of $2.6 billion with a payback period of roughly five years. It is even more impressive when you consider the substantial progress we've made over the course of the Next Horizon time frame, a 400 basis point increase in IRR and a two-year decrease in payback period, all of which adds up to more cash sooner. As you can see from our VNB numbers, MetLife prioritizes organic growth with attractive payback periods and internal rates of return. We also favor strategic inorganic growth with similar financial characteristics. When appropriate organic and inorganic opportunities are not available, we will return capital to shareholders via share repurchase while also generating attractive IRRs. Our track record proves this out. In the third quarter, we were again active in capital management and returned close to $1.2 billion to shareholders via common stock dividends and share repurchase. We distributed common stock dividends of roughly $400 million and bought back approximately $800 million of our common shares. This brings total common stock repurchase through the third quarter to about $2.8 billion. We still have more than $2 billion remaining on our Board authorization. Finally, at the end of the third quarter, we had $4.5 billion of cash and liquid assets at our holding companies, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. To wrap up, we are moving closer to our December 12 Investor Day, where we are excited to roll out our next five-year strategy, New Frontier. As I have mentioned, New Frontier is not a radical change in direction for MetLife. Rather, it takes us to places where we have the right to win. It is a growth platform that builds on the success of Next Horizon and provides a pathway to lead MetLife to even stronger performance in the future. We are in a much different position than we were five years ago, more front-footed and oriented towards offense versus defense. I look forward to expanding on the precepts of New Frontier, which are anchored on accelerating growth, boosting returns and fostering greater consistency. Now, I'll turn it over to John to cover our quarterly performance in more detail. Sure. Thanks, Suneet. I'll start and then I'll let John add some color as well. So really pleased with the journey we've been on here in terms of -- one of our main pillars for Next Horizon was the focus pillar, which is allocating capital to its highest and best use. And I think that's reflected in how we allocate capital in support of organic growth, of new business growth. And if you think about sort of the trajectory we've been on here, think about Group Benefits, Lat Am, two of our higher-return businesses, continuing to show really strong growth there. So that's certainly a contributing factor. We're not getting 19%, I would say, across all of our businesses, but the fact that we have businesses with higher returns growing faster than some of the other businesses, that's certainly contributing to the VNB picture you see on our slide. Yes. I mean, I think that should give a good indication in terms of direction of traffic here, especially if you consider that besides what we just mentioned, the fact that MetLife Holdings, which is a low-ROE business, is running off. So, all of these factors combined, I think, would point to a ROE trending upwards. Alex, yes, I would say, it's a combination of continuing to grow high-return businesses, continue with the same discipline that we've -- that's now sort of -- really sort of a muscle that's very strong in the organization, I would say, in terms of how we price, how we bring product to market. And then to the point that John made earlier, our unit cost also has been coming down. So that's another contributing factor there. So, it's both of those things."

            "name": "Ramy Tadros",
            "content": "Suneet, maybe I'll start with the competitive environment. I would reiterate we're not really seeing any change in the competitive environment in group. The market has been competitive, remains competitive. But having said that, we always did note that the pricing perspective is not an irrational market and the short-term nature of the products that we sell, in particular, also dental, means that any aggressive pricing will shop fairly quickly in earnings, which acts as a kind of a natural check on any irrational pricing. So, the headline for you here, yes, it's competitive, not irrational. And we do see kind of a competitive environment. That also extends beyond price as we've also talked about before in terms of capabilities, digital experiences, breadth of product and what have you. From a ratio perspective, I'll start with life. We're particularly pleased with the life ratio this quarter. It is still below our lower end of our guidance range once you kind of take that notable piece out. And we're benefiting from favorable incidents in the population, and you continue to see that in the CDC population data for the working age population. So, if you look at that life ratio year-to-date, we're at 83.9%. And even if you were to factor in a seasonally higher Q4 on the life side, we would still be close to the bottom end of the range for life. And then finally, moving on to the nonmedical health ratio. We're also within the range, as you pointed. We did have a number of smaller items in the nonmedical health ratio, which were unfavorable to the ratio. Those were worth about a point. So, if you take that out, it would bring us right back in the middle of that range. Then with respect to dental in particular, I did talk about the competitive environment. And we also did talk in the past about a market that's trending back to pre-pandemic seasonality and utilization levels. And we have seen these dynamics play out, and we have been taking actions in terms of pricing. So, think of that as really part and parcel of how we manage our dental block through cycles. The critical point I would make here is going forward, it's really about ability to reprice and maintain persistency. We can reprice about 80% of that business in any given year. So, while this quarter was higher than our seasonal expectations, our pricing for 1/1 reflects these dynamics. And we feel really good about returning back to our target margins for the block in 2025. Tom, thank you for the question. So, the one-timers were about one point in aggregate. So, think of them as -- the small items were about one point in aggregate. So, think of that as about $20 million post tax. And I would largely characterize them as one-timers. So, we've got some of -- small item on the reinsurance true-up, another item on timing of rate approvals. So, think of them as a collection of items that just all went against us in the quarter. Within the -- disability continues to perform very well for us, and we continue to see incidents in line with expectations. We continue to see strong recoveries in that line of business. So, that's a bit of a -- kind of some more color on those smaller items. But in aggregate, I would say, largely think of them as onetime in nature. With dental, we have been putting rate increases in the books since the beginning of the year. And as and when business comes up for renewal, these rate increases kind of will go into place. While we don't have complete visibility into 1/1, the visibility is pretty good at this point. And from what we're seeing so far, we are going to be back to our margin for the full year '25. So, this is not a multiyear issue. We're kind of towards the end of that cycle, and 1/1 would have us back to our target margin. Tom, it's Ramy again here. While I can't comment on the specific of any peer. We continue to see activity in that market, I would say, increased activity, in particular over the last 12 months. And I would say, the bid-ask spreads are somewhat narrowing, which is, I think, encouraging as we think about our book and some of the bid-ask spreads that are out there. But as we've always said, our book is well capitalized, it's well managed. It continues to perform in line with expectations. So, we continue to assess risk transfer options. Clearly, any deal needs to create long-term shareholder value. So, price matters, structure matters here. But in general, I would say, active discussions and somewhat narrowing of bid-ask spreads there in terms of what we see."

            "name": "John McCallion",
            "content": "Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I'll start with the 3Q '24 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, including details of our annual global actuarial assumption review. In addition, I'll provide updates on our value of new business metrics and our liquidity and capital position. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the third quarter. Net income was $1.3 billion, $100 million lower than adjusted earnings. We had net derivative gains primarily due to the strengthening of the yen versus the U.S. dollar and the decline in interest rates in the third quarter. That said, derivative gains were partially offset by market risk benefit, or MRB, remeasurement losses due to lower interest rates. Net investment losses were modest, reflecting normal trading activity and a continuation of a stable credit environment. Overall, the investment portfolio remains high quality and resilient and our hedging program performed as expected. The table on Page 4 provides highlights of our annual actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments with the breakdown of the adjusted earnings and net income impact by segment. Overall, the impact to adjusted earnings and net income was modest. In Group Benefits, we had an unfavorable impact due to a liability refinement related to an annuity payout feature on a small subset of our Group Life portfolio. There is no ongoing impact due to this refinement. In Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, while we have maintained our long-term mortality trend assumption consistent with pre-COVID. This reflects the impact of higher mortality over the last few years, which resulted in a positive impact to adjusted earnings. And in Asia, the net unfavorable impact was primarily due to three factors: unfavorable changes to lapsed assumptions across life and accident health products in Japan; lower expected fund returns for variable life products in Korea; and these were partially offset by a positive impact from improved morbidity for accident and health products in Japan and Korea. On Page 5, you can see the third quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items. Adjusted earnings were $1.4 billion, down 8% and 6% on a constant currency basis primarily due to lower recurring interest margins, partially offset by solid volume growth year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.93, down 1% on a reported basis but up 1% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were $431 million, down 11% year-over-year, primarily due to less favorable non-medical health underwriting margins versus a strong comparison in Q3 of '23. The Group Life mortality ratio was 85.6% and 82.4% when excluding the notable items discussed earlier. This was below our annual target of 84% to 89%. Our mortality results remain seasonally strong, albeit following record-low life claims in 2Q of '24. Year-to-date, our Group Life mortality ratio remained at the low end of our annual target range, although we would expect the ratio to be toward the middle of the range in the fourth quarter. Regarding nonmedical health, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 72.4% in the quarter, within our annual target range of 69% to 70% but higher than the prior year quarter of 69% or 70.4% excluding a favorable notable item related to disability in 3Q of '23. Turning to the top line. Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 5% year-over-year and at the midpoint of our 2024 target growth range of 4% to 6%. Group Benefits year-to-date sales were up 9% driven by strong growth in national accounts. RIS adjusted earnings were $368 million, down 10% versus the prior year. Lower recurring interest margins were partially offset by strong volume growth and favorable underwriting margins. RIS total investment spreads were 106 basis points, down 15 basis points sequentially mainly due to the continued expiration of interest rate caps and lower variable investment income. As we highlighted in the Q2 earnings call, the continued roll-off of the interest rate caps drove the majority of the sequential decline. Given the vast majority of interest caps have expired and based on the current forward interest rate curve, we expect fourth quarter spreads, excluding variable investment income, to now stabilize and be flat to up 1 to 2 basis points. RIS adjusted PFOs, excluding pension risk transfers, were up 3% year-over-year primarily driven by strong sales in U.K. longevity reinsurance. With regards to PRT, we continue to see an active market. We had premiums of approximately $500 million in the third quarter, and we have already seen a strong start to Q4 with over $1.5 billion in PRT wins in the past month alone. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were $347 million, down 6% and 5% on a constant currency basis primarily due to market-related items in the quarter, partially offset by favorable underwriting margins. For Asia's growth metrics, general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis were up 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Asia sales were down 1% on a constant currency basis. Lower Japan sales were mostly offset by other Asian markets, which were up 10%, most notably due to strong growth in India and China. In Japan, sales were down 7% year-over-year primarily due to the impact of yen volatility on foreign currency products. However, we continue to see a favorable outlook given higher interest rates and positive macro changes in Japan. For example, our refreshed yen-denominated variable life and cancer products introduced earlier this year have been well. Latin America adjusted earnings were $217 million, up 9% and 21% on a constant currency basis primarily driven by strong Chilean encaje returns in the quarter and volume growth in our key markets. Latin America's top line also continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 1% and 11% on a constant currency basis driven by strong sales and solid persistency across the region. Turning to EMEA. Adjusted earnings were $75 million, up 7% on a reported basis and 9% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by strong volume growth year-over-year. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 11% and 14% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region, and sales were up 32% on a constant currency basis primarily from Turkey and Egypt. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $170 million, down 17% versus the prior year quarter. The primary driver was the foregone earnings due to the reinsurance transaction that closed in November of 2023. Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $249 million versus an adjusted loss of $262 million in the prior year. The Company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 24% and within our 2024 guidance range of 24% to 26%. On Page 6, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the prior five quarters, including $162 million in Q3 of '24. This was down $17 million versus Q3 of '23. The private equity portfolio, which had over $14 billion in VII assets as of September 30 had a positive 0.6% return in the quarter. This compared to a 1.4% return in Q3 of '23. While PE returns were below recent trends, our real estate-related and other funds of roughly $4.5 billion continued to improve with a 1.1% return in the quarter. As a reminder, PE, real estate-related and other funds are reported on a one-quarter lag and accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. On Page 7, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the last four quarters and the third quarter of '24. As you can see in the chart, RIS, Asia and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest proportion of VII assets given their long-dated liability profile. Now turning to Page 8. The chart on the left of the page illustrates the split of our adjusted net investment income between recurring and VII for the last three years, including third quarter of 2023 and '24. Adjusted net investment income in Q3 of '24 was essentially flat versus the prior year. While recurring investment income has benefited from asset growth and higher interest rates, it has been offset by the roll-off of interest rate caps. Turning your attention to the right side of the page. This shows our new money rate versus roll-off yield since the third quarter of '21. Over the last 10 quarters, new money yields have outpaced roll-off yields, consistent with higher interest rates. In Q3 of '24, our global new money rate achieved a yield of 6%, 22 basis points higher than the roll-off rate. The narrowing of the spread between new money rates and roll-off yields in 3Q was primarily due to a roughly 70 basis point decline in U.S. interest rates and elevated pay downs in the quarter of recently purchased higher-yield securities. That said, the proceeds from these pay downs in 3Q have been reinvested in high relative value public and private assets with similar yields. I would also note that the new money rate-related purchases in 3Q of roughly $14 billion, more than twice that of the invested assets rolling off. So, while the difference between our new money rates and roll-off yields shown here is as an indicative metric for future investment margin impact, it's only directional in nature and not a perfect depiction of spread impacts. At these levels, we continue to see positive impact of higher yields on our in-force and new business growth. Now moving to expenses on Page 9. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio for the full year of 2023 of 12.2% and the first three quarters to '24 all below 12%, including 11.7% in Q3 of '24. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our Q3 direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline. Looking ahead, we would expect our direct expense ratio to be higher in the fourth quarter, consistent with the seasonal nature of our business. That said, our performance year-to-date positions us to beat our full year 2024 direct expense ratio target of 12.3%, demonstrating our consistent execution and a sustained efficiency mindset. Now let's turn to Page 10. This chart reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments for the past five years, including an update for 2023. MetLife invested $3.6 billion of capital in 2023 to support new business. This was deployed at an average unlevered IRR of approximately 19% with a payback period of five years, generating roughly $2.6 billion in value. I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 11. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were $4.5 billion at September 30, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. Cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend and share repurchases of roughly $800 million in the third quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, we have repurchased shares totaling approximately $130 million in October. For our U.S. companies, preliminary third quarter year-to-date 2024 statutory operating earnings were approximately $2.8 billion, essentially flat year-over-year, while net income was approximately $2 billion. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $17.6 billion as of September 30, 2024, down 2% from June 30, 2024 primarily due to dividends paid and derivative losses, partially offset by operating earnings. Finally, we expect the Japan solvency margin ratio to be approximately 745% as of September 30, which will be based on statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks. Before I wrap up, I would just like to highlight that we have an updated commercial mortgage loan slide as of September 30 in the appendix. Overall, the CML portfolio continues to perform as expected with attractive loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios as well as the expectation of modest losses. In summary, while adjusted earnings were below our expectations primarily due to lower VII, the underlying strength of our business fundamentals was evident with strong top line growth, disciplined underwriting and prudent expense management. In addition, our strong value of new business metrics demonstrates our disciplined approach to deploying capital to its highest and best use, consistent with our all-weather strategy. MetLife remains in a position of strength given our balance sheet, free cash flow generation and diversification of our market-leading businesses, and we are committed to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth and building sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. Finally, let me close by saying that we look forward to seeing many of you on December 12 at our Investor Day, which will focus on the introduction of our New Frontier strategy. As we have in the past several years, we will be offering our near-term outlook in early February as part of our fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Yes. And Suneet, I think your -- it's a good question, the point around just back testing because as you said, this is -- these are IRRs on new business that we've priced based on our best estimate assumptions. And I think -- I have been thinking about that as well. And I think there's a couple of things. Certainly, the environment has been favorable here, right? I mean, in the case of -- if you just think about -- we've been in benign credit environment. Underwriting has generally been in line across our businesses and interest rates have been favorable. So, all of those -- so I think the answer is yes, it's hard to be really precise, give or take, on all of those things. But we think about -- we've asked the same question ourselves because, obviously, we're seeing the positive momentum here. And I think, just thinking a little more about the positive momentum, like Michel said, mix of business is certainly a driver there in terms of our new business. Two, I think the tool itself as a management tool has -- causes everyone to continue to refine things in terms of pricing, capital optimization, how you might use reinsurance. We did get some favorable regulatory changes. Like in Korea, for example, they've moved to an economic framework recently, typically favors up because we tend to follow an economic framework. So that has ultimately given us a lot more excess capital there that will over time be redistributed up into the holding company. And then, I think the third thing is there's been a trend of unit cost improvement there. So, I think all of those factors give rise to why you see this kind of migration occurring. And I think probably the biggest one is what Michel said, which is mix of business, you have high growth in -- certainly in some of our businesses that have had high IRRs from very low capital-intensive businesses like group and Latin America. So hopefully, it helps. Jimmy, I'll take your commercial mortgage comment or question. As you pointed out, I think despite the recent pressure, we've kind of commented on a few factors, right? There's been continued -- economic growth has been healthy. That has been good news for fundamentals of real estate. There's some modest trend towards in-office or even office has some kind of backdrop momentum here. And overall, I think as you point out, we feel -- outside of office, we probably feel like we've kind of hit the trough, and we've probably seen a positive outlook. There's healthy fundamentals overall now for the economy. You have like some at least expectation of some declining interest rates. Even steepening of the curve, I think, would be a positive here. You're starting to see increasing transaction activity. Even us in this quarter, we probably -- I think we had five sales of real estate properties for a gain, about $120 million, $150 million of gain in the quarter. So again, we're just starting to see more liquidity come back into the market. So, we think -- overall, there is a positive backdrop that's starting to emerge. I don't think we're out of it. We're not going to see kind of a V-shape recovery per se, but it certainly is setting up for a more positive 2025 environment. I think you asked about single borrower. I don't have the exact number on CMBS, but it's relatively small. I think I'd just give you a few statistics. We have about $10 billion of CMBS. And of that, over 80% or about 80% of that is rated AAA or AA. But the single borrower exposure is relatively small. I just don't have that at my fingertips. Ryan, good morning. Yes, and just as -- just to kind of rehash what I said, right, we had we had a little bit more of a decline this quarter relative to what we had called out in the second quarter of 8 to 10 basis points on the core spreads, and it came in around 11. So, I think a good reminder, which I didn't say in my opening remarks, is that in the second quarter, we said 8 to 10 would occur as well, and we came in under that. So, a little bit of each of those quarters are a function of just what rates did in the quarter. And this quarter, we had we had some lower rates during the quarter. Although as everyone has seen, rates have ticked up, which gives us a little bit of the -- kind of optimism to being flat to up a few basis points come fourth quarter. We'll give more color in the outlook call in February. I think that maybe the -- but I will say that we do feel like we've gotten to a more stable spread, maybe is the way I'd put it. But curve matters. So that will be an aspect of what we do in our outlook. So hesitant to kind of call it now. I think we'll wait and see where the curve is, and also the sensitivities can change and things like that, very dependent upon kind of the outlook of the curve. But all in all, we are seeing more stability now. And so, I think that's a fair assumption for now. I wish I could say yes, but probably -- I don't know if we have really good insights. I mean, look, at the end of the day, we probably have a -- we have a view. And I think the reality is that this portfolio in the sector of PE, they continue to adjust to higher rates and more volatile markets and a constrained set of exit options. That said, it was still positive returns this quarter. We also saw a positive rebound in the real estate and related funds there in the quarter, again, maybe referencing back to some of the comments I made earlier around kind of what we're seeing in real estate. And I think the other thing that I did call out, I think it was at your conference possibly, is that we had another $600 million of distributions occur. So, this is still giving a strong cash flow. I think performance has been good on a relative scale, I think, top -- kind of top half quartile -- top half performance, maybe second-quartile performance. In the quarter, when we went in and dug deep, we saw that there were probably a few one-off situations in certain funds in the quarter, where some of the funds had to mark a particular asset as opposed to broad marks across. We think that those are more one-off factors. So, if we were to normalize for them and use that as our proxy for the fourth quarter, you should think maybe total VII would be north of where we are today, maybe doesn't get us back to 2Q levels. So maybe you take the midpoint of those two as a good estimate for fourth quarter at this juncture. Alex, it's John, and welcome back. Yes, just as a framing, generally, for our portfolio is -- a steeper curve is better. So, we -- higher rates are better, steeper curve is better as well. So, I think that helps with maybe the direction of travel. In terms of like our floating rate assets to liabilities, we're pretty well matched. Sometimes, we have a little bit of floating rate assets in Corporate & Other. So that can be one place where you might see. But ultimately, a lower short end of the curve is better for us, and that's just how we typically manage our collective portfolio. So, I think the outlook slides we provided back in February of this year in terms of just parallel shifts in the curve are probably still pretty good proxies for the impact to our firm. But in terms of shape of the curve, I can probably just give you directional commentary at this juncture. Okay. I think, Wilma, I just want to make sure we were able to hear that. You just said, could you walk through more normalized earnings for group and RIS? No problem. Okay. I can just start at a high level, and then Ramy can add. I think, obviously, RIS has been impacted by the roll-off of our interest rate caps. And I'd say, we've provided some guidance on that actually in February, roughly 8 to 10 basis points a quarter. I would say, basically, hit that on the mark. We were a little lower in that roll off and impact in the second quarter, a little higher than the third. Net-net, we probably ended where we expected. And now, we'll see -- we should see some stabilization in those levels for the fourth quarter and on. And I think for RIS, you have to take into account VII, right? And if you think about our earnings this quarter, that's obviously a fairly large delta for us relative to what we think our underlying run rate is for the firm. I think for group, you have to be -- seasonality matters a lot. So, it depends on what quarter we're talking about. But I think, as Ramy pointed out in some of his remarks, that we did have a few things that just went against us this quarter. And I think that's the case also in Japan and others. And it's just one of those things where we've got a few things that we don't expect to recur. They just tend to all happen in one quarter, and they all were relatively small but added to some numbers that all went in one direction. So, that's kind of how we probably see the quarter at this juncture. And I know you only said RIS and group, but I thought I'd give you a more holistic view of that. Sure. I think, as we were referencing earlier, certainly, higher interest rates have caused the sector to have to adjust, right? I mean it's been a sector that has benefited significantly from the lower-forever environment that no longer is forever. And so, as rates have risen, things have -- firms have had to shift back to kind of the growth model and -- as opposed to just the leverage model. And I think that was a strategy. I don't think it was wrong. It was just it was. And so, it's taking some time, coupled with the fact that the environment needs exit options and M&A or IPO activity, and that also has slowed a bit as a result of the broader macro environment. So, we think with the onetime, it's probably one factor that improves the sector. And the second is I think that as rates start to stabilize and probably the curve starts to stabilize more importantly, that will be kind of a positive aspect to support the sector. And John, just to make sure I have that, you're asking whether there could be a larger allocation as a result of maybe the outlook? Is that what you mean? I mean, we've given some outlook -- in our outlook, we gave some views of returns for the asset classes. And obviously, they were predicated on a certain set of assumptions. Not all those assumptions have come true, and they aren't -- and that's expected. I still think using that relative scaling, even if the returns kind of migrate up, is still a good concept. And if you think about our real estate exposure in VII today, it's more in the, call it, core, core plus and maybe some bit of opportunistic. So, in terms of the expected return on those types of investments, you would think they're lower than what you would be expecting for, say, a PE or a venture capital fund. Yes. I think just my -- I'll just say quickly my comment on Korea, and I think you probably caught on to it is, we do tend to work better in a more economic framework because we tend to run our firm very much like that. Obviously, you have to manage to the statutory constraints in any jurisdiction, and so you can't ignore them. But we certainly spend a lot of time thinking about the economic nature of our business. And so, that's one thing we saw in Korea. And I'm not so sure it opens up the environment or for business outlook per se, but we certainly think it's more favorable for us, and it avoids having to manage too many different constraints."

            "name": "Lyndon Oliver",
            "content": "Great. Jimmy, it's Lyndon here. Let me take the Japan question. So, let's start with Japan sales, and I'll give you some color on overall Asia. Look, Japan is an attractive market. Look, we're seeing increasing interest rates as well as positive macro trends there. And what we are seeing is an overall environment for FX products that has become more competitive. If you look at Japan sales, they were lower year-over-year in single premium FX products. Now a few reasons. We face a tough comparative against last year. Sales in '23 for the full year were up 14% year-over-year. And then, as you said, while the yen has strengthened in the quarter, we do see continued volatility of FX markets, and that has impacted the sales of foreign currency products. So essentially, what we're seeing are more customers staying on the sideline during these periods of FX volatility. Japan sales for the third quarter sequentially were in line with where they were for the second quarter. Now we do have a diversified portfolio. We have both U.S. dollar as well as yen products in Japan. And we continue to evolve this product portfolio to maintain competitiveness. So, we've introduced several new products. We launched a refreshed yen-denominated variable life product. We've launched a cancer product earlier this year. Both products have performed very well. We've also launched a refreshed A&H medical product this month, and we're planning to launch a new U.S. dollar life product early next year. If we look at the rest of Asia, what we're seeing, our sales have gone up 9% year-over-year, and that's driven primarily from China and India. Solid performance in China, especially as we look across both our channels, bancassurance as well as agency. And if you look in India, we've seen sales increase sharply there with strong growth across all our channels. As far as an outlook goes, look, year-to-date sales have been in line with the prior year, and we expect full year sales for Asia to be close to flat year-over-year."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, all. We appreciate you joining MetLife's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I'd point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Other members of senior management are also are also available to participate. We released our supplemental slides last night, and they are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to them in his prepared remarks. An appendix to the slides features disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information for your review. Q&A will follow prepared remarks, and we'll end just before the top of the hour. As a reminder, please limit yourself to yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up. Now to Michel.\nMichel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with the second quarter results that we posted last night and believe the quarter clearly reflects MetLife's core strength, including the momentum across our businesses and greater predictability of our performance achieved through our consistent execution. The expectations we shared about our about our performance came to pass in the second, in line with our forecast, and in some cases, even better. After normal seasonal impacts in the first quarter, the performance of our flagship Group Benefits Group Benefits franchise shone through in the second quarter. Variable investment income, or VII, performed in line with the expectations we laid out in the first quarter, with the recovery in private equity returns partially offset by the performance of real estate funds, which saw significantly narrower losses in the second quarter. The broad diversification of our businesses has proven to be a fundamental strength for MetLife, creating many natural offsets and allowing us to generate growth while navigating the tides of shifting business and economic dynamics. And our ability to generate strong recurring cash flow, coupled with our discipline to apply capital to its highest and best use, enables us to drive sustained long-term value for our highest. In the second quarter, we reported adjusted earnings of $1.6 billion or $2.28 per share, up 18% from the prior year. The strong result was driven by favorable underwriting, good volume growth and higher variable investment income led by the positive performance I just mentioned. In total, net income in the mentioned was $912 million, substantially higher than $370 million in the prior year period. Strong adjusted earnings growth, aided by our unwavering focus on execution, generated outstanding results measured by several of our key performance metrics. MetLife posted a 17.3% adjusted return on equity in the quarter, well above our target range of 13% to 15% and a powerful example of our ability to efficiently deploy quarter, and generate profitable growth for our shareholders. MetLife's direct expense ratio in the second quarter was 11.9%, an improvement year-over-year and below our 12.3% annual target. As we have noted before, the positive leverage in this ratio is not only a measure of our ability to control costs, but also our capacity to grow revenue at a grow revenue at a faster rate than expenses, and the second quarter, both top line growth and lower direct expenses were contributors to our excellent quarterly expense ratio. When we established our Next Horizon strategy almost five years ago, it was supported by the interconnected foundational pillars of focus, simplify and differentiate. Our success in executing against our focus pillar is evident in the high-teen internal rates of return we achieve on new business and our strong enterprise-wide return on equity. Similarly, our success in executing against our simplified pillar manifests in our improving expense ratio. Our drive to execute against our differentiated pillar is essentially funded by the success we've achieved through our focus and simplify pillars. When we activated Next Horizon, we committed to free up $1 billion of expense capacity to invest in growth initiatives and technology, and we have done so, matching both sides of this equation. This shows up in dozens of internal technology initiatives that are making it easier for customers to purchase our products, as well as for them to receive their benefit and retirement payments. We see our capacity to invest in technology at MetLife's scale as a true differentiator relative to our competitors, which we believe will only get more impactful over time. There are many tools in our toolbox that will help drive this advantage forward, including artificial intelligence, or AI. From our standpoint, we believe MetLife's large pool of pool of data puts us in an advantaged position with AI having the potential to act as a force multiplier and further widen the divide in our favor, yet this is not just future talk. AI has been part of our playbook at MetLife for years, and we are seeing many initiatives move -- to implementation to create seamless and personalized customer experiences, improve decision-making and empower employees to focus on purposeful work. Be assured, we understand the power of AI commands great responsibility. With that in mind, we are at the vanguard of this topic, and we'll be issuing our policy on the responsible use of AI in the third quarter. Shifting to our business segment results, our leading Group Benefits business reported adjusted earnings of $533 million, representing an all-time quarterly record, as Group Life mortality experience snapped back from the seasonally impacted first quarter. Group Life mortality registered a benefit ratio of 79.1% in the second quarter. For the year-to-date period, the Group Life benefit ratio is now firmly at the lower end of our annual target range of 84% to 89%. Our growth strategy in the attractive Group Benefits space is twofold. On a national accounts basis, employers with greater than 5,000 employees, we are driving penetration across employer groups via new products and greater employee participation. On a regional accounts basis, employers with less than 5,000 employees, we are seeking to accelerate growth via a more refined distribution focus, broader suite of products and by attacking white space, the absence of any employer-offered benefits. Across both avenues of growth, national and regional, increasing enrollment and utilization of voluntary products are primary elements of boosting sales and margins. Moving to RIS. Business momentum was evident in our Retirement and Income Solutions segment, which enjoyed several notable wins. These included two jumbo pension risk transfer deals totaling $3.5 billion, a $2.2 billion stable value addition, as well as $3.3 billion of U.K. longevity reinsurance, underscoring the breadth of our liability origination in this segment. Beyond these wins, we continue to see strong flow for structured to see strong flow for structured settlements where we are the market leader, with more than $700 million sold in the second quarter. In Asia, we enjoyed solid growth across a range of metrics. While sales in Japan have been impacted by currency fluctuations, assets under management in Asia continue to grow, rising 5% on a constant currency basis in the quarter. Outside of Japan, sales were up 60% on the strength of a large group sale in Australia. Looking to Latin America, top line and bottom-line results were strong, again, despite some currency headwinds. Adjusted premium fees and other revenues were up 12% on a constant currency basis, pointing to sustained business momentum in Mexico, Chile, and Brazil. EMEA adjusted earnings rose 10% year-over-year on strong volume growth and higher recurring interest margins. Adjusted PFOs were up 12% on a constant currency basis due to strong sales across the region. Our business in EMEA is an example of our efficiency mindset at work. We simplified the structure of our business and refocused it on protection products with strong free cash flow, producing positive, tangible results. Moving to capital and cash. MetLife is well-capitalized, and our capacity to generate strong recurring free cash flow allows us to meet our commitments and provide flexibility to proactively seize attractive growth opportunities. And in the absence of compelling M&A opportunities, we will return capital to our shareholders. We were active on the capital management front in the second quarter from both an equity and debt standpoint. We paid common stock dividends of roughly $400 million, reflecting a 4.8% increase to our common stock dividend per share. We also bought back around bought back around $900 million of our common shares in the second quarter and repurchased about another $270 million worth in July. This brings total common stock repurchase for the year through July to about $2.3 billion. We still have roughly $2.8 billion remaining on our Board authorization. From a debt standpoint, we paid off or redeemed approximately $1.5 billion of debt and issued $500 million of senior debt. We have now largely prefunded our 2025 maturing debt issues. And finally, at the end of the second quarter, we had $4.4 billion of cash and liquid assets at our holding companies, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. Turning to our recently published Sustainability Report. MetLife operates within a virtuous circle comprised of our customers, our people, our communities, and our shareholders with the objective of delivering long-term value to each of these stakeholders. Perhaps nowhere is the success of these efforts more evident than in the pages of our Annual Sustainability Report and can be found on MetLife's website. In it, you'll see highlights of our efforts to build more confident futures for our stakeholders and updates on our sustainability commitments. Among our many successes, I am pleased to mention that the MetLife Foundation has surpassed $1 billion in total giving in its history. As a 156-year-old company, and the intent to log another 156 years more, sustainability is an essential part of MetLife's heritage. As I close, one of the objectives of our Next Horizon strategy was to emerge as a stronger, more predictable company. As we approach the finish line of that five-year strategic cycle, we are on track to accomplish, if not exceed, each of the key targets and objectives we laid out relative to distributable cash, operating leverage and return on equity. As I have said before, we do not stand still here at MetLife. We constantly look for opportunities to raise the bar and challenge ourselves further, pursuing these new challenges with passion and enthusiasm. We are hard at work developing and pressure testing our next five-year strategy, which we are calling New Frontier. This will build on the core pillars of Next Horizon while looking to accelerate growth, boost returns, and foster consistency. The first stop on this journey will begin with our annual board strategy review in September. Subsequently, I look forward to sharing with you our plans for the future at our Investor Day scheduled for December 12th of this year. Now I'll turn it over to John to cover our quarterly performance in more detail.\nJohn McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I'll start with the 2Q 2024 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our liquidity and capital position. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the second quarter. We had net derivative losses, primarily due to the strengthening of the US dollar versus the yen, as well as higher interest rates. That said, derivative losses were partially offset by market risk benefit, or MRB, remeasurement gains due to the higher interest rates and stronger equity markets. Net investment losses were mainly the result of normal trading activity for fixed maturity securities in a higher rate environment. Overall, the investment portfolio remains well positioned, credit losses continue to be modest, and our hedging program performed as expected. On page 4, you can see the second quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, which should not have any notable items in either period. Adjusted earnings were $1.6 billion, up 9% and 11% on a constant currency basis. Favorable underwriting, volume growth and higher variable investment income drove the year-over-year increase. This was partially offset by lower recurring interest margins. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.28, up 18% and up 20% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, group benefits adjusted earnings were $533 million, up 43% year-over-year, primarily due to favorable underwriting margins. The group life mortality ratio was a record low of 79.1%, well below our annual target range of 84% to 89%, driven by favorable experience across all coverages. The strong group life results mirrored the notably low number of US deaths between the ages of 25 and 64 in April and May, according to CDC data. Regarding non-medical health, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 70.8% in the quarter, toward the bottom end of our annual target range of 69% to 74%, and below the prior year quarter of 73.7%. Favorable disability results benefited from a reserve adjustment of approximately $30 million after tax. Turning to the top line, group benefits adjusted PFOs were up 3% year-over-year. Taking participating contracts into account, which dampened growth by roughly 200 basis points, the underlying PFOs were up approximately 5% year-over-year, and at the midpoint of our 2024 target growth range of 4% to 6%. Group benefits 2Q 2024 year-to-date sales were up 11%, driven by strong growth across most products, including our suite of voluntary products. RIS adjusted earnings were $410 million, down 2% versus the prior year. Lower recurring interest margins were partially offset by higher variable investment income and strong volume growth. RIS investment spreads were 121 basis points, down 6 basis points sequentially, mainly due to the expiration of interest rate caps in the second quarter of 2024. We anticipate that spreads will remain between our annual target range of 115 and 140 basis points in the third quarter. Although we foresee an increase in variable investment income, it will likely be balanced out by reduced earnings from the expiration of the interest rate caps. RIS adjusted PFOs, excluding pension risk transfers, were up 4% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong sales of institutional income annuities as well as growth in UK longevity reinsurance. With regards to PRT, we had approximately $3.5 billion in deals in the second quarter and continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were $449 million, up 4% and 8% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to favorable underwriting margins and higher variable investment income. For Asia's key growth metrics, general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis were up 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Sales were up 4% on a constant currency basis compared to a strong prior year quarter. While Japan sales were down 19% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily due to the impact of yen volatility on foreign currency products. This was more than offset by strong sales growth of 60% in the rest of the region, including a large group case in Australia Latin America adjusted earnings were $226 million, up 3% on reported basis and 8% on a reported basis, primarily driven by solid volume growth across the region and favorable underwriting. This was partially offset by lower Chilean encaje returns of a negative 2.4% in Q2 of 2024 compared to a positive 1.4% in Q2 of the prior year. Latin America's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 9% or 12% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were $77million, up 10% and 20% on a constant currency basis, driven by volume growth and higher recurring interest margins. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins year-over-year. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 7% and 12% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 31% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong growth in Turkey, the Gulf and the U.K. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $153 million, down 27% versus the prior year quarter. The primary driver was the foregone earnings due to the reinsurance transaction that closed in November. Corporate and Other adjusted loss was $220 million versus an adjusted loss of $228 million in the prior year. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 24% and within our 2024 guidance range of 24% to 26%. On Page 5, this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the prior five quarters, including $298 million in Q2 of 2024. Private equity portfolio, which makes up the vast majority of the VII asset balance, had a positive 2.3% return in the quarter, while our real estate equity funds had a negative 1.4% return in the quarter. As a reminder, both private equity and real estate equity funds are reported on a one-quarter lag. Looking ahead, we expect VII returns to continue to improve over the course of second half of the year. On Page 6, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the last four quarters and the second quarter of 2024. As you can see in the chart, Asia, RIS and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest proportion of VII assets given their long-dated liability profile. Now turning to Page 7. The chart on the left of page illustrates the left of page illustrates the split of our net investment income between recurring and VII for the last three years, including second quarters of 2023 and 2024. Adjusted net investment income in Q2 of 2024 was up $120 million year-over-year. Recurring investment income has benefited from higher interest rates, partially offset by the roll-off from higher interest rates caps. In addition, we have seen VII improvement driven by higher private equity returns. Turning your attention to the right side of the page. This shows our new money yield versus roll-off shows our new money yield versus roll-off yields since second quarter of 2021. Over the last nine quarters, new money yields have outpaced roll-off yields, consistent with higher interest rates. In the second quarter of 2024, our global new money rate achieved the yield of 6.27%, 63 basis points higher than the roll-off rate. We anticipate that the new money yields will remain above roll-off yields given the prevailing interest rate environment. However, the spread can fluctuate depending on the mix of sales across our businesses. Now moving to expenses discussed on Page 8, this chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio for full year 2023 of 12.2% and the first two quarters of 2024, both at 11.9%. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our Q2 direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline. Looking ahead, we would expect our direct expense ratio to be higher in the second half of the year, consistent with the seasonal nature of our business. That said, our performance year-to-date positions us well to achieve a full year 2024 direct expense ratio of 12.3% or below demonstrating our consistent execution and a sustained efficiency mindset. I will now discuss our cash and capital positions on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were $4.4 billion at June 30th, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion, but down from $5.2 billion at March 31st. The sequential decline in holding companies' cash is primarily a result of approximately $1.5 billion used in April for a debt maturity and a debt redemption, partially offset by a $500 million senior debt issuance in June. Beyond this, cash of the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, and share repurchases of roughly $900 million in the second quarter, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, we have repurchased shares totaling approximately $270 million in July. For our US companies, preliminary second quarter year-to-date 2024 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.9 billion, essentially flat year-over-year, while net income was approximately $1.3 billion. We estimate that our total US statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18 billion as of June 30, down 2% from March 31, 2024, primarily due to dividends paid and derivative losses partially offset by operating earnings. Finally, we expect that Japan's solvency margin ratio to be approximately 670% as of June 30, which will be based on statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks. Before I wrap up, I would just like to highlight that we have an updated commercial mortgage loan slide as of June 30 in the appendix. Overall, the CML portfolio continues to perform as expected with attractive loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios as well as the expectation of modest losses. In summary, the underlying strength of our business fundamentals was evident with strong top line growth, disciplined underwriting and prudent expense management. Our Group Benefits segment achieved record earnings. Higher interest rates continue to support flows and spreads. And we continue to see improvement in variable investment income. MetLife continues to move forward from a position of strength with a strong balance sheet and a diversified set of market-leading businesses, generating solid recurring free cash flow. And we are committed to deploying this free cash flow to achieve responsible growth and build long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We'll go to our first question from Tom Gallagher at Evercore.\nTom Gallagher: Good morning. Wanted to ask a couple on the Group Benefits business. First is, can you just unpack the non-medical health results? How were -- how was the underlying disability versus dental? And where -- also, can you just comment on pricing, maybe on both of those products and how you think about renewals? Thanks.\nRamy Tadros: Sure, Tom. Good morning. It's Ramy Tadros here. So, I think just from a headline ratio perspective, just to reference John's remarks, the overall ratio of 70.8, you want to just normalize that for one-off nonrecurring reserve adjustment. So that gets you back into kind of the 72.2 range. So, on your question on dental and disability. So in the second quarter for dental, we did see utilization rates come down from the first quarter. And what you're seeing here is just normal seasonality in that business and where Q1 tends to be heavier in terms of utilization as these benefits reset typically at the beginning of the year. And in terms of how we think about dental and dental pricing going forward, if you step back from the current quarter -- as you know, dental is an inflationary product, and we do deploy a number of levers to ensure we manage and stay within our target margins. And the two, I would highlight here is that the majority of our claims come within our network, which gives us a greater line of sight and control over margin. And the other key lever here is renewal pricing. And this is a business where we remain disciplined in terms of our rate guarantee periods. And in aggregate, we can reprice about 80% of our book every year. And that's exactly what we've been doing. So we've been seeing overall trends in the last kind of, call it, year and a half pick up, and we've seen pressure on margins because of that. And we've been taking appropriate action -- pricing action across the entire block in response to that trend. At this stage, most of these actions are behind us. We've implemented them across the book. And going forward, we'll continue to kind of monitor the trend and take actions as necessary. But just think of that as more business as usual of how you manage an inflationary product like dental. On disability, I would say the underlying block is running very much in line with expectations. We see some slight increases in incidents, but severity has come down and we continue to still see very strong recoveries. And so, the core business continues to be healthy and very much in line. And I would say just on renewals, in aggregate, we're hitting our target renewal pricing across the book. And we're still maintaining very strong persistency here. So we feel pretty good about both the new business, both about the renewal pricing, coupled with persistency and you clearly need to watch both in this business.\nTom Gallagher: Great. Thanks for that, Ramy. And just my quick follow-up. How are you feeling about the level of competition in the market? We've heard about new entrants putting some pressure on sales and pricing. Are you guys seeing that? Or are you -- is not affecting you in terms of margin and pricing?\nRamy Tadros: I mean the short answer is that it's not affecting us. I would overall characterize the market as competitive, largely rational. You occasionally see aggressive pricing, but that is more of a -- of an outlier than the norm here, Tom. I mean our perspective here is also informed by ongoing rigorous surveillance. We look at every single metric in the market on an ongoing basis. And I would say we have not seen any evidence of a change in the competitive environment. The key point here for us is, as we've always talked about before, we have positioned this business to compete on a range of factors, inclusive of price. So while price is important, the basis of how we compete extends to multiple factors beyond price. This is ultimately a scale business, capabilities matter, experience matter, product breadth matters. And the ability to invest, which comes with scale, also really matters. So some of the new entrants that you've referenced are pretty small in terms of their overall premium size, they largely operate at the very small end of the market with narrower capabilities. And we haven't seen any meaningful impact or say, any impact on our book from those new competitors.\nTom Gallagher: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: We'll move next to Suneet Kamath at Jefferies.\nSuneet Kamath: Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just to follow-up on Group Benefits. The earnings power of this business has improved pretty substantially. I mean, normally think about this as maybe a $400 million business and excluding the reserve release, you're over $500 million. Is that sort of a sustainable level of earnings power for this business? Or is there anything that we should be thinking about that maybe broke the right way in the quarter?\nRamy Tadros: Yeah. Good morning. It's Ramy here. Again, I think the one item I would point to here is the Group Life ratio. This is a historical low for us. It's mainly driven by lower volume. And the lower volume, if you step back and look at the CDC data, in terms of the old course [ph] death in the US population, that has come down significantly in the second quarter as well. So I would say that's the one here that was tailwind in the quarter, which we're pleased with. But if you think about our expectations on a go-forward basis, we think mortality will kind of moderate back in line with historical levels. You still see the seasonality that you in this business. And so a better view of that on a run rate basis, I'll bring you back to our guidance range. And if you look at that on a year-to-date basis, we're about 84.7. So I think that's the one that you want to kind of look out for in terms of the, I would say, the one item this quarter, which was material, which gave us a bit of a tailwind here.\nSuneet Kamath: Got it. That makes sense. And then I guess on RIS, in terms of the spreads, I mean, think last quarter, you guided to maybe 8 bps to 10 bps of sequential compression. I think you came in much better than that. So just curious what you'd attribute that to? And then how should we be thinking about the progress of that spread as we kind of transition to 3Q and then ultimately 4Q?\nJohn McCallion: Yes. Thanks, Suneet. It's John. Good morning. So as you mentioned, so in the quarter, we came in at 121 basis points, that was within the 115 to 140 guidance. And then if you exclude VII, it was 119. And so a couple of things, right? We saw continued improvement in VII in the quarter. As you mentioned, we expected a decline from first quarter as a result of lower recurring interest margins due to the roll off of the interest rate caps. And we did anticipate it to be 8 to 10. It came in less, and it's primarily due higher-than-expected interest rates which we took advantage of during the course of the quarter. And so it was a little better than we thought. Having said that, I think our guidance that we gave last quarter is we continued to believe another 8 to 10 would occur during the course of the Q3 on ex-VII as most of the of the remaining interest rate caps mature over the course next few months. And then we should see spreads stabilize in most of the in-the-money interest rate caps purchased primarily during kind of pre- and even in the COVID era matures by then. So that's kind of how I would kind of play out the rest of this year. And I think if you go back to what we said at the outlook call, which was, we thought, all in, 2024 would show an all-in spread similar to 2023. And that's generally where we're trending towards.\nSuneet Kamath: Okay. Thanks, John.\nOperator: Next, we'll move to Ryan Krueger at KBW.\nRyan Krueger: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess on Japan, could you give some perspective on the sales environment there? I think you had -- it was a tougher year ago comparison, but you had some declines in sales. So just hoping to get a little more color on the different product areas there.\nLyndon Oliver: Hey, Ryan, it's Lyndon here. So let me give you some color on sales across Asia, including what we're seeing in Japan. So sales for the quarter grew 5%, including our divested operations in Malaysia. We also saw a 5% growth in assets under management. While Japan single premium FX sales were impacted by the yen weakness, we did see an offset when we look at across the rest of Asia. Japan sales were lower in the single premium US dollar products. But as you said, we're up against a tough comparative. In the second quarter, the weaker yen did impact the overall market for the foreign currency products. And so if we look at the overall banca market, this market has shrunk, but we continue to maintain our share in this space. Look, we have a diversified portfolio, and we are rebalancing between product mix between yen and US dollars. So if you look at the outlook for yen products, it has improved with higher interest rates and also with the positive macro environment that we're seeing in Japan. Now we have introduced a couple of new products, both the variable life as well as cancer product earlier this year. And they both have performed very well. We've got other product launches planned in the pipeline, some coming in later this year, as well as at the beginning of next year. So we've got strong growth in the rest of Asia, and that's also contributing to the overall story. We saw solid performance in Korea, in China, in India, and also strong year-over-year growth in all these countries. And then in the quarter, in Japan, we benefited from a large group case which came on risk in the second quarter. If we look at the outlook, first half actual sales were in line with the prior year, and we expect a similar trend as we go through the second half. So given this, we expect full year sales for Asia to be flat year-over-year. I hope that helps.\nJohn McCallion: Yes. And I would just -- it's a large group case in Australia. I think you mentioned Japan, but...\nMichel Khalaf: Sorry, yes, in Australia.\nRyan Krueger: Thanks. One quick follow-up. I think I think you -- I think there's been some elevated surrender activity in Japan. Just -- any more info on that? And to what extent has that impacted earnings in recent quarters?\nJohn McCallion: Yes. Now we did see some benefit in earnings. We saw a 4% increase in adjusted earnings on a reported as well as an 8% increase on a constant currency basis. This was driven both by favorable underwriting given by the surrenders, as well as variable investment income. When you look at surrender activities, it was higher than expected in the quarter, given we had the weaker yen as some customers choose to lock in some of the gains. And if we look at the VII in the quarter, Asia does get a higher allocation of real estate equity funds in the -- and so in the quarter, we did see better performance in the real estate relative to the prior year. We've also had good expense management in the quarter, and that's contributed to the stronger earnings. If you look at the outlook for the year, we expect full year earnings to kind of remain strong, in line with guidance. VII performance will continue to be a factor that will impact our earnings going forward.\nRyan Krueger: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Wes Carmichael at Autonomous Research.\nWes Carmichael: Hey good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just focusing on Japan for a second, but with the SMR ratio around 670% in the quarter, could you maybe just give us an update regarding the transition to ESR in Japan, if there's been any material changes in how you're feeling about implementation at this point?\nJohn McCallion: Wes, it's John. Good morning. So as you mentioned, 670% is our estimate for the quarter. We'll file that in a few weeks. I'd just like to start out by saying no concerns around capital generation or dividends, right? And that ratio tends to have some asymmetrical impacts when rates rise. But as we know, the overall economic value of businesses improved. So the other thing we saw in this quarter is it's generally a heavier cash out quarter for us. We have higher dividends. We pay taxes. So there's a little bit of timing there. And then as you mentioned, the new ESR comes into effect April 1, 2025. We'll report on that for the first time, March 31, 2026. And that is more of an economic framework, one of which that we have typically managed this business. We've used economic as well as stat as we think about like product pricing and development and things like that. So that's kind of a good place to start from. In addition, I'd say implementation is going well. We don't see any big issues. There are some -- a few items that we're just continuing to work through with the regulator. But even if those don't come to fruition, we can certainly manage, but we're hopeful to make some improvements to the kind of the current situation. All in, we're comfortable. And I'd say -- I'd say, supportive of moving from the SMR to the ESR.\nWes Carmichael: Thanks, John. And just maybe switching to the commercial mortgage loan portfolio. I think the loan-to-value ratio has deteriorated a little bit, at least in office quarter-over-quarter. But could you give us an update on your watch list? Any loans that are in the foreclosure process and if there's any properties where you might be expecting to take them on balance sheet?\nJohn McCallion: Okay. Great. Thanks, Wes. A lot in there to unpack, but let me just maybe start with the LTV. So you mentioned -- and we kind of forecasted this in the first quarter. We thought year prior, we had kind of given some peak to trough views. We thought it had another 10% broadly to go in some of the more distressed areas. And as you know, when we go through our annual appraisal process, it happens throughout the year, we typically wait for the second quarter. We find it hard to do it in the first quarter because we'd like to get financial information in our hands before we start that. So 2Q tends to be a heavy revaluation quarter. And so that's kind of what we saw happen generally in line with expectations. Overall, LTV ticked up one point overall. A couple of points more in office. And then as we look out for the rest of this year, probably heavier ones were done in the second quarter. We'll still see some, I'd say, modest deterioration, maybe another point overall in the second half and a little more maybe a couple of points in office. Look, I think it's playing out as expected. Last year, we had write-offs of roughly 20. We think this year, you're in kind of closer to maybe 100, but maybe below. So still modest. We had a little under $30 million year-to-date so far, and we think we're on track for kind of that kind of closer to $100 million of write-offs for the year, very well within kind of the modest area for us in terms of our capital and size and position. So again, we think the environment is -- despite the pressure, economic growth remains healthy and that's actually good news for real estate fundamentals. Despite office sector still probably has some kind of some work to do there, but you also have moderating construction pipeline, which is benefiting all properties. And so this is how this sector generally works out. It takes time. It doesn't happen overnight. You need to be well positioned going into it to be able to kind of manage through the kind of the pressure and the distress. And generally, the demand and supply factors typically work themselves out. So all in all, I think things are performing as expected for us, and no change to our view.\nWes Carmichael: Thanks, John.\nOperator: We'll move next to Jimmy Bhullar at JPMorgan.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hey. Good morning. My questions are mostly answered, but I just wanted to follow-up on a couple of points. First, on Japan, the decline in sales that you saw, how much of that is just a function of comps and maybe the volatility in the yen depressing sales of ForEx products versus an uptick in competition or price reductions by competitors or other market dynamics that are causing you to actively pull back?\nLyndon Oliver: Hey Jimmy, it's Lyndon here. So yeah, look, we did have a tough comparative last year. I think sales in Japan were up over 40% when we look at last year. So that is driving a lot of the results this year, but we are also seeing a weaker yen, and this has impacted the overall market for foreign currency products. The bank market, as I said, has declined, but we continue to maintain our market position over there. So I do think the volatility in the end is driving some of the decline we're seeing in sales.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then on RIS spreads, I think you've been clear that there's interest rate caps that are expiring later this year or in the third quarter. But should we assume that they'll stabilize in 4Q on a core basis ex-VII? And then are there other puts and takes as you're thinking about spreads going into next year, whether it's caps or sort of maturity of blocks or anything else or business coming out of end of period that would drive a shift in spread margins one way or the other?\nJohn McCallion: Hey Jimmy. It's John. Good morning. Yeah, as was alluded to in kind of the opening remarks and earlier is that we do have another quarter of 8 to 10 bps is what we forecasted. Like I said earlier, we thought we were going to have 8 to 10 this quarter, but interest rates were a bit higher than we had assumed at the time we were discussing this in the Q1, and we took advantage of that and a few different things we could do. So then the remainder -- most of the remaining interest rate cash roll off this quarter, and then you should see stabilization. Also, we're projecting VII to marginally increase each of the next two quarters as well, kind of similar to the trend that we saw here. So, that would be kind of the offset comment I'd make to you. And then you should see some stabilization in the Q4. In terms of beyond that, we'll wait for outlook to go through that information.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then on competition in Japan, is it still rational? Or are you seeing any evidence of price reductions with the higher interest rates in that market?\nLyndon Oliver: Look, I mean it is a competitive environment. But I would say it's rational. We always see a player get more aggressive once in a while, but we continue to maintain our pricing discipline and our focus on profitability. We've got a very diversified distribution platform. We've got a wide range of product set to both yen as well as U.S. dollar. We've got good investment origination capabilities along with strong internal reinsurance capabilities. All this combined kind of puts us in a good position, allows us to differentiate and maintain our competitive position in the market.\nJimmy Bhullar: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks and good morning. My first question, maybe starting on the PRT side, can you just give some color just on what you see in the pipeline for back half of this year and just any change in the competitive market for that business?\nRamy Tadros: Good morning, Elyse. It's Ramy here. With respect to the pipeline, we're still seeing a pretty healthy pipeline here, particularly on the larger end of the market, which is where we focus and where we have [Technical Difficulty] advantages. And if you step beyond the next couple of quarters, there are just secular trends here that bode really well for us and how we're positioned. If you survey corporate DB plan sponsors and survey after survey, including ours, they all point to a significant and rising proportion of those plan sponsors who are looking to derisk and transfer the risk. You also have a very large stock of corporate DB assets, $3 trillion if you look at the private market only. And you've got funding status that's pretty good, which makes all of these risk transfers a lot more affordable. So these will always be lumpy, but sitting here now, looking at the rest of the year, we're seeing a pretty healthy jumbo pipeline. And we're also very pleased with what we've done this quarter. As you saw, we did $3.5 billion of PRT. And we're clearly very pleased with our performance here.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you. And maybe the second question on Asia, the earnings were pretty strong in the quarter. I think you guys called out favorable underwriting maybe in the prepared remarks. Anything just more to think about just kind of the run rate earnings within that segment and anything that stood out in the quarter?\nLyndon Oliver: Yeah, hi Elyse, its Lyndon here. As I said earlier, I mean, we're pleased with the overall results in Asia or earnings in the quarter. We did see higher-than-expected surrender activity, and that was driven by the weaker yen as some customers start to lock in their gains. And that was higher than expected in the quarter. In addition, we did see Asia does get a higher allocation of real estate equity funds. And in the quarter, we saw better performance in real estate relative to the prior year, so those two are sort of drivers for the strong earnings results in the quarter for Asia.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from John Barnidge at Piper Sandler.\nJohn Barnidge: Good morning. Thank you for the opportunity. With the capital regime change in Japan, is there an opportunity to broaden out the Bermuda platform, create more capital-light model? Thank you.\nJohn McCallion: Hey John, it's John. Good morning. I'll take that one. So look, I think that's something we've always had in place for quite some time. We actually have two Bermuda entities right now. And we've had them for close to a decade in place. So it's a tool we have used and probably one that we have used successfully with some of our Japan products. I think ESR will allow you to reevaluate some of that and determine what's fit for purpose. And it's really -- we look at -- one of the factors we always consider as we kind of take our own internal economic model and think about what's a prudent level of capital and then we evaluate that relative to some of the jurisdiction requirements. So -- but certainly, Bermuda has been and continues to be an optimization tool for us. And I think we'll continue to do that, not just -- and by the way, not just with Japan, sometimes we use it with other jurisdictions as well.\nJohn Barnidge: Thanks for the answer, John. And my follow-up question is on the opportunity to leverage the large data that you have. Can you talk about the opportunity set? Is it about driving greater profitability or revenues or close rates of persistency? Thanks.\nMichel Khalaf: Hi, John, it's Michel. Thanks for the question. So as I mentioned in my remarks, we've been investing in technology and capabilities and -- that's part of our sort the efficiency mindset that we've built here, freeing up capacity to make those important investments. And the fact that we have size here, we have a lot of data, obviously, is an advantage because we're able to leverage this data. And I would say there are three areas where we've seen, in some cases, early signs, in other cases, more advanced signs of real impact on progress. One is around the customer experience. And again, if you think about that, very important in terms of meeting not only current but future customer expectations, driving our competitive advantage. I think the other area where we're seeing a potential impact is around driving revenue growth. So technology and data can help drive that. And the third area is around efficiency. And again, here, we see significant opportunities. You can see from our direct expense ratio, which has come in at below the 12.3 [ph] guidance that we provided in the first half. And our expectation is that whereas we'll see sort of a tick up in the second half, which is typical, we will still expect to come in under the 12.3. And I would say, going forward, those investments that we're making and our ability to leverage data will continue to drive sort of a downward trend when it comes to that as well.\nJohn Barnidge: Thank you for that.\nOperator: And we'll move next to Mike Ward at Citi.\nMike Ward: Thanks, guys. Good morning. I was hoping to ask about holdings to your scheme. I'm curious how active those discussions are? Any kind of pressure or change in activity to execute before Fed cuts? Or is it agnostic to that, but any update?\nJohn McCallion: Hey, Mike, good morning. It's John. Thanks for the question. I think I can't remember the last time we spoke about this, but I'd say that obviously, we did the transaction back in November of last year. And think the environment has continued to progress is way I think we would put it. We are still in the same position today, which is that we don't -- we are continuing to meet with third parties. We continue to explore opportunities. This needs to be kind of a win-win, but there's no burning platform where we have to do something. So it's a real -- it's an opportunity. It's not a requirement for us to or a necessity for us. And so -- but that requires continuous discussions, evaluations, reviews We did a large nontraditional life transaction last year. We generally have traditional life blocks left. We have obviously LTC, and then we have VA. And obviously, the traditional life is very attractive to people, but it's also attractive to us in terms of returns. So I think that would be a price one. And then the other ones, there's limited supply of partners that would be willing to kind of think about that. So you're talking about a more narrow universe. So you continue to discuss those things, and we're happy to manage it ourselves. But if we're able to find unique opportunities, then we'll do that. But I would say it's gotten -- discussions continue, but no material changes in terms of momentum.\nMike Ward: Helpful. Thanks, John. And then maybe on private credit. It seems to be an area of attention, maybe a bit frothy. Just curious how you guys see that landscape? Are you leaning in or being more cautious? And I guess like -- what's your strategy? How do you balance having the ability to originate directly versus investing in some of the boutique shops that you've done?\nJohn McCallion: It's John again. It's an interesting question. I think, first, definitionally, private credit probably has 100 different definitions out there. So that's always a tough 1 to kind of decide which 1 you -- which everyone is talking about. But I think at the end of the day, we have been in private credit, broadly speaking, for 150 years, right? I mean you can -- if you cast a wide net there, whether it's our commercial mortgage loan origination, we have an ag loan platform, we're the largest ag lender outside of the US government. We're -- I think we're the number one infrastructure lender as well. And so -- but we typically were higher grade, and we have some higher-yielding products as well and so we have a number of origination platforms. It's something we've talked about over the years is a unique capability for us. And so -- but to your point, it's an area that everyone has been jumping in. So now you need to be much -- very disciplined in your approach. There is kind of a -- kind of view around the term private credit. And so we have approached it our way, which is for the long-term is the way we think about it. And -- so I think that's used to our approach and everyone has their own unique approach to it, but we're -- there are sectors that much more competitive today that I think we would say you need to be mindful of.\nMike Ward: Thanks, John.\nOperator: And that concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to John Hall for closing remarks.\nJohn Hall: Great. Thank you, operator, and thanks, everybody for joining for joining us this morning. Have a great summer.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Michel Khalaf",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with the second quarter results that we posted last night and believe the quarter clearly reflects MetLife's core strength, including the momentum across our businesses and greater predictability of our performance achieved through our consistent execution. The expectations we shared about our about our performance came to pass in the second, in line with our forecast, and in some cases, even better. After normal seasonal impacts in the first quarter, the performance of our flagship Group Benefits Group Benefits franchise shone through in the second quarter. Variable investment income, or VII, performed in line with the expectations we laid out in the first quarter, with the recovery in private equity returns partially offset by the performance of real estate funds, which saw significantly narrower losses in the second quarter. The broad diversification of our businesses has proven to be a fundamental strength for MetLife, creating many natural offsets and allowing us to generate growth while navigating the tides of shifting business and economic dynamics. And our ability to generate strong recurring cash flow, coupled with our discipline to apply capital to its highest and best use, enables us to drive sustained long-term value for our highest. In the second quarter, we reported adjusted earnings of $1.6 billion or $2.28 per share, up 18% from the prior year. The strong result was driven by favorable underwriting, good volume growth and higher variable investment income led by the positive performance I just mentioned. In total, net income in the mentioned was $912 million, substantially higher than $370 million in the prior year period. Strong adjusted earnings growth, aided by our unwavering focus on execution, generated outstanding results measured by several of our key performance metrics. MetLife posted a 17.3% adjusted return on equity in the quarter, well above our target range of 13% to 15% and a powerful example of our ability to efficiently deploy quarter, and generate profitable growth for our shareholders. MetLife's direct expense ratio in the second quarter was 11.9%, an improvement year-over-year and below our 12.3% annual target. As we have noted before, the positive leverage in this ratio is not only a measure of our ability to control costs, but also our capacity to grow revenue at a grow revenue at a faster rate than expenses, and the second quarter, both top line growth and lower direct expenses were contributors to our excellent quarterly expense ratio. When we established our Next Horizon strategy almost five years ago, it was supported by the interconnected foundational pillars of focus, simplify and differentiate. Our success in executing against our focus pillar is evident in the high-teen internal rates of return we achieve on new business and our strong enterprise-wide return on equity. Similarly, our success in executing against our simplified pillar manifests in our improving expense ratio. Our drive to execute against our differentiated pillar is essentially funded by the success we've achieved through our focus and simplify pillars. When we activated Next Horizon, we committed to free up $1 billion of expense capacity to invest in growth initiatives and technology, and we have done so, matching both sides of this equation. This shows up in dozens of internal technology initiatives that are making it easier for customers to purchase our products, as well as for them to receive their benefit and retirement payments. We see our capacity to invest in technology at MetLife's scale as a true differentiator relative to our competitors, which we believe will only get more impactful over time. There are many tools in our toolbox that will help drive this advantage forward, including artificial intelligence, or AI. From our standpoint, we believe MetLife's large pool of pool of data puts us in an advantaged position with AI having the potential to act as a force multiplier and further widen the divide in our favor, yet this is not just future talk. AI has been part of our playbook at MetLife for years, and we are seeing many initiatives move -- to implementation to create seamless and personalized customer experiences, improve decision-making and empower employees to focus on purposeful work. Be assured, we understand the power of AI commands great responsibility. With that in mind, we are at the vanguard of this topic, and we'll be issuing our policy on the responsible use of AI in the third quarter. Shifting to our business segment results, our leading Group Benefits business reported adjusted earnings of $533 million, representing an all-time quarterly record, as Group Life mortality experience snapped back from the seasonally impacted first quarter. Group Life mortality registered a benefit ratio of 79.1% in the second quarter. For the year-to-date period, the Group Life benefit ratio is now firmly at the lower end of our annual target range of 84% to 89%. Our growth strategy in the attractive Group Benefits space is twofold. On a national accounts basis, employers with greater than 5,000 employees, we are driving penetration across employer groups via new products and greater employee participation. On a regional accounts basis, employers with less than 5,000 employees, we are seeking to accelerate growth via a more refined distribution focus, broader suite of products and by attacking white space, the absence of any employer-offered benefits. Across both avenues of growth, national and regional, increasing enrollment and utilization of voluntary products are primary elements of boosting sales and margins. Moving to RIS. Business momentum was evident in our Retirement and Income Solutions segment, which enjoyed several notable wins. These included two jumbo pension risk transfer deals totaling $3.5 billion, a $2.2 billion stable value addition, as well as $3.3 billion of U.K. longevity reinsurance, underscoring the breadth of our liability origination in this segment. Beyond these wins, we continue to see strong flow for structured to see strong flow for structured settlements where we are the market leader, with more than $700 million sold in the second quarter. In Asia, we enjoyed solid growth across a range of metrics. While sales in Japan have been impacted by currency fluctuations, assets under management in Asia continue to grow, rising 5% on a constant currency basis in the quarter. Outside of Japan, sales were up 60% on the strength of a large group sale in Australia. Looking to Latin America, top line and bottom-line results were strong, again, despite some currency headwinds. Adjusted premium fees and other revenues were up 12% on a constant currency basis, pointing to sustained business momentum in Mexico, Chile, and Brazil. EMEA adjusted earnings rose 10% year-over-year on strong volume growth and higher recurring interest margins. Adjusted PFOs were up 12% on a constant currency basis due to strong sales across the region. Our business in EMEA is an example of our efficiency mindset at work. We simplified the structure of our business and refocused it on protection products with strong free cash flow, producing positive, tangible results. Moving to capital and cash. MetLife is well-capitalized, and our capacity to generate strong recurring free cash flow allows us to meet our commitments and provide flexibility to proactively seize attractive growth opportunities. And in the absence of compelling M&A opportunities, we will return capital to our shareholders. We were active on the capital management front in the second quarter from both an equity and debt standpoint. We paid common stock dividends of roughly $400 million, reflecting a 4.8% increase to our common stock dividend per share. We also bought back around bought back around $900 million of our common shares in the second quarter and repurchased about another $270 million worth in July. This brings total common stock repurchase for the year through July to about $2.3 billion. We still have roughly $2.8 billion remaining on our Board authorization. From a debt standpoint, we paid off or redeemed approximately $1.5 billion of debt and issued $500 million of senior debt. We have now largely prefunded our 2025 maturing debt issues. And finally, at the end of the second quarter, we had $4.4 billion of cash and liquid assets at our holding companies, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. Turning to our recently published Sustainability Report. MetLife operates within a virtuous circle comprised of our customers, our people, our communities, and our shareholders with the objective of delivering long-term value to each of these stakeholders. Perhaps nowhere is the success of these efforts more evident than in the pages of our Annual Sustainability Report and can be found on MetLife's website. In it, you'll see highlights of our efforts to build more confident futures for our stakeholders and updates on our sustainability commitments. Among our many successes, I am pleased to mention that the MetLife Foundation has surpassed $1 billion in total giving in its history. As a 156-year-old company, and the intent to log another 156 years more, sustainability is an essential part of MetLife's heritage. As I close, one of the objectives of our Next Horizon strategy was to emerge as a stronger, more predictable company. As we approach the finish line of that five-year strategic cycle, we are on track to accomplish, if not exceed, each of the key targets and objectives we laid out relative to distributable cash, operating leverage and return on equity. As I have said before, we do not stand still here at MetLife. We constantly look for opportunities to raise the bar and challenge ourselves further, pursuing these new challenges with passion and enthusiasm. We are hard at work developing and pressure testing our next five-year strategy, which we are calling New Frontier. This will build on the core pillars of Next Horizon while looking to accelerate growth, boost returns, and foster consistency. The first stop on this journey will begin with our annual board strategy review in September. Subsequently, I look forward to sharing with you our plans for the future at our Investor Day scheduled for December 12th of this year. Now I'll turn it over to John to cover our quarterly performance in more detail. Sorry, yes, in Australia. Hi, John, it's Michel. Thanks for the question. So as I mentioned in my remarks, we've been investing in technology and capabilities and -- that's part of our sort the efficiency mindset that we've built here, freeing up capacity to make those important investments. And the fact that we have size here, we have a lot of data, obviously, is an advantage because we're able to leverage this data. And I would say there are three areas where we've seen, in some cases, early signs, in other cases, more advanced signs of real impact on progress. One is around the customer experience. And again, if you think about that, very important in terms of meeting not only current but future customer expectations, driving our competitive advantage. I think the other area where we're seeing a potential impact is around driving revenue growth. So technology and data can help drive that. And the third area is around efficiency. And again, here, we see significant opportunities. You can see from our direct expense ratio, which has come in at below the 12.3 [ph] guidance that we provided in the first half. And our expectation is that whereas we'll see sort of a tick up in the second half, which is typical, we will still expect to come in under the 12.3. And I would say, going forward, those investments that we're making and our ability to leverage data will continue to drive sort of a downward trend when it comes to that as well."

            "name": "Ramy Tadros",
            "content": "Sure, Tom. Good morning. It's Ramy Tadros here. So, I think just from a headline ratio perspective, just to reference John's remarks, the overall ratio of 70.8, you want to just normalize that for one-off nonrecurring reserve adjustment. So that gets you back into kind of the 72.2 range. So, on your question on dental and disability. So in the second quarter for dental, we did see utilization rates come down from the first quarter. And what you're seeing here is just normal seasonality in that business and where Q1 tends to be heavier in terms of utilization as these benefits reset typically at the beginning of the year. And in terms of how we think about dental and dental pricing going forward, if you step back from the current quarter -- as you know, dental is an inflationary product, and we do deploy a number of levers to ensure we manage and stay within our target margins. And the two, I would highlight here is that the majority of our claims come within our network, which gives us a greater line of sight and control over margin. And the other key lever here is renewal pricing. And this is a business where we remain disciplined in terms of our rate guarantee periods. And in aggregate, we can reprice about 80% of our book every year. And that's exactly what we've been doing. So we've been seeing overall trends in the last kind of, call it, year and a half pick up, and we've seen pressure on margins because of that. And we've been taking appropriate action -- pricing action across the entire block in response to that trend. At this stage, most of these actions are behind us. We've implemented them across the book. And going forward, we'll continue to kind of monitor the trend and take actions as necessary. But just think of that as more business as usual of how you manage an inflationary product like dental. On disability, I would say the underlying block is running very much in line with expectations. We see some slight increases in incidents, but severity has come down and we continue to still see very strong recoveries. And so, the core business continues to be healthy and very much in line. And I would say just on renewals, in aggregate, we're hitting our target renewal pricing across the book. And we're still maintaining very strong persistency here. So we feel pretty good about both the new business, both about the renewal pricing, coupled with persistency and you clearly need to watch both in this business. I mean the short answer is that it's not affecting us. I would overall characterize the market as competitive, largely rational. You occasionally see aggressive pricing, but that is more of a -- of an outlier than the norm here, Tom. I mean our perspective here is also informed by ongoing rigorous surveillance. We look at every single metric in the market on an ongoing basis. And I would say we have not seen any evidence of a change in the competitive environment. The key point here for us is, as we've always talked about before, we have positioned this business to compete on a range of factors, inclusive of price. So while price is important, the basis of how we compete extends to multiple factors beyond price. This is ultimately a scale business, capabilities matter, experience matter, product breadth matters. And the ability to invest, which comes with scale, also really matters. So some of the new entrants that you've referenced are pretty small in terms of their overall premium size, they largely operate at the very small end of the market with narrower capabilities. And we haven't seen any meaningful impact or say, any impact on our book from those new competitors. Yeah. Good morning. It's Ramy here. Again, I think the one item I would point to here is the Group Life ratio. This is a historical low for us. It's mainly driven by lower volume. And the lower volume, if you step back and look at the CDC data, in terms of the old course [ph] death in the US population, that has come down significantly in the second quarter as well. So I would say that's the one here that was tailwind in the quarter, which we're pleased with. But if you think about our expectations on a go-forward basis, we think mortality will kind of moderate back in line with historical levels. You still see the seasonality that you in this business. And so a better view of that on a run rate basis, I'll bring you back to our guidance range. And if you look at that on a year-to-date basis, we're about 84.7. So I think that's the one that you want to kind of look out for in terms of the, I would say, the one item this quarter, which was material, which gave us a bit of a tailwind here. Good morning, Elyse. It's Ramy here. With respect to the pipeline, we're still seeing a pretty healthy pipeline here, particularly on the larger end of the market, which is where we focus and where we have [Technical Difficulty] advantages. And if you step beyond the next couple of quarters, there are just secular trends here that bode really well for us and how we're positioned. If you survey corporate DB plan sponsors and survey after survey, including ours, they all point to a significant and rising proportion of those plan sponsors who are looking to derisk and transfer the risk. You also have a very large stock of corporate DB assets, $3 trillion if you look at the private market only. And you've got funding status that's pretty good, which makes all of these risk transfers a lot more affordable. So these will always be lumpy, but sitting here now, looking at the rest of the year, we're seeing a pretty healthy jumbo pipeline. And we're also very pleased with what we've done this quarter. As you saw, we did $3.5 billion of PRT. And we're clearly very pleased with our performance here."

            "name": "John McCallion",
            "content": "Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I'll start with the 2Q 2024 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our liquidity and capital position. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the second quarter. We had net derivative losses, primarily due to the strengthening of the US dollar versus the yen, as well as higher interest rates. That said, derivative losses were partially offset by market risk benefit, or MRB, remeasurement gains due to the higher interest rates and stronger equity markets. Net investment losses were mainly the result of normal trading activity for fixed maturity securities in a higher rate environment. Overall, the investment portfolio remains well positioned, credit losses continue to be modest, and our hedging program performed as expected. On page 4, you can see the second quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, which should not have any notable items in either period. Adjusted earnings were $1.6 billion, up 9% and 11% on a constant currency basis. Favorable underwriting, volume growth and higher variable investment income drove the year-over-year increase. This was partially offset by lower recurring interest margins. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.28, up 18% and up 20% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, group benefits adjusted earnings were $533 million, up 43% year-over-year, primarily due to favorable underwriting margins. The group life mortality ratio was a record low of 79.1%, well below our annual target range of 84% to 89%, driven by favorable experience across all coverages. The strong group life results mirrored the notably low number of US deaths between the ages of 25 and 64 in April and May, according to CDC data. Regarding non-medical health, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 70.8% in the quarter, toward the bottom end of our annual target range of 69% to 74%, and below the prior year quarter of 73.7%. Favorable disability results benefited from a reserve adjustment of approximately $30 million after tax. Turning to the top line, group benefits adjusted PFOs were up 3% year-over-year. Taking participating contracts into account, which dampened growth by roughly 200 basis points, the underlying PFOs were up approximately 5% year-over-year, and at the midpoint of our 2024 target growth range of 4% to 6%. Group benefits 2Q 2024 year-to-date sales were up 11%, driven by strong growth across most products, including our suite of voluntary products. RIS adjusted earnings were $410 million, down 2% versus the prior year. Lower recurring interest margins were partially offset by higher variable investment income and strong volume growth. RIS investment spreads were 121 basis points, down 6 basis points sequentially, mainly due to the expiration of interest rate caps in the second quarter of 2024. We anticipate that spreads will remain between our annual target range of 115 and 140 basis points in the third quarter. Although we foresee an increase in variable investment income, it will likely be balanced out by reduced earnings from the expiration of the interest rate caps. RIS adjusted PFOs, excluding pension risk transfers, were up 4% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong sales of institutional income annuities as well as growth in UK longevity reinsurance. With regards to PRT, we had approximately $3.5 billion in deals in the second quarter and continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were $449 million, up 4% and 8% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to favorable underwriting margins and higher variable investment income. For Asia's key growth metrics, general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis were up 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Sales were up 4% on a constant currency basis compared to a strong prior year quarter. While Japan sales were down 19% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily due to the impact of yen volatility on foreign currency products. This was more than offset by strong sales growth of 60% in the rest of the region, including a large group case in Australia Latin America adjusted earnings were $226 million, up 3% on reported basis and 8% on a reported basis, primarily driven by solid volume growth across the region and favorable underwriting. This was partially offset by lower Chilean encaje returns of a negative 2.4% in Q2 of 2024 compared to a positive 1.4% in Q2 of the prior year. Latin America's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 9% or 12% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were $77million, up 10% and 20% on a constant currency basis, driven by volume growth and higher recurring interest margins. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins year-over-year. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 7% and 12% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 31% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong growth in Turkey, the Gulf and the U.K. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $153 million, down 27% versus the prior year quarter. The primary driver was the foregone earnings due to the reinsurance transaction that closed in November. Corporate and Other adjusted loss was $220 million versus an adjusted loss of $228 million in the prior year. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 24% and within our 2024 guidance range of 24% to 26%. On Page 5, this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the prior five quarters, including $298 million in Q2 of 2024. Private equity portfolio, which makes up the vast majority of the VII asset balance, had a positive 2.3% return in the quarter, while our real estate equity funds had a negative 1.4% return in the quarter. As a reminder, both private equity and real estate equity funds are reported on a one-quarter lag. Looking ahead, we expect VII returns to continue to improve over the course of second half of the year. On Page 6, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the last four quarters and the second quarter of 2024. As you can see in the chart, Asia, RIS and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest proportion of VII assets given their long-dated liability profile. Now turning to Page 7. The chart on the left of page illustrates the left of page illustrates the split of our net investment income between recurring and VII for the last three years, including second quarters of 2023 and 2024. Adjusted net investment income in Q2 of 2024 was up $120 million year-over-year. Recurring investment income has benefited from higher interest rates, partially offset by the roll-off from higher interest rates caps. In addition, we have seen VII improvement driven by higher private equity returns. Turning your attention to the right side of the page. This shows our new money yield versus roll-off shows our new money yield versus roll-off yields since second quarter of 2021. Over the last nine quarters, new money yields have outpaced roll-off yields, consistent with higher interest rates. In the second quarter of 2024, our global new money rate achieved the yield of 6.27%, 63 basis points higher than the roll-off rate. We anticipate that the new money yields will remain above roll-off yields given the prevailing interest rate environment. However, the spread can fluctuate depending on the mix of sales across our businesses. Now moving to expenses discussed on Page 8, this chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio for full year 2023 of 12.2% and the first two quarters of 2024, both at 11.9%. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our Q2 direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline. Looking ahead, we would expect our direct expense ratio to be higher in the second half of the year, consistent with the seasonal nature of our business. That said, our performance year-to-date positions us well to achieve a full year 2024 direct expense ratio of 12.3% or below demonstrating our consistent execution and a sustained efficiency mindset. I will now discuss our cash and capital positions on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were $4.4 billion at June 30th, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion, but down from $5.2 billion at March 31st. The sequential decline in holding companies' cash is primarily a result of approximately $1.5 billion used in April for a debt maturity and a debt redemption, partially offset by a $500 million senior debt issuance in June. Beyond this, cash of the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, and share repurchases of roughly $900 million in the second quarter, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, we have repurchased shares totaling approximately $270 million in July. For our US companies, preliminary second quarter year-to-date 2024 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.9 billion, essentially flat year-over-year, while net income was approximately $1.3 billion. We estimate that our total US statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18 billion as of June 30, down 2% from March 31, 2024, primarily due to dividends paid and derivative losses partially offset by operating earnings. Finally, we expect that Japan's solvency margin ratio to be approximately 670% as of June 30, which will be based on statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks. Before I wrap up, I would just like to highlight that we have an updated commercial mortgage loan slide as of June 30 in the appendix. Overall, the CML portfolio continues to perform as expected with attractive loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios as well as the expectation of modest losses. In summary, the underlying strength of our business fundamentals was evident with strong top line growth, disciplined underwriting and prudent expense management. Our Group Benefits segment achieved record earnings. Higher interest rates continue to support flows and spreads. And we continue to see improvement in variable investment income. MetLife continues to move forward from a position of strength with a strong balance sheet and a diversified set of market-leading businesses, generating solid recurring free cash flow. And we are committed to deploying this free cash flow to achieve responsible growth and build long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Yes. Thanks, Suneet. It's John. Good morning. So as you mentioned, so in the quarter, we came in at 121 basis points, that was within the 115 to 140 guidance. And then if you exclude VII, it was 119. And so a couple of things, right? We saw continued improvement in VII in the quarter. As you mentioned, we expected a decline from first quarter as a result of lower recurring interest margins due to the roll off of the interest rate caps. And we did anticipate it to be 8 to 10. It came in less, and it's primarily due higher-than-expected interest rates which we took advantage of during the course of the quarter. And so it was a little better than we thought. Having said that, I think our guidance that we gave last quarter is we continued to believe another 8 to 10 would occur during the course of the Q3 on ex-VII as most of the of the remaining interest rate caps mature over the course next few months. And then we should see spreads stabilize in most of the in-the-money interest rate caps purchased primarily during kind of pre- and even in the COVID era matures by then. So that's kind of how I would kind of play out the rest of this year. And I think if you go back to what we said at the outlook call, which was, we thought, all in, 2024 would show an all-in spread similar to 2023. And that's generally where we're trending towards. Yes. And I would just -- it's a large group case in Australia. I think you mentioned Japan, but... Yes. Now we did see some benefit in earnings. We saw a 4% increase in adjusted earnings on a reported as well as an 8% increase on a constant currency basis. This was driven both by favorable underwriting given by the surrenders, as well as variable investment income. When you look at surrender activities, it was higher than expected in the quarter, given we had the weaker yen as some customers choose to lock in some of the gains. And if we look at the VII in the quarter, Asia does get a higher allocation of real estate equity funds in the -- and so in the quarter, we did see better performance in the real estate relative to the prior year. We've also had good expense management in the quarter, and that's contributed to the stronger earnings. If you look at the outlook for the year, we expect full year earnings to kind of remain strong, in line with guidance. VII performance will continue to be a factor that will impact our earnings going forward. Wes, it's John. Good morning. So as you mentioned, 670% is our estimate for the quarter. We'll file that in a few weeks. I'd just like to start out by saying no concerns around capital generation or dividends, right? And that ratio tends to have some asymmetrical impacts when rates rise. But as we know, the overall economic value of businesses improved. So the other thing we saw in this quarter is it's generally a heavier cash out quarter for us. We have higher dividends. We pay taxes. So there's a little bit of timing there. And then as you mentioned, the new ESR comes into effect April 1, 2025. We'll report on that for the first time, March 31, 2026. And that is more of an economic framework, one of which that we have typically managed this business. We've used economic as well as stat as we think about like product pricing and development and things like that. So that's kind of a good place to start from. In addition, I'd say implementation is going well. We don't see any big issues. There are some -- a few items that we're just continuing to work through with the regulator. But even if those don't come to fruition, we can certainly manage, but we're hopeful to make some improvements to the kind of the current situation. All in, we're comfortable. And I'd say -- I'd say, supportive of moving from the SMR to the ESR. Okay. Great. Thanks, Wes. A lot in there to unpack, but let me just maybe start with the LTV. So you mentioned -- and we kind of forecasted this in the first quarter. We thought year prior, we had kind of given some peak to trough views. We thought it had another 10% broadly to go in some of the more distressed areas. And as you know, when we go through our annual appraisal process, it happens throughout the year, we typically wait for the second quarter. We find it hard to do it in the first quarter because we'd like to get financial information in our hands before we start that. So 2Q tends to be a heavy revaluation quarter. And so that's kind of what we saw happen generally in line with expectations. Overall, LTV ticked up one point overall. A couple of points more in office. And then as we look out for the rest of this year, probably heavier ones were done in the second quarter. We'll still see some, I'd say, modest deterioration, maybe another point overall in the second half and a little more maybe a couple of points in office. Look, I think it's playing out as expected. Last year, we had write-offs of roughly 20. We think this year, you're in kind of closer to maybe 100, but maybe below. So still modest. We had a little under $30 million year-to-date so far, and we think we're on track for kind of that kind of closer to $100 million of write-offs for the year, very well within kind of the modest area for us in terms of our capital and size and position. So again, we think the environment is -- despite the pressure, economic growth remains healthy and that's actually good news for real estate fundamentals. Despite office sector still probably has some kind of some work to do there, but you also have moderating construction pipeline, which is benefiting all properties. And so this is how this sector generally works out. It takes time. It doesn't happen overnight. You need to be well positioned going into it to be able to kind of manage through the kind of the pressure and the distress. And generally, the demand and supply factors typically work themselves out. So all in all, I think things are performing as expected for us, and no change to our view. Hey Jimmy. It's John. Good morning. Yeah, as was alluded to in kind of the opening remarks and earlier is that we do have another quarter of 8 to 10 bps is what we forecasted. Like I said earlier, we thought we were going to have 8 to 10 this quarter, but interest rates were a bit higher than we had assumed at the time we were discussing this in the Q1, and we took advantage of that and a few different things we could do. So then the remainder -- most of the remaining interest rate cash roll off this quarter, and then you should see stabilization. Also, we're projecting VII to marginally increase each of the next two quarters as well, kind of similar to the trend that we saw here. So, that would be kind of the offset comment I'd make to you. And then you should see some stabilization in the Q4. In terms of beyond that, we'll wait for outlook to go through that information. Hey John, it's John. Good morning. I'll take that one. So look, I think that's something we've always had in place for quite some time. We actually have two Bermuda entities right now. And we've had them for close to a decade in place. So it's a tool we have used and probably one that we have used successfully with some of our Japan products. I think ESR will allow you to reevaluate some of that and determine what's fit for purpose. And it's really -- we look at -- one of the factors we always consider as we kind of take our own internal economic model and think about what's a prudent level of capital and then we evaluate that relative to some of the jurisdiction requirements. So -- but certainly, Bermuda has been and continues to be an optimization tool for us. And I think we'll continue to do that, not just -- and by the way, not just with Japan, sometimes we use it with other jurisdictions as well. Hey, Mike, good morning. It's John. Thanks for the question. I think I can't remember the last time we spoke about this, but I'd say that obviously, we did the transaction back in November of last year. And think the environment has continued to progress is way I think we would put it. We are still in the same position today, which is that we don't -- we are continuing to meet with third parties. We continue to explore opportunities. This needs to be kind of a win-win, but there's no burning platform where we have to do something. So it's a real -- it's an opportunity. It's not a requirement for us to or a necessity for us. And so -- but that requires continuous discussions, evaluations, reviews We did a large nontraditional life transaction last year. We generally have traditional life blocks left. We have obviously LTC, and then we have VA. And obviously, the traditional life is very attractive to people, but it's also attractive to us in terms of returns. So I think that would be a price one. And then the other ones, there's limited supply of partners that would be willing to kind of think about that. So you're talking about a more narrow universe. So you continue to discuss those things, and we're happy to manage it ourselves. But if we're able to find unique opportunities, then we'll do that. But I would say it's gotten -- discussions continue, but no material changes in terms of momentum. It's John again. It's an interesting question. I think, first, definitionally, private credit probably has 100 different definitions out there. So that's always a tough 1 to kind of decide which 1 you -- which everyone is talking about. But I think at the end of the day, we have been in private credit, broadly speaking, for 150 years, right? I mean you can -- if you cast a wide net there, whether it's our commercial mortgage loan origination, we have an ag loan platform, we're the largest ag lender outside of the US government. We're -- I think we're the number one infrastructure lender as well. And so -- but we typically were higher grade, and we have some higher-yielding products as well and so we have a number of origination platforms. It's something we've talked about over the years is a unique capability for us. And so -- but to your point, it's an area that everyone has been jumping in. So now you need to be much -- very disciplined in your approach. There is kind of a -- kind of view around the term private credit. And so we have approached it our way, which is for the long-term is the way we think about it. And -- so I think that's used to our approach and everyone has their own unique approach to it, but we're -- there are sectors that much more competitive today that I think we would say you need to be mindful of."

            "content": "Hey, Ryan, it's Lyndon here. So let me give you some color on sales across Asia, including what we're seeing in Japan. So sales for the quarter grew 5%, including our divested operations in Malaysia. We also saw a 5% growth in assets under management. While Japan single premium FX sales were impacted by the yen weakness, we did see an offset when we look at across the rest of Asia. Japan sales were lower in the single premium US dollar products. But as you said, we're up against a tough comparative. In the second quarter, the weaker yen did impact the overall market for the foreign currency products. And so if we look at the overall banca market, this market has shrunk, but we continue to maintain our share in this space. Look, we have a diversified portfolio, and we are rebalancing between product mix between yen and US dollars. So if you look at the outlook for yen products, it has improved with higher interest rates and also with the positive macro environment that we're seeing in Japan. Now we have introduced a couple of new products, both the variable life as well as cancer product earlier this year. And they both have performed very well. We've got other product launches planned in the pipeline, some coming in later this year, as well as at the beginning of next year. So we've got strong growth in the rest of Asia, and that's also contributing to the overall story. We saw solid performance in Korea, in China, in India, and also strong year-over-year growth in all these countries. And then in the quarter, in Japan, we benefited from a large group case which came on risk in the second quarter. If we look at the outlook, first half actual sales were in line with the prior year, and we expect a similar trend as we go through the second half. So given this, we expect full year sales for Asia to be flat year-over-year. I hope that helps. Hey Jimmy, it's Lyndon here. So yeah, look, we did have a tough comparative last year. I think sales in Japan were up over 40% when we look at last year. So that is driving a lot of the results this year, but we are also seeing a weaker yen, and this has impacted the overall market for foreign currency products. The bank market, as I said, has declined, but we continue to maintain our market position over there. So I do think the volatility in the end is driving some of the decline we're seeing in sales. Look, I mean it is a competitive environment. But I would say it's rational. We always see a player get more aggressive once in a while, but we continue to maintain our pricing discipline and our focus on profitability. We've got a very diversified distribution platform. We've got a wide range of product set to both yen as well as U.S. dollar. We've got good investment origination capabilities along with strong internal reinsurance capabilities. All this combined kind of puts us in a good position, allows us to differentiate and maintain our competitive position in the market. Yeah, hi Elyse, its Lyndon here. As I said earlier, I mean, we're pleased with the overall results in Asia or earnings in the quarter. We did see higher-than-expected surrender activity, and that was driven by the weaker yen as some customers start to lock in their gains. And that was higher than expected in the quarter. In addition, we did see Asia does get a higher allocation of real estate equity funds. And in the quarter, we saw better performance in real estate relative to the prior year, so those two are sort of drivers for the strong earnings results in the quarter for Asia."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\n Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings.\n With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations. \nJohn Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate your participation on MetLife's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. In addition to our earnings release, we issued a press release last night announcing a $3 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization.\n Before we begin, I'd point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review.\n On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussions are other members of senior management.\n As usual, last night, we released our standard set of supplemental slides, which are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to them in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. An appendix to the slides features disclosures GAAP reconciliations and other information, which you should similarly review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session.\n Given the busy morning, Q&A will end promptly just before the top of the hour. In fairness to everyone, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michel. \nMichel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As you can see from last night's report, MetLife is getting off to a good start for the year. We delivered another solid quarter of financial results, reflecting strong top line growth, consistent execution and sustained momentum across our market-leading portfolio of businesses. We achieved this mindful that change and uncertainty remain constant in the current environment.\n Our resilience and consistency are made possible by the unwavering commitment of our associates, our unabated confidence in our all-weather Next Horizon strategy and our unyielding focus on controlling those factors we can control to drive value for our shareholders and other stakeholders.\n With change as a persistent backdrop, MetLife's 156-year track record of risk management is stable stakes for our customers and shareholders. As I addressed in my shareholder letter, central to this notion is protecting our balance sheet so we can meet the promises we've made to our policyholders and shareholders regardless of economic or geopolitical conditions.\n Risk management extends across virtually everything we do, the way we invest and manage our capital and liquidity to the way we price, underwrite and reserve for the products we sell. Another element of risk management at MetLife lies in our diversification. We operate across a range of products and geographies, many that have offsetting risk characteristics such as mortality versus longevity among others.\n Even within our business segments, we have diversification. Our Group Benefits business serves employers across a wide range of business sizes and industries and has customers in every state. A similar theme runs through Retirement and Income Solutions and can be seen in the multiple liability streams we are able to originate, capital markets, pension risk transfers, structured settlements, stable value, corporate-owned life insurance and longevity reinsurance, among others.\n Our diversification is at the core of who we are and further differentiates MetLife. It is not coincident, but by design. We have constructed a platform to deliver for the long term and believe our diversification promotes both sustainable and responsible growth.\n Turning to the quarter. We reported adjusted earnings of $1.3 billion or $1.83 per share, up 20% per share from the prior year period. This was aided by a partial rebound in variable investment income led by private equity gains, which delivered a positive return of 2.1%.\n In the aggregate, net income for the first quarter was $800 million, well above $14 million from the prior year period. Top line growth was strong across our market-leading set of businesses, with adjusted premium fees and other revenues, or PFOs, totaling $12 billion, up 4% compared to the first quarter of 2023. On a constant currency basis, PFOs were up 5%.\n Our unrelenting focus on execution continues to drive positive results across important key metrics. MetLife posted a 13.8% adjusted return on equity in the quarter, still within the 13% to 15% target range despite VII not yet hitting a more normal quarterly run rate. Our direct expense ratio of 11.9% improved from a year ago and was lower than our 12.3% annual target. The positive leverage captured by this ratio illustrates our ability to control costs as well as grow revenues at a faster rate than expenses.\n Shifting to MetLife's business performance in the quarter, Group Benefits generated $6.3 billion of adjusted PFOs, up 5% or up 6% adjusting for participating policies from the prior year period, driven by solid growth across most products, including further expansion and voluntary benefits.\n Our premier national accounts franchise continues to demonstrate its differentiation and deliver value to customers through its comprehensive range of products and a customer experience enhanced by innovative technology platforms. In the quarter, Group Benefits' adjusted earnings of $284 million was impacted by seasonally high life mortality and seasonally elevated nonmedical health utilization returning to a historical trend more recently masked by the pandemic.\n Showing the continued vitality of this flagship business, sales were up 25% from the prior year, propelled by our sustained efforts to drive enrollment, which pushed growth across core and voluntary products. Last month, MetLife launched our 2024 employee benefit front study in its 22nd year, the survey tracks evolving employer and employee dynamics and the impact that macro environment and other trends have on the workplace and the employee benefits ecosystem.\n Through the years, we've enjoyed tremendous engagement with our customers as a result of the survey demonstrated thought leadership and this year's survey with its focus on employee care was no different. The business case for employee care is clear.\n Our research and other studies showed that one organizations offer a range of benefits, employees are more holistically healthy and business performance is stronger. As the largest group benefits provider, this ties directly into our strategy to offer the widest array of products, which gives MetLife more opportunities to serve our customers and more avenues to drive growth.\n Our leading Retirement and Income Solutions business reported adjusted earnings of $399 million, essentially flat with last year. Higher interest rates continue to increase the attractiveness of many of the products we offer within RIS.\n Overall, quarterly sales in RIS were $2.7 billion, up 49% from the prior year, led by structured settlements and corporate-owned life insurance production.\n Our business in Asia posted a 51% increase in adjusted earnings on better variable investment income and favorable underwriting, particularly in Japan.\n Sales while robust were down relative to a strong quarter a year ago. Yet illustrating the strength of recent quarters, assets under management in Asia are up 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis.\n In Latin America, our momentum continues across the region, particularly in our 2 largest markets of Mexico and Chile. The segment generated another record quarter of adjusted earnings with $233 million, rising 8% and 5% on a constant currency basis.\n Moving to capital and cash. Our operative philosophy on capital deployment relies on a balance across investing in organic and inorganic growth and returning capital to shareholders via common dividends and share repurchase.\n During the first quarter, MetLife linked into capital management. We paid $377 million to shareholders via common stock dividends, and we repurchased almost $1.2 billion of our common stock. After the quarter, we have repurchased about another $300 million of common stock in April. Also in April, we boosted our common dividend per share by 4.8%.\n Year-to-date through April, we have repurchased about $1.5 billion of our common shares. Along with reporting our first quarter results, you saw that we also announced the addition of $3 billion to our repurchase authorization. Our total share repurchase authorization now stands at approximately $3.6 billion, which allows us to proceed with repurchase at a more measured pace for the balance of the year.\n Shifting to governance, we announced during the quarter that Laura Hay joined our Board of Directors effective in February. Most recently, she was the Global Head of KPMG's insurance practice. We are excited to have Laura bring her broad set of actuarial and financial skills and her business experience to our board.\n In closing, as we near the conclusion of our 5-year Next Horizon framework, we are engaged in a thoughtful process to chart the next course of our strategic journey, building on a strong well-established foundation. I don't anticipate an abrupt departure from what has successfully delivered on our purpose always with you building a more confident future, but rather a further evolution.\n As we sought to raise the bar during Next Horizon, asking more of ourselves and delivering more than our stated goals, we've already started advancing towards the next phase of our strategy. The core principles of Next Horizon anchor our future actions, and we remain embedded in our strategic thinking as we move ahead.\n We are building on our strong foundation with a growth mindset and a range of opportunities that would not have been possible just a few years ago. We are well positioned to further differentiate ourselves and deliver additional value to customers fueling higher levels of growth. We have a tremendous opportunity to leverage our scale and harness emerging technologies to drive margin expansion, all the while achieving greater overall operating consistency.\n Taken together, we believe these powerful factors will result in greater returns for our shareholders. To that end, I look forward to discussing our refreshed strategy at an Investor Day here in New York on December 12 of this year.\n Now I'll turn it over to John to cover our first quarter performance in greater detail. \nJohn McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 1Q '24 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our liquidity and capital position.\n Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the first quarter. We had net derivative losses, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the yen and Chilean peso as well as favorable equity markets and higher interest rates.\n That said, derivative losses were mostly offset by market risk benefit or MRB remeasurement gains due to the higher interest rates and stronger equity markets. Net investment losses were mainly the result of normal trading activity for fixed maturity securities in a rising rate environment. Overall, the investment portfolio remains well positioned. Credit losses continued to be modest and our hedging program performed as expected.\n On Page 4, you can see the first quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, which do not have any notable items in either period. Adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion, up 13% on a reported and constant currency basis. Higher variable investment income due to a rebound in private equity returns drove the year-over-year increase. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.83, up 20% and up 21% on a constant currency basis.\n Moving to the businesses. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were $284 million, down 7% year-over-year, primarily due to less favorable underwriting margins. The Group Life mortality ratio was 90.2%, a slight improvement versus Q1 of '23 of 90.5% and above the top end of our annual target range of 84% to 89% as Group Life's Mortality ratio tends to be seasonally highest in the first quarter.\n Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 73.9% in the quarter, at the top end of its annual target range of 69% to 74%, in line with our expectation of higher seasonal dental utilization in the first quarter.\n Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 5% year-over-year. Taking participating contracts into account, which dampened growth by roughly 100 basis points, the underlying PFOs were up approximately 6% year-over-year and at the top end of our 2024 target growth range of 4% to 6%.\n In addition, Group Benefits sales were up 25%, driven by strong growth across core and voluntary products.\n RIS adjusted earnings were $399 million, essentially flat versus Q1 of '23. Higher variable investment income was offset by lower recurring interest margins as well as less favorable underwriting margins. RIS investment spreads were 127 basis points at the midpoint of our annual target range of 115 to 140 basis points. This incorporates both the impact of the roll-off of our interest rate caps and the offsetting benefit of VII reemerging.\n RIS adjusted PFOs were up 25% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong sales of structured settlement products as well as growth in U.K. longevity reinsurance. With regards to pension risk transfers, while we did not complete any transactions in the first quarter, we continue to see an active market.\n Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were $423 million, up 51% and 57% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income, favorable underwriting margins and favorable tax benefits in Q1 of '24. For Asia's key growth metrics, general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis were up 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Sales were down 8% on a constant currency basis versus a strong prior year quarter.\n Latin America adjusted earnings were $233 million, up 8% and 5% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to volume growth and favorable underwriting margins. In addition solid Chilean encaje returns of 4.8% in Q1 of '24 compared to a negative 0.9% in Q1 of the prior year.\n Latin America's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 9% and 8% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region.\n EMEA adjusted earnings were $77 million, up 28% and 35% on a constant currency basis, driven by favorable underwriting, volume growth and higher recurring interest margins. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins year-over-year. While EMEA adjusted earnings were above trend this quarter, we still view the run rate to be $60 million to $65 million per quarter for the remainder of the year.\n EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 7% and 9% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 16% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong growth in Turkey and the U.K.\n MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $159 million versus $158 million in the prior year quarter. Higher private equity returns were offset by roughly $50 million in foregone earnings as a result of the reinsurance transaction that closed in November, in line with expectations.\n Adjusted earnings in the quarter were also pressured by a true-up associated with the reinsurance transaction.\n Corporate and other adjusted loss was $241 million versus an adjusted loss of $236 million in the prior year. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 23%, below our 2024 guidance range of 24% to 26% due to several favorable tax items in the quarter.\n On Page 5, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the prior 5 quarters, including $260 million in Q1 of '24. The private equity portfolio, which makes up the majority of the VII asset balance had a positive 2.1% return in the quarter, while real estate equity funds had a negative 5.8% return in Q1 of '24. Both are reported on a 1-quarter lag.\n In addition, as we've seen signs of improvement in PE secondary markets, we have opportunistically divested roughly $750 million of private equity general account assets in Q1 of '24 at a modest discount. The transaction structure will allow MetLife Investment Management to continue managing the assets from the sale. We believe this transaction, which is similar to the roughly $1 billion divestment that we made in 2022 is a thoughtful approach to managing our investment allocation while supporting an important and growing fee-generating business for MetLife.\n Looking ahead, we continue to expect VII returns to move toward the upper end of our near-term outlook range in the second half of the year, and we remain comfortable with our full year VII guidance of $1.5 billion.\n On Page 6, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the fourth quarter of 2023 and Q1 of '24. As you can see in the chart, RIS, Asia and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest proportion of VII assets given their long-dated liability profile.\n Now turning to Page 7. The chart on the left of the page shows the split of our net investment income between recurring and VII for the past 3 years and Q1 of '23 versus Q1 of '24. Adjusted net investment income in Q1 of '24 was up roughly $500 million or 10% year-over-year. While recurring investment income moderated in the quarter due to the roll off of the interest rate caps, we did see a solid recovery in PE returns driving the VII improvement year-over-year.\n Shifting your attention to the right of the page, which shows our new money yield versus roll-off yields since Q1 of '21. New money yields continue to outpace roll-off yields over the past 8 quarters, consistent with the rising rates. In the first quarter of 2024, our global new money rate achieved a yield of 6.6%, 103 basis points higher than the roll-off rate.\n Keep in mind, the roll-off rate can fluctuate from period to period, as it did in the first quarter due to a greater volume of higher-yielding floating rate assets paying off. We would expect this positive trend of new money yields outpacing roll-off yields to persist given the current level of interest rates.\n Now let's switch gears to discuss expenses on Page 8. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio for the full year 2023 of 12.2% and Q1 of '24 of 11.9%. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results.\n Our Q1 direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline. We are off to a good start achieving a full year 2024 direct expense ratio of 12.3% or below, demonstrating our consistent execution and a sustained efficiency mindset.\n I will now discuss our cash and capital positions on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were $5.2 billion at March 31, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. This includes approximately $1.4 billion used in April for a debt maturity and a debt redemption. We do not have any further debt maturities for the balance of the year.\n Beyond this, cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend and share repurchases of roughly $1.2 billion in the first quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, we have repurchased shares totaling approximately $330 million in April.\n Regarding our statutory capital for our U.S. companies, our 2023 combined NAIC RBC ratio was 407% which is above our target ratio of 360%. For our U.S. companies, preliminary first quarter 2024 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1 billion, essentially flat year-over-year, while net income was approximately $570 million.\n We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.3 billion as of March 31, 2024, down 6% from year-end 2023, primarily due to dividends paid and surplus notes repaid, partially offset by operating earnings.\n Finally, we expect the Japan solvency margin ratio to be approximately 725% as of March 31, which will be based on statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks.\n Before I wrap up, I would just highlight that we have an updated commercial mortgage loan slide as of March 31 in the appendix. Overall, the CML portfolio continues to perform as expected with attractive loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios as well as the expectation of modest losses.\n Let me conclude by saying that MetLife delivered another solid quarter to begin the new year. The underlying strength of our business fundamentals was evident with strong top line growth, coupled with disciplined underwriting and expense management.\n In addition, our core spreads remain robust and sustainable given the higher yield environment. Also, we saw a nice rebound in our private equity returns. While the current environment remains uncertain, we are excited about the outlook and growth prospects of our businesses over the near term and beyond.\n MetLife continues to move forward from a position of strength with a strong balance sheet and a diversified set of market-leading businesses, which generate solid recurring free cash flow. And we are committed to deploying this free cash flow to achieve responsible growth and build long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders.\n And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from Suneet Kamath with Jefferies. \nSuneet Kamath: Just wanted to start with VII. John, you had mentioned, I think, a real estate loss of 5.8%. Can you just unpack that a little bit? Was that actually losses on sales or appraisals? And how do you see that tracking as we move through the balance of the year? \nJohn McCallion: Sure, Suneet. Primarily appraisals and valuation. So we actually saw, if you recall, in the fourth quarter, it was fairly flat. Appraisals, they tend to lag a bit in terms of just market declines. And so we saw kind of a catch-up of that in the fourth quarter, which obviously gets reported here in the first quarter.\n Our view is that it will start to moderate. We probably still have some pressure in 2Q, but less so and then moderates through the rest of this year. And then we think you start to see things start to pick up in a positive way towards the latter part of this year into '25. That's kind of the outlook. \nSuneet Kamath: Michel, on your comments for future share buybacks. I think you used the word measured pace. Is that measured pace relative to what you did in the first quarter? Or is that relative to what you did in April? And is the plan to exhaust the $3.6 billion authorization in 2024? \nMichel Khalaf: Yes. Suneet, thanks for the question. So yes, I did use the word measure, and I was referring to the first quarter. But I think as you've seen in the first quarter and what you've seen from us over time is that we do move expeditiously and deliberately to return capital to shareholders, especially in the absence of other high-value capital deployment opportunities following divestments.\n We did so following the spin-off of our former retail business following the sale of Auto and Home, and we closed on our risk transfer deal in the fourth quarter.\n So looking ahead and without me getting overly prescriptive, I would say that we lead into the first quarter at a pace that is greater than what you might see for the balance of the year. \nOperator: Next, we go to the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. \nRyan Krueger: First, I just wanted to clarify one thing on the variable investment income comment. John, did you say that you expected to be towards the higher end of the range that you had given for the balance of the year? \nJohn McCallion: Yes. Ryan, it's John. I think Suneet's question was focused on real estate. And so I think what we're just trying to -- and regarding outlook in terms of the real estate funds and so we saw a negative return this quarter of 5.8%. I mentioned I thought it would be less negative next quarter, but we still think there'll be a little pressure in just kind of the appraisals coming through and then it will start -- it will kind of moderate from there and start to have an upward trajectory is kind of the way we put it. \nRyan Krueger: Okay. Got it. Other question was on the Group Benefits business. Can you talk more about the competitive environment you're seeing at this point as you went through January 1 renewals as well as what you saw with persistency and pricing? \nRamy Tadros: Sure, Ryan. It's Ramy here. I would say, in terms of our view of the competitive dynamics of the group business, it really hasn't changed. I mean, we've always talked about this as a competitive marketplace. And one, because of the short-tail nature of this business is on the whole rationale. And we also think and see that this is a market where there are many avenues for differentiation beyond price.\n And look, if you have the scale to invest in the business, you can create true differentiation in this market and grow profitability -- and grow profitably. So the price, while important, becomes one out of multiple factors in the consideration set.\n So with that background, we're very pleased with our growth in sales this year. You saw a 25% increase in sales year-over-year. I should note that the strength of that momentum was across the board. So life, disability, dental as well as our voluntary suite of products. And from a pricing perspective, we're very pleased with the rate adequacy we got for that new business. And we're also very pleased with the rate increases that we got on renewals that were commensurate with our targets. So it's not a pretty solid picture, both in terms of the growth, persistency as well as the pricing and the rate increases. \nOperator: Next, we move on to Wes Carmichael with Autonomous Research. \nWesley Carmichael: I had a question on pension risk transfer. I know you guys didn't have any deals in the quarter. But there were some deals that were done that were reasonable size and your peers has plenty of capital to support this marketplace right now. And there's actually another ongoing call right now that one of your peers are saying that PRT is not that good of a business this year, there's not as much spread. So I'm just wondering if pricing is getting more competitive there, if there's any dynamics changing in the marketplace. \nRamy Tadros: Thank you. It's Ramy here again. Look, the -- we're coming off a very successful 2023 year in terms of PRT, we had 5 cases totaling more than $5 billion in premium, and that was off the back of a record year in '22, where we wrote more than $12 billion of premiums. This business is lumpy. So I would remind you, we did not win any deals in Q1 of '23 either, and we did not win any deals in Q1 of '24.\n But having said that, we continue to see a very robust pipeline ahead of us, particularly for the jumbo end of the market, where we focus. And this is not surprising. We've got very healthy funding levels of defined benefit plans and the desire for large plan sponsors to derisk. And we see this trend continuing for many, many years, and we're well positioned to win our fair share of the market here.\n From a pricing perspective, I would just emphasize what we've always said is that we look at these jumbo PRT deals with an M&A lens, and you kind of need to do that given the large quantum of capital that any given deal can consume. And we're very disciplined to ensure that we deploy that capital to its best and highest use.\n So we evaluate each transaction carefully. We will only deploy capital if the risk-adjusted returns are healthy and the ROEs are aligned with our enterprise targets. And as you look forward, we still see this as a large profit pool, a big opportunity and one where we're going to get our fair share. \nWesley Carmichael: And Michel, I think you talked about higher rates increasing the attractiveness of your products. Just wanted to get a little perspective on capital deployment and how you're thinking about allocating capital towards growth in capital-intensive businesses where you can generate good IRRs versus buying back more stock, which continues to be pretty strong. \nMichel Khalaf: Yes. Sure, Wes. Thanks for the question. So our philosophy and approach is that we want to support organic growth. We've been doing so consistently. And you can see from our VNB disclosures the returns that we've been able to generate high teens and paybacks in the sort of mid-single digits.\n We like a good balance in terms of supporting organic -- deploying capital in support of organic growth. We continue to be in the flow looking at potential M&A transactions. We consider M&A to be a strategic capability here, but we're extremely disciplined when it comes to strategic set and sort of a consistent basis globally by which we look at M&A transactions.\n And then excess capital, as we've said, belongs to our shareholders. We want to continue to have an attractive dividend yield, and you can see that we increased our dividend by 4.8%. And then share repurchases, it's also sort of part of the equation. And so it's that balance that we like to maintain. And -- but we're certainly very keen on continuing to deploy capital in support of organic growth at attractive returns. \nOperator: And next, we move on to Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. \nJamminder Bhullar: So first on the question for John on your spreads in RIS. Healthy overall, but we saw a sequential decline in spreads, excluding variable investment income. And I think you attributed that to the expiration of some of the interest rate cap. So I'm wondering if you could give us some idea on the trajectory of that? And should we assume sort of a similar level of an impact from caps that are expiring in the next few quarters? And when should we assume that dynamic is going to be over? \nJohn McCallion: Jimmy, thanks for the question. Yes, I think it's pretty much in line in terms of the roll off of the -- given the roll-off of the cap. So in terms of XVII, that was generally in line. I think VII came in better than we expected. As you recall, we talked about a 115 to 140 spread range for the segment. So the middle of the range was 127 for the year.\n We still think that's the right answer. And the way we got there was that we have a kind of a quarterly roll off of these interest rate caps. Remember, we bought these back a while ago when there wasn't a risk of rising rates, but is to protect against a short-end rise fairly quickly so that it allows the long end to kind of emerge in over time. It's basically worked as planned. But they all effectively roll off for the most part throughout this year.\n So in terms of expectations, we will see another -- so I think it was 10 bps maybe decline between 4Q and 1Q. I think 8% to 10% next quarter is not a bad estimate. It will depend on what VII does next quarter. We still think VII has kind of a reemergence to occur. So we had a good quarter this quarter, but that can gradually grow throughout the year, probably a bigger growth in the second half and then probably have one more quarter of 8 to 10 bps occurring, and it flattens out between third and fourth quarter. Basically, it's minimal, if not immaterial roll off.\n So that's how to think about the roll off, and that's how we get to the midpoint of that range when we gave the guidance. So we -- obviously, in the past, we've spent quite a bit of time on XVII. We're happy to give that number, but we're really looking at the total spread all in now and as you think about the reemergence of VII. \nJamminder Bhullar: Okay. And then for Ramy, on margins and Group Benefits. I think group life margin, you had assumed that they'd be weak in 1Q because of seasonality. Dental claims picked up as well. And do you attribute most of that to seasonality as well? Or are you seeing just higher incidents for some reason? \nRamy Tadros: Jimmy, it's basically seasonality story. As you know, with dental claims, the benefits reset at the end of the calendar year. So come January, you just get to see more utilization as the claims reset. And therefore, that's just a seasonally higher ratio. If you look at our overall non-medical health ratio, this first quarter seasonality is baked into our guidance ranges. I remind you, these are annual ranges, and our expectations are at this point, that will be well within our range, 69% to 74% for the full year.\n And I would also remind you that we did lower that range by 1 point earlier this year. So very much a seasonality story and feel very good about being within that range for the full year. \nOperator: And next, we move to Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. \nThomas Gallagher: Just a few follow-ups to Jimmy's questions. John, if I followed your math that would suggest about 20 basis points of lower base spreads for RIS versus Q1 level if I look at towards the end of 2024. Is that directionally right? \nJohn McCallion: Yes, 8 to 10, you took the top end of that range, but sure, it's close -- 16 to 20. \nThomas Gallagher: 18 to 20? \nJohn McCallion: Yes. \nThomas Gallagher: Okay. And then for -- and Ramy, for Group Benefits, I just want to make sure I have the right expectation here. The -- if I look at last year, and I look at the last 3 quarters of the year, I think earnings averaged around $450 million, that's probably $170 million, $180 million above what you did in Q1 this year. So is it fair to say you still expect to grow above the $450 million earnings level for the next 3 quarters?\n In other words, it was just worse seasonality this year. And then is it -- and said another way, it sounds like dental utilization was quite high. You fully expect to recover and see a big earnings snapback in dental for the balance of the year. \nRamy Tadros: Tom, I mean the way you can triangulate to an earnings number is take our top line and our guidance ratio. So from a top line perspective, we're still very much within the 4% to 6% range. We got a 6% PFO growth this year -- this quarter, but think of that ratio being close to the midpoint of the range for the full year.\n And for sure, think of both non-medical health, which includes dental moderating for the full year. So think of that going towards the midpoint of the range. And think of the same thing happening with the life underwriting ratio. So very much a seasonality story for this quarter.\n Remember, as Michel alluded in his remarks, that seasonality was kind of masked in the last few years with COVID and different behaviors on the dental side and clearly on the mortality side in terms of what we've seen. And that's just now returning to a more regular pattern, if you will. So I hope that helps you think through the guidance growth, both given the top line number that I've articulated as well as the midpoint of these ratios for the full year? \nThomas Gallagher: That does. And if I could just sneak in one other follow-up. So dental utilization, you would fully expect that to be far lower in 2Q than 1Q? Or is there going to be some tail on that where you might see some level of higher utilization and lower earnings into 2Q as well, would you say? \nRamy Tadros: I mean Q3 tends to be the lightest. So you'd expect it to come down in the second quarter. Q3 will be a lot lighter. So there's going to be always -- there will be a decrease, whether it's going to happen as a sharp cliff in Q2 and then another one in Q3 or different pattern, it's hard to predict. But again, think of it as a full year range and think of that ratio coming to the midpoint for the full year. \nJohn McCallion: And Tom, maybe I'll just add a follow-up again on your first question. I mean, I think also just you only focused on XVII. But as I said, I think what's really important is that we think of the all-in spread here, and that's -- all of that is very much in line with what we gave in the outlook for the midpoint of the range. \nOperator: Next, we move on to Brian Meredith with UBS. \nJustin Tucker: This is Justin Tucker on for Brian. My first question is about RIS. When looking at the structured settlement results, could you kind of help us understand how much of the demand is driven by the favorable interest rate environment? And then how much of it is driven by the courts opening and social inflation?\n And then furthermore, just curious about the sensitivity to those factors. If interest rates do decrease, do you think that has a bigger impact on structured settlement demand versus a dampening of social inflation? \nRamy Tadros: It's Ramy here. I mean I would say interest rates is the primary driver of this. You have seen coming out of the pandemic, call it, pent-up demand with the courts being closed and some of that clearly kind of did cause an increase in volumes earlier on. That's now stabilized, and it's very much an interest rate-driven volume increases.\n And you do have given court settlements have increased. You do have some social inflation component. But I would say interest rates is the primary one. We are a major player in this market. The market has grown substantially over the last few years, and we have maintained a pretty good share in that market. And it's a very specialized market in terms of the distribution channel, the underwriting, et cetera. And we're extremely pleased both with the volume, but as importantly, with the ROEs and the returns we're able to achieve in this market. \nJustin Tucker: Great. And then my follow-up question is just on Latin America. Sales were flat year-over-year. I'm just kind of curious about what you're seeing in the overall market for demand and what you expect with sales going forward? \nEric Sacha Clurfain: Yes. Justin, thanks for the question. This is Eric. So overall, we're pleased really with our results this quarter. This is a good start of the year after what was a record year in 2023. The quarter's results are primarily driven by favorable underwriting, some of which we don't expect to recur strong encaje returns and solid volume growth.\n And to your question, from a top line perspective, we've seen all key markets contributing to the high solid -- high single-digit PFO growth, and that was supported by a solid sales and strong persistency. So from a sales perspective, specifically, this quarter is a tough compare given that last year, we had a 36% growth, which included 2 large employee benefits and corporate pension sales in Mexico and Brazil.\n Now if you exclude these 2 sales from 2023, our sales are up roughly 10% year-over-year. So all in all, we're really pleased with the growth trajectory and the momentum in the region. And we believe that the outlook guidance we provided is still a reasonable run rate for the remainder of the year. \nOperator: And we have no other questions. I'll be turning the conference back to John Hall for closing comments. \nJohn Hall: Great. Thank you very much, operator, and thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning on a very busy day. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Michel Khalaf",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As you can see from last night's report, MetLife is getting off to a good start for the year. We delivered another solid quarter of financial results, reflecting strong top line growth, consistent execution and sustained momentum across our market-leading portfolio of businesses. We achieved this mindful that change and uncertainty remain constant in the current environment.\n Our resilience and consistency are made possible by the unwavering commitment of our associates, our unabated confidence in our all-weather Next Horizon strategy and our unyielding focus on controlling those factors we can control to drive value for our shareholders and other stakeholders.\n With change as a persistent backdrop, MetLife's 156-year track record of risk management is stable stakes for our customers and shareholders. As I addressed in my shareholder letter, central to this notion is protecting our balance sheet so we can meet the promises we've made to our policyholders and shareholders regardless of economic or geopolitical conditions.\n Risk management extends across virtually everything we do, the way we invest and manage our capital and liquidity to the way we price, underwrite and reserve for the products we sell. Another element of risk management at MetLife lies in our diversification. We operate across a range of products and geographies, many that have offsetting risk characteristics such as mortality versus longevity among others.\n Even within our business segments, we have diversification. Our Group Benefits business serves employers across a wide range of business sizes and industries and has customers in every state. A similar theme runs through Retirement and Income Solutions and can be seen in the multiple liability streams we are able to originate, capital markets, pension risk transfers, structured settlements, stable value, corporate-owned life insurance and longevity reinsurance, among others.\n Our diversification is at the core of who we are and further differentiates MetLife. It is not coincident, but by design. We have constructed a platform to deliver for the long term and believe our diversification promotes both sustainable and responsible growth.\n Turning to the quarter. We reported adjusted earnings of $1.3 billion or $1.83 per share, up 20% per share from the prior year period. This was aided by a partial rebound in variable investment income led by private equity gains, which delivered a positive return of 2.1%.\n In the aggregate, net income for the first quarter was $800 million, well above $14 million from the prior year period. Top line growth was strong across our market-leading set of businesses, with adjusted premium fees and other revenues, or PFOs, totaling $12 billion, up 4% compared to the first quarter of 2023. On a constant currency basis, PFOs were up 5%.\n Our unrelenting focus on execution continues to drive positive results across important key metrics. MetLife posted a 13.8% adjusted return on equity in the quarter, still within the 13% to 15% target range despite VII not yet hitting a more normal quarterly run rate. Our direct expense ratio of 11.9% improved from a year ago and was lower than our 12.3% annual target. The positive leverage captured by this ratio illustrates our ability to control costs as well as grow revenues at a faster rate than expenses.\n Shifting to MetLife's business performance in the quarter, Group Benefits generated $6.3 billion of adjusted PFOs, up 5% or up 6% adjusting for participating policies from the prior year period, driven by solid growth across most products, including further expansion and voluntary benefits.\n Our premier national accounts franchise continues to demonstrate its differentiation and deliver value to customers through its comprehensive range of products and a customer experience enhanced by innovative technology platforms. In the quarter, Group Benefits' adjusted earnings of $284 million was impacted by seasonally high life mortality and seasonally elevated nonmedical health utilization returning to a historical trend more recently masked by the pandemic.\n Showing the continued vitality of this flagship business, sales were up 25% from the prior year, propelled by our sustained efforts to drive enrollment, which pushed growth across core and voluntary products. Last month, MetLife launched our 2024 employee benefit front study in its 22nd year, the survey tracks evolving employer and employee dynamics and the impact that macro environment and other trends have on the workplace and the employee benefits ecosystem.\n Through the years, we've enjoyed tremendous engagement with our customers as a result of the survey demonstrated thought leadership and this year's survey with its focus on employee care was no different. The business case for employee care is clear.\n Our research and other studies showed that one organizations offer a range of benefits, employees are more holistically healthy and business performance is stronger. As the largest group benefits provider, this ties directly into our strategy to offer the widest array of products, which gives MetLife more opportunities to serve our customers and more avenues to drive growth.\n Our leading Retirement and Income Solutions business reported adjusted earnings of $399 million, essentially flat with last year. Higher interest rates continue to increase the attractiveness of many of the products we offer within RIS.\n Overall, quarterly sales in RIS were $2.7 billion, up 49% from the prior year, led by structured settlements and corporate-owned life insurance production.\n Our business in Asia posted a 51% increase in adjusted earnings on better variable investment income and favorable underwriting, particularly in Japan.\n Sales while robust were down relative to a strong quarter a year ago. Yet illustrating the strength of recent quarters, assets under management in Asia are up 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis.\n In Latin America, our momentum continues across the region, particularly in our 2 largest markets of Mexico and Chile. The segment generated another record quarter of adjusted earnings with $233 million, rising 8% and 5% on a constant currency basis.\n Moving to capital and cash. Our operative philosophy on capital deployment relies on a balance across investing in organic and inorganic growth and returning capital to shareholders via common dividends and share repurchase.\n During the first quarter, MetLife linked into capital management. We paid $377 million to shareholders via common stock dividends, and we repurchased almost $1.2 billion of our common stock. After the quarter, we have repurchased about another $300 million of common stock in April. Also in April, we boosted our common dividend per share by 4.8%.\n Year-to-date through April, we have repurchased about $1.5 billion of our common shares. Along with reporting our first quarter results, you saw that we also announced the addition of $3 billion to our repurchase authorization. Our total share repurchase authorization now stands at approximately $3.6 billion, which allows us to proceed with repurchase at a more measured pace for the balance of the year.\n Shifting to governance, we announced during the quarter that Laura Hay joined our Board of Directors effective in February. Most recently, she was the Global Head of KPMG's insurance practice. We are excited to have Laura bring her broad set of actuarial and financial skills and her business experience to our board.\n In closing, as we near the conclusion of our 5-year Next Horizon framework, we are engaged in a thoughtful process to chart the next course of our strategic journey, building on a strong well-established foundation. I don't anticipate an abrupt departure from what has successfully delivered on our purpose always with you building a more confident future, but rather a further evolution.\n As we sought to raise the bar during Next Horizon, asking more of ourselves and delivering more than our stated goals, we've already started advancing towards the next phase of our strategy. The core principles of Next Horizon anchor our future actions, and we remain embedded in our strategic thinking as we move ahead.\n We are building on our strong foundation with a growth mindset and a range of opportunities that would not have been possible just a few years ago. We are well positioned to further differentiate ourselves and deliver additional value to customers fueling higher levels of growth. We have a tremendous opportunity to leverage our scale and harness emerging technologies to drive margin expansion, all the while achieving greater overall operating consistency.\n Taken together, we believe these powerful factors will result in greater returns for our shareholders. To that end, I look forward to discussing our refreshed strategy at an Investor Day here in New York on December 12 of this year.\n Now I'll turn it over to John to cover our first quarter performance in greater detail. Yes. Suneet, thanks for the question. So yes, I did use the word measure, and I was referring to the first quarter. But I think as you've seen in the first quarter and what you've seen from us over time is that we do move expeditiously and deliberately to return capital to shareholders, especially in the absence of other high-value capital deployment opportunities following divestments.\n We did so following the spin-off of our former retail business following the sale of Auto and Home, and we closed on our risk transfer deal in the fourth quarter.\n So looking ahead and without me getting overly prescriptive, I would say that we lead into the first quarter at a pace that is greater than what you might see for the balance of the year. Yes. Sure, Wes. Thanks for the question. So our philosophy and approach is that we want to support organic growth. We've been doing so consistently. And you can see from our VNB disclosures the returns that we've been able to generate high teens and paybacks in the sort of mid-single digits.\n We like a good balance in terms of supporting organic -- deploying capital in support of organic growth. We continue to be in the flow looking at potential M&A transactions. We consider M&A to be a strategic capability here, but we're extremely disciplined when it comes to strategic set and sort of a consistent basis globally by which we look at M&A transactions.\n And then excess capital, as we've said, belongs to our shareholders. We want to continue to have an attractive dividend yield, and you can see that we increased our dividend by 4.8%. And then share repurchases, it's also sort of part of the equation. And so it's that balance that we like to maintain. And -- but we're certainly very keen on continuing to deploy capital in support of organic growth at attractive returns."

            "content": "Sure, Ryan. It's Ramy here. I would say, in terms of our view of the competitive dynamics of the group business, it really hasn't changed. I mean, we've always talked about this as a competitive marketplace. And one, because of the short-tail nature of this business is on the whole rationale. And we also think and see that this is a market where there are many avenues for differentiation beyond price.\n And look, if you have the scale to invest in the business, you can create true differentiation in this market and grow profitability -- and grow profitably. So the price, while important, becomes one out of multiple factors in the consideration set.\n So with that background, we're very pleased with our growth in sales this year. You saw a 25% increase in sales year-over-year. I should note that the strength of that momentum was across the board. So life, disability, dental as well as our voluntary suite of products. And from a pricing perspective, we're very pleased with the rate adequacy we got for that new business. And we're also very pleased with the rate increases that we got on renewals that were commensurate with our targets. So it's not a pretty solid picture, both in terms of the growth, persistency as well as the pricing and the rate increases. Thank you. It's Ramy here again. Look, the -- we're coming off a very successful 2023 year in terms of PRT, we had 5 cases totaling more than $5 billion in premium, and that was off the back of a record year in '22, where we wrote more than $12 billion of premiums. This business is lumpy. So I would remind you, we did not win any deals in Q1 of '23 either, and we did not win any deals in Q1 of '24.\n But having said that, we continue to see a very robust pipeline ahead of us, particularly for the jumbo end of the market, where we focus. And this is not surprising. We've got very healthy funding levels of defined benefit plans and the desire for large plan sponsors to derisk. And we see this trend continuing for many, many years, and we're well positioned to win our fair share of the market here.\n From a pricing perspective, I would just emphasize what we've always said is that we look at these jumbo PRT deals with an M&A lens, and you kind of need to do that given the large quantum of capital that any given deal can consume. And we're very disciplined to ensure that we deploy that capital to its best and highest use.\n So we evaluate each transaction carefully. We will only deploy capital if the risk-adjusted returns are healthy and the ROEs are aligned with our enterprise targets. And as you look forward, we still see this as a large profit pool, a big opportunity and one where we're going to get our fair share. Jimmy, it's basically seasonality story. As you know, with dental claims, the benefits reset at the end of the calendar year. So come January, you just get to see more utilization as the claims reset. And therefore, that's just a seasonally higher ratio. If you look at our overall non-medical health ratio, this first quarter seasonality is baked into our guidance ranges. I remind you, these are annual ranges, and our expectations are at this point, that will be well within our range, 69% to 74% for the full year.\n And I would also remind you that we did lower that range by 1 point earlier this year. So very much a seasonality story and feel very good about being within that range for the full year. Tom, I mean the way you can triangulate to an earnings number is take our top line and our guidance ratio. So from a top line perspective, we're still very much within the 4% to 6% range. We got a 6% PFO growth this year -- this quarter, but think of that ratio being close to the midpoint of the range for the full year.\n And for sure, think of both non-medical health, which includes dental moderating for the full year. So think of that going towards the midpoint of the range. And think of the same thing happening with the life underwriting ratio. So very much a seasonality story for this quarter.\n Remember, as Michel alluded in his remarks, that seasonality was kind of masked in the last few years with COVID and different behaviors on the dental side and clearly on the mortality side in terms of what we've seen. And that's just now returning to a more regular pattern, if you will. So I hope that helps you think through the guidance growth, both given the top line number that I've articulated as well as the midpoint of these ratios for the full year? I mean Q3 tends to be the lightest. So you'd expect it to come down in the second quarter. Q3 will be a lot lighter. So there's going to be always -- there will be a decrease, whether it's going to happen as a sharp cliff in Q2 and then another one in Q3 or different pattern, it's hard to predict. But again, think of it as a full year range and think of that ratio coming to the midpoint for the full year. It's Ramy here. I mean I would say interest rates is the primary driver of this. You have seen coming out of the pandemic, call it, pent-up demand with the courts being closed and some of that clearly kind of did cause an increase in volumes earlier on. That's now stabilized, and it's very much an interest rate-driven volume increases.\n And you do have given court settlements have increased. You do have some social inflation component. But I would say interest rates is the primary one. We are a major player in this market. The market has grown substantially over the last few years, and we have maintained a pretty good share in that market. And it's a very specialized market in terms of the distribution channel, the underwriting, et cetera. And we're extremely pleased both with the volume, but as importantly, with the ROEs and the returns we're able to achieve in this market."

            "content": "Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 1Q '24 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our liquidity and capital position.\n Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the first quarter. We had net derivative losses, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the yen and Chilean peso as well as favorable equity markets and higher interest rates.\n That said, derivative losses were mostly offset by market risk benefit or MRB remeasurement gains due to the higher interest rates and stronger equity markets. Net investment losses were mainly the result of normal trading activity for fixed maturity securities in a rising rate environment. Overall, the investment portfolio remains well positioned. Credit losses continued to be modest and our hedging program performed as expected.\n On Page 4, you can see the first quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, which do not have any notable items in either period. Adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion, up 13% on a reported and constant currency basis. Higher variable investment income due to a rebound in private equity returns drove the year-over-year increase. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.83, up 20% and up 21% on a constant currency basis.\n Moving to the businesses. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were $284 million, down 7% year-over-year, primarily due to less favorable underwriting margins. The Group Life mortality ratio was 90.2%, a slight improvement versus Q1 of '23 of 90.5% and above the top end of our annual target range of 84% to 89% as Group Life's Mortality ratio tends to be seasonally highest in the first quarter.\n Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 73.9% in the quarter, at the top end of its annual target range of 69% to 74%, in line with our expectation of higher seasonal dental utilization in the first quarter.\n Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 5% year-over-year. Taking participating contracts into account, which dampened growth by roughly 100 basis points, the underlying PFOs were up approximately 6% year-over-year and at the top end of our 2024 target growth range of 4% to 6%.\n In addition, Group Benefits sales were up 25%, driven by strong growth across core and voluntary products.\n RIS adjusted earnings were $399 million, essentially flat versus Q1 of '23. Higher variable investment income was offset by lower recurring interest margins as well as less favorable underwriting margins. RIS investment spreads were 127 basis points at the midpoint of our annual target range of 115 to 140 basis points. This incorporates both the impact of the roll-off of our interest rate caps and the offsetting benefit of VII reemerging.\n RIS adjusted PFOs were up 25% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong sales of structured settlement products as well as growth in U.K. longevity reinsurance. With regards to pension risk transfers, while we did not complete any transactions in the first quarter, we continue to see an active market.\n Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were $423 million, up 51% and 57% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income, favorable underwriting margins and favorable tax benefits in Q1 of '24. For Asia's key growth metrics, general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis were up 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Sales were down 8% on a constant currency basis versus a strong prior year quarter.\n Latin America adjusted earnings were $233 million, up 8% and 5% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to volume growth and favorable underwriting margins. In addition solid Chilean encaje returns of 4.8% in Q1 of '24 compared to a negative 0.9% in Q1 of the prior year.\n Latin America's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 9% and 8% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region.\n EMEA adjusted earnings were $77 million, up 28% and 35% on a constant currency basis, driven by favorable underwriting, volume growth and higher recurring interest margins. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins year-over-year. While EMEA adjusted earnings were above trend this quarter, we still view the run rate to be $60 million to $65 million per quarter for the remainder of the year.\n EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 7% and 9% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 16% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong growth in Turkey and the U.K.\n MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $159 million versus $158 million in the prior year quarter. Higher private equity returns were offset by roughly $50 million in foregone earnings as a result of the reinsurance transaction that closed in November, in line with expectations.\n Adjusted earnings in the quarter were also pressured by a true-up associated with the reinsurance transaction.\n Corporate and other adjusted loss was $241 million versus an adjusted loss of $236 million in the prior year. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 23%, below our 2024 guidance range of 24% to 26% due to several favorable tax items in the quarter.\n On Page 5, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the prior 5 quarters, including $260 million in Q1 of '24. The private equity portfolio, which makes up the majority of the VII asset balance had a positive 2.1% return in the quarter, while real estate equity funds had a negative 5.8% return in Q1 of '24. Both are reported on a 1-quarter lag.\n In addition, as we've seen signs of improvement in PE secondary markets, we have opportunistically divested roughly $750 million of private equity general account assets in Q1 of '24 at a modest discount. The transaction structure will allow MetLife Investment Management to continue managing the assets from the sale. We believe this transaction, which is similar to the roughly $1 billion divestment that we made in 2022 is a thoughtful approach to managing our investment allocation while supporting an important and growing fee-generating business for MetLife.\n Looking ahead, we continue to expect VII returns to move toward the upper end of our near-term outlook range in the second half of the year, and we remain comfortable with our full year VII guidance of $1.5 billion.\n On Page 6, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the fourth quarter of 2023 and Q1 of '24. As you can see in the chart, RIS, Asia and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest proportion of VII assets given their long-dated liability profile.\n Now turning to Page 7. The chart on the left of the page shows the split of our net investment income between recurring and VII for the past 3 years and Q1 of '23 versus Q1 of '24. Adjusted net investment income in Q1 of '24 was up roughly $500 million or 10% year-over-year. While recurring investment income moderated in the quarter due to the roll off of the interest rate caps, we did see a solid recovery in PE returns driving the VII improvement year-over-year.\n Shifting your attention to the right of the page, which shows our new money yield versus roll-off yields since Q1 of '21. New money yields continue to outpace roll-off yields over the past 8 quarters, consistent with the rising rates. In the first quarter of 2024, our global new money rate achieved a yield of 6.6%, 103 basis points higher than the roll-off rate.\n Keep in mind, the roll-off rate can fluctuate from period to period, as it did in the first quarter due to a greater volume of higher-yielding floating rate assets paying off. We would expect this positive trend of new money yields outpacing roll-off yields to persist given the current level of interest rates.\n Now let's switch gears to discuss expenses on Page 8. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio for the full year 2023 of 12.2% and Q1 of '24 of 11.9%. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results.\n Our Q1 direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline. We are off to a good start achieving a full year 2024 direct expense ratio of 12.3% or below, demonstrating our consistent execution and a sustained efficiency mindset.\n I will now discuss our cash and capital positions on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were $5.2 billion at March 31, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. This includes approximately $1.4 billion used in April for a debt maturity and a debt redemption. We do not have any further debt maturities for the balance of the year.\n Beyond this, cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend and share repurchases of roughly $1.2 billion in the first quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, we have repurchased shares totaling approximately $330 million in April.\n Regarding our statutory capital for our U.S. companies, our 2023 combined NAIC RBC ratio was 407% which is above our target ratio of 360%. For our U.S. companies, preliminary first quarter 2024 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1 billion, essentially flat year-over-year, while net income was approximately $570 million.\n We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.3 billion as of March 31, 2024, down 6% from year-end 2023, primarily due to dividends paid and surplus notes repaid, partially offset by operating earnings.\n Finally, we expect the Japan solvency margin ratio to be approximately 725% as of March 31, which will be based on statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks.\n Before I wrap up, I would just highlight that we have an updated commercial mortgage loan slide as of March 31 in the appendix. Overall, the CML portfolio continues to perform as expected with attractive loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios as well as the expectation of modest losses.\n Let me conclude by saying that MetLife delivered another solid quarter to begin the new year. The underlying strength of our business fundamentals was evident with strong top line growth, coupled with disciplined underwriting and expense management.\n In addition, our core spreads remain robust and sustainable given the higher yield environment. Also, we saw a nice rebound in our private equity returns. While the current environment remains uncertain, we are excited about the outlook and growth prospects of our businesses over the near term and beyond.\n MetLife continues to move forward from a position of strength with a strong balance sheet and a diversified set of market-leading businesses, which generate solid recurring free cash flow. And we are committed to deploying this free cash flow to achieve responsible growth and build long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders.\n And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Sure, Suneet. Primarily appraisals and valuation. So we actually saw, if you recall, in the fourth quarter, it was fairly flat. Appraisals, they tend to lag a bit in terms of just market declines. And so we saw kind of a catch-up of that in the fourth quarter, which obviously gets reported here in the first quarter.\n Our view is that it will start to moderate. We probably still have some pressure in 2Q, but less so and then moderates through the rest of this year. And then we think you start to see things start to pick up in a positive way towards the latter part of this year into '25. That's kind of the outlook. Yes. Ryan, it's John. I think Suneet's question was focused on real estate. And so I think what we're just trying to -- and regarding outlook in terms of the real estate funds and so we saw a negative return this quarter of 5.8%. I mentioned I thought it would be less negative next quarter, but we still think there'll be a little pressure in just kind of the appraisals coming through and then it will start -- it will kind of moderate from there and start to have an upward trajectory is kind of the way we put it. Jimmy, thanks for the question. Yes, I think it's pretty much in line in terms of the roll off of the -- given the roll-off of the cap. So in terms of XVII, that was generally in line. I think VII came in better than we expected. As you recall, we talked about a 115 to 140 spread range for the segment. So the middle of the range was 127 for the year.\n We still think that's the right answer. And the way we got there was that we have a kind of a quarterly roll off of these interest rate caps. Remember, we bought these back a while ago when there wasn't a risk of rising rates, but is to protect against a short-end rise fairly quickly so that it allows the long end to kind of emerge in over time. It's basically worked as planned. But they all effectively roll off for the most part throughout this year.\n So in terms of expectations, we will see another -- so I think it was 10 bps maybe decline between 4Q and 1Q. I think 8% to 10% next quarter is not a bad estimate. It will depend on what VII does next quarter. We still think VII has kind of a reemergence to occur. So we had a good quarter this quarter, but that can gradually grow throughout the year, probably a bigger growth in the second half and then probably have one more quarter of 8 to 10 bps occurring, and it flattens out between third and fourth quarter. Basically, it's minimal, if not immaterial roll off.\n So that's how to think about the roll off, and that's how we get to the midpoint of that range when we gave the guidance. So we -- obviously, in the past, we've spent quite a bit of time on XVII. We're happy to give that number, but we're really looking at the total spread all in now and as you think about the reemergence of VII. Yes, 8 to 10, you took the top end of that range, but sure, it's close -- 16 to 20. Yes. And Tom, maybe I'll just add a follow-up again on your first question. I mean, I think also just you only focused on XVII. But as I said, I think what's really important is that we think of the all-in spread here, and that's -- all of that is very much in line with what we gave in the outlook for the midpoint of the range."
