At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Live Nation Entertainment's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.  Before we begin, Live Nation has asked me to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements related to the company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters. Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the company's most recent filings on Form 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results. Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with the SEC Regulation G, Live Nation has provided a full reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures in their earnings release. The release, reconciliation and other financial and statistical information to be discussed on this call can be found under the Financial Information section on Live Nation's website at investors.livenationentertainment.com. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference call over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir.\nMichael Rapino: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. As we look back on 2020, it is clearly not the year anyone predicted, but I'm very proud of how Live Nation has dug in and focused on turning this challenge into an opportunity to improve our business. I want to take a moment to thank our employees for their resilience and creativity and acknowledge all of those affected by COVID and the shutdown of live events. Over the last year, leaders across all of our business lines, Concerts, Ticketing and Sponsorship, have been analyzing ways to improve their business. Some of the key initiatives include reorganizing to become more nimble while also reducing our cost structure by $200 million; building concert streaming and direct-to-consumer businesses to expand our revenue streams; advancing our technology initiatives globally while accelerating the shift to digital tickets to meet changing needs of fans, venues and artists; and reinforcing our balance sheet to endure this period while maintaining a strong position to build our business for the future and act on opportunities as we identify them such as our recent acquisition of the streaming platform, Veeps; and continued pipeline bolt-on acquisitions throughout the globe. So, while this past year has been challenging for the company, our employees, fans, artists, and so many others globally impacted by COVID, I've never been more excited about the opportunities in front of us. We continue to have a substantial tailwind in the live event industry as consumers, more than ever, are looking to spend on experiences. The supply-demand fundamentals of the concert business remained strong with artists ready to get back on the road and fans eager to reconnect at events. All our data continues to show that there is substantial pent-up demand for concerts on the consumer demand side. The $2.4 trillion projected surplus in savings in the U.S. alone by June is a key indicator of consumer spending potential. At the same time, surveys demonstrate the high demand for concerts globally with 95% of fans likely to attend a show when restrictions are lifted. This is proving out in fan behavior as well with 83% of fans continuing to hold on to their tickets with rescheduled shows. On the artist side, there's a broad desire to get back on stage to connect with their fans and provide economic support to their bands, crew, and hundreds of others employed each night putting on the show. Given the limited touring activity in 2020 and '21, the pipeline for 2022 is much stronger than usual with almost twice as many major touring artists on cycle in 2022 in a typical year, about 45 artists versus the usual 25, and there remains plenty of scheduling availability at arenas, amphitheaters, and stadiums to accommodate these additional tours with over 2/3 of these venue nights unused by sporting events or major concerts in a typical year. It appears that the timing to release the pent-up supply and demand is now approaching. Vaccine distribution is accelerating and declines in COVID cases throughout most of the world gives us even more confidence that a safe and meaningful return to shows will soon be possible. For both the U.S. and U.K., projections indicate that everyone who wants a vaccine will be able to get one by May or June in Europe and most other markets following a few months later. Given the mass social and economic toll the lockdown has put on the public, we believe there will be strong momentum to reopen society swiftly as soon as vaccines are readily available, and we believe outdoor activity will be the first to happen. So, while the timing of return to live will continue to vary across global markets, every sign points to beginning safely in many countries sometime this summer and scaling further from there. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe for more detail on our financial results. \nJoe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As we did for Q3, we've added some additional tables at the back of our earnings release that reconcile in more detail some of the numbers I will refer to on the call. For the fourth quarter, all the key costs and cash numbers are in line with or better than what we forecasted last quarter. As a result, we are confident that our actions taken to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until the time is right to bring shows back. As part of this, we further reduced discretionary spending by another $50 million and closed 2020 with over $950 million in lower costs. We also reduced our cash usage by $1.65 billion relative to our pre-COVID plans, $150 million more than we were projecting last quarter. Looking at our Q4 AOI results, our AOI loss for the quarter was $244 million, which consisted of $290 million in operational fixed costs and $46 million of contribution margin, which included $96 million contribution from operations along with various one-time items. As we pointed out last quarter, this contribution margin from operations includes our sponsorship business where we've been able to maintain close to 90% of the commitments that were in place at the end of February last year. Half of this sponsorship moved into 2021 while the portion we retained in 2020 was repurposed into other assets, including streaming concerts. Our artist management and merchandise businesses also generated positive contribution margin in the quarter. Looking at free cash and liquidity, we ended the fourth quarter with $643 million in free cash, which increased to $1.1 billion in early January with our debt raise. This, along with over $950 million of available debt capacity gives us $2 billion in readily available liquidity. Our total free cash usage in the quarter was $308 million or $103 million per month. We had $97 million per month average in operational burn plus another $44 million per month of nonoperational cash costs to get us to $142 million average per month in gross burn. And then we had $39 million per month in cash contribution margin and ended up with a total effective cash burn of $103 million per month. Now ticket refunds. The global refund rate for Live Nation concerts that are rescheduled and are in or have gone through a refund window or windows was unchanged from the prior quarter at 17% through the end of Q4. For the tours that have gone through a second refund window, the refund levels were generally much lower for the second window as the casual fans requested their refunds during the first window. Festivals  generally canceled their 2020 events. But for festivals where fans could retain their tickets for next year's show, 63% of fans are doing so. On deferred revenue, at the end of the fourth quarter, deferred revenue for events in the next 12 months was $1.5 billion versus the $1.4 billion we projected at the end of Q3, higher due to $100 million in ticket sales during the quarter. Finally, our 2021 outlook. We won't be giving a multi-quarter outlook given the uncertainty on specific timing and likely varied timing for different markets around the world. For Q1, we will remain focused on our cash burn rate and particularly managing our total effective burn rate to ensure cash contribution margin growth outstrips any increases in our cost structure as we start to ramp back up. With that, let's open up the call for any questions for Michael, Kathy or me. Operator?\nOperator:  Your first question is from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan.\nDavid Karnovsky: Michael, for the U.S. and U.K. markets, can you expand a bit on what you think we'll see this summer in terms of concerts? Can you get back the whole tours and some major festivals or do you sort of envision operating in a more kind of smaller regional basis? And then as a follow-up, I'd be interested to understand how artists are approaching the decision on when the right time to get back on the road is.\nMichael Rapino: Yes. I think this summer, we're going to see a bit of a regional model -- a module model. Every day, we seem to have a new state or country talking about when they'll open up. So we're feeling more optimistic than we were a month ago. Lots of artists are calling and looking at how we start up in July, August, September, maybe move things a month. So for right now, we still believe that we'll have enough open throughout the U.K., Australia, Canada, U.S., to keep what we have on the books and the amphitheater booked for now. We might have some certain states that might not be ready, but we have enough states, we think, and enough artists willing to play the open slots if we get to that level in the right markets. So right now, we think we have enough artists. And as long as these states open up to the right capacities, we can start mid-summer into Southern U.S. We could go all the way to November.\nJoe Berchtold: And then -- this is Joe. The only thing I would add is, if you look at the U.K. as a model, I think what they've laid out is a series of thresholds and timelines to reopen and really get almost fully  June has been very helpful and has really created a big burst of consumer demand over this week. And as a result, if you look at our U.K. festivals in August, Creamfields has already sold out. Reading & Leeds saw a huge jump in consumer demand, and those are both likely to be sold out this weekend. So, we do see that in the U.K. with the help of  we're going to be able to get those festivals to happen certainly in August.\nDavid Karnovsky: Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up on that point, assuming kind of conditions start to normalize faster than expected. Can you maybe just say how much lead time you need to ramp-up activities at your various venue types? And are there kind of acts that you can lean on to fill supply in short notice? \nMichael Rapino: Yes. We're running about a 3-month lead time. So, we've been talking to our global employees about that kind of timeline, when we kind of have the first show at scale that we think is going to happen beyond 50%. three months back from that is when we can start bringing back marketing production, all of the key venue functions. So, everyone is eager, employees to get back out, and we can wrap up in between the on sale or the announcement and the actual show with no challenges.\nOperator: Our next question is from Stephen Glagola with Cowen.\nStephen Glagola: Earlier this month, Ticketmaster rolled out its new live stream product and you purchased the Veeps platform as well a month ago. The online live market appears to be a more nascent market. Could you discuss how you expect this business to impact the P&L in '21? Maybe high level, just the economics of ticketing virtual events, how that compares to sort of ticketing a regular live show? And how Ticketmaster is positioned in this market relative to the competition?\nMichael Rapino: Right. We look at it -- obviously, we have to solve two different problems. Live Nation looks to be in this space because we think, as I've said before, it's a great complement to our core physical product. We're still not sure if this is a business or a feature, but we think we've been streaming our live shows from Yahoo! Live to Twitter. We stream most of our festivals for many years on YouTube and other platforms. So, streaming a festival or streaming a live show for a sponsor or for other platforms, we've been doing that a long time. This is just now an opportunity with Veeps to do some of that direct-to-consumer on the club shows, amphitheater, festival shows that we think will have that added capacity and demand that will help increase some of the revenue for the artist. So, we think it's kind of like a T-shirt and merchandise in a VIP platform. It's another incremental revenue stream to the current physical show. We think we have a unique advantage because we have the sort of 30,000 physical shows. So, when we're putting those on sale, just like today, we try to sell you an upgrade, VIP package or a T-shirt, for those that can't come to the show -- but possibly even if you come to the show and you want some -- to look at some other camera angles on your phone, we think it's a good complement or an add-on to our physical show. Ticketmaster just wanted to make sure this is a new product. Whether it's like festivals or clubs, we wanted to make sure that they had the capability to service events and clients coming to them saying, \"Hey, I have a virtual show going on sale. Can you ticket it for me since you have such a large database and the -- then the scale and competency?\" So we're proud that, that team in COVID was able to take some existing software and quickly ramp up and has been able to service many shows around the globe because that's kind of instantly a global product when you're putting a virtual show on sale. So, we think Ticketmaster will probably be one of the leaders in that space. Most of the platforms or most of the live shows you've seen have come to Ticketmaster and said, \"We'd love you to ticket it. You have the capability, and you have the marketing reach that we don't.\" So that's been successful to date. Same business model, it's a service fee model. Most of the platforms you see out there are charging a service fee on the ticket, and that's what Ticketmaster is also doing, and that seems to be the accepted model to date. So, we think it's another product in the channel or their portfolio that Ticketmaster can effectively deliver for the customer. How big of this segment, this ultimately is in the end. I think it continues or will be -- -- once like it's been on YouTube, it's always been an interesting way for a customer to see some of the live show. History says that live show though, thanks to Tiktok and Instagram, is not consumed in mass. Most people don't want to watch two hours of their favorite band. They want to find that one great shot on Tiktok. So, we're still not sure how big of a business a live show is, but it's something that is incremental to our course. So, we'll be on it, same with Ticketmaster.\nStephen Glagola: Michael, that was really helpful. And maybe one more for just Joe and Kathy. On your -- you guided total CapEx to $150 million in '21. It's down 30% or so from '20 levels. Down, I think, over 40% from 2017 to '19 levels. The '17 and '19 was a really significant CapEx ramp period for the business. Is the '21 CapEx moderation or deceleration is something we should expect going forward as we look out to some of the outer years, '22 and beyond?\nJoe Berchtold: This is Joe. I'll start. I think 2021 CapEx is more a reflection of the fact that we're continuing to be prudent in our cash management this year. I think as we get back to '22, we spend CapEx based on the opportunities we see. We continue to see great opportunities on the concert side in terms of going into new markets, adding new venues, continuing to build out that business. So you'll see that accelerate, ramp back up in '22 along with continuing to find ways to invest in the venues that we have to get a fan throughout that portfolio.\nOperator:  Your next question is from Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners.\nBrandon Ross: A couple of questions. First, I wanted to ask a follow-up on David's question, leading off about reopening. And Michael, you tweeted out earlier an article about the Reading & Leeds Festivals being set to take place this summer. They're large-scale events. Can you describe some of the safety plans that are being contemplated for those? And whether they're meaningful in terms of cost? And kind of how you see the fan experience looking when we open festivals like that?\nMichael Rapino: I'm going to let Joe handle the safety part. I'm going to come back to the sales on that one, though.\nJoe Berchtold: Just in terms of the -- in terms of the protocols, number one, obviously, we have some additional cleaning protocols that are in place. Those are not a -- those are not a huge cost. And then one of the big changes is the shift to much more contactless. So as we get the digital ticket really fully implemented and out there, the ability to have contactless interest -- entry, contactless purchase of food and beverage, contactless purchase of merch, all of that is going to improve the fan experience, provide some safety and comfort to the fans, and I think only be a better overall experience.\nMichael Rapino: And Brandon, just because you brought it up, just to show you when we keep talking about pent-up demand. Reading & Leeds went on sale, thanks to the government-outlined new plan for the summer, and sold 100,000 tickets in 72 hours. Creamfields went on sale and sold out in 48 hours, over 70,000. So we are seeing the fan and what we've been talking about, they are excited to get back to the show as soon as we get the green lights in these markets to open up.\nBrandon Ross: Great. And you gave some details around the Ticketmaster globalization initiative a few months back at the Liberty Day. I wanted to unpack that a little further. Can you maybe describe the overall margin opportunity for ticketing? Is it a business that as this globalization effort is implemented, can make Ticketmaster have a more typical marketplace margin structure? And then maybe describe how long the process will take and whether we're going to see continuous benefits as it plays out.\nJoe Berchtold: This is Joe, Brandon. I'll start that by getting into some of the numbers. I think part of this is in that -- the $200 million cost reduction that we told you was going to take place. Ticketmaster is a large portion of that. Ticketmaster's cost or, I guess, their revenue was about $1.5 billion in 2019. So if you apply a good chunk of the cost savings to that, you get mid-single-digit margin expansion from that cost savings off the bat. We expect that, over time, as we get even more efficient, more globalized than the Ticketmaster platform, there will be some additional savings. But as importantly, it will let us go into new markets faster. And also, when we add new capabilities in the U.S., those can be instantly rolled out worldwide. So we'll be able to drive revenue along with the reduced cost.\nBrandon Ross: Cool. And then just finally, as things reopen and you come out of the pandemic fairly levered, I wanted to ask your early thinking on capital allocation. If there are international assets at attractive prices out there, would that take precedent over delevering? And how do you balance the opportunities that may present themselves abroad as you continue that international roll-up versus sort of a leverage target?\nJoe Berchtold: This is Joe. I'll start. I think that we're very comfortable with the leverage that we're at now. We are not in a rush to delever. We think it will naturally happen over time given the performance levels that we think are going to be happening starting in 2022. So we remain, as we said, in a very liquid state, around $2 billion of total liquidity, including untapped debt right now. We don't think the vast majority of that will be necessary this year. So it gives us a lot of dry powder as we look at our global set of opportunities and bolt-on acquisitions.\nMichael Rapino: And Brandon, to pick up on that. As you've seen us over the last 10 years, this space, on a global basis, tends to be a lot of small bolt-ons. So we've been ramping up our 100-plus million customers, doubled it over the last few years, and we'll continue to grow those numbers. But we don't have to make $1 billion acquisitions to make any of that come to life. We were talking the $20 million range is a lot of where we pick up a festival, a venue, a promoter that's accretive and in a key market for us. So we'll continue to be acquisitive on our theater, club, global business, any markets we think there's opportunities that arise given where the world sits today. So we will be aggressive on a bolt-on, continued consolidation path while we are able to. We think '22 is a peak year, which lets us start taking a lot of free cash flow and start working towards delevering also. So we think we can accomplish both as we have over the years.\nOperator:  We do have a question from Paul Golding with Macquarie Capital.\nPaul Golding: So Michael, you talked about the 3-month lead time on possibly a 50% capacity show. I guess when we think about the recent news in New York around the 10% arena capacity limit now being allowed, how should we think about how artists are sort of phasing back in? You've had peers say that, that just isn't enough for financial reasons to justify an event. How should we think about sort of that breakeven where artists may decide to get out there early if states start opening up even earlier?\nMichael Rapino: Well, I think you look at the U.K. and Australia as kind of the key markets, right, where they went from -- once COVID and they had the right game plan. They have now set a clear date when 100% capacity can happen outdoor, then it's kind of business as usual. So we have not, as to date, done a lot of work in the 0 to 50% capacity business. We don't see that as a viable model to ramp back up fixed cost. So we think we're close enough though where we are with COVID and with all the governors in the states we're talking to, that there will be a clear outline to a 75% to 100% outdoor green light in '21. So we think we're better off waiting for a high bar capacity moment in most of the states to ramp up and talk to the artists about getting paid properly. So we think that's within sight and is better -- is closer than having to dabble in the 10% and 20s, but those are great steps forward.\nPaul Golding: Great. And then with the downtime, have you seen maybe a broader set of venues more aggressively roll out components of the SafeTix or Presence platform in venue?\nJoe Berchtold: This is Joe. Obviously, during the shutdown, most of the venues have been shut down as well. So there hasn't been a lot of specific rollout during the time as much as there is a massive sign-up of venues that are looking to shift to a paperless digital ticketing going forward. And for those that have already adopted digital ticketing to some extent, looking to expand it and really having it be the way that entry takes place.\nPaul Golding: So maybe some pent-up rollout demand when things reopen so that you can roll out quickly?\nJoe Berchtold: Yes. Yes.\nOperator: And there are no further questions in queue at this time. Management, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing or additional remarks.\nMichael Rapino: All right. Thank you, everyone. Stay safe, and we'll talk to you on our next earnings call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

For the fourth quarter, all the key costs and cash numbers are in line with or better than what we forecasted last quarter. As a result, we are confident that our actions taken to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until the time is right to bring shows back.

And then we had $39 million per month in cash contribution margin and ended up with a total effective cash burn of $103 million per month. Now ticket refunds. The global refund rate for Live Nation concerts that are rescheduled and are in or have gone through a refund window or windows was unchanged from the prior quarter at 17% through the end of Q4. For the tours that have gone through a second refund window, the refund levels were generally much lower for the second window as the casual fans requested their refunds during the first window. Festivals  generally canceled their 2020 events. But for festivals where fans could retain their tickets for next year's show, 63% of fans are doing so. On deferred revenue, at the end of the fourth quarter, deferred revenue for events in the next 12 months was $1.5 billion versus the $1.4 billion we projected at the end of Q3, higher due to $100 million in ticket sales during the quarter. Finally, our 2021 outlook. We won't be giving a multi-quarter outlook given the uncertainty on specific timing and likely varied timing for different markets around the world. For Q1, we will remain focused on our cash burn rate and particularly managing our total effective burn rate to ensure cash contribution margin growth outstrips any increases in our cost structure as we start to ramp back up.

            "content": "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. As we look back on 2020, it is clearly not the year anyone predicted, but I'm very proud of how Live Nation has dug in and focused on turning this challenge into an opportunity to improve our business. I want to take a moment to thank our employees for their resilience and creativity and acknowledge all of those affected by COVID and the shutdown of live events. Over the last year, leaders across all of our business lines, Concerts, Ticketing and Sponsorship, have been analyzing ways to improve their business. Some of the key initiatives include reorganizing to become more nimble while also reducing our cost structure by $200 million; building concert streaming and direct-to-consumer businesses to expand our revenue streams; advancing our technology initiatives globally while accelerating the shift to digital tickets to meet changing needs of fans, venues and artists; and reinforcing our balance sheet to endure this period while maintaining a strong position to build our business for the future and act on opportunities as we identify them such as our recent acquisition of the streaming platform, Veeps; and continued pipeline bolt-on acquisitions throughout the globe. So, while this past year has been challenging for the company, our employees, fans, artists, and so many others globally impacted by COVID, I've never been more excited about the opportunities in front of us. We continue to have a substantial tailwind in the live event industry as consumers, more than ever, are looking to spend on experiences. The supply-demand fundamentals of the concert business remained strong with artists ready to get back on the road and fans eager to reconnect at events. All our data continues to show that there is substantial pent-up demand for concerts on the consumer demand side. The $2.4 trillion projected surplus in savings in the U.S. alone by June is a key indicator of consumer spending potential. At the same time, surveys demonstrate the high demand for concerts globally with 95% of fans likely to attend a show when restrictions are lifted. This is proving out in fan behavior as well with 83% of fans continuing to hold on to their tickets with rescheduled shows. On the artist side, there's a broad desire to get back on stage to connect with their fans and provide economic support to their bands, crew, and hundreds of others employed each night putting on the show. Given the limited touring activity in 2020 and '21, the pipeline for 2022 is much stronger than usual with almost twice as many major touring artists on cycle in 2022 in a typical year, about 45 artists versus the usual 25, and there remains plenty of scheduling availability at arenas, amphitheaters, and stadiums to accommodate these additional tours with over 2/3 of these venue nights unused by sporting events or major concerts in a typical year. It appears that the timing to release the pent-up supply and demand is now approaching. Vaccine distribution is accelerating and declines in COVID cases throughout most of the world gives us even more confidence that a safe and meaningful return to shows will soon be possible. For both the U.S. and U.K., projections indicate that everyone who wants a vaccine will be able to get one by May or June in Europe and most other markets following a few months later. Given the mass social and economic toll the lockdown has put on the public, we believe there will be strong momentum to reopen society swiftly as soon as vaccines are readily available, and we believe outdoor activity will be the first to happen. So, while the timing of return to live will continue to vary across global markets, every sign points to beginning safely in many countries sometime this summer and scaling further from there. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe for more detail on our financial results. Yes. I think this summer, we're going to see a bit of a regional model -- a module model. Every day, we seem to have a new state or country talking about when they'll open up. So we're feeling more optimistic than we were a month ago. Lots of artists are calling and looking at how we start up in July, August, September, maybe move things a month. So for right now, we still believe that we'll have enough open throughout the U.K., Australia, Canada, U.S., to keep what we have on the books and the amphitheater booked for now. We might have some certain states that might not be ready, but we have enough states, we think, and enough artists willing to play the open slots if we get to that level in the right markets. So right now, we think we have enough artists. And as long as these states open up to the right capacities, we can start mid-summer into Southern U.S. We could go all the way to November. Yes. We're running about a 3-month lead time. So, we've been talking to our global employees about that kind of timeline, when we kind of have the first show at scale that we think is going to happen beyond 50%. three months back from that is when we can start bringing back marketing production, all of the key venue functions. So, everyone is eager, employees to get back out, and we can wrap up in between the on sale or the announcement and the actual show with no challenges. Right. We look at it -- obviously, we have to solve two different problems. Live Nation looks to be in this space because we think, as I've said before, it's a great complement to our core physical product. We're still not sure if this is a business or a feature, but we think we've been streaming our live shows from Yahoo! Live to Twitter. We stream most of our festivals for many years on YouTube and other platforms. So, streaming a festival or streaming a live show for a sponsor or for other platforms, we've been doing that a long time. This is just now an opportunity with Veeps to do some of that direct-to-consumer on the club shows, amphitheater, festival shows that we think will have that added capacity and demand that will help increase some of the revenue for the artist. So, we think it's kind of like a T-shirt and merchandise in a VIP platform. It's another incremental revenue stream to the current physical show. We think we have a unique advantage because we have the sort of 30,000 physical shows. So, when we're putting those on sale, just like today, we try to sell you an upgrade, VIP package or a T-shirt, for those that can't come to the show -- but possibly even if you come to the show and you want some -- to look at some other camera angles on your phone, we think it's a good complement or an add-on to our physical show. Ticketmaster just wanted to make sure this is a new product. Whether it's like festivals or clubs, we wanted to make sure that they had the capability to service events and clients coming to them saying, \"Hey, I have a virtual show going on sale. Can you ticket it for me since you have such a large database and the -- then the scale and competency?\" So we're proud that, that team in COVID was able to take some existing software and quickly ramp up and has been able to service many shows around the globe because that's kind of instantly a global product when you're putting a virtual show on sale. So, we think Ticketmaster will probably be one of the leaders in that space. Most of the platforms or most of the live shows you've seen have come to Ticketmaster and said, \"We'd love you to ticket it. You have the capability, and you have the marketing reach that we don't.\" So that's been successful to date. Same business model, it's a service fee model. Most of the platforms you see out there are charging a service fee on the ticket, and that's what Ticketmaster is also doing, and that seems to be the accepted model to date. So, we think it's another product in the channel or their portfolio that Ticketmaster can effectively deliver for the customer. How big of this segment, this ultimately is in the end. I think it continues or will be -- -- once like it's been on YouTube, it's always been an interesting way for a customer to see some of the live show. History says that live show though, thanks to Tiktok and Instagram, is not consumed in mass. Most people don't want to watch two hours of their favorite band. They want to find that one great shot on Tiktok. So, we're still not sure how big of a business a live show is, but it's something that is incremental to our course. So, we'll be on it, same with Ticketmaster. I'm going to let Joe handle the safety part. I'm going to come back to the sales on that one, though. And Brandon, just because you brought it up, just to show you when we keep talking about pent-up demand. Reading & Leeds went on sale, thanks to the government-outlined new plan for the summer, and sold 100,000 tickets in 72 hours. Creamfields went on sale and sold out in 48 hours, over 70,000. So we are seeing the fan and what we've been talking about, they are excited to get back to the show as soon as we get the green lights in these markets to open up. And Brandon, to pick up on that. As you've seen us over the last 10 years, this space, on a global basis, tends to be a lot of small bolt-ons. So we've been ramping up our 100-plus million customers, doubled it over the last few years, and we'll continue to grow those numbers. But we don't have to make $1 billion acquisitions to make any of that come to life. We were talking the $20 million range is a lot of where we pick up a festival, a venue, a promoter that's accretive and in a key market for us. So we'll continue to be acquisitive on our theater, club, global business, any markets we think there's opportunities that arise given where the world sits today. So we will be aggressive on a bolt-on, continued consolidation path while we are able to. We think '22 is a peak year, which lets us start taking a lot of free cash flow and start working towards delevering also. So we think we can accomplish both as we have over the years. Well, I think you look at the U.K. and Australia as kind of the key markets, right, where they went from -- once COVID and they had the right game plan. They have now set a clear date when 100% capacity can happen outdoor, then it's kind of business as usual. So we have not, as to date, done a lot of work in the 0 to 50% capacity business. We don't see that as a viable model to ramp back up fixed cost. So we think we're close enough though where we are with COVID and with all the governors in the states we're talking to, that there will be a clear outline to a 75% to 100% outdoor green light in '21. So we think we're better off waiting for a high bar capacity moment in most of the states to ramp up and talk to the artists about getting paid properly. So we think that's within sight and is better -- is closer than having to dabble in the 10% and 20s, but those are great steps forward. All right. Thank you, everyone. Stay safe, and we'll talk to you on our next earnings call."

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to Live Nation Entertainment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conference is being recorded. Following management\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A. Instructions will be given at that time. Before we begin, Live Nation has asked me to remind you that this afternoon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ including statements related to the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters.

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir.\nMichael Rapino: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. There're been no major changes in our business conditions or outlook since the last time we spoke. And while we see signs of promise around the world with some live events return. Most regions we operate in continue to have various restrictions unlike this. For now we continue to maintain a strong cash management discipline while planning for the ramp up to resume live shows as soon as possible. Joe will have a further update on costs and cash management efforts later in the call. We also continue to see strong fan demand across the board. Our sales and survey data tell us fan demand will be there when the time is right. Our refund rate on reschedule shows remain consistently low with 83% of fans globally keeping their tickets. A recent global survey indicates that 95% of fans are planning to return to live events when restrictions are lifted, the highest point of confidence since the start of the pandemic. Festival on sales for next year have been strong with EDC Las Vegas 2021 selling out in 24 hours with a higher capacity than last year. And ticket sales for Red and Greenfields and other White festivals pacing ahead of last year. And we encouraged by the enthusiasm for recent events and gatherings that have started to take place including our first sold out tour with 20,000 fans in New Zealand where business is headed back to normal. Meanwhile, we are working on a roadmap to get back to live safely. We are encouraged by progress on testing technology treatments and vaccines which will help us build our plans. We still expect shows at scale next summer but recognize that some exact timeline of this return will vary by region and so we continue to focus on remaining flexible. In preparation there are two areas we are focusing on. On the technology front, Ticketmaster is creating the tools we need to make sure live events can deliver a variety of safe precautions when returning. New products such as our social distancing seat mapping tool and time entry technology have been created to give venues the flexibility to plan how to manage everything from venue access to box office interactions. Existing products including our safe text digital ticket technology can fulfill new needs including being a key facilitator for contact tracing. And the ability to integrate third party applications with our digital ticketing platform enable the range of customizable features from contact list with concessions to testing and health questionnaire tracking. On the content front, Live Nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s developing a set of standards for executing shows that our vendors. We are collaborating with health experts to develop show guidelines to put in place procedures, which can adapt to various situations across all regions. From venue sanitation procedures to fan friendly policies and on ticket purchases and the latest testing options, we are setting standards that will give the fans, crews and artists peace of mind before, during and after the show. If we look ahead it is through the past to Live will not be a straight one. With as such, we will maintain flexibility and focus on innovating during these times. On November 19th at our Investor event, we will outline more detail the opportunities we see emerging for our business. With that, I'll turn over to Joe.\nJoe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael. Good afternoon, everyone. We've added some additional tables to the back of our earnings release, so this quarter I will hit the key numbers as opposed to reconciling in every number as I did last quarter. As Michael noted, we've continued to strengthen our financial position during the third quarter and all the key numbers are in line with or better than what we forecast last quarter. As a result, we are confident that our actions taken to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until the time is right to bring shows back. As part of this, we have further reduced all discretionary spending by another approximately $100 million and have now lowered to us for this year by over $900 million and reduce our cash usage by $1.5 billion relative to our pre-COVID plants. With these reductions, we have lowered the estimate on our operational cash burn rate to $110 million per month and our gross burn rate to $175 million per month on average for the last nine months of the year and prior to the benefit of contribution margin generated by the business. Included in our gross burn estimate is approximately $40 million in severance expense estimated through year-end which we expect to generate over $200 million in annual run rate savings. Our free cash at the end of the third quarter is $951 million and along with over $950 million of available debt capacity, we have $1.9 billion in readily available liquidity. At the same time refund rates for Q3 remain low at 17% globally. As a result deferred revenue is at $1.4 billion as of the end of Q3. And we have increased our forecast than what we expect at the end of the year now $1.4 billion. Turning to our Q3 results starting with AOI, our AOI loss for the quarter was $319 million which consisted of $337 million in operational cash burn, $50 million in other non-cash fixed costs and $68 million of contribution margin, which included $73 million from operations along with other one-time items. One point to note here is that this same from operations includes our sponsorship business where we've been able to maintain 90% of the commitments that were in place at the end of February. The bulk of this sponsorship moved into 2021, but some of it was repurposed into other assets including streaming concerts. Looking at free cash we ended the third quarter with $951 million in free cash compared to $1.8 billion at the end of Q2 in line with what we expected and consistent with what we told you last quarter. This translates to an $821 million reduction in our free cash metric for the quarter. Part of this, we had a reduction in free cash of $333 million due to working capital timing, which is part of the $415 million flip we told you last quarter would be happening in Q3 and Q4. We expect the remaining $80 million of this timing impact will affect free cash in Q4. The majority of this timing shift resulted from show scheduled for Q3 of 2021 shifting from long-term deferred revenue to current deferred revenue. So it is an accounting shift as opposed to actually use of cash. As a result, our total effective cash burn was $488 million for the quarter or approximately $160 million per month, which aligns with our gross cash burn net of contribution margin generated in the quarter. Now ticket refunds, as I indicated, the global refund rate for Live Nation Concerts that are rescheduled and are in or have gone through a refund window is 17% through the end of Q3. Festivals have generally canceled this year's event. But for festivals where fans can retain their tickets for next year's show 63% of fans are doing so and keeping their tickets. A bit more detail on deferred revenue, which is tracking ahead of where we told you last quarter we were going to be. At the end of the third quarter, deferred revenue for events in the next 12 months was $1.4 billion. Of the $421 million increase, $383 million was due to a shift from long-term deferred revenue to current deferred revenue for concerts rescheduled Q3 of 2021. At the end of the third quarter, we still had $103 million of long-term deferred revenue most of which equipped to short term deferred revenue by the end of the year. Given this, along with the projected Q4 outflow of $74 million from additional ticket refunds, we now forecast deferred revenue of $1.4 billion at the end of the year prior to any additional ticket sales. Given the uncertainty in the market on timing of shows returning, we cannot give any more guidance beyond the burn rates and refund levels we just gave you. With that, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s open the call for any questions for Michael, Kathy, or me.\nOperator:  Thank you. And your first question is from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan.\nDavid Karnovsky: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just recognizing that 2021 may be a fairly unique year in terms of how concerts and festivals are structured. But when you look at 2022 which is the long term general, are you confident that the general economics that drove the concerts industry will return or should investors expect some sort of change as it pertains to relationships with artists, the venues or really on any front?\nJoe Berchtold: I think the baseline economics the promoter the artist the venue those economics will not materially change structurally going forward. I think what you'll see and we've hit a few points is as we've spent this time continuing to think about our business, we've looked at how it is. We can take some costs out. And I give you some numbers on over $200 million in reduced run rate. And we've also spent our time thinking about just how does each piece of the flywheel operate a bit better going forward. And how do we keep thinking about new ways to drive the overall economics of the business. But I don't see any change in the core historical dynamics on the key players.\nDavid Karnovsky: Okay. And then just to follow-up on the $200 million should we think of that as permanent cost savings or some of that comes back when the industry begins to scale up again?\nJoe Berchtold: I think as we look at 2021 we expect to see those savings to be largely in place and then 2022 is we've got to wait and see exactly what the scale is. The 2022 is as big as we think it could -- then we'll see what costs are needed. But we think that the bulk of this flows through the business and there is a structural savings.\nDavid Karnovsky: And then maybe just to ask one a little bit long-term in nature. You know an area that's got a little bit more attention lately is virtual concerts. I just wondering if you could update your views on the opportunities to the Live Nation either as it pertains to selling incremental virtual access to your shows or just continuing to stage your own productions like you've done recently with Live From Home? Thanks.\nMichael Rapino: Thank you. It's Michael. We believe that virtual is a great complement to the car business. You know there's going to be always beyond says in BTS and Billie Eilish of the world can probably do like the old school pay per view if you think of it that way. There's always a few global superstars that probably can go direct and drive some significant dollars. But generally this business we think is a complement to and a promotion to their core concert. So we think it's a great opportunity. Listen we've been dabbling in virtual for years whether it was streaming through Twitter and Yahoo and stream and ourselves for sponsors. We've been streaming our festivals on YouTube for years. We now look at that as a continuation of that and we think going into 2021 and 2022 will be streaming a lot more of our concerts to fans that maybe either can't show up at the event or some that may want to still stream on our app when they're at the event because there's some added value of digital backrooms or camera angles et cetera. So we think it's a great compliment helps us probably drive a few incremental dollars per show and also as always been a great tool for sponsorship fulfillment.\nOperator: Your next question is from Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners.\nBrandon Ross: Hey guys. What I really want to know is who won Georgia. But short of that wanted to take a step back on Ticketmaster with Jerd's departure you promoted your head of international who's that actually based abroad. Is there anything to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 hello? Is there anything to read into that? Is international a bigger focus and more broadly maybe if you could discuss the strategic priorities that Ticketmaster under the new leadership.\nMichael Rapino: Thanks Brandon. You know there's nothing to read. This is like everyone is probably saying COVID excelled any strategy you had in our case while we've been sitting tight, we've been able to do a bunch of restructuring and really thinking of the business. But we had planned over the next three years that we were able to do in the last three months. So going global on Ticketmaster was always the number one priority. We always knew that our greatest opportunity for you know kind of the TAM on Ticketmaster is going to be outside of the US. It's an incredible powerful brand. We've expanded into markets where Live Nation has content. It's an allocation market. So as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re concerts grow, you can feed your ticketing business. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a huge opportunity. We haven't been successful at getting the global technology architecture excelled as fast as we wanted. The US is always such a big kind of drag on resources when we're running at full steam that we always get that projects get slightly pushed back to solve the latest US technology need. This is one let us excel the strategy that says we're going to now have one global technology stack a much better efficient architecture around it, common global products that we can roll out at once and help excel our international expansion. So I myself am the product when I moved from Toronto to London and lived there for five years. I think it was the single reason Live Nation is what it is today. And Place Global is when you see from the outside in all the opportunity it gets you \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it gets you thinking differently. So I believe that the fastest way we would grow Ticketmaster to a global brand was let someone from the global side who's working that what business every day take the reins and drive that product. So we're even working with Mark for years and they've been having a product strategy to get there. We just excelled the leadership team to do it now. Sorry go ahead.\nBrandon Ross: Go ahead. No, you go ahead.\nMichael Rapino: Yeah. I think the priorities haven't changed when we get back to business they're going to continually be about, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got an incredible two businesses that Ticketmaster were at the core were enterprise platform, white labeling teams and venues all around the world. So whether it's the NFL or the Phoenix Suns or ultimately artists were great software platform to power your ticket needs. And we're going to get better at better at that in terms of our do it yourself and white label in and empowering artists and venues and teams to deliver their ticketing needs. It's been a great kind of test platform is the virtual business. We've overnight had to become a virtual ticketing company at scale across the globe and we've been able to do that. We are powering through our portfolio all of these virtual shows and selling tickets to them. So that's been what we do at our core. And then two we've always talked about being a better marketplace making sure that the marketplace the approximately, making sure that we have full inventory on the shelves, adding more inventory to the shelves. Whether it's Ticketmaster clients or not being a true marketplace where consumers can find tickets buy them stock the shelves through secondary third-party partners adding more content to the shelves, that is the strategy. So this does take that global and those two core strategies continue. We've got lots of clients to service on a global basis. We're underserviced \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in under markets shared in many markets where our concepts are strong. And we're rolling out our global marketplace best-in-class practices across our global marketplaces that are sitting on old platforms.\nBrandon Ross: Great. And then a few weeks ago Marc Geiger had announced his Save Life Club roll-off wondering what impact if any. You think he can have on the industry with that?\nMichael Rapino: The same one he had at William Morris. But I think that there's a lot of talk on the independent venues save our stages et cetera. And there's no doubt everyone in live service providers and companies are having a rough year. We've been being very focused on making sure that the 12 million employees in Live from the hairdresser to the lighting crew to the security guards are get some stimulus and help. We think those people are in the most need. So, we've been very vocal about that. When it gets to the venues in general the thesis out there with Mark Geiger and some others is that these independent venues are so distressed that they're going to throw someone the keys at a very cheap price and you can maybe roll up some of these cheaply and have some scale. Well, the thesis is basically broken at the first point is any great Live club is not throwing anybody in the keys cheaply. There's a lot of capital out there. So if you on the Troubadour in Los Angeles, it's a legendary business and you're having a tough year. You're not selling to Mark Geiger or anyone else, if one or two time multiple your access to capital PPE loans lots of ways you can keep your business afloat, while you get through the storm. So we don't think that there's a huge opportunity that that there's a fire sale happening at that level. Now number two as you know we -- we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the -- we have a consolidation of clubs in our business. Clubs on their own are a tough business, if you scale them up on their own. They're not -- they're not a really, really fruitful business on their own. So, we like them as part of our -- our overall ecosystem. But we're -- we don't believe that clubs whether you own 10, or whether you own 20 of them on their own provides you much global synergy or US synergy to leverage off of. So we hope all of these clubs find their way through this pandemic like we -- we hope all Live service providers find their way through this and that the government and stimulus programs and can help them survive it. But we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably many that are going to fire to anybody, because there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too many great options for them.\nOperator: Your next question in queue is from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks. Good afternoon. First Michael just what are you hearing from artists and artist managements on getting back out. And I'm specifically wondering, what's your best guess in terms of timing when we start to see major tours announced that eventually and tickets put on sale at \u00e2\u0080\u009cat scale\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was wondering what your latest crystal ball tells you.\nMichael Rapino: Well, the important part is the demand there and the supplies there as we know, right. So that's obviously what we're playing for. So we know that the fans still are going to get to the show and we know the artists want to get back on the road when it's safe. And depending whether you're \u00e2\u0080\u0093 what age you are as an artist you may have a different timeline and risk factor. But many artists that we're talking to are just waiting. As we all are looking on a week by week basis to figure out when is there a plan in place when they can start looking to get on the road. So we've been always talking to artists about if you have a 2022 or moved into 2021 for the summer into the fall. Let's hold on to that. Let's see how the next few months go through testing and vaccines and in a proper national plan et cetera. And we're telling any artist that has a new tour that's thinking of going on the road. Let's look at the fall, but we don't need to make those decisions until January, February. So if you have a new if you have a new tour well let's think about the fall into 2022 but let's sit tight until January before you start moving any costs in place to get ready. So that's kind of a -- that the general sense is let's -- let's reset, let's get through 2021 summer with whatever we reschedules from 2020, add new stuff into the fall to 2022 as we get a better visibility into January.\nBen Swinburne: That makes sense. Are there any insurance-related issues that you guys are having to work through, you know beside the festivals or any large events or do you think that's pretty well baked at this point?\nMichael Rapino: You're talking about insurance on the historical what's happened to us this year?\nBen Swinburne: No, I mean more is you know we obviously see like in film production, the studios have to do are dealing with more and more \u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nMichael Rapino: Yeah.\nBen Swinburne: Health-related protection and insurance frankly from having to shut down. Just wondering, if that's impacting your business at all?\nMichael Rapino: Well, because we're just talking about as Michael just said really summer of getting back to scale. I think first of all we remain optimistic that the government here in the US like many of them internationally if sorted out and made sure that there's not spurious liability from everybody doing the appropriate actions. And then that's why we've got the programs in place and what we're doing is we're working with the public health officials in every market to figure out what is it that there needs to be done for those markets to bring fans back safely as we get to next summer. And I think it's our expectation that as long as we're doing that that we're going to be in a fine position.\nBen Swinburne: Got it. And Joe if I could just ask you one to try to help us think through the fourth quarter use of cash and I know your looking forward to that question. Is there any way to think about the contribution margin that we might see in Q4 versus what you saw in Q3? If that seems to go in one area that might help you know benefit the cash burn number?\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah, really I can say is that I don't think Q2 and Q3 were that different from each other. Obviously some different pieces moving around, but they weren't wildly different. And I've given you the cash burn numbers operational and growth for nine months. So you can pretty easily do the calc on what that leaves over for Q4.\nBen Swinburne: Okay, thanks a lot. And Joe you mentioned the sponsorship already.\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah, 90% of our sponsorship commitments that we had as of the end of February have stayed in place. They've stayed in 2020 where possible and that's what's driven some of the CM that we had this quarter in particular with most of the rest of it rolling into next year.\nBen Swinburne: That's great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from David Katz with Jefferies. David Katz, your line is open. Mr. Katz, your line is on mute. We'll move on to the next question. Your next in queue is from Doug Arthur with Hebert Research.\nDoug Arthur: Yes. So I guess is the question for Michael or Joe. Based on all the costs that you have had to sort of take out to slow the burn. Is it fair to conclude that when business gets back to normal and obviously there'll be a surge of activity at some point that the underlying inherent margins of this company particularly on the concert segment may be higher on a longer term basis based on the kinds of rationalizations you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done the things you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found sort of added necessity. I mean, will there be structural change on a permanent basis?\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah. This is Joe. I'll start. The answer is yes. That's the over $200 million of cost savings from the severance that I talked about that we said will be out for the pursuable future. So that piece of it is out and then we'll manage bringing the other costs obviously as slowly as possible as needed to ramp up as we get into next year.\nMichael Rapino: And just to add -- I just want to add to that one of the things I want to make sure we're -- it's not just about severance we've had a time to reengineer. So one of the strengths is like everyone's learned that that is a new tool for all of us is the work from home strategy. We were very decentralized organization with lots of offices from Tampa Bay to Cleveland. And we're now learning what everyone is learning. We can shut down a lot of those regional offices. We can have a work from home strategy. We can reduce our office burn, our monthly burn, and have a much more flexible workforce too. So work from home a decentralized service model like ours has been an incredible new gift to figure out how can we now restructure and still deliver the same volume without some of the costs. We've also reengineered where we need offices and how we can have a regional model versus maybe a local at times. So between reengineering and work from home, our goal has been both at Ticketmaster, Live Nation and globally to run at a $200 million annual run rate reduction on our fixed costs. That's our goal right now and into a full wrap up.\nDoug Arthur: And just sort of following up on Ben's question on artists and maybe this is probably  but as things start to come back and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of demand for artists to get down the road there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably some scheduling issues, do you think artist management teams will be more flexible on payouts particularly if you're restricted in terms of how many seats you can sell out initially in an amphitheater what have you. Are your conversations indicating flexibility on that side of the equation?\nMichael Rapino: Yeah, 100%. I mean everyone has been affected by this understands the world's going to start differently. And it's going to require a slower ramp up. So we see it already and you see the driving shows. We're doing the social distance shows in Atlanta the rocks \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Roxy on the weekend where we have maybe 20% to 40% attendance depending on the state. Those are all adjusted artist guarantees based on the capacity, so 100% the artist will be coming back to work and adjusting their expectations to the realities of the capacity as we all as an industry start to scale up from 25% to 100% eventually.\nOperator: And we have David Katz with Jefferies.\nDavid Katz: Very good. Thank you. Look I given the considerable financial endurance and the limited visibility around the trajectory of this recovery. I just wanted to hear your thoughts or perspectives about any sources of capital or any capital rising at this point.\nJoe Berchtold: This is Joe. I think we don't see it as necessary at this point as we gave you a pretty detailed numbers on the burn. Current \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and our current debt capacity in cash. We think that we've got enough to get us through until we ramp backup. Also remember that a lot of the cash starts flowing back into the business months before the shows themselves start because you've got the concerts going on sale, which generates the cash in the Ticketmaster and into sponsorship. So we think that will take us through this period until we can get ramp back up. At the same time, we know the same thing that you and everybody else knows is that there is tremendous liquidity out in the market should at some point that the need arise. But we just don't see it at this point.\nOperator:  Your next question in queue is from Stephen Glagola with Cowen.\nStephen Glagola: Hi. Has the pandemic accelerated the shift for event organizers to utilize your digital ticketing technology and I just going back to the prior question on the Ticketmaster changes moving to the global tech stack et cetera. Do you expect these changes to push ticketing structural margins above that 29%, 30% threshold when business conditions normalize? Thanks.\nJoe Berchtold: So first of all on digital ticketing I think Michael spoke to the streaming and the fact that we see streaming has been a very interesting complement to our business going forward and we think it makes sense it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an additional point of revenue for the artists and for the overall ecosystem. And when they do a show they can also stream it for fans in other markets who can't get to the sold out show and so on. So the ability to provide that digital ticket along with traditional tickets and do  more important and something we're doing right now. So no question on that and then in terms of TM team going forward and the globalization. Again Michael spoke to and we've given you some of the numbers on the cost reduction obviously a chunk of that is associated with Ticketmaster and how we think about driving that on a globalized platform and taking some of the rust and inefficiencies that might have existed in accelerating bringing that all together. I don't think we're going to give you specific numbers here today, but we certainly see overall some further reductions in the cost structure.\nStephen Glagola: All right. Appreciate that John. Just one more if I can. Obviously most people are you're seeing most people hold onto their tickets for shows that have been postponed. How many times can you move a show before you expect to see sort of the ticket buying public to give up on the show and demand a refund or you just cancel altogether? I believe maybe you might have moved them once or twice right now. If you do three or four times does that get into a situation where you just end up canceling altogether?\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah. Look as Michael said the fundamental supply and demand dynamics have not changed. Artists want to tour. They need to tour for their livelihood. Fans want those tickets. You know six months ago we had a lot of folks saying no, no refunds in the 80%. Everybody's going to want their money back. Nobody's going to want. And that's proven fundamentally wrong. We're sitting at 17% six months later a fraction of what I think almost everybody was saying. And so we remain very confident that there's not going to be an exact formula. But fans who were able to get a good ticket for an artist they want to go to they're going to want to go to that show as soon as they possibly can whenever that is.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joe Berchtold",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael. Good afternoon, everyone. We've added some additional tables to the back of our earnings release, so this quarter I will hit the key numbers as opposed to reconciling in every number as I did last quarter. As Michael noted, we've continued to strengthen our financial position during the third quarter and all the key numbers are in line with or better than what we forecast last quarter. As a result, we are confident that our actions taken to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until the time is right to bring shows back. As part of this, we have further reduced all discretionary spending by another approximately $100 million and have now lowered to us for this year by over $900 million and reduce our cash usage by $1.5 billion relative to our pre-COVID plants. With these reductions, we have lowered the estimate on our operational cash burn rate to $110 million per month and our gross burn rate to $175 million per month on average for the last nine months of the year and prior to the benefit of contribution margin generated by the business. Included in our gross burn estimate is approximately $40 million in severance expense estimated through year-end which we expect to generate over $200 million in annual run rate savings. Our free cash at the end of the third quarter is $951 million and along with over $950 million of available debt capacity, we have $1.9 billion in readily available liquidity. At the same time refund rates for Q3 remain low at 17% globally. As a result deferred revenue is at $1.4 billion as of the end of Q3. And we have increased our forecast than what we expect at the end of the year now $1.4 billion. Turning to our Q3 results starting with AOI, our AOI loss for the quarter was $319 million which consisted of $337 million in operational cash burn, $50 million in other non-cash fixed costs and $68 million of contribution margin, which included $73 million from operations along with other one-time items. One point to note here is that this same from operations includes our sponsorship business where we've been able to maintain 90% of the commitments that were in place at the end of February. The bulk of this sponsorship moved into 2021, but some of it was repurposed into other assets including streaming concerts. Looking at free cash we ended the third quarter with $951 million in free cash compared to $1.8 billion at the end of Q2 in line with what we expected and consistent with what we told you last quarter. This translates to an $821 million reduction in our free cash metric for the quarter. Part of this, we had a reduction in free cash of $333 million due to working capital timing, which is part of the $415 million flip we told you last quarter would be happening in Q3 and Q4. We expect the remaining $80 million of this timing impact will affect free cash in Q4. The majority of this timing shift resulted from show scheduled for Q3 of 2021 shifting from long-term deferred revenue to current deferred revenue. So it is an accounting shift as opposed to actually use of cash. As a result, our total effective cash burn was $488 million for the quarter or approximately $160 million per month, which aligns with our gross cash burn net of contribution margin generated in the quarter. Now ticket refunds, as I indicated, the global refund rate for Live Nation Concerts that are rescheduled and are in or have gone through a refund window is 17% through the end of Q3. Festivals have generally canceled this year's event. But for festivals where fans can retain their tickets for next year's show 63% of fans are doing so and keeping their tickets. A bit more detail on deferred revenue, which is tracking ahead of where we told you last quarter we were going to be. At the end of the third quarter, deferred revenue for events in the next 12 months was $1.4 billion. Of the $421 million increase, $383 million was due to a shift from long-term deferred revenue to current deferred revenue for concerts rescheduled Q3 of 2021. At the end of the third quarter, we still had $103 million of long-term deferred revenue most of which equipped to short term deferred revenue by the end of the year. Given this, along with the projected Q4 outflow of $74 million from additional ticket refunds, we now forecast deferred revenue of $1.4 billion at the end of the year prior to any additional ticket sales. Given the uncertainty in the market on timing of shows returning, we cannot give any more guidance beyond the burn rates and refund levels we just gave you. With that, leta\u0302\u0080\u0099s open the call for any questions for Michael, Kathy, or me. I think the baseline economics the promoter the artist the venue those economics will not materially change structurally going forward. I think what you'll see and we've hit a few points is as we've spent this time continuing to think about our business, we've looked at how it is. We can take some costs out. And I give you some numbers on over $200 million in reduced run rate. And we've also spent our time thinking about just how does each piece of the flywheel operate a bit better going forward. And how do we keep thinking about new ways to drive the overall economics of the business. But I don't see any change in the core historical dynamics on the key players. I think as we look at 2021 we expect to see those savings to be largely in place and then 2022 is we've got to wait and see exactly what the scale is. The 2022 is as big as we think it could -- then we'll see what costs are needed. But we think that the bulk of this flows through the business and there is a structural savings. Yeah, really I can say is that I don't think Q2 and Q3 were that different from each other. Obviously some different pieces moving around, but they weren't wildly different. And I've given you the cash burn numbers operational and growth for nine months. So you can pretty easily do the calc on what that leaves over for Q4. Yeah, 90% of our sponsorship commitments that we had as of the end of February have stayed in place. They've stayed in 2020 where possible and that's what's driven some of the CM that we had this quarter in particular with most of the rest of it rolling into next year. Yeah. This is Joe. I'll start. The answer is yes. That's the over $200 million of cost savings from the severance that I talked about that we said will be out for the pursuable future. So that piece of it is out and then we'll manage bringing the other costs obviously as slowly as possible as needed to ramp up as we get into next year. This is Joe.

At the same time, we know the same thing that you and everybody else knows is that there is tremendous liquidity out in the market should at some point that the need arise. But we just don't see it at this point. So first of all on digital ticketing I think Michael spoke to the streaming and the fact that we see streaming has been a very interesting complement to our business going forward and we think it makes sense ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s an additional point of revenue for the artists and for the overall ecosystem.

            "name": "Michael Rapino",
            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. There're been no major changes in our business conditions or outlook since the last time we spoke. And while we see signs of promise around the world with some live events return. Most regions we operate in continue to have various restrictions unlike this. For now we continue to maintain a strong cash management discipline while planning for the ramp up to resume live shows as soon as possible. Joe will have a further update on costs and cash management efforts later in the call. We also continue to see strong fan demand across the board. Our sales and survey data tell us fan demand will be there when the time is right. Our refund rate on reschedule shows remain consistently low with 83% of fans globally keeping their tickets. A recent global survey indicates that 95% of fans are planning to return to live events when restrictions are lifted, the highest point of confidence since the start of the pandemic. Festival on sales for next year have been strong with EDC Las Vegas 2021 selling out in 24 hours with a higher capacity than last year. And ticket sales for Red and Greenfields and other White festivals pacing ahead of last year. And we encouraged by the enthusiasm for recent events and gatherings that have started to take place including our first sold out tour with 20,000 fans in New Zealand where business is headed back to normal. Meanwhile, we are working on a roadmap to get back to live safely. We are encouraged by progress on testing technology treatments and vaccines which will help us build our plans. We still expect shows at scale next summer but recognize that some exact timeline of this return will vary by region and so we continue to focus on remaining flexible. In preparation there are two areas we are focusing on. On the technology front, Ticketmaster is creating the tools we need to make sure live events can deliver a variety of safe precautions when returning. New products such as our social distancing seat mapping tool and time entry technology have been created to give venues the flexibility to plan how to manage everything from venue access to box office interactions. Existing products including our safe text digital ticket technology can fulfill new needs including being a key facilitator for contact tracing. And the ability to integrate third party applications with our digital ticketing platform enable the range of customizable features from contact list with concessions to testing and health questionnaire tracking. On the content front, Live Nationa\u0302\u0080\u0099s developing a set of standards for executing shows that our vendors. We are collaborating with health experts to develop show guidelines to put in place procedures, which can adapt to various situations across all regions. From venue sanitation procedures to fan friendly policies and on ticket purchases and the latest testing options, we are setting standards that will give the fans, crews and artists peace of mind before, during and after the show. If we look ahead it is through the past to Live will not be a straight one. With as such, we will maintain flexibility and focus on innovating during these times. On November 19th at our Investor event, we will outline more detail the opportunities we see emerging for our business. With that, I'll turn over to Joe. Thank you. It's Michael. We believe that virtual is a great complement to the car business. You know there's going to be always beyond says in BTS and Billie Eilish of the world can probably do like the old school pay per view if you think of it that way. There's always a few global superstars that probably can go direct and drive some significant dollars. But generally this business we think is a complement to and a promotion to their core concert. So we think it's a great opportunity. Listen we've been dabbling in virtual for years whether it was streaming through Twitter and Yahoo and stream and ourselves for sponsors. We've been streaming our festivals on YouTube for years. We now look at that as a continuation of that and we think going into 2021 and 2022 will be streaming a lot more of our concerts to fans that maybe either can't show up at the event or some that may want to still stream on our app when they're at the event because there's some added value of digital backrooms or camera angles et cetera. So we think it's a great compliment helps us probably drive a few incremental dollars per show and also as always been a great tool for sponsorship fulfillment. Thanks Brandon. You know there's nothing to read. This is like everyone is probably saying COVID excelled any strategy you had in our case while we've been sitting tight, we've been able to do a bunch of restructuring and really thinking of the business. But we had planned over the next three years that we were able to do in the last three months. So going global on Ticketmaster was always the number one priority. We always knew that our greatest opportunity for you know kind of the TAM on Ticketmaster is going to be outside of the US. It's an incredible powerful brand. We've expanded into markets where Live Nation has content. It's an allocation market. So as youa\u0302\u0080\u0099re concerts grow, you can feed your ticketing business. So ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s been a huge opportunity. We haven't been successful at getting the global technology architecture excelled as fast as we wanted. The US is always such a big kind of drag on resources when we're running at full steam that we always get that projects get slightly pushed back to solve the latest US technology need. This is one let us excel the strategy that says we're going to now have one global technology stack a much better efficient architecture around it, common global products that we can roll out at once and help excel our international expansion. So I myself am the product when I moved from Toronto to London and lived there for five years. I think it was the single reason Live Nation is what it is today. And Place Global is when you see from the outside in all the opportunity it gets you a\u0302\u0080\u0093 it gets you thinking differently. So I believe that the fastest way we would grow Ticketmaster to a global brand was let someone from the global side who's working that what business every day take the reins and drive that product. So we're even working with Mark for years and they've been having a product strategy to get there. We just excelled the leadership team to do it now. Sorry go ahead. Yeah. I think the priorities haven't changed when we get back to business they're going to continually be about, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve got an incredible two businesses that Ticketmaster were at the core were enterprise platform, white labeling teams and venues all around the world. So whether it's the NFL or the Phoenix Suns or ultimately artists were great software platform to power your ticket needs. And we're going to get better at better at that in terms of our do it yourself and white label in and empowering artists and venues and teams to deliver their ticketing needs. It's been a great kind of test platform is the virtual business. We've overnight had to become a virtual ticketing company at scale across the globe and we've been able to do that. We are powering through our portfolio all of these virtual shows and selling tickets to them. So that's been what we do at our core. And then two we've always talked about being a better marketplace making sure that the marketplace the approximately, making sure that we have full inventory on the shelves, adding more inventory to the shelves. Whether it's Ticketmaster clients or not being a true marketplace where consumers can find tickets buy them stock the shelves through secondary third-party partners adding more content to the shelves, that is the strategy. So this does take that global and those two core strategies continue. We've got lots of clients to service on a global basis. We're underserviced a\u0302\u0080\u0093 in under markets shared in many markets where our concepts are strong. And we're rolling out our global marketplace best-in-class practices across our global marketplaces that are sitting on old platforms. The same one he had at William Morris. But I think that there's a lot of talk on the independent venues save our stages et cetera. And there's no doubt everyone in live service providers and companies are having a rough year. We've been being very focused on making sure that the 12 million employees in Live from the hairdresser to the lighting crew to the security guards are get some stimulus and help. We think those people are in the most need. So, we've been very vocal about that. When it gets to the venues in general the thesis out there with Mark Geiger and some others is that these independent venues are so distressed that they're going to throw someone the keys at a very cheap price and you can maybe roll up some of these cheaply and have some scale. Well, the thesis is basically broken at the first point is any great Live club is not throwing anybody in the keys cheaply. There's a lot of capital out there. So if you on the Troubadour in Los Angeles, it's a legendary business and you're having a tough year. You're not selling to Mark Geiger or anyone else, if one or two time multiple your access to capital PPE loans lots of ways you can keep your business afloat, while you get through the storm. So we don't think that there's a huge opportunity that that there's a fire sale happening at that level. Now number two as you know we -- wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re the -- we have a consolidation of clubs in our business. Clubs on their own are a tough business, if you scale them up on their own. They're not -- they're not a really, really fruitful business on their own. So, we like them as part of our -- our overall ecosystem. But we're -- we don't believe that clubs whether you own 10, or whether you own 20 of them on their own provides you much global synergy or US synergy to leverage off of. So we hope all of these clubs find their way through this pandemic like we -- we hope all Live service providers find their way through this and that the government and stimulus programs and can help them survive it. But we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t think that that therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s probably many that are going to fire to anybody, because therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s too many great options for them. Well, the important part is the demand there and the supplies there as we know, right. So that's obviously what we're playing for. So we know that the fans still are going to get to the show and we know the artists want to get back on the road when it's safe. And depending whether you're a\u0302\u0080\u0093 what age you are as an artist you may have a different timeline and risk factor. But many artists that we're talking to are just waiting. As we all are looking on a week by week basis to figure out when is there a plan in place when they can start looking to get on the road. So we've been always talking to artists about if you have a 2022 or moved into 2021 for the summer into the fall. Let's hold on to that. Let's see how the next few months go through testing and vaccines and in a proper national plan et cetera. And we're telling any artist that has a new tour that's thinking of going on the road. Let's look at the fall, but we don't need to make those decisions until January, February. So if you have a new if you have a new tour well let's think about the fall into 2022 but let's sit tight until January before you start moving any costs in place to get ready. So that's kind of a -- that the general sense is let's -- let's reset, let's get through 2021 summer with whatever we reschedules from 2020, add new stuff into the fall to 2022 as we get a better visibility into January. You're talking about insurance on the historical what's happened to us this year? Yeah. Well, because we're just talking about as Michael just said really summer of getting back to scale. I think first of all we remain optimistic that the government here in the US like many of them internationally if sorted out and made sure that there's not spurious liability from everybody doing the appropriate actions. And then that's why we've got the programs in place and what we're doing is we're working with the public health officials in every market to figure out what is it that there needs to be done for those markets to bring fans back safely as we get to next summer. And I think it's our expectation that as long as we're doing that that we're going to be in a fine position. And just to add -- I just want to add to that one of the things I want to make sure we're -- it's not just about severance we've had a time to reengineer. So one of the strengths is like everyone's learned that that is a new tool for all of us is the work from home strategy. We were very decentralized organization with lots of offices from Tampa Bay to Cleveland. And we're now learning what everyone is learning. We can shut down a lot of those regional offices. We can have a work from home strategy. We can reduce our office burn, our monthly burn, and have a much more flexible workforce too. So work from home a decentralized service model like ours has been an incredible new gift to figure out how can we now restructure and still deliver the same volume without some of the costs. We've also reengineered where we need offices and how we can have a regional model versus maybe a local at times. So between reengineering and work from home, our goal has been both at Ticketmaster, Live Nation and globally to run at a $200 million annual run rate reduction on our fixed costs. That's our goal right now and into a full wrap up. Yeah, 100%. I mean everyone has been affected by this understands the world's going to start differently. And it's going to require a slower ramp up. So we see it already and you see the driving shows. We're doing the social distance shows in Atlanta the rocks a\u0302\u0080\u0093 Roxy on the weekend where we have maybe 20% to 40% attendance depending on the state. Those are all adjusted artist guarantees based on the capacity, so 100% the artist will be coming back to work and adjusting their expectations to the realities of the capacity as we all as an industry start to scale up from 25% to 100% eventually."

The release reconciliation and other financial or statistical information could be discussed on this call can be found under the Financial Information section on Live Nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website at investor.livenationentertainment.com. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir.\nMichael Rapino: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Over the past three months, our top priority has been strengthening our financial position to ensure that we have the liquidity and flexibility to get through an extended period with no live events. Our expectation that live events will return at scale is the summer of 2021, with ticket sales ramping up in the quarters leading up to these shows. And partly, we remain confident that fans will return to live events when it is safe to do so. Our strongest indicator of demand is that fans are holding onto their tickets even when given the option of a refund. Through the end of the second quarter, 86% of concert fans are keeping their tickets for rescheduled shows, demonstrating their continued desire to attend concerts in the future despite the current uncertainty. Our expectation for robust outdoor summer season in 2021 are also reinforced by the two-thirds of fans keeping their tickets for canceled festivals so they can go to next year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s show, along with a strong early ticket sales for the festivals in the UK next summer.  For example, downloads in the Isle of Wight are pacing well ahead of last year. Between the tickets held by fans for the rescheduled shows and these festival on sales, we have already sold 19 million tickets to more than 4,000 concerts and festivals scheduled for 2021, creating a strong base load of demand that is taking well ahead of this point last year. At the same time, surveys continue to show that concerts remain fans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 highest priority social event when it is safe to gather, with almost 90% of fans globally planning on attending concerts again. Understanding that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be some time before we put on concerts at scale, we are innovating to find new and creative ways to help artists keep fans connected in the meantime. Virtual concerts have proven to be a huge demand with fans, so we established a live from home platform to provide a convenient place for fans of all types to find the performances from their favorite artists. In the second quarter we had 67 million fans see over 18,000 concerts and festivals globally. Among our highlights, the past weekend we streamed 150 performances from our virtual Lollapalooza festival. Given the tremendous popularity of these shows, we are seeing the potential for live streaming to become an additional long-term component of our concert business, allowing fans in other cities or those who can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t attend to enjoy the concert as well. At the same time, recognizing fans want to get back to attending concerts in person as soon as possible, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve launched socially distant shows when and where permitted, included in New Zealand, France, Denmark, Spain, Germany, Finland and as well as cities across the U.S. While this is a challenging time for everyone, the live events business in particular, there are a few things that I am confident about. We are well-positioned to whether this crisis and we will get through this. When it is safe to return, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have an abundance of fan and artists ready to join live music again. And Live Nation will do everything in its power to meet our responsibilities to artists, fans, our employees and everyone else affected by this shutdown by bringing back as much live music as fast as possible when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s responsible to do so. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe for more detail on our results.\nJoe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As Michael mentioned, our top property during this time has been strengthening our financial position. And we are confident our actions taken to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until the time is right to bring shows back. We have now reduced costs for this year by over $800 million and reduced our cash usage by $1.4 billion relative to our pre-COVID plans. With these reductions, we have lowered the estimate on operational cash burn rate to $125 million per month and our gross burn rate to $185 million per month on average for the second quarter through the end of the year. At the same time, we raised an additional $1.2 billion, providing us with a $1.8 billion of free cash at the end of the second quarter, along with over $950 million of available debt capacity, totaling over $2.7 billion in readily available liquidity. And last week we amended our credit agreement to suspend our maintenance covenant to a more favorable liquidity metric to Q4 of 2021, providing us with added flexibility until business returns. Turning to our Q2 results, starting with AOI. Our AOI for the quarter was a loss of $432 million, driven primarily by operational fixed costs of $334 million, inclusive of approximately $60 million in benefits from various government payroll funding programs. So with our cost initiatives we expect operational fixed costs to average approximate $125 million per month for the second quarter through the end of the year. We then had negative $98 million in contribution margin, largely driven by one-time events in Ticketmaster and are concerts business. For Ticketmaster, recording refunds for 11 million tickets across 42,000 shows generated a loss of approximately $79 million for our portion of the service fees. In our Concerts business, writing off sunk costs associated with concerts that have been canceled or rescheduled for 2021 generated an expense of approximately $87 million, about two-thirds of which is write-off of advertising expenses given the calendar year shift in show timing. Partially offsetting these expenses, we had $68 million of contribution margin generated by business operations and insurance recoveries for events impacted by the pandemic. Looking at free cash, we ended the first quarter with approximately $820 million in free cash, added $1.2 billion in cash from additional debt during the second quarter and then ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of free cash. This implies $250 million in cash used during the quarter. As part of this, we had a timing benefit to free cash to $415 million which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll put back out in Q3 and Q4. Of this timing benefit, $225 million has accrued but not yet paid ticket refunds and $190 million is working capital timing. This puts our total effective cash burn at $665 million for the quarter. The largest one-time impact was the payment of Ticketmaster refunds which totaled $110 million for our portion of service fees refunded to fans during the quarter. We then had our operational cash burn. Starting with our $334 million in operational fixed costs and adding back $54 million of non-cash benefits, our operational cash burn totals $388 million for the quarter. In addition, we had $217 million of ongoing nonoperational cash burn items, including capital expenditures, acquisition activity, net advances and interest payments. These items ran slightly higher for the quarter due to contractually obligated payments for past acquisitions, but we expect this nonoperational component to our cash burn to average approximately $60 million per month for the second quarter through the end of the year. Finally, we had $50 million of inflows from operations and improved cash management. Lastly, let me give you an update on ticket refunds and how that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impacted our deferred revenue. Ticket refunds first. The global refund rate for Live Nation concerts that are rescheduled and are in or have gone through a refund window is 14% through the end of Q2. Festivals have generally canceled this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s events. But for festivals where fans can retain their tickets for next year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s show as Michael mentioned about two-thirds of them are keeping their tickets. Across both concerts and festivals, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve refunded $218 million for rescheduled shows since March. In addition, we have refunded $477 million for canceled shows over this period. Of this $695 million total, $230 million was funds held by third-party venues and $465 million from Live Nation held funds. We still have some shows in the process of rescheduling or are rescheduled but not yet offering refunds. If we apply the same fan behavior and mix on these events, we forecast approximately $270 million in additional fan refunds, of which about $180 million will be from Live Nation held funds. Given this estimate we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve shifted these funds from deferred revenue to accrued but not yet paid ticket refunds. Now to look at how these refunds flow through our event-related deferred revenue. At the end of the first quarter, our deferred revenue for events over the next 12 months was $2 billion. At the end of the second quarter, deferred revenue for events in the next 12 months was $941 million. Of this, approximately $1 billion decreased, $405 million was due to a shift from short-term deferred revenue to long-term deferred revenue as a number of concerts were shifted into the second half of 2021. As a result, we have $486 million of long-term deferred revenue at the end of the second quarter of which we estimate approximately $400 million was shipped back to short-term deferred revenue over the course of the year. The Live Nation concert ticket refunds recorded in the quarter then accounted for $465 million, an estimated additional future refunds from Live Nation health cash totaled $180 million. We then had ticket sales in the quarter that generated roughly $30 million in new deferred revenue. Looking at the rest of the year, our forecast for event-related deferred revenue at the end of the year prior to additional ticket sales and based on our projected refund rates is approximately $1.3 billion. Given all the uncertainty in the market and timing of shows, we cannot give you any further guidance beyond these burn rates and refund levels we just gave you. With that, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn the call over to Kathy.\nElizabeth Willard: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. I will review our second quarter and six months results and provide updates on our balance sheet. All of our results for this quarter and the first six months of the year have been significantly impacted by the shutdown of our shows since mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic which is driving all of the variances for both periods in total and across all segments. For the quarter, our revenue was $74 million, compared to $3.2 billion last year, down 98%. AOI was a loss of $432 million for the quarter compared to earnings of $319 million in 2019. Our operating loss was $588 million compared to $172 million in operating income last year. And net loss for the quarter was $568 million compared to net income of $103 million in 2019. For the first six months, we generated $1.4 billion in revenue compared to $4.9 billion last year, down 71%. Most of this revenue in 2020 was driven by our show activity in the first two-and-a-half months of the year prior to the shutdown. AOI was a loss of $452 million for the first six months compared to income of $435 million in 2019. Our operating loss was $761 million compared to $148 million in operating income last year and net loss for the first six months was $752 million compared to net income of $51 million in 2019. Now onto our balance sheet. As of June 30, we had total cash of $3.3 billion, which includes a free cash balance of $1.8 billion. Our total cash includes $941 million of current event-related deferred revenue as well as $486 million of long-term deferred revenue for events that have been rescheduled more than one year out as of June 30. This is part of our operating cash and therefore provides us additional liquidity. As Joe outlined, we estimate that our actions to conserve cash eliminates or defers approximately $1.4 billion in cash outflows for 2020, which includes the cash portion of our approximately $800 million in cost savings along with the reduction in capital expenditures, lower acquisition activity and reduce concert and ticketing advances. In May 2020, we issued $1.2 billion principal amount of 6.5% senior secured notes due 2027. As of the end of the quarter, our total debt was $4.9 billion with a weighted average cost of 4.4%. We also have $966 million of available debt capacity between our revolvers and undrawn term loan A. Last week we completed an amendment to our credit agreement which amends and further suspends our net leverage coveted until December 31, 2021, if we choose, replacing it with a minimum liquidity test of $500 million, which is measured against our free cash, available debt capacity and up to $250 million of our event-related deferred revenue. We believe that our free cash, together with our undrawn debt capacity, gives us sufficient liquidity to maintain critical operations until shows return. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $55 million, giving us a total for the six months of $129 million. We are now estimating our full year spend to be approximately $215 million, down from our initial estimate for the year of $375 million. Of the remaining $86 million in capital expenditures for the year, approximately $30 million is for capitalized labor, for updates to our ticketing systems, with the remainder largely venue-related in large term projects.  With that, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll open up for questions. Operator?\nOperator:  And your first question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners.\nBrandon Ross: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for the very detailed prepared remarks. A couple of questions. First, can you tell us how you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re approaching on sales for 2021? Should we expect a similar cadence to the typical years? Or are you guys going to take more of a wait-and-see approach, given everything that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on? And I assume in your cash burn guidance that you gave there is no top line in there at all and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re assuming no on sales in 2021. Then I have a follow up.\nJoe Berchtold: This is Joe. I will start these. In terms of the on sales timing, as we indicated, we expect to be returning to scale with next summer particularly focused on the amphitheaters and the festivals first. So I think that we would expect the usual timing of those on sales, which would typically be for amphitheaters around the end of the year. So we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect for the full year the same; we expect it to be more back half loaded. But we do expect the on sales to be somewhere around a few towards the end of the year and the bulk of them as we get into the first quarter of the year. Second question. In terms of the cash burn, the cash burn is with I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll call it relatively limited inflows, more similar to what we have in Q2. So we did have some inflows but not, obviously, at scale or substantial. The cash burn numbers we gave you are assuming the status quo through Q4. And as we move further into it and we have better visibility on Q4, if there is some ramp ups and activity which would give us both increased contribution margin as well as increased costs, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll guide you to that as we get closer. But we thought the more prudent simple thing to do at this point is to give you the status quo. And then as we have more going on, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll increase both sides from there.\nBrandon Ross: Got it. And then it was widely reported I guess in the rags that you tried to adjust artist terms for festivals and were met with pushback. Can you talk about what happened there and what was the outcome? And as you contract for 2021 shows, have you been able to share your risks with artists at all? And how have contracts been structured differently for 2021 shows and maybe going forward from there? Hello?\nMichael Rapino: Sorry, Brandon, I had trouble with my mic. Yeah, the press got a hold of a work in progress, which was too bad, because it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t meant to be that. We, for a living, are negotiating deals with agents and managers. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the business model. Their job is to look for competition, and our job is to bid on these shows in different terms for different artists in different times. So the process is always fluid. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re obviously trying to do our side of the negotiation and the agents doing their side. This looked, I guess as it got reported, it was just a mid statement. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t meant to be anything more than that. But what we really wanted to accomplish was I would just step back and say the industry overall has been amazing dealing with restructuring 2020 into 2021. The agents, the managers and all the artists all have been very cooperative, that understand that if you had a show this year and you wanted to reschedule next year, some compromise in the terms would have to be met. And the biggest risk we all had on the promoting side that we wanted to make sure we could incorporate was the refunds. Now the refunds, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen, have been surprisingly really strong on the concert side. And we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what we were going to head into an we started renegotiating. But we do know on festivals refund rates are much higher because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bigger cash outlet, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also just a bigger time commitment. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tend to be as local as your average concert. So wanted to make sure going to 2021, if you are a headline artist that was going to play a certain festival this year and we wanted -- and you still wanted to play it next year, the two things we wanted to make sure that we were protected in and that we both shared some of the risk was a refund reduction and insurance. Those are the two principles, if you take all the drama from the press, aside those are the two things we wanted to make sure that we weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stuck paying the same price in 2020 if we had a 31% refund rate on a festival. Now if those tickets all sold back through and that festival ended up at the same place it was in 2020 then we should all share the upside. And every agent and artist and manager have been incredibly accommodating to all the promotors in the business who are all looking for some help in terms of rescheduling next year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shows and taking in refund and insurance, and making sure we are clear on those two terms. So that was the net result of it all. The rest was a wish list of things as we head into any negotiation. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099d all like to win, but those are the two points that made sense that were most important for our business and for the festival P&Ls.\nBrandon Ross: What about for shows that are in 2021 that were not pushed from 2020? Are those contracts being structured differently than historical deals?\nMichael Rapino: Well, I would say that what the industry did in general overall is every show you basically had you had the chance to cancel it. Right. Every show basically was canceled in some sense. Not to our doing. So everyone was in the same boat. You were all starting with a clean slate. So I would say to you if you had a tour that was on sale and it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t doing well, you and the artist decided to pull it down and not go forward with it regardless of COVID. So any tour that you reschedule, you have the opportunity to look at that deal and at that show and at the number of dates, et cetera, and negotiate with the agent and manager and the artist on what was the best go-forward strategy. So anything -- we talk about 2021 is going to be a spectacular year in the sense of the stuff that did get pushed you can guarantee was all of the stuff that was selling well and high demand. So that stuff is all going to -- those shows will still be continuing next year. We didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have anything really on sale for 2021 ahead of our 2020 season of any substance. Ninety-five percent of what we are dealing with was 2020 reschedule to 2021 shows.\nBrandon Ross: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan.\nDavid Karnovsky: Hi. Thank you. When you look at planned 2021 concert season, can you talk about how it might look coming back in terms of venues? And you all mentioned before, focus on maybe the amphitheater footprint initially, so how much can you lean into your amphs? And can you book artists there that might otherwise played an arena or stadium?\nMichael Rapino: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll start and then Joe will jump in. I mean, first, you think about our business. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 50% international, 50% America, so a lot of what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing is what were going to happen outside of America versus here. The summer season in international is the heartbeat of their business festivals, from small outdoor shows to larger festivals. So Europe will already continue what they do well. Most of their business will be outdoors. The summer season here, we do have the advantage of our 50 amphitheaters and we think those are going to be high utilization next summer, as well as our boutique festivals. So, yes, we would be looking right now at the business as a strong amphitheater festival outdoor business in Europe and into America, and then most of your touring indoor stuff will start to ramp up in the fall into winter.\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah, I agree. The only thing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d add is I think this is a place where our having, our managing a large number of buildings really is going to come to our advantage. So the fact that we have these 50 amphitheaters we can manage the process with the buildings and we have all of that activity outdoor, the same for the festivals where we have the leases on the land and we can operate them. And then even the hundred plus clubs and theaters that we have as one would expect that some of the lower volume number of people gathering will happen sooner than some of the large gathering indoor because we have those buildings, because we can manage the processes with them. I think that will let us ramp up faster than otherwise we would be able to.\nDavid Karnovsky: Okay. Then I think earlier you did mention some international regions with concerts being done at limited capacity. I mean, are there other countries or markets where you operate where you think you can get to some level of scale prior to summer 2021 at this point?\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah, I mean, we definitely, we all see that news, the U.S. looks like the one that will be the longest but the other markets, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Australia, New Zealand, Denmark Germany, Finland, some of those markets, they all seem to be moving along on a good forward path. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had a very structured plan in place and when small shows can start, they seem to be moving towards those timelines. So although we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about a spring return to business outdoors we do actually operate in 40 different countries expect certain markets especially from theater up unto clubs and into arenas to be happening in some of those markets before the spring.\nDavid Karnovsky: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBen Swinburne: Hey. Good evening or good afternoon. Michael, can you go a little bit more about artist appetite to get back on the road in this environment? I know a lot are either postponing releasing new music or at least some have. Others, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure, are trying to be sensitive to the economic pressures that their fans are seeing. What are you hearing from artists that you have relations with around getting back on the road sooner rather than later? And maybe a similar question for you on their, decision process on canceling versus postponing, I think there been some who have decided to cancel in order to help their fans get their money back faster. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if that was something that you thought would grow as the year progressed. And then I just had a follow up on the deferred revenue point.\nMichael Rapino: Yeah, I think it was our last earnings call we were showing you some statistics to make sure that everyone understood that touring had not had a structural change. There was a debate back then whether fans would gather when they got out of this. I think if anything we learned in three months, we got to figure out how they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gather short-term so we can have better business faster. I would just say to you that we have been really, really, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to play long on this one, so we have artists with lots of ideas on shows they could do now. We won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be doing DJ sets in The Hamptons anytime soon. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to play along and play safe. So the artist, you nailed it. I was talking to an artist this morning. I think as you read elsewhere, I think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see a creative boom. I saw the record label this week also down slightly because they need new releases and touring to happen to keep the machine moving. So yeah, I think 2021 you have artists that are all just keep calling me daily saying, when can I go? When\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it going to be safe? When are we going to go? I am dying to go. I got new music. I want to drop new music. So I think this is why we believe long-term regardless of what quarter we exactly scale at, the business will be stronger than ever with the creative push by all these artists who need to get on the road to drive their new music. So 2021, 2022, we can debate what quarter exactly ramps but we believe 2021 into 2022 will be record years with artists on the road who are pent-up. They need to get on the road economically and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re now powered by crates of backlog and they are all waiting. I talked to an artist this morning. They were going to release in November. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to wait until March now so they can coincide with the tour schedule later in the year in 2021. So huge demand. We are very gifted in this industry and that we have incredible supply chain, a lot of ongoing creative geniuses who make their living connecting with fans on the road. So that will continue, and we know now from all of the craziness we have seen across America, the fans are going to gather. We just got to make sure we can do it safely. As far as canceling and postponing, one of the things we decided really early on was to make sure that we offered refunds on postponed events also. We didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want deferred revenue to have any false narrative to it. We still are leading the industry. There are many companies that are not giving refunds, even ones that got government money. But we believe that you need to offer the fans refunds for postponed and cancel shows, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done that. So we believe our actual number when we talk about fans holding on, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s real. We make it very easy for you to get a refund right now at Ticketmaster if you go look at our site versus others. We even see a concerts sold at Ticketmaster versus other ticket sites, the take rate is higher at Ticketmaster, because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very easy to get a refund. I believe that the refund numbers are true, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not suppressed in any manner on our business because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re offering both options. And if you see an artist that canceled versus postponed, it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be because he wants his fan to get money back. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve offered both those options for any tour. It may just be an artist that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to go, was going to go on the road, probably an older artist looking at it saying, maybe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to run back and try to figure out if May is going to happen right now; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take a year off. So you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen some of those ones that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just wait. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a younger artist tied to more record releases, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably really still waiting and ready to go probably a little earlier, given your demo.\nBen Swinburne: Got it. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s helpful. And then just deferred on the revenue. Thank you for all the detail. I may be confused. Deferred revenue for events, I think, at the end of the quarter was about $940 million. And I think you said you thought it would be $1.3 billion at the end of the year. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obviously the higher number, which is sort of counterintuitive, given there is some refund activity expected. I think, Joe, you said that did not include any benefit from on sales. So what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the reconciling item? Or did I just maybe mishear you?\nJoe Berchtold: Yes. So you heard the numbers right, Ben. Two things. One is, as part of that $941 million, that includes $180 million of what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve modeled out as additional refunds that we expect to happen. Because we are able to model it, we needed to ship that out of deferred revenue. If our model were perfect, then that would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already been taken out. And the second is when we use the term deferred revenue, it is with regards to deferred revenue for events taking place over the next 12 months. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never been an important nuance in the past because deferred revenue for things over a year ago has tended to be pretty small. But in this case, because we deferred a lot of shows into the second half of 2021, we have about $400 million of long-term deferred revenue that will flip into deferred revenue over the next six months. So your 900 plus 400 equals the $1.3 billion rough numbers.\nBen Swinburne: Got it. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll all be experts on this by the end of the year hopefully. Thanks for your help.\nJoe Berchtold: And then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll start selling more tickets to confuse you deferred. We look forward to that day.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks.\nOperator:  And you do have a question in queue from Khoa Ngo with Jeffries.\nKhoa Ngo: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. If you can just focus a little bit on M&A opportunities, and obviously, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of distress out there. So I want to be sensitive and cognizant with the question. So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just wondering what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing in terms of opportunities to consolidate and what your general appetite is to pursue those opportunities.\nMichael Rapino: Well, I think we mentioned it last time. I think we look on a global basis as we continue to look to build our global market share. And we believe that over the next 24 months there\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be ongoing opportunities for us to expand our global footprints in foreign and international markets that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve have been looking to get into and build some businesses around. So, yes, we do think that over time this will provide us some opportunity in international markets.\nKhoa Ngo: Understood. And if I can just pivot a little bit towards your cost cuts. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve clearly made a lot of progress. I believe the numbers were around $500 million pre-1Q, and then 1Q was about $600 million and now you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at $800 million. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just wondering of that $800 million how much of that you think is more structural, more permanent going forward.\nMichael Rapino: Yeah, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to give you exact number. But there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no question we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been going through this process, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been looking at our fundamental cost structure and we do expect that we will come out of this with some different organizational structures, a bit leaner, bit tighter in terms of how we do some things. So we will have some savings. How much of that, right, you expect to see more of that in 2021 is a year that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ramping back up; and then as your continuing to grow getting into 2022 and beyond, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re then reinvesting some portion of that. But over the next quarter or two, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give more definitive numbers on that.\nKhoa Ngo: Understood. Thanks very much.\nMichael Rapino: But to give you color, I would add the only gift to when you slow down to this level that you have not had since we launched this company 15 years ago is you build up your own bureaucracy and your own rust 15 years in. And we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t had the luxuries or opportunity to sit back division by division and look under every rock and challenge ourselves on how are we going to go to market differently? What are some new products we need to go to market with, and how are going to operate more efficiently on a global basis? So I would say the part that does motivate me daily is Joe and I and our teams probably have never felt so energized around what Live Nation 3.0 will look like heading into 2021. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s -- our main obsession isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just to sit still but to come out of this looking and feeling different.\nKhoa Ngo: Thanks very much for the color\nMichael Rapino: Will hit -- which obviously will add efficiencies to our ongoing cost structure as well.\nOperator: Your final question comes from Stephen Glagola with Cowen.\nStephen Glagola: Hi. If we look at the phase 3 openings across the U.S. and internationally, concerts that are still being put on in various international countries and cities for the most part are at pretty reduced capacities. What gives you confidence that the governments will allow live events to return to scale in the summer of 2021? And can you maybe define like when you say back to scale, is that 75% capacity, 50% capacity in your amsen  festivals or full capacity, if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the expectation. That would be great. And then you talk on the press release like the potential revenue opportunity or -- sorry -- streaming, excuse me -- as being an additional long-term component of the concert business. Could you maybe speak to that as a potential additional new revenue opportunity? And any other adjacent products or services you guys may be able to offer during this difficult time to bring in some incremental revenue? Thanks.\nMichael Rapino: All right. Let me -- go ahead.\nJoe Berchtold: I will start on streaming then work backwards. Yeah. I think we have a natural advantage in the streaming business in the sense we have studios call these events. And 300 festivals and 10,000 theater and club shows alone, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been great at the physical execution but they do provide incredible digital opportunities that we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t focused enough on. So I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re deep at work in biz devev  department and I think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see some new products from us in the new year that we think are complements to our core business. But great additions. We also have such a huge sponsorship base, when you have 900 sponsors. Adding Live from Home alone has been a big part of helping deliver some benchmarks as well as drive-in concerts and some of the reduced capacity, although not perfect on their own, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been great tools to provide sponsors with some value. So I think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see us launch some new products that we think will be a great complement to our core business. As far as the confidence on getting back to business, Joe, you and I were just discussing that so you could take the lead.\nJoe Berchtold: Sure. So first of all, to answer your question on what we mean by scale? To us, scale our normal business model in the summer, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be doing several thousand concerts a quarter for tens of millions of fans. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to try to predict right now the exactness. Is it 70%? Is it 90%? What percent of last year is it? But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in that type of volume. So why do we think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to happen? A couple of things. First of all, I think the efforts on the vaccine front are moving faster than anyone predicted three or four months ago if you listen to the experts. The Dr. Faucis of the world and what are they saying in terms of their expectations where you have multiple different vaccines with multiple different approaches and their belief that something is going to happen by the end of the year is one of the vectors that gives you some comfort. The other is the progress being made on the treatments. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve obviously as a medical community learned a huge amount over the past four months in terms of the basic treatment, in terms of perhaps the potential of antibody treatments, the use of other drugs, remdesivir and others, in terms of helping to reduce the mortality rate of it. So overall in terms of as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked bringing about the facts and the science lead us, we have been pleasantly surprised thus far on the progress of vaccines, probably some of the testing and tracing has been slower but still now is ramping up so between the testing, tracing, the treatment also providing opportunity. So amongst those I think we believe sitting here today that the facts would say that by the beginning of the year you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to put on the tickets. The tickets on sale we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to do the shows next summer. And then for the reasons that we have talked about, we have a high degree of comfort that demand is going to be there. 86% of the people keeping their tickets to the shows, two-thirds of the people keeping their tickets for festivals that were canceled this year, put out canceled but still saying they wanted to go to the show next year instead of getting their refund. So in total over 19 million tickets for 4,000 shows that have already been sold which that alone, well, we have already sold for 2021 would make us one of the largest promoters in the world. So all those factors together I think is what gives us the comfort.\nStephen Glagola: Thanks, John and Michael, and pardon the long-winded questions, but if I could just slip one more and just on, could you discuss the viability of independent venue owners in this environment if then used to close down or go bankrupt? How do you anticipate that impacting the concerts business and also Ticketmaster you think will reopen?\nMichael Rapino: I would just say on the Ticketmaster front, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a global business with a very, very diverse portfolio less on the small venue side on a macro level. So it would have limited effect there. Ticketmaster, at the end of the day has very large sports business on a global basis and big venues which is a big part of its business and then large concerts. So don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see it there, any effect there. I would say that looks like in most of the countries, maybe the U.S. now, this ongoing stimulus programs in effect and that seem to be coming to life for the live business in general, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the employees, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the venues, small or big. So I would assume some of them would have continued ongoing support through government programs to keep them afloat through this time. Listen, we are all in the same boat. We are all looking to figure out how to get through the downtime and reduce costs, and I think they are banding together, and hopefully, they will find their support systems also.\nOperator: And there are no further questions in queue at this time. \nMichael Rapino: Thank you. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Joe Berchtold",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As Michael mentioned, our top property during this time has been strengthening our financial position. And we are confident our actions taken to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until the time is right to bring shows back. We have now reduced costs for this year by over $800 million and reduced our cash usage by $1.4 billion relative to our pre-COVID plans. With these reductions, we have lowered the estimate on operational cash burn rate to $125 million per month and our gross burn rate to $185 million per month on average for the second quarter through the end of the year. At the same time, we raised an additional $1.2 billion, providing us with a $1.8 billion of free cash at the end of the second quarter, along with over $950 million of available debt capacity, totaling over $2.7 billion in readily available liquidity. And last week we amended our credit agreement to suspend our maintenance covenant to a more favorable liquidity metric to Q4 of 2021, providing us with added flexibility until business returns. Turning to our Q2 results, starting with AOI. Our AOI for the quarter was a loss of $432 million, driven primarily by operational fixed costs of $334 million, inclusive of approximately $60 million in benefits from various government payroll funding programs. So with our cost initiatives we expect operational fixed costs to average approximate $125 million per month for the second quarter through the end of the year. We then had negative $98 million in contribution margin, largely driven by one-time events in Ticketmaster and are concerts business. For Ticketmaster, recording refunds for 11 million tickets across 42,000 shows generated a loss of approximately $79 million for our portion of the service fees. In our Concerts business, writing off sunk costs associated with concerts that have been canceled or rescheduled for 2021 generated an expense of approximately $87 million, about two-thirds of which is write-off of advertising expenses given the calendar year shift in show timing. Partially offsetting these expenses, we had $68 million of contribution margin generated by business operations and insurance recoveries for events impacted by the pandemic. Looking at free cash, we ended the first quarter with approximately $820 million in free cash, added $1.2 billion in cash from additional debt during the second quarter and then ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of free cash. This implies $250 million in cash used during the quarter. As part of this, we had a timing benefit to free cash to $415 million which wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll put back out in Q3 and Q4. Of this timing benefit, $225 million has accrued but not yet paid ticket refunds and $190 million is working capital timing. This puts our total effective cash burn at $665 million for the quarter. The largest one-time impact was the payment of Ticketmaster refunds which totaled $110 million for our portion of service fees refunded to fans during the quarter. We then had our operational cash burn. Starting with our $334 million in operational fixed costs and adding back $54 million of non-cash benefits, our operational cash burn totals $388 million for the quarter. In addition, we had $217 million of ongoing nonoperational cash burn items, including capital expenditures, acquisition activity, net advances and interest payments. These items ran slightly higher for the quarter due to contractually obligated payments for past acquisitions, but we expect this nonoperational component to our cash burn to average approximately $60 million per month for the second quarter through the end of the year. Finally, we had $50 million of inflows from operations and improved cash management. Lastly, let me give you an update on ticket refunds and how thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s impacted our deferred revenue. Ticket refunds first. The global refund rate for Live Nation concerts that are rescheduled and are in or have gone through a refund window is 14% through the end of Q2. Festivals have generally canceled this yeara\u0302\u0080\u0099s events. But for festivals where fans can retain their tickets for next yeara\u0302\u0080\u0099s show as Michael mentioned about two-thirds of them are keeping their tickets. Across both concerts and festivals, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve refunded $218 million for rescheduled shows since March. In addition, we have refunded $477 million for canceled shows over this period. Of this $695 million total, $230 million was funds held by third-party venues and $465 million from Live Nation held funds. We still have some shows in the process of rescheduling or are rescheduled but not yet offering refunds. If we apply the same fan behavior and mix on these events, we forecast approximately $270 million in additional fan refunds, of which about $180 million will be from Live Nation held funds. Given this estimate wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve shifted these funds from deferred revenue to accrued but not yet paid ticket refunds. Now to look at how these refunds flow through our event-related deferred revenue. At the end of the first quarter, our deferred revenue for events over the next 12 months was $2 billion. At the end of the second quarter, deferred revenue for events in the next 12 months was $941 million. Of this, approximately $1 billion decreased, $405 million was due to a shift from short-term deferred revenue to long-term deferred revenue as a number of concerts were shifted into the second half of 2021. As a result, we have $486 million of long-term deferred revenue at the end of the second quarter of which we estimate approximately $400 million was shipped back to short-term deferred revenue over the course of the year. The Live Nation concert ticket refunds recorded in the quarter then accounted for $465 million, an estimated additional future refunds from Live Nation health cash totaled $180 million. We then had ticket sales in the quarter that generated roughly $30 million in new deferred revenue. Looking at the rest of the year, our forecast for event-related deferred revenue at the end of the year prior to additional ticket sales and based on our projected refund rates is approximately $1.3 billion. Given all the uncertainty in the market and timing of shows, we cannot give you any further guidance beyond these burn rates and refund levels we just gave you. With that, Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll turn the call over to Kathy. This is Joe. I will start these. In terms of the on sales timing, as we indicated, we expect to be returning to scale with next summer particularly focused on the amphitheaters and the festivals first. So I think that we would expect the usual timing of those on sales, which would typically be for amphitheaters around the end of the year. So we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t expect for the full year the same; we expect it to be more back half loaded. But we do expect the on sales to be somewhere around a few towards the end of the year and the bulk of them as we get into the first quarter of the year. Second question. In terms of the cash burn, the cash burn is with Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll call it relatively limited inflows, more similar to what we have in Q2. So we did have some inflows but not, obviously, at scale or substantial. The cash burn numbers we gave you are assuming the status quo through Q4. And as we move further into it and we have better visibility on Q4, if there is some ramp ups and activity which would give us both increased contribution margin as well as increased costs, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll guide you to that as we get closer. But we thought the more prudent simple thing to do at this point is to give you the status quo. And then as we have more going on, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll increase both sides from there. Yeah, I agree. The only thing Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099d add is I think this is a place where our having, our managing a large number of buildings really is going to come to our advantage. So the fact that we have these 50 amphitheaters we can manage the process with the buildings and we have all of that activity outdoor, the same for the festivals where we have the leases on the land and we can operate them. And then even the hundred plus clubs and theaters that we have as one would expect that some of the lower volume number of people gathering will happen sooner than some of the large gathering indoor because we have those buildings, because we can manage the processes with them. I think that will let us ramp up faster than otherwise we would be able to. Yeah, I mean, we definitely, we all see that news, the U.S. looks like the one that will be the longest but the other markets, whether ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s Australia, New Zealand, Denmark Germany, Finland, some of those markets, they all seem to be moving along on a good forward path. Theya\u0302\u0080\u0099ve had a very structured plan in place and when small shows can start, they seem to be moving towards those timelines. So although wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re talking about a spring return to business outdoors we do actually operate in 40 different countries expect certain markets especially from theater up unto clubs and into arenas to be happening in some of those markets before the spring. Yes. So you heard the numbers right, Ben. Two things. One is, as part of that $941 million, that includes $180 million of what wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve modeled out as additional refunds that we expect to happen. Because we are able to model it, we needed to ship that out of deferred revenue. If our model were perfect, then that woulda\u0302\u0080\u0099ve already been taken out. And the second is when we use the term deferred revenue, it is with regards to deferred revenue for events taking place over the next 12 months. Thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s never been an important nuance in the past because deferred revenue for things over a year ago has tended to be pretty small. But in this case, because we deferred a lot of shows into the second half of 2021, we have about $400 million of long-term deferred revenue that will flip into deferred revenue over the next six months. So your 900 plus 400 equals the $1.3 billion rough numbers. And then wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll start selling more tickets to confuse you deferred. We look forward to that day. I will start on streaming then work backwards. Yeah. I think we have a natural advantage in the streaming business in the sense we have studios call these events. And 300 festivals and 10,000 theater and club shows alone, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve been great at the physical execution but they do provide incredible digital opportunities that we havena\u0302\u0080\u0099t focused enough on. So I think wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re deep at work in biz devev  department and I think youa\u0302\u0080\u0099ll see some new products from us in the new year that we think are complements to our core business.

            "content": "Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. I will review our second quarter and six months results and provide updates on our balance sheet. All of our results for this quarter and the first six months of the year have been significantly impacted by the shutdown of our shows since mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic which is driving all of the variances for both periods in total and across all segments. For the quarter, our revenue was $74 million, compared to $3.2 billion last year, down 98%. AOI was a loss of $432 million for the quarter compared to earnings of $319 million in 2019. Our operating loss was $588 million compared to $172 million in operating income last year. And net loss for the quarter was $568 million compared to net income of $103 million in 2019. For the first six months, we generated $1.4 billion in revenue compared to $4.9 billion last year, down 71%. Most of this revenue in 2020 was driven by our show activity in the first two-and-a-half months of the year prior to the shutdown. AOI was a loss of $452 million for the first six months compared to income of $435 million in 2019. Our operating loss was $761 million compared to $148 million in operating income last year and net loss for the first six months was $752 million compared to net income of $51 million in 2019. Now onto our balance sheet. As of June 30, we had total cash of $3.3 billion, which includes a free cash balance of $1.8 billion. Our total cash includes $941 million of current event-related deferred revenue as well as $486 million of long-term deferred revenue for events that have been rescheduled more than one year out as of June 30. This is part of our operating cash and therefore provides us additional liquidity. As Joe outlined, we estimate that our actions to conserve cash eliminates or defers approximately $1.4 billion in cash outflows for 2020, which includes the cash portion of our approximately $800 million in cost savings along with the reduction in capital expenditures, lower acquisition activity and reduce concert and ticketing advances. In May 2020, we issued $1.2 billion principal amount of 6.5% senior secured notes due 2027. As of the end of the quarter, our total debt was $4.9 billion with a weighted average cost of 4.4%. We also have $966 million of available debt capacity between our revolvers and undrawn term loan A. Last week we completed an amendment to our credit agreement which amends and further suspends our net leverage coveted until December 31, 2021, if we choose, replacing it with a minimum liquidity test of $500 million, which is measured against our free cash, available debt capacity and up to $250 million of our event-related deferred revenue. We believe that our free cash, together with our undrawn debt capacity, gives us sufficient liquidity to maintain critical operations until shows return. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $55 million, giving us a total for the six months of $129 million. We are now estimating our full year spend to be approximately $215 million, down from our initial estimate for the year of $375 million. Of the remaining $86 million in capital expenditures for the year, approximately $30 million is for capitalized labor, for updates to our ticketing systems, with the remainder largely venue-related in large term projects.  With that, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll open up for questions. Operator?"

            "name": "Michael Rapino",
            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Over the past three months, our top priority has been strengthening our financial position to ensure that we have the liquidity and flexibility to get through an extended period with no live events. Our expectation that live events will return at scale is the summer of 2021, with ticket sales ramping up in the quarters leading up to these shows. And partly, we remain confident that fans will return to live events when it is safe to do so. Our strongest indicator of demand is that fans are holding onto their tickets even when given the option of a refund. Through the end of the second quarter, 86% of concert fans are keeping their tickets for rescheduled shows, demonstrating their continued desire to attend concerts in the future despite the current uncertainty. Our expectation for robust outdoor summer season in 2021 are also reinforced by the two-thirds of fans keeping their tickets for canceled festivals so they can go to next yeara\u0302\u0080\u0099s show, along with a strong early ticket sales for the festivals in the UK next summer.  For example, downloads in the Isle of Wight are pacing well ahead of last year. Between the tickets held by fans for the rescheduled shows and these festival on sales, we have already sold 19 million tickets to more than 4,000 concerts and festivals scheduled for 2021, creating a strong base load of demand that is taking well ahead of this point last year. At the same time, surveys continue to show that concerts remain fansa\u0302\u0080\u0099 highest priority social event when it is safe to gather, with almost 90% of fans globally planning on attending concerts again. Understanding that ita\u0302\u0080\u0099ll be some time before we put on concerts at scale, we are innovating to find new and creative ways to help artists keep fans connected in the meantime. Virtual concerts have proven to be a huge demand with fans, so we established a live from home platform to provide a convenient place for fans of all types to find the performances from their favorite artists. In the second quarter we had 67 million fans see over 18,000 concerts and festivals globally. Among our highlights, the past weekend we streamed 150 performances from our virtual Lollapalooza festival. Given the tremendous popularity of these shows, we are seeing the potential for live streaming to become an additional long-term component of our concert business, allowing fans in other cities or those who cana\u0302\u0080\u0099t attend to enjoy the concert as well. At the same time, recognizing fans want to get back to attending concerts in person as soon as possible, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve launched socially distant shows when and where permitted, included in New Zealand, France, Denmark, Spain, Germany, Finland and as well as cities across the U.S. While this is a challenging time for everyone, the live events business in particular, there are a few things that I am confident about. We are well-positioned to whether this crisis and we will get through this. When it is safe to return, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll have an abundance of fan and artists ready to join live music again. And Live Nation will do everything in its power to meet our responsibilities to artists, fans, our employees and everyone else affected by this shutdown by bringing back as much live music as fast as possible when ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s responsible to do so. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe for more detail on our results. Sorry, Brandon, I had trouble with my mic. Yeah, the press got a hold of a work in progress, which was too bad, because it wasna\u0302\u0080\u0099t meant to be that. We, for a living, are negotiating deals with agents and managers. Thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s the business model. Their job is to look for competition, and our job is to bid on these shows in different terms for different artists in different times. So the process is always fluid. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re obviously trying to do our side of the negotiation and the agents doing their side. This looked, I guess as it got reported, it was just a mid statement. It wasna\u0302\u0080\u0099t meant to be anything more than that. But what we really wanted to accomplish was I would just step back and say the industry overall has been amazing dealing with restructuring 2020 into 2021. The agents, the managers and all the artists all have been very cooperative, that understand that if you had a show this year and you wanted to reschedule next year, some compromise in the terms would have to be met. And the biggest risk we all had on the promoting side that we wanted to make sure we could incorporate was the refunds. Now the refunds, as wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve seen, have been surprisingly really strong on the concert side. And we didna\u0302\u0080\u0099t know what we were going to head into an we started renegotiating. But we do know on festivals refund rates are much higher because ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s a bigger cash outlet, but ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s also just a bigger time commitment. They dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t tend to be as local as your average concert. So wanted to make sure going to 2021, if you are a headline artist that was going to play a certain festival this year and we wanted -- and you still wanted to play it next year, the two things we wanted to make sure that we were protected in and that we both shared some of the risk was a refund reduction and insurance. Those are the two principles, if you take all the drama from the press, aside those are the two things we wanted to make sure that we werena\u0302\u0080\u0099t stuck paying the same price in 2020 if we had a 31% refund rate on a festival. Now if those tickets all sold back through and that festival ended up at the same place it was in 2020 then we should all share the upside. And every agent and artist and manager have been incredibly accommodating to all the promotors in the business who are all looking for some help in terms of rescheduling next yeara\u0302\u0080\u0099s shows and taking in refund and insurance, and making sure we are clear on those two terms. So that was the net result of it all. The rest was a wish list of things as we head into any negotiation. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099d all like to win, but those are the two points that made sense that were most important for our business and for the festival P&Ls. Well, I would say that what the industry did in general overall is every show you basically had you had the chance to cancel it. Right. Every show basically was canceled in some sense. Not to our doing. So everyone was in the same boat. You were all starting with a clean slate. So I would say to you if you had a tour that was on sale and it wasna\u0302\u0080\u0099t doing well, you and the artist decided to pull it down and not go forward with it regardless of COVID. So any tour that you reschedule, you have the opportunity to look at that deal and at that show and at the number of dates, et cetera, and negotiate with the agent and manager and the artist on what was the best go-forward strategy. So anything -- we talk about 2021 is going to be a spectacular year in the sense of the stuff that did get pushed you can guarantee was all of the stuff that was selling well and high demand. So that stuff is all going to -- those shows will still be continuing next year. We didna\u0302\u0080\u0099t have anything really on sale for 2021 ahead of our 2020 season of any substance. Ninety-five percent of what we are dealing with was 2020 reschedule to 2021 shows. Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll start and then Joe will jump in. I mean, first, you think about our business. Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s 50% international, 50% America, so a lot of what wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re doing is what were going to happen outside of America versus here. The summer season in international is the heartbeat of their business festivals, from small outdoor shows to larger festivals. So Europe will already continue what they do well. Most of their business will be outdoors. The summer season here, we do have the advantage of our 50 amphitheaters and we think those are going to be high utilization next summer, as well as our boutique festivals. So, yes, we would be looking right now at the business as a strong amphitheater festival outdoor business in Europe and into America, and then most of your touring indoor stuff will start to ramp up in the fall into winter. Yeah, I think it was our last earnings call we were showing you some statistics to make sure that everyone understood that touring had not had a structural change. There was a debate back then whether fans would gather when they got out of this. I think if anything we learned in three months, we got to figure out how they dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t gather short-term so we can have better business faster. I would just say to you that we have been really, really, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re going to play long on this one, so we have artists with lots of ideas on shows they could do now. We wona\u0302\u0080\u0099t be doing DJ sets in The Hamptons anytime soon. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re going to play along and play safe. So the artist, you nailed it. I was talking to an artist this morning. I think as you read elsewhere, I think youa\u0302\u0080\u0099re going to see a creative boom. I saw the record label this week also down slightly because they need new releases and touring to happen to keep the machine moving. So yeah, I think 2021 you have artists that are all just keep calling me daily saying, when can I go? Whena\u0302\u0080\u0099s it going to be safe? When are we going to go? I am dying to go. I got new music. I want to drop new music. So I think this is why we believe long-term regardless of what quarter we exactly scale at, the business will be stronger than ever with the creative push by all these artists who need to get on the road to drive their new music. So 2021, 2022, we can debate what quarter exactly ramps but we believe 2021 into 2022 will be record years with artists on the road who are pent-up. They need to get on the road economically and theya\u0302\u0080\u0099re now powered by crates of backlog and they are all waiting. I talked to an artist this morning. They were going to release in November. Theya\u0302\u0080\u0099re going to wait until March now so they can coincide with the tour schedule later in the year in 2021. So huge demand. We are very gifted in this industry and that we have incredible supply chain, a lot of ongoing creative geniuses who make their living connecting with fans on the road. So that will continue, and we know now from all of the craziness we have seen across America, the fans are going to gather. We just got to make sure we can do it safely. As far as canceling and postponing, one of the things we decided really early on was to make sure that we offered refunds on postponed events also. We didna\u0302\u0080\u0099t want deferred revenue to have any false narrative to it. We still are leading the industry. There are many companies that are not giving refunds, even ones that got government money. But we believe that you need to offer the fans refunds for postponed and cancel shows, and wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve done that. So we believe our actual number when we talk about fans holding on, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s real. We make it very easy for you to get a refund right now at Ticketmaster if you go look at our site versus others. We even see a concerts sold at Ticketmaster versus other ticket sites, the take rate is higher at Ticketmaster, because ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s very easy to get a refund. I believe that the refund numbers are true, theya\u0302\u0080\u0099re not suppressed in any manner on our business because wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re offering both options. And if you see an artist that canceled versus postponed, it wouldna\u0302\u0080\u0099t be because he wants his fan to get money back. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve offered both those options for any tour. It may just be an artist that wasna\u0302\u0080\u0099t going to go, was going to go on the road, probably an older artist looking at it saying, maybe Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099m not going to run back and try to figure out if May is going to happen right now; Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll take a year off. So youa\u0302\u0080\u0099ve seen some of those ones that theya\u0302\u0080\u0099ve said, Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll just wait. If youa\u0302\u0080\u0099re a younger artist tied to more record releases, youa\u0302\u0080\u0099re probably really still waiting and ready to go probably a little earlier, given your demo. Well, I think we mentioned it last time. I think we look on a global basis as we continue to look to build our global market share. And we believe that over the next 24 months therea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll be ongoing opportunities for us to expand our global footprints in foreign and international markets that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve have been looking to get into and build some businesses around. So, yes, we do think that over time this will provide us some opportunity in international markets. Yeah, I dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t think wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re going to give you exact number. But therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s no question wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve been going through this process, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve been looking at our fundamental cost structure and we do expect that we will come out of this with some different organizational structures, a bit leaner, bit tighter in terms of how we do some things. So we will have some savings. How much of that, right, you expect to see more of that in 2021 is a year that youa\u0302\u0080\u0099re ramping back up; and then as your continuing to grow getting into 2022 and beyond, youa\u0302\u0080\u0099re then reinvesting some portion of that. But over the next quarter or two, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll give more definitive numbers on that. But to give you color, I would add the only gift to when you slow down to this level that you have not had since we launched this company 15 years ago is you build up your own bureaucracy and your own rust 15 years in. And we havena\u0302\u0080\u0099t had the luxuries or opportunity to sit back division by division and look under every rock and challenge ourselves on how are we going to go to market differently? What are some new products we need to go to market with, and how are going to operate more efficiently on a global basis? So I would say the part that does motivate me daily is Joe and I and our teams probably have never felt so energized around what Live Nation 3.0 will look like heading into 2021. And thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s -- our main obsession isna\u0302\u0080\u0099t just to sit still but to come out of this looking and feeling different. Will hit -- which obviously will add efficiencies to our ongoing cost structure as well. All right. Let me -- go ahead. I would just say on the Ticketmaster front, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s a global business with a very, very diverse portfolio less on the small venue side on a macro level. So it would have limited effect there. Ticketmaster, at the end of the day has very large sports business on a global basis and big venues which is a big part of its business and then large concerts. So dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t think youa\u0302\u0080\u0099ll see it there, any effect there. I would say that looks like in most of the countries, maybe the U.S. now, this ongoing stimulus programs in effect and that seem to be coming to life for the live business in general, whether ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s the employees, whether ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s the venues, small or big. So I would assume some of them would have continued ongoing support through government programs to keep them afloat through this time. Listen, we are all in the same boat. We are all looking to figure out how to get through the downtime and reduce costs, and I think they are banding together, and hopefully, they will find their support systems also. Thank you."

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Live Nation Entertainment's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].Before we begin, Live Nation has asked me to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ including statements related to the company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters. Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the company's most recent filings on Forms 10-K 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results. Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with the SEC Regulation G, Live Nation has provided a full reconciliation of the most comparable GAAP measures in their earnings release. The release, reconciliation and other financial statistical information to be discussed on this call can be found under the Financial Information section on Live Nation's website at investors.livenationentertainment.com.It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir.\nMichael Rapino: Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I hope that everyone out there is healthy and safe. On our last call, we were on track for tremendous growth across all our businesses, with both fan demand and artists touring increasing on a global basis. Then in mid-March, we came to a halt. We have held no concerts in almost 2 months. Despite these challenging times, we continue to have full confidence in the long-term supply and demand of the live concert industry, Live Nation's leadership position and our business model's ability to successfully deliver AOI growth and shareholder value. With that context, let me update you on our top priorities at this point.Our top priority is to ensure the health and safety of our employees, fans and artists. Like most of the world, we have been working remotely since mid-March, and we will return to work only after there is clear consensus that it is safe to do so, and then in appropriate numbers with expanding cleaning and social distancing protocols. Similarly, we recognize the experience that our venues will change when concerts start back up. And we're working with medical experts and public health officials on procedures to keep people safe while enjoying our shows.When we asked over 8,000 fans across North America about the requirements for returning to shows, they had 2 clear priorities, with 85% of fans stating they want increased cleaning and sanitizing of the venues and ready access to hand sanitizing stations, while no other action received more than 40%. In addition, we expect to have additional safety protocols in place, potentially including reduced capacity, touchless concessions and creative ways to apply our digital ticketing technology.Our next priority is planning for the reopening of concerts when the time is right. First and foremost, we will let the facts and science tell us when we should start putting on concerts again. We are working with government at federal and state levels in the U.S. and across all markets in building plans that fit with their reopening phases. In the meantime, we have fortified our balance sheet to have the resources to ramp up quickly when the time is right.We know from fans that demand will be there when the shows return. Globally, over 90% of fans are holding on to their tickets for rescheduled shows when refunds are available. That's the clearest demonstration of pent-up demand that will enable us to quickly start concerts back up.Looking a bit farther out, given that 80% of shows are rescheduled rather than canceled, and as noted, almost all fans are holding on to their tickets, we believe 2021 can return to show volume and fan attendance at levels consistent with what we've seen in recent years.As we plan the resumption of concerts, we're also seeing a number of innovations within our company as artists look to stay connected to fans. Almost 1 million fans have come to our Live at Home site to find virtual tours and acoustic performances from their home. And millions of fans in over 100 different countries have joined Insomniac's Virtual Rave-a-Thons, while drive-in concerts are finding a new purpose to socially-distant concert halls. Throughout all this, we are still motivated by the long-term potential of global live events. It's in the DNA of us to want to gather, socialize and celebrate. And as we provide assurances on health and safety at the venue, we expect our business to build back.Live Nation is in the best position in the live ecosystem to play long and to capture new opportunities, continue leading the industry into the future. I'll now hand the call over to Kathy and Joe, who will provide additional full details on our balance sheet.\nJoe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Before getting into the quarter, I want to give a quick update on our cost and cash management programs, which we launched in March. We previously announced initiatives to cut costs by $500 million this year. And we've surpassed that goal and are now targeting $600 million in cost reductions. We've also expanded our cash management program, which including our cost initiatives, now eliminates or defers $1 billion in cash requirements this year. As a result, we project our monthly operational cost burn rate to be approximately $150 million per month for the second quarter and through the remainder of the year.Now I will walk through the impact of the COVID shutdown on each of our businesses during the first quarter. As we previously indicated, at the end of February, we were headed toward delivering Q1 AOI, in line with last year, approximately $115 million. Instead, with the shutdown, we had 100 -- sorry, instead, with the shutdown, we had a $21 million AOI loss for the quarter. The direct COVID impact in the quarter was approximately $165 million, which was partially offset by approximately $30 million in cost savings during the quarter.Starting with concerts. Our concerts division went from $5 million of AOI in the first quarter of last year to a loss of $88 million this year. Through February, we had promoted 5,500 shows for nearly 8 million fans, up year-on-year by 17% and 2%, respectively. We then ended the quarter with 7,100 shows for 10.4 million fans, down 14% and 30%, respectively, from last year. With 2,100 March shows canceled or rescheduled to a future date, we've lost approximately $40 million of anticipated contribution margin on those shows. Additionally, we had a onetime expense of approximately $25 million for sunk cost for canceled shows, which included the cost of paying show employees for those shows that didn't happen during the second half of March. We had always expected our concerts AOI to be down in Q1 given the show activity level and increased fixed costs of approximately $40 million largely associated with acquisitions made over the last year. But unfortunately, the March shutdown led to a substantially lower AOI.On a separate matter, our OCESA acquisition was approved by Mexico's regulators in April. We've now entered into discussions with CIE and Televisa regarding the timing and terms of the previously announced OCESA transaction. And do not expect to close the transaction until we have greater clarity on the duration of the shutdown in Mexico and its impact on OCESA's business.Next, Ticketmaster. Our ticketing division AOI fell from $100 million in the first quarter last year to $45 million this year. Similar to our concerts division, through February, we were on track for a strong Q1 with fee-bearing GTV up 31% to $3.2 billion. Net of refunds, we then ended the quarter with $3.0 billion in fee-bearing GTV, down 22% from Q1 last year. This drastic reduction in fee-bearing GTV led to an approximately $65 million reduction in contribution margin relative to our February forecast for the business. In addition, we refunded 5.2 million tickets for $432 million of GTV during March. And along with an accrual for future refunds of shows canceled in April, this resulted in a $35 million reduction in contribution margin.To give you a little more color on our refunds through this past weekend, Ticketmaster has had 65,000 shows impacted by the virus. Virtually all canceled shows are currently refunding, and about 80% of rescheduled shows or postponed shows are currently offering refunds. For Live Nation concerts, about 9,000 shows have been impacted. Of those shows, about 20% have canceled and 80% are rescheduling. Again, almost all canceled shows are currently refunding. And over 90% of rescheduled shows are offering refunds with the remaining shows scheduled to be refunding in the near future. And as Michael said, less than 10% of fans are taking the refund for the rescheduled or postponed shows when given the choice with over 90% of them holding on to their tickets for a future date.Finally, sponsorship. Our sponsorship business was the least impacted by the March shutdown, losing less than $5 million in contribution margin as a result, and this quarter delivered $47 million in AOI, up from $40 million in the first quarter last year.Overall, we recognize the next few quarters will not be business as usual, so we won't be giving any direction on key operating metrics until we start selling tickets and promoting concerts again. Our focus is on managing our cost structure and cash burn, ensuring a strong balance sheet as we come out of the shutdown. And with that, I will turn the call over to Kathy.\nElizabeth Willard: Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon to everyone joining us. I will briefly recap our first quarter results and provide an update on our liquidity position. For the quarter, we generated $1.4 billion in revenue, down 21% compared to last year as the shutdown shows due to COVID-19 reduced our revenue by approximately $435 million, primarily in concerts and also ticketing. Our AOI was a loss of $21 million for the quarter, down $136 million compared to last year driven by approximately $165 million in COVID-related impacts.Our operating loss was $173 million, driven by an estimated $175 million COVID-19 impacts, including $10 million in intangible impairments in the quarter. Net loss for the quarter was $185 million, and net loss per share was $0.94.Now on to our balance sheet and liquidity position. We are actively managing our cash to preserve our strong liquidity position during the stoppage in shows. We have taken quick and aggressive actions to conserve cash, including our cost savings initiatives and cash management program, which eliminates or defers $1 billion in cash outflows for 2020 relative to our budget as Joe outlined. In addition to the $600 million in cost savings, these cash impacts include a reduction in capital expenditures, lower acquisition activity and deferrals of concert and ticketing advances. We now estimate an operational cash burn rate of approximately $150 million per month for the rest of the year, prior to interest expense, debt payments, capital expenditures and other nonoperational items.As of March 31, we had total cash of $3.3 billion, which includes a free cash balance of $817 million. In April, we completed an amendment to our credit agreement, which suspends our net leverage covenant for the second and third quarters of 2020, replaced with a minimum liquidity test for those quarters. Beginning in Q4 of this year, the net leverage covenant will use the bank-defined EBITDA from Q2 and Q3 of 2019 instead of the Q2 and Q3 2020 results. We continue to have a 20% add-back in that EBITDA calculation, which gives us added protection from our COVID-19 impacts during the period. We also added an incremental revolver of $130 million in April, providing us with additional financial and operational flexibility. That now gives us $963 million of available debt capacity between our revolvers and undrawn term loan A. And we will continue to monitor the capital markets for opportunities to expand liquidity at appropriate pricing.Our total cash includes $2 billion of event-related deferred revenue as of March 31. This is part of our operating cash and therefore, provides us additional liquidity. We believe that our free cash balance of $817 million, together with our $963 million of undrawn debt capacity, gives us sufficient liquidity to maintain critical operations for the remainder of the year, even in the extreme scenario that no major shows play off this year.As of the end of the quarter, our total net debt position was $3.7 billion, with a weighted average cost of 3.9%. We expect to be in compliance with our debt covenants around our corporate debt structure for all of 2020. Total capital expenditures for the quarter were $74 million. We are now estimating our full year CapEx to be approximately $200 million, down from our initial estimate at the beginning of the year of $375 million as part of our overall cash flow improvement process. Of the remaining $126 million in CapEx for the year, approximately $50 million is for capitalized labor in our ticketing segment, which we continue to rely on for our ticketing operations, with the remainder largely venue-related long-term projects. We will continue to evaluate all projects as the year progresses, particularly as we gain more insight into opening time lines by region.With that, we'll open it up to questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan.\nDavid Karnovsky: First, Michael, I'd be interested to get your view on the long-term impact of COVID-19. Across a lot of industries right now, there's talk of huge acceleration in consumer trends. So I'm wondering what you think this potentially means for the concerts and ticketing industry.\nMichael Rapino: Thanks, David. We're looking at all this data ongoing as we're trying to understand and make sure we're looking at a global basis of our consumers and any long-term effects. It was important, we want to make sure we got one of our surveys online today because I think the general surveys aren't always useful, but we went and talk to 10,000 of casual and ongoing ticket buyers around the world. And the data's pretty compelling. I mean 90% of fans are saying, \"I can't wait to get back to the show.\" I think our refund rate says everything. Anyone that has any view that says, will they come back? Will the consumer change behavior? We're running somewhere between a 5% and 10% refund rate right now on a global basis, much lower in Europe.Those aren't out of line with when we reschedule just a traditional tour for different reasons. So 90% of fans in today's environment saying, \"I'm going to hold on to those tickets because I can't wait to see the show,\" I think it's probably the most compelling data one could look at that says the consumer is going to come back strong. It's a big part of their old social DNA to get out and gather and communal experiences with their friends and family.So we don't debate that consumers nor artists will be back on the road from a supply/demand -- I mean, since the early days, people have been gathering around artists. And we think long after we're dead, people will gather around artists. It's a communal primal need. We're just not debating on what month we start that back. So we don't think we have any consumer trends that worry us. This -- there was no acceleration in our industry of a decline. If anything, we were having a global acceleration as emerging markets were becoming more sophisticated and opening up to the traditional concert. So we see that on a global basis that the show will be back. It'll be back as big as ever from a consumer demand.And the second part of our equation that is really unique is the supply. We have all these artists who really look to go on the road for financial and to bond with their fans and build long-term franchises. And talking to those artists on a daily basis, they are waiting to get back on the road when it's safe for them and their fans. So supply/demand dynamics, I think we have a unique situation in the sense of fans are -- cherish those 2 hours when they get on the road and see their favorite performers. The artists want to get back out. Now we're just going to make sure we play the science, and when can we get out there on a safe manner on a scale basis. But we think demand in '21 and onward will be as big as it was in '20 -- or in '19.\nDavid Karnovsky: Okay. And I was hoping you could expand a bit on your liquidity position. In a scenario of extended shutdowns, how long can you continue to operate? And what options do you see in terms of additional financing? And maybe as a follow-on to that, what is the right way for investors to view your available cash position, including the deferred revenue portion?\nMichael Rapino: Joe?\nJoe Berchtold: Yes. Sure. David, let's start with where we're at, which is $800-and-something million in available cash, $900-and-something million in untapped debt. So $1.7 billion of available untapped liquidity to start with, and then to the point I made of about $150 million a month of operational cash burn. So that says you can go through this year without doing shows at any scale without any concern. I think it's our expectation that even though likely to not have a huge volume of shows this year, as we get into Q4, you start having the ticket sales in some large scale for shows next year.I think we're already seeing -- obviously, the NFL has their schedule announced today or schedule release today. Most of the teams are going on sale with their tickets over the next day or so. So you're already seeing people going on sale even if the shows aren't happening, and that will drive some of our ticketing and sponsorship businesses. But just as the base case, certainly, getting through this year without any additional liquidity isn't a concern. More broadly, when we look at the markets, I think spreads have come back to more normal levels. The capital markets are absolutely open. Open to us, open to a wide range of folks that are looking for any increased liquidity. We'll watch that opportunistically and see what makes sense to do.And then in terms of your question on deferred revenue, I think that, to us, has never historically been part of how we think about our ongoing operational liquidity. I think in this instance, particularly given the very low level of refunds, as Michael went into, it's just some float that in effect we could tap into if, for short- to medium-term purposes, we had a need for that additional liquidity float. It's not part of our base case scenarios in any means.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thanks for all the color on the cash front. Two questions. Michael, could you talk about the sort of operational approach and process of sort of rescheduling all of these events around the world? I mean the complexity, I think, you've talked about in the press is significant. But I'm wondering as you start to go down that path, if you could just spend a few minutes on sort of how you go about doing that and what your opportunities and options are, and how you may or may not be working with other promoters and artists and things along those lines.And then just another cash question on the liability side. You guys have some accrued expenses and accounts payable at the end of the quarter. And I didn't know what we should be thinking about those liabilities, whether or not you need to pay those down over the next couple of quarters. Is there any color you can give us on the accrued expense account payable front? I don't think that's captured in your cash burn number, but I could have that wrong.\nMichael Rapino: Thank you. Yes, you're right. We have a lot of shows. I mean again, the glass half full here. Thankfully, our show is not time-dependent. So you feel for any other event companies where if you missed the final 4, you can't replay that. So the great advantage we have is it's just now timing. The fan wants to see Billie Eilish. They would have liked to see them in March, but they'll wait until October or they'll wait until February. The average customer goes to 2.5 shows a year. So these are the Kodak moments, and they'll wait for them.So you're right. We're going to -- we're dealing right now as an industry, as a whole, I'd say, like most probably industries. The industry has never come together this well from the agents, the artists, the buildings, the managers, the promoters, we're all in the same boat. So we're all looking to say, how do we move availabilities. Really, the only challenge we've had with availabilities in terms of a little bit of the -- why we had to hang on to the refund strategy is the sports lakes. They're kind of the ones -- we need to understand what's going to happen in the fall time in their arenas, and what availability is and when is the season going to start. Traditionally, the NFL, and the NBA, NHL announce their season, and then we kind of know the next Q4, Q1, Q2 availabilities. That would really be our only gating issue. As soon as they get their exact schedules up, then we'll be able to slot all the dates in.As an industry, we have a great model right now that if you have a current date that was planned, you will get first holds to get that back on the road. And if you're a new tour that was going to tour in '21, you're probably moving that to later in '21 or into '22. So we've talked about it. We think we'll have a very robust '21 backend and really, really robust backend '21, '22. But working together with the industry, we see no issues in moving all of these dates into '21, just waiting on some scheduling conflicts.\nElizabeth Willard: And on the accrued liability AP part of that question, I mean, think about, yes, it's obviously built into cash burn. It's also part of when you think about what we're deferring, when we talk about deferring part of our cash, the $1 billion. There will be liabilities that will be sitting there that are accrued that just won't be paid for a while.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners.\nBrandon Ross: First, curious how COVID's impacting your commercial agreements with the artists and venues. In the process of rescheduling all these shows, have you been able to renegotiate the contract terms with the artists on guarantees? And as you look to incremental 2021 tours, do the terms of the artist deals look different because of COVID? Are there less guarantees? And then also, what about third-party venues? And then I have a follow-up.\nMichael Rapino: Thanks, Brandon. As I referred to, as an industry, it's been a unique time where we are all in this together. And I would say that the artists, the agents, the managers have been incredibly supportive. The reality that in '20 and '21, the promoter can't take all the risk on the business as we historically have. We need to share some of that, especially refunds on the guarantees. So I would say to you that we don't want to out loud get into how and what the deals are. I would say to you though that we absolutely are getting great latitude from the artists and agents to look at a traditional business of high guarantees and all of our risk, to help share that risk into '20 and 21, to get the shows back on the road and help us absorb the show, but not take all of the refund sales, sponsorship, food and beverage unknowns for the next 6 to 12 months. They're helping sharing some of that risk which will provide us great opportunity to get back, scale fast, but not have to worry about losing money on the show.\nBrandon Ross: Great. And you've obviously spent a lot of time looking at your costs searching for near-term savings, but is there an opportunity to reassess your overall cost structure as we come out of the pandemic.\nMichael Rapino: Yes, I think any CEO, any business operator, it's the great gift of this reality we're in. We're all looking at our business and wondering, now that we have been able to stop, catch our breath and look at our business, are we running the most efficient way we can? How do we restructure our business, our cost basis on a global basis to be more efficient? We have gone into furloughs and cost reductions, as you know. We absolutely plan on coming out of this a leaner machine, much more efficient on how we go to market.And then probably as other companies have learned, there are some areas we're going to have to spend and acquire a better skill set at, to help us diversify our core business in terms of virtual concerts and other things that we've dabbled in, but maybe we got to spend a bit more time in that area. So bottom line is we look at this as a great opportunity on a global basis for us to restructure our cost basis, come out a leaner organization while still as aggressive as ever in terms of our global growth strategy.\nBrandon Ross: Great. And then maybe one just more technical one for Kathy. You said you expect your debt covenants to be fine all year. If I sit back here and I do the math with limited or no revenue in Q4, it looks to me like -- if we used AOI as a proxy for bank EBITDA, you would still bust the covenant in Q4. Can you just explain what we're missing, maybe it's the 20% add-back that you mentioned earlier?\nElizabeth Willard: Yes. I think the two main things, Brandon, would be, yes, you're assuming no material concert activity. But as Joe said, still expecting some ticket sale activity this year and related sponsorship for that. So based on those things, we obviously will not break our covenants based on projections. But I think the other big thing is that 20% because you can take 20% of that bank EBITDA as an add-back for the COVID impacts. And so you can do that for your AOI in the same way and get pretty close.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Drew Borst with Goldman Sachs.\nAndrew Borst: A couple of questions. I want to ask firstly about OCESA. I heard the comments about it but I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on what's going on there in terms of -- are you still interested in the asset? Or is this about figuring out a new purchase price, maybe because the performance says they've underperformed in this environment? But maybe you could just add some color on that, please.\nMichael Rapino: Yes. We're going to -- we've had a long relationship with OCESA and a great relationship helping them on the tour business as they build their business. And we have talked to them about it in the last couple of weeks. It's taken a while to get the government approvals. It happens -- and now in Mexico. But we were -- as you would expect, my line to them has been, we are, long term, still bullish on their business and ours. We want to be in business with OCESA and get the deal done.But we're not sure where Mexico stands. And I'm not looking to take on any losses from Mexico while they're going through their 6 or 8 months of business downturn, will they come up the other side. So ideally, we want to get the deal done. We want to delay the cash payment of the deal until we both know how and when we're on the other side of this crisis. So that's the intent.\nAndrew Borst: Makes sense. If I could, a couple more. I go through the 10-K, there is a liability that gets mentioned, this redeemable noncontrolling interest puts. In the K, you guys flagged it, at least at the time you expected it might be $238 million sort of obligation. I was wondering if you could just comment on whether that's still a good estimate or are there ways to maybe defer those payments in this environment.\nMichael Rapino: Yes. Joe, you've been working on that.\nJoe Berchtold: Yes. Sure. So Drew, some of that we paid in Q1 for some of those puts. And the majority of anything that's still out there that hasn't been paid, we're working to defer out of the year, and that's part of the $1 billion deferral program. So I think you can kind of take all of that together.\nAndrew Borst: Okay. And then just sorry, one last one...\nMichael Rapino: But I would add to it. The spirit of it, it's been great. As you can imagine, if you're a partner in a festival, and the festival got canceled, and you happen to have a put up in your deal, we're talking to them about let's delay the put for the year because the event didn't happen and we didn't retain the cash. So we've been very cooperative with our partners. And some of them may need the cash for other reasons, but generally, the partnerships have been very accommodating if their event got moved.\nAndrew Borst: Okay. And sorry, one last one on -- when I look at your free cash reconciliation, right, from GAAP cash down to free cash, one of the big add-backs is this prepaid expenses, which I think about $450 million at the end of the quarter. I just want to understand what that is because I guess I'm a little bit concerned that, I guess, these are expenses you already paid for events. I don't know what a counterparty is on those and I guess I'm wondering, would it be -- is it feasible to really collect that cash if you need to get it in sort of short order? Or I don't know, can you help me understand what that number is and that risk of collecting?\nElizabeth Willard: Yes. So mainly, that's going to be artist advances. And so the best way to think about that is it's an offset to the deferred revenue. So we -- on that free cash, we're deducting off our event-related deferred revenue. And the add-back basically says we're not going to have to pay the artist part of that money because we've already advanced it to them. So it's a good way to net out what really is deferred revenue that might be going out other than our profit.\nAndrew Borst: I see. So you actually have the cash on. I got you. So it's netted against the deferred, you have the cash in your bank account.\nElizabeth Willard: Right.\nOperator: And your last question comes from the line of Khoa Ngo from Jefferies.\nKhoa Ngo: It's clear that your data suggests there's a lot of pent-up demand to return to concerts. I'm just wondering if you can provide granular detail as to your reopening strategies, particularly spend engagement, artist engagement, and how you can feasibly control capacity in the social business as well.\nMichael Rapino: Thank you. Yes. Well, one of the things I always remind people on 2 fronts is our global diversity is our greatest strength. It always has been. Wherever there's been challenges, there's been markets of opportunity. So the 2 things to remember about our business, unlike sports or NFL where it's stadiums or nothing, is we have a very diverse size of shows. We did 15,000 club and theater shows last year, and we did them in 40 countries. So we'll look in the next 6 months, but we'll be kind of starting slow and small, focusing on the basics, kind of testing regionally. But it will be about whether it's in Arkansas or a state that is safe, secure and politically is fine to proceed in, we're going to dabble in fan-less concerts with broadcast. We're going to go and reduce capacity shows because we can make the math work.There are a lot of great artists that maybe they can sell an arena out, but they'll do 10 higher-end smaller theaters or clubs. We're seeing lots of artists jumping to get back out when it's safe. So you're going to see us in different countries, whether it's Finland, whether it's Asia, Hong Kong, certain markets are farther ahead. And we kind of look at it as over the next -- over the summer period, there'll be testing happening, whether it's some fan-less concerts, which are really important for our sponsorship business, all the ways we can create great properties to keep all of our sponsors who have been amazing and sticking with us this year. So it's important for us to keep doing drive-in concerts. We're going to test and roll out, which we're having some success with, fan-less concerts, which have great broadcast opportunities; reduce capacity of festival concerts where it could be outdoors, could be in a theater, it could be in a large stadium floor, where there's enough room to be safe.So we have all of these plans in place depending on the market and where the -- that local city may sit in their reopening phases. So we want to be smart. We don't want to rush. We're playing long ball. One of the realities is we and AEG are the 2 companies that can withstand this storm as long as it plays. And we're going to play for the long safety of business. So we're not looking to rush and provoke any new spread of the virus. We want to do it smart with local participation. But there's lots of great opportunities that are arising now where we will get to test over the summer period.And again, I remind you, those are important for my sponsorship business as well as testing the feel on some new ideas we have. We think the fall time, if a lot of those things happen and don't cause any second hot spots, that you'll see markets around the world. Europe specifically has talked about September opening up 5,000-plus. So I think you'll see the fall time more experimental and more shows happening in more of a theater setting and into some arenas. And then our goal is really to be on sale in Q3 and 4 for '21 at full scale, and testing all through the summer.I would say on the venue part that's really interesting, and we're dealing with Federal, White House to every government body, you can imagine. We're jumping on all of the best practices with all the sports leagues, the commissioners, the teams. So we've got a great task force around what have we got to do with the venue to make you safe. And I just think it's very interesting from our data, the fan's not looking for instant testing or thermometers, although those would be fabulous, and we hope those come fast in terms of 5-minute testing. 85% of fans want to make sure our venues are sanitized, enhanced sanitizers available. That's the bar they need to say it's safe to show up. It's the most important factors. So that's also important. We're working with the local governments on what is our venue prep plan, what's the protocol to make the fans feel safe, well for testing. So making sure we have proper sanitization, hand sanitizers, masks, physical distance, cashless concessions. So we've got a full plan in place. We think those are smart things for the future.Digital ticketing is something we've always been driving for a bunch of reasons, but no better time than ever to have digital ticketing and cashless concessions, part of our access program, we're going to continue to excel. I think that will be one of the real advantages of this crisis.So we think we're well on plan on a global basis to have our venues ready. Now we're just going to go market-by-market with one of these or multiple ideas as the market's ready to test these. And that's our plan for the summer, to keep the business moving.\nKhoa Ngo: Understood. And if I can follow up on that on the pricing side. It does seem like we are moving into a contact-less world going forward. So I'm just wondering, in your latest presentation, you outlined $100 million AOI opportunity. Do you think the current environment allows you to pull that forward in some sort of capacity?\nJoe Berchtold: This is Joe. Yes, we absolutely think the presence only becomes more important. I think that the magnitude of the opportunity holistically becomes even larger because I think our leadership in technology and the breadth at which we can apply it, as Michael said, it's not just contact-less entry, but cashless payments and other forms have great potential. I think the exact timing of it is still TBD with just a pause that we have going on right now, and we can get it -- when we can get it deployed. But no question, the opportunity is larger than ever.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. And I will now turn the call back over to Michael for any closing remarks.\nMichael Rapino: No. Be safe, and we'll talk to you soon. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joe Berchtold",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Before getting into the quarter, I want to give a quick update on our cost and cash management programs, which we launched in March. We previously announced initiatives to cut costs by $500 million this year. And we've surpassed that goal and are now targeting $600 million in cost reductions. We've also expanded our cash management program, which including our cost initiatives, now eliminates or defers $1 billion in cash requirements this year. As a result, we project our monthly operational cost burn rate to be approximately $150 million per month for the second quarter and through the remainder of the year.Now I will walk through the impact of the COVID shutdown on each of our businesses during the first quarter. As we previously indicated, at the end of February, we were headed toward delivering Q1 AOI, in line with last year, approximately $115 million. Instead, with the shutdown, we had 100 -- sorry, instead, with the shutdown, we had a $21 million AOI loss for the quarter. The direct COVID impact in the quarter was approximately $165 million, which was partially offset by approximately $30 million in cost savings during the quarter.Starting with concerts. Our concerts division went from $5 million of AOI in the first quarter of last year to a loss of $88 million this year. Through February, we had promoted 5,500 shows for nearly 8 million fans, up year-on-year by 17% and 2%, respectively. We then ended the quarter with 7,100 shows for 10.4 million fans, down 14% and 30%, respectively, from last year. With 2,100 March shows canceled or rescheduled to a future date, we've lost approximately $40 million of anticipated contribution margin on those shows. Additionally, we had a onetime expense of approximately $25 million for sunk cost for canceled shows, which included the cost of paying show employees for those shows that didn't happen during the second half of March. We had always expected our concerts AOI to be down in Q1 given the show activity level and increased fixed costs of approximately $40 million largely associated with acquisitions made over the last year. But unfortunately, the March shutdown led to a substantially lower AOI.On a separate matter, our OCESA acquisition was approved by Mexico's regulators in April. We've now entered into discussions with CIE and Televisa regarding the timing and terms of the previously announced OCESA transaction. And do not expect to close the transaction until we have greater clarity on the duration of the shutdown in Mexico and its impact on OCESA's business.Next, Ticketmaster. Our ticketing division AOI fell from $100 million in the first quarter last year to $45 million this year. Similar to our concerts division, through February, we were on track for a strong Q1 with fee-bearing GTV up 31% to $3.2 billion. Net of refunds, we then ended the quarter with $3.0 billion in fee-bearing GTV, down 22% from Q1 last year. This drastic reduction in fee-bearing GTV led to an approximately $65 million reduction in contribution margin relative to our February forecast for the business. In addition, we refunded 5.2 million tickets for $432 million of GTV during March. And along with an accrual for future refunds of shows canceled in April, this resulted in a $35 million reduction in contribution margin.To give you a little more color on our refunds through this past weekend, Ticketmaster has had 65,000 shows impacted by the virus. Virtually all canceled shows are currently refunding, and about 80% of rescheduled shows or postponed shows are currently offering refunds. For Live Nation concerts, about 9,000 shows have been impacted. Of those shows, about 20% have canceled and 80% are rescheduling. Again, almost all canceled shows are currently refunding. And over 90% of rescheduled shows are offering refunds with the remaining shows scheduled to be refunding in the near future. And as Michael said, less than 10% of fans are taking the refund for the rescheduled or postponed shows when given the choice with over 90% of them holding on to their tickets for a future date.Finally, sponsorship. Our sponsorship business was the least impacted by the March shutdown, losing less than $5 million in contribution margin as a result, and this quarter delivered $47 million in AOI, up from $40 million in the first quarter last year.Overall, we recognize the next few quarters will not be business as usual, so we won't be giving any direction on key operating metrics until we start selling tickets and promoting concerts again. Our focus is on managing our cost structure and cash burn, ensuring a strong balance sheet as we come out of the shutdown. And with that, I will turn the call over to Kathy. Yes. Sure. David, let's start with where we're at, which is $800-and-something million in available cash, $900-and-something million in untapped debt. So $1.7 billion of available untapped liquidity to start with, and then to the point I made of about $150 million a month of operational cash burn. So that says you can go through this year without doing shows at any scale without any concern. I think it's our expectation that even though likely to not have a huge volume of shows this year, as we get into Q4, you start having the ticket sales in some large scale for shows next year.I think we're already seeing -- obviously, the NFL has their schedule announced today or schedule release today. Most of the teams are going on sale with their tickets over the next day or so. So you're already seeing people going on sale even if the shows aren't happening, and that will drive some of our ticketing and sponsorship businesses. But just as the base case, certainly, getting through this year without any additional liquidity isn't a concern. More broadly, when we look at the markets, I think spreads have come back to more normal levels. The capital markets are absolutely open. Open to us, open to a wide range of folks that are looking for any increased liquidity. We'll watch that opportunistically and see what makes sense to do.And then in terms of your question on deferred revenue, I think that, to us, has never historically been part of how we think about our ongoing operational liquidity. I think in this instance, particularly given the very low level of refunds, as Michael went into, it's just some float that in effect we could tap into if, for short- to medium-term purposes, we had a need for that additional liquidity float. It's not part of our base case scenarios in any means. Yes. Sure. So Drew, some of that we paid in Q1 for some of those puts. And the majority of anything that's still out there that hasn't been paid, we're working to defer out of the year, and that's part of the $1 billion deferral program. So I think you can kind of take all of that together. This is Joe. Yes, we absolutely think the presence only becomes more important. I think that the magnitude of the opportunity holistically becomes even larger because I think our leadership in technology and the breadth at which we can apply it, as Michael said, it's not just contact-less entry, but cashless payments and other forms have great potential. I think the exact timing of it is still TBD with just a pause that we have going on right now, and we can get it -- when we can get it deployed. But no question, the opportunity is larger than ever."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Elizabeth Willard",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon to everyone joining us. I will briefly recap our first quarter results and provide an update on our liquidity position. For the quarter, we generated $1.4 billion in revenue, down 21% compared to last year as the shutdown shows due to COVID-19 reduced our revenue by approximately $435 million, primarily in concerts and also ticketing. Our AOI was a loss of $21 million for the quarter, down $136 million compared to last year driven by approximately $165 million in COVID-related impacts.Our operating loss was $173 million, driven by an estimated $175 million COVID-19 impacts, including $10 million in intangible impairments in the quarter. Net loss for the quarter was $185 million, and net loss per share was $0.94.Now on to our balance sheet and liquidity position. We are actively managing our cash to preserve our strong liquidity position during the stoppage in shows. We have taken quick and aggressive actions to conserve cash, including our cost savings initiatives and cash management program, which eliminates or defers $1 billion in cash outflows for 2020 relative to our budget as Joe outlined. In addition to the $600 million in cost savings, these cash impacts include a reduction in capital expenditures, lower acquisition activity and deferrals of concert and ticketing advances. We now estimate an operational cash burn rate of approximately $150 million per month for the rest of the year, prior to interest expense, debt payments, capital expenditures and other nonoperational items.As of March 31, we had total cash of $3.3 billion, which includes a free cash balance of $817 million. In April, we completed an amendment to our credit agreement, which suspends our net leverage covenant for the second and third quarters of 2020, replaced with a minimum liquidity test for those quarters. Beginning in Q4 of this year, the net leverage covenant will use the bank-defined EBITDA from Q2 and Q3 of 2019 instead of the Q2 and Q3 2020 results. We continue to have a 20% add-back in that EBITDA calculation, which gives us added protection from our COVID-19 impacts during the period. We also added an incremental revolver of $130 million in April, providing us with additional financial and operational flexibility. That now gives us $963 million of available debt capacity between our revolvers and undrawn term loan A. And we will continue to monitor the capital markets for opportunities to expand liquidity at appropriate pricing.Our total cash includes $2 billion of event-related deferred revenue as of March 31. This is part of our operating cash and therefore, provides us additional liquidity. We believe that our free cash balance of $817 million, together with our $963 million of undrawn debt capacity, gives us sufficient liquidity to maintain critical operations for the remainder of the year, even in the extreme scenario that no major shows play off this year.As of the end of the quarter, our total net debt position was $3.7 billion, with a weighted average cost of 3.9%. We expect to be in compliance with our debt covenants around our corporate debt structure for all of 2020. Total capital expenditures for the quarter were $74 million. We are now estimating our full year CapEx to be approximately $200 million, down from our initial estimate at the beginning of the year of $375 million as part of our overall cash flow improvement process. Of the remaining $126 million in CapEx for the year, approximately $50 million is for capitalized labor in our ticketing segment, which we continue to rely on for our ticketing operations, with the remainder largely venue-related long-term projects. We will continue to evaluate all projects as the year progresses, particularly as we gain more insight into opening time lines by region.With that, we'll open it up to questions. Operator? And on the accrued liability AP part of that question, I mean, think about, yes, it's obviously built into cash burn. It's also part of when you think about what we're deferring, when we talk about deferring part of our cash, the $1 billion. There will be liabilities that will be sitting there that are accrued that just won't be paid for a while. Yes. I think the two main things, Brandon, would be, yes, you're assuming no material concert activity. But as Joe said, still expecting some ticket sale activity this year and related sponsorship for that. So based on those things, we obviously will not break our covenants based on projections. But I think the other big thing is that 20% because you can take 20% of that bank EBITDA as an add-back for the COVID impacts. And so you can do that for your AOI in the same way and get pretty close. Yes. So mainly, that's going to be artist advances. And so the best way to think about that is it's an offset to the deferred revenue. So we -- on that free cash, we're deducting off our event-related deferred revenue. And the add-back basically says we're not going to have to pay the artist part of that money because we've already advanced it to them. So it's a good way to net out what really is deferred revenue that might be going out other than our profit. Right."

            "content": "Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I hope that everyone out there is healthy and safe. On our last call, we were on track for tremendous growth across all our businesses, with both fan demand and artists touring increasing on a global basis. Then in mid-March, we came to a halt. We have held no concerts in almost 2 months. Despite these challenging times, we continue to have full confidence in the long-term supply and demand of the live concert industry, Live Nation's leadership position and our business model's ability to successfully deliver AOI growth and shareholder value. With that context, let me update you on our top priorities at this point.Our top priority is to ensure the health and safety of our employees, fans and artists. Like most of the world, we have been working remotely since mid-March, and we will return to work only after there is clear consensus that it is safe to do so, and then in appropriate numbers with expanding cleaning and social distancing protocols. Similarly, we recognize the experience that our venues will change when concerts start back up. And we're working with medical experts and public health officials on procedures to keep people safe while enjoying our shows.When we asked over 8,000 fans across North America about the requirements for returning to shows, they had 2 clear priorities, with 85% of fans stating they want increased cleaning and sanitizing of the venues and ready access to hand sanitizing stations, while no other action received more than 40%. In addition, we expect to have additional safety protocols in place, potentially including reduced capacity, touchless concessions and creative ways to apply our digital ticketing technology.Our next priority is planning for the reopening of concerts when the time is right. First and foremost, we will let the facts and science tell us when we should start putting on concerts again. We are working with government at federal and state levels in the U.S. and across all markets in building plans that fit with their reopening phases. In the meantime, we have fortified our balance sheet to have the resources to ramp up quickly when the time is right.We know from fans that demand will be there when the shows return. Globally, over 90% of fans are holding on to their tickets for rescheduled shows when refunds are available. That's the clearest demonstration of pent-up demand that will enable us to quickly start concerts back up.Looking a bit farther out, given that 80% of shows are rescheduled rather than canceled, and as noted, almost all fans are holding on to their tickets, we believe 2021 can return to show volume and fan attendance at levels consistent with what we've seen in recent years.As we plan the resumption of concerts, we're also seeing a number of innovations within our company as artists look to stay connected to fans. Almost 1 million fans have come to our Live at Home site to find virtual tours and acoustic performances from their home. And millions of fans in over 100 different countries have joined Insomniac's Virtual Rave-a-Thons, while drive-in concerts are finding a new purpose to socially-distant concert halls. Throughout all this, we are still motivated by the long-term potential of global live events. It's in the DNA of us to want to gather, socialize and celebrate. And as we provide assurances on health and safety at the venue, we expect our business to build back.Live Nation is in the best position in the live ecosystem to play long and to capture new opportunities, continue leading the industry into the future. I'll now hand the call over to Kathy and Joe, who will provide additional full details on our balance sheet. Thanks, David. We're looking at all this data ongoing as we're trying to understand and make sure we're looking at a global basis of our consumers and any long-term effects. It was important, we want to make sure we got one of our surveys online today because I think the general surveys aren't always useful, but we went and talk to 10,000 of casual and ongoing ticket buyers around the world. And the data's pretty compelling. I mean 90% of fans are saying, \"I can't wait to get back to the show.\" I think our refund rate says everything. Anyone that has any view that says, will they come back? Will the consumer change behavior? We're running somewhere between a 5% and 10% refund rate right now on a global basis, much lower in Europe.Those aren't out of line with when we reschedule just a traditional tour for different reasons. So 90% of fans in today's environment saying, \"I'm going to hold on to those tickets because I can't wait to see the show,\" I think it's probably the most compelling data one could look at that says the consumer is going to come back strong. It's a big part of their old social DNA to get out and gather and communal experiences with their friends and family.So we don't debate that consumers nor artists will be back on the road from a supply/demand -- I mean, since the early days, people have been gathering around artists. And we think long after we're dead, people will gather around artists. It's a communal primal need. We're just not debating on what month we start that back. So we don't think we have any consumer trends that worry us. This -- there was no acceleration in our industry of a decline. If anything, we were having a global acceleration as emerging markets were becoming more sophisticated and opening up to the traditional concert. So we see that on a global basis that the show will be back. It'll be back as big as ever from a consumer demand.And the second part of our equation that is really unique is the supply. We have all these artists who really look to go on the road for financial and to bond with their fans and build long-term franchises. And talking to those artists on a daily basis, they are waiting to get back on the road when it's safe for them and their fans. So supply/demand dynamics, I think we have a unique situation in the sense of fans are -- cherish those 2 hours when they get on the road and see their favorite performers. The artists want to get back out. Now we're just going to make sure we play the science, and when can we get out there on a safe manner on a scale basis. But we think demand in '21 and onward will be as big as it was in '20 -- or in '19. Joe? Thank you. Yes, you're right. We have a lot of shows. I mean again, the glass half full here. Thankfully, our show is not time-dependent. So you feel for any other event companies where if you missed the final 4, you can't replay that. So the great advantage we have is it's just now timing. The fan wants to see Billie Eilish. They would have liked to see them in March, but they'll wait until October or they'll wait until February. The average customer goes to 2.5 shows a year. So these are the Kodak moments, and they'll wait for them.So you're right. We're going to -- we're dealing right now as an industry, as a whole, I'd say, like most probably industries. The industry has never come together this well from the agents, the artists, the buildings, the managers, the promoters, we're all in the same boat. So we're all looking to say, how do we move availabilities. Really, the only challenge we've had with availabilities in terms of a little bit of the -- why we had to hang on to the refund strategy is the sports lakes. They're kind of the ones -- we need to understand what's going to happen in the fall time in their arenas, and what availability is and when is the season going to start. Traditionally, the NFL, and the NBA, NHL announce their season, and then we kind of know the next Q4, Q1, Q2 availabilities. That would really be our only gating issue. As soon as they get their exact schedules up, then we'll be able to slot all the dates in.As an industry, we have a great model right now that if you have a current date that was planned, you will get first holds to get that back on the road. And if you're a new tour that was going to tour in '21, you're probably moving that to later in '21 or into '22. So we've talked about it. We think we'll have a very robust '21 backend and really, really robust backend '21, '22. But working together with the industry, we see no issues in moving all of these dates into '21, just waiting on some scheduling conflicts. Thanks, Brandon. As I referred to, as an industry, it's been a unique time where we are all in this together. And I would say that the artists, the agents, the managers have been incredibly supportive. The reality that in '20 and '21, the promoter can't take all the risk on the business as we historically have. We need to share some of that, especially refunds on the guarantees. So I would say to you that we don't want to out loud get into how and what the deals are. I would say to you though that we absolutely are getting great latitude from the artists and agents to look at a traditional business of high guarantees and all of our risk, to help share that risk into '20 and 21, to get the shows back on the road and help us absorb the show, but not take all of the refund sales, sponsorship, food and beverage unknowns for the next 6 to 12 months. They're helping sharing some of that risk which will provide us great opportunity to get back, scale fast, but not have to worry about losing money on the show. Yes, I think any CEO, any business operator, it's the great gift of this reality we're in. We're all looking at our business and wondering, now that we have been able to stop, catch our breath and look at our business, are we running the most efficient way we can? How do we restructure our business, our cost basis on a global basis to be more efficient? We have gone into furloughs and cost reductions, as you know. We absolutely plan on coming out of this a leaner machine, much more efficient on how we go to market.And then probably as other companies have learned, there are some areas we're going to have to spend and acquire a better skill set at, to help us diversify our core business in terms of virtual concerts and other things that we've dabbled in, but maybe we got to spend a bit more time in that area. So bottom line is we look at this as a great opportunity on a global basis for us to restructure our cost basis, come out a leaner organization while still as aggressive as ever in terms of our global growth strategy. Yes. We're going to -- we've had a long relationship with OCESA and a great relationship helping them on the tour business as they build their business. And we have talked to them about it in the last couple of weeks. It's taken a while to get the government approvals. It happens -- and now in Mexico. But we were -- as you would expect, my line to them has been, we are, long term, still bullish on their business and ours. We want to be in business with OCESA and get the deal done.But we're not sure where Mexico stands. And I'm not looking to take on any losses from Mexico while they're going through their 6 or 8 months of business downturn, will they come up the other side. So ideally, we want to get the deal done. We want to delay the cash payment of the deal until we both know how and when we're on the other side of this crisis. So that's the intent. Yes. Joe, you've been working on that. But I would add to it. The spirit of it, it's been great. As you can imagine, if you're a partner in a festival, and the festival got canceled, and you happen to have a put up in your deal, we're talking to them about let's delay the put for the year because the event didn't happen and we didn't retain the cash. So we've been very cooperative with our partners. And some of them may need the cash for other reasons, but generally, the partnerships have been very accommodating if their event got moved. Thank you. Yes. Well, one of the things I always remind people on 2 fronts is our global diversity is our greatest strength. It always has been. Wherever there's been challenges, there's been markets of opportunity. So the 2 things to remember about our business, unlike sports or NFL where it's stadiums or nothing, is we have a very diverse size of shows. We did 15,000 club and theater shows last year, and we did them in 40 countries. So we'll look in the next 6 months, but we'll be kind of starting slow and small, focusing on the basics, kind of testing regionally. But it will be about whether it's in Arkansas or a state that is safe, secure and politically is fine to proceed in, we're going to dabble in fan-less concerts with broadcast. We're going to go and reduce capacity shows because we can make the math work.There are a lot of great artists that maybe they can sell an arena out, but they'll do 10 higher-end smaller theaters or clubs. We're seeing lots of artists jumping to get back out when it's safe. So you're going to see us in different countries, whether it's Finland, whether it's Asia, Hong Kong, certain markets are farther ahead. And we kind of look at it as over the next -- over the summer period, there'll be testing happening, whether it's some fan-less concerts, which are really important for our sponsorship business, all the ways we can create great properties to keep all of our sponsors who have been amazing and sticking with us this year. So it's important for us to keep doing drive-in concerts. We're going to test and roll out, which we're having some success with, fan-less concerts, which have great broadcast opportunities; reduce capacity of festival concerts where it could be outdoors, could be in a theater, it could be in a large stadium floor, where there's enough room to be safe.So we have all of these plans in place depending on the market and where the -- that local city may sit in their reopening phases. So we want to be smart. We don't want to rush. We're playing long ball. One of the realities is we and AEG are the 2 companies that can withstand this storm as long as it plays. And we're going to play for the long safety of business. So we're not looking to rush and provoke any new spread of the virus. We want to do it smart with local participation. But there's lots of great opportunities that are arising now where we will get to test over the summer period.And again, I remind you, those are important for my sponsorship business as well as testing the feel on some new ideas we have. We think the fall time, if a lot of those things happen and don't cause any second hot spots, that you'll see markets around the world. Europe specifically has talked about September opening up 5,000-plus. So I think you'll see the fall time more experimental and more shows happening in more of a theater setting and into some arenas. And then our goal is really to be on sale in Q3 and 4 for '21 at full scale, and testing all through the summer.I would say on the venue part that's really interesting, and we're dealing with Federal, White House to every government body, you can imagine. We're jumping on all of the best practices with all the sports leagues, the commissioners, the teams. So we've got a great task force around what have we got to do with the venue to make you safe. And I just think it's very interesting from our data, the fan's not looking for instant testing or thermometers, although those would be fabulous, and we hope those come fast in terms of 5-minute testing. 85% of fans want to make sure our venues are sanitized, enhanced sanitizers available. That's the bar they need to say it's safe to show up. It's the most important factors. So that's also important. We're working with the local governments on what is our venue prep plan, what's the protocol to make the fans feel safe, well for testing. So making sure we have proper sanitization, hand sanitizers, masks, physical distance, cashless concessions. So we've got a full plan in place. We think those are smart things for the future.Digital ticketing is something we've always been driving for a bunch of reasons, but no better time than ever to have digital ticketing and cashless concessions, part of our access program, we're going to continue to excel. I think that will be one of the real advantages of this crisis.So we think we're well on plan on a global basis to have our venues ready. Now we're just going to go market-by-market with one of these or multiple ideas as the market's ready to test these. And that's our plan for the summer, to keep the business moving. No. Be safe, and we'll talk to you soon. Thank you."

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir.\nMichael Rapino: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. The past two years have only reinforced the power of live music, and it\u2019s been great to see artists and fans reconnecting at scale around the world. Over the course of 2021, we saw the strength of live events. The year started in the midst of the pandemic, but by summer fans were returning to shows, and by the end of the year, we had a record pipeline of concerts, ticket sales and advertising commitments for 2022. Restarting our concerts business in the second half of the year, we put over 17,000 concerts for 35 million fans in 2021, mainly in the U.S. and UK markets. In the final five months of the year, in the U.S. and UK, we had over 15 million fans attend our outdoor events: festivals, stadiums, and amphitheaters, nearly 25% higher than during the same period in 2019. Through the ramp up, we saw demand driven price increases, particularly with platinum and other front of the house ticket pricing. Fans continue to seek the best tickets, and the ongoing rapid growth of the secondary market indicates there\u2019s more room to grow. Fans on-site also continued spending more, with average per fan revenue up double digits for the year relative to 2019 levels, across each of amphitheaters, festivals, theaters and clubs. And as shows came back, so did the desire of brands to connect to our fans. As a result, sponsorship and advertising AOI was roughly the same for the second half of 2021 as it was in 2019, which was a record level. This interest came from a mix of expanding long-term relationships with brands such as Bacardi, Heineken and O2, as well as adding new partners, including Coinbase, Hulu and Cinch. Our ticketing business had the dual benefit of strong ticket sales for events in 2021, while also being the first of our businesses to benefit from our 2022 pipeline. Ticket sales were at a record pace across every metric with October, November and December being our top three months ever for ticketing GTV, excluding refunds. And the fourth quarter and second half of the year also set records for a quarter and six-month period. At the same time, we continued to reorganize our business globally and improve our operations, establishing a more nimble and lower cost company. Looking to 2022 and beyond, with the strength in ticket sales, not surprisingly, we are seeing every leading indicator for 2022 up relative to 2019, reinforcing our confidence that we will have a record year in 2022 that sets us up for growth over the next several years. Helping accelerate our growth this year is the acquisition of OCESA, which gives us immediate scale in Mexico and establishes another path into a broader Latin American market. Looking at the leading indicators, starting with show count through February, we are up 30% relative to 2019 across our large venue shows, for stadium, amphitheater, arena and festivals. Ticket sales through mid-February, we have sold 45 million tickets for shows this year, up 45% from 2019. We already have eight artists selling over 500,000 tickets for tours this year, including Bad Bunny, Dua Lipa and Billie Eilish. And fans are coming to the shows, our most recent data over the past month indicates no-show rates at our concerts in the U.S. are back to 2019 levels, eliminating any lingering questions on the resilience of fan demand. Along with our fan growth, we continue building the portfolio of venues we operate, now at 320 globally, as we net added 31 additional venues in 2021, approximately half of which came through the OCESA acquisition. Building our venue portfolio enables us to more rapidly grow our show count and fan base in 2022, and over the next few years, and positions us to drive on-site spending more widely while also providing additional assets to brand partners. Our sponsorship and advertising pipeline is similarly set for a strong 2022, up double digits through mid-February relative to 2019, with 80% of our planned revenue for the year committed. Taking this strong activity pipeline and combining it with our more efficient cost structure, I expect 2022 to deliver record financial performance overall for each division. The two-year wait for artists and fans is over. Never have the tailwinds to our business been so strong, and I believe this is just the start of what will be the strongest multi-year period for the concert industry. With that I will let Joe take you through more details on our results.\nJoe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Given the unique seasonality we experienced last year, I\u2019ll provide an overview of our annual results, but also give some specifics on the fourth quarter as we believe that is a better indicator of what lies ahead for 2022 and beyond. Overall, our AOI of $324 million for the year was $1.3 billion better than 2020, led by an improvement of $800 million in ticketing, over $400 million in concerts and $150 million in sponsorship. For the fourth quarter, we delivered AOI of $160 million, led by a record quarterly AOI results in ticketing and strong performance in sponsorship. On the balance sheet, we ended the year with $1.5 billion in free cash and $2.3 billion in event-related deferred revenue. This deferred revenue is almost twice the level of Q4 2019, giving us one of several leading indicators for how strong 2022 is lucky. Let me give a bit more color on each division and then I will give you more on the 2022 leading indicators. First, in concerts, we had 16 million fans attend 9,300 events in the quarter, continuing to be led by the U.S. and the UK, which accounted for almost 90% of these fans. The strength of fan spending we discussed in Q3 continued through Q4, with consistent increases in ticket pricing and average per fan spending. Concert ticket pricing was up 11% overall for the year relative to 2019 14% in North America. As demand in many major venue types: amphitheaters, stadiums and festivals showed strong increases as we put more tickets in market-based platinum and VIP pricing offers. Similarly, average fan spending at our amphitheaters ended up in line with last quarter\u2019s commentary at $37 for the year, up 25% from 2019. While this was helped by fewer promotions, it was largely driven by higher purchases. His average fan spending increased across the Board from food and beverage, ticket add-ons, VIP and parking. For our major festivals, average spending per fan also rose double digits, largely as a result of higher food and beverage in VIP sale. Finally, as we also noted last quarter, operating costs per fan were up due to lower operating scale from fewer shows per venue, along with labor cost increases. But overall, our contribution margin per fan was up double digits as pricing on-site spending another revenue more than covered any incremental costs. Next sponsorship, largely followed concerts returned to activity over the course of the year and into the fourth quarter. As a result, 2021 sponsorship and advertising AOI of $242 million was about two-thirds of 2019 levels, while Q4 AOI of $115 million was 39% higher in 2019 Q4. This strength comes across on-site and online, as both parts of the business delivered record Q4 AOI. Again, our large festivals were a standout performer, increasing sponsorship revenue per fan by over 10% versus the same festivals in 2019. Finally, ticketing was clearly the star of the quarter, delivering $212 million of AOI, which surpassed its previous best quarter Q3 of this year by over 20% and was 60% higher than Q4 2019, which was our previous best Q4. Ticketing success was across the Board. Let me give you a few key statistics for the quarter. Transacted ticket volume, excluding refunds, were 65 million tickets, coming in even higher than Q4 2019. Transacted ticketing GTV, excluding refunds, was $6.6 billion, 20% higher than Q4 2019. This was driven by concerts and sporting events, whose GTV were up 22% and 55%, respectively. Price increases help drive the GTV levels, with average ticket prices up 17% for the fourth quarter relative to Q4 2019, in concerts and sporting event, ticketing, pricing, each app approximately 20%. Our growth came from both primary and secondary ticketing, with transacted GTV, excluding refunds, up 16% and 49%, respectively. And we added 17 million net new fee-bearing tickets from new clients to the marketplace in 2021, with most of that inventory coming online this year. And finally, our ongoing cost management help drive ticketing into Q4 results operating at substantially lower fixed costs in Q4 2019, as we both structurally reduced costs and also held the line on other costs being added back until we saw ticket sales fully return. As we look to 2022, first OCESA will benefit full year results as Mexico seen live events starting to return. Most notably their contribution will flow through our sponsorship and ticketing division. Looking at our leading indicators through mid-February 1, confirmed large venue show bookings were up 30% overall and double digits for each amphitheaters, arenas, stadiums and festivals. Second, we have sold 45 million tickets for concerts this year, up 45% from this point in 2019. While it\u2019s too early to have much data on ticket pricing, early indicators continue to show the inelasticity of demand for the best tickets. Looking at our top 10 concert tours this year versus this point in 2019, average pricing is up over 20% as our average platinum allocation has increased substantially. And looking at secondary ticketing demand in Ticketmaster, five of their top 10 highest demand events ever have taken place in 2022, signaling that secondary markets continue to grow even faster than primary tickets. On the sponsorship side, commitments are up double digits from this point in 2019 prior to including OCESA. And overall, we have more than 80% of our planned sponsorship net revenue for 2022 already committed. A few other 2022 points, we continue to maintain a lower cost structure, and this takes into account labor cost increases within our perimeter as at the start of 2020. But obviously, adding new businesses, including OCESA, will come with additional fixed costs. And from a seasonality standpoint, we\u2019re going to be even more Q2 and Q3-driven this year than usual. Q1 activities historically very arena-driven with limited outdoor activity. And as we plan the arena tours for this year, we had most of them starting Q2 instead of Q1 to give the international markets time to fully open. It appears we plan that correctly, we continue to be on track with those plans, and certainly the leading indicators suggests the full year will be at record fan levels, but with somewhat lower concert activity this Q1 versus 2019. In anticipation of the growth opportunities ahead of us this year, we expect 2022 capital expenditures to be approximately $375 million, with two-thirds of this spent on revenue-generating projects. In addition, we ended 2021 with $2.1 billion of available liquidity between free cash and untapped revolver capacity, giving us sufficient flexibility to invest in growth. We are comfortable with our current leverage, and we\u2019ll continue to reevaluate our balance sheet on an ongoing basis. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will be conducting our question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please state your question.\nDavid Karnovsky: Hey, thank you. Some of forward commentary wrote 45% increase in ticket sold versus 30% increase in large venue supply. I\u2019m wondering to understand more of what you\u2019re seeing on the demand side, given your own customer data, the average concert goers buying more shows than they were buying earlier. Are you seeing more first-time concert goers, any additional you could provide would be great?\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah, this is Joe. We\u2019re certainly seeing them buy earlier. We\u2019re seeing these numbers benefit from the pent-up supply and the pent-up demand that exists out in the marketplace. I think given that we\u2019re just getting going, it\u2019s probably too early to call whether they\u2019re going to multiple concerts more likely, I think, we\u2019re going to have to play through the year and see more data before we can really make that determination.\nDavid Karnovsky: Okay. And then you told the assessment for a few months now, would just be interested to hear any update on how you view the asset in terms of revenue synergies or how maybe their cost structure looks relative to when you first executed the deal in 2019? And then could you provide an update on how we should think about the Mexico market ramp-up?\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah, I think we continue to be very excited by assessment. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time with their team. We do think the top line opportunities are exactly as we\u2019ve been laying out. First, we have the opportunity to bring more of our terrain through Mexico was a natural part of our terrain activities. And then second, because of their great strength with LatinX, which are red hot right now, more opportunities to build our market share in the Latin business and bring those into not just Mexico, but in the U.S. So we\u2019re excited about that top line opportunity. They\u2019re getting going as we get into Q2, they\u2019ll get going first with festivals, and then ramp-up the touring business. We expect them to have a very good year, this year. Again, the way they\u2019re structured, their economics really flow through \u2013 their \u2013 if you look at them, their sponsorship and their ticketing divisions, but we expect them to have a very solid year.\nDavid Karnovsky: And anything on the cost side, I mean, you see on their commentary sort of indicated taking out a lot of expenses during the pandemic as well. I wasn\u2019t sure if we should be thinking of the kind of AOI structure that business is different than maybe it exists to pre-pandemic?\nJoe Berchtold: I think it\u2019s probably premature to change your cost structure assumptions with them. As we further integrate Ticketmaster, I would expect that and as we get the concert machine more finely tuned that expected, but it\u2019s \u2013 the first focus is driving the top line. if we get the top line right, that business will do great, and then we\u2019ll follow with costs. We\u2019re not going to start with cost because you can\u2019t pick it \u2013 you can\u2019t catch up this year.\nMichael Rapino: And it\u2019s Michael stepping in. And also, we know this company very well. Alex , the CEO is a professional. You don\u2019t get to be the third largest promoter in the world without being kind of an all round good businessman and operator. So he runs an incredible good business. But yes, like myself and our team through COVID, he was able to dig in and decide what\u2019s \u2013 where\u2019s some rust and some bureaucracy? And how can we streamline some of the business? So like us, I would expect him to hold on to some cost savings and run more efficient, regardless of the merger. And we think now together, we\u2019ve already started the process of how do we elevate the ticket business? How do we upgrade the software? How do we introduce secondary? How do we excel the hospitality and sponsorship business? So I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some cost savings, but we\u2019re more excited about, as Joe said, we think we can bring another gear to his already well-run machine.\nDavid Karnovsky: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.\nStephen Laszczyk: Great, thank you. I wanted to ask a little bit more about international and maybe from Michael, could you give us an update on when you expect concerts to resume at scale across your global footprint? I know you laid out a timeline late last year. But I was curious if that changed at all, given the latest COVID wave? And then if all that goes according to plan, how do you expect your international business in 2022 will compare to 2020 \u2013 2019?\nMichael Rapino: You know, and I will preface here. We have our Investor Day tomorrow. So we\u2019re going to dig into all of these topics probably in much more detail. So if we\u2019re a little shorter tonight, just expect us tomorrow, you\u2019ll have a much more opportunity to dig into all of these levers. International, it looks like everything is opening up fast and we see a full summer/spring business across the globe. Australia and New Zealand have only been \u2013 has been the only real I would say slower some of the Pacific Rim a little slower in some of the markets, China, Japan. But for our business, we think most of the business across Europe, international, South America, we start Coldplay March 18 in Costa Rica going down to Latin America. We believe most of our big Lollapalooza is in South America in March and April will happen. And all of our summer festivals in Europe are scheduled to happen. So it looks like 70% to 80% of the business around the world will be open, little bit of Pacific Rim might have some delays.\nStephen Laszczyk: Got it. Thanks for that. And then just one on sponsorship and advertising. Could you maybe give us an idea on what the remaining inventory in 2022 looks like? Is it inventory from earlier in the year, later in the year? What types of tours are formats? And then I know some of your sponsorship and advertising relationships can be multi-year in nature. Is there anything you can tell us about how the funnel shaping up for 2023 and beyond?\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah, in terms of remaining inventory, as you know, a lot of our inventory is what we create and what our sponsorship team has the ability to come up with ideas for how we expand into new categories, and how we take existing categories and break them down in pieces. So we don\u2019t feel generally speaking inventory constrained. The team is often working on a variety of areas, fintech and others that we think can steer still deliver a lot this year and into next year. As Michael said, we\u2019ll get more into that tomorrow. But we still think there\u2019s a great runway in that business. And as you also noted, a lot of these deals are multi-year. So as we establish a new baseline this year, we just have the opportunity to keep growing from that next year and beyond.\nStephen Laszczyk: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Ross: Yeah. Thank you, guys. So ticket pricing for the top 10 tours you said was up, I think, 20% over 2019, and we definitely took notice when you use the word inelasticity in your prepared remarks. Platinum is obviously a big part of what you\u2019re doing there. Can you frame where you are in unlocking tailwinds from Platinum tickets specifically? What percentage of major artists are you using it? And how much further impact do you see platinum having over time?\nJoe Berchtold: Well, I think, again, Brandon, you\u2019ll be there tomorrow. Well I think you just have to look at the size of the prize right now. I mean, if you look at it, just from a secondary perspective, how much unrealized underpriced are the tickets, unrealized pricing opportunity, if you want to call it. So I would say right now, Platinum is adopting a great tool to get a higher ticket price, but we still have very low penetration across a global business, huge upside still.\nBrandon Ross: Okay. And then there have been a lot of reports about insurance rates going up, especially because of COVID and the Travis Scott incident, et cetera. Can you comment on how impactful you expect that to be to your cost structure this year and going forward?\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah, this is Joe. We see what everybody else sees, which is yes, insurance costs going up. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s material to the business overall. I think we\u2019re in a good position as it relates to inflation more broadly. If you look at inflation of inputs versus your ability to price on the outputs, I think, we\u2019re in a very good position that while you have some price pressures on your inputs, whether it\u2019s insurance or labor. We have, for your first question, a much greater level of pricing ability on the outside, which led us as we talked about, use the same logic as we had last summer at the amps, still drove CM per fan up double digits. So we\u2019re watching every cost is everybody else\u2019s, we understand which ones are movie where, and we\u2019re just figuring out how we make sure we\u2019re pricing overall to to keep our AOI.\nBrandon Ross: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavid Katz: Evening, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just two interesting things I wanted to go back to and hope you could elaborate on. One is, you talked about the lower cost structure and you said that, I think, Joe, that it includes some labor cost increases. Can you just elaborate a bit more on what kinds of labor costs those is \u2013 and those are and where they are from in magnitude, et cetera?\nJoe Berchtold: Sure. We like every business. I\u2019ve seen employees are demanding some higher wages as you\u2019ve come back from COVID. And as we built our cost \u2013 structural cost savings, we knew that was going to be the case. And we built that in and we talked in the past about the levels of those cost savings. So I just rather than get into every quarter trying to reconcile for you guys, well, how does your cost of living adjustment this year impact your structural savings? I want to make it clear we\u2019re delivering those savings, having expected that there was going to be some labor cost increases as we were going through, no different for us than anybody else.\nDavid Katz: Understood. And the second issue I wanted to touch on is I think you mentioned that the secondary ticket market is going faster than primary. I\u2019m curious, what\u2019s driving that and what order of magnitude there as well?\nJoe Berchtold: Well, yeah, it\u2019s the same point as what Brandon asked about. It\u2019s the inelasticity of demand for the best tickets, plus the general overall desire for fans to get back to live events. So if they didn\u2019t buy a ticket for the sporting event, or for the concert, they missed out, they\u2019re buying it on secondary, and they\u2019re paying whatever it takes on those best tickets to get in. So as we strive on the primary to be pricing it such that to bring the dollars back the content to the artists, so we think deserve every dollar for their performance. We\u2019re doing that through platinum and through other tools. As we do that, secondary continues to grow rapidly. We\u2019re not shrinking secondary yet. So we have the opportunity to continue to move pricing and primary as I was talking about earlier, while looking at secondary and figuring out how far do we go.\nDavid Katz: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Glagola with Cowen. Please state your question.\nStephen Glagola: Hi, thanks for the question. There\u2019s been some reports that the industry has been recently seen 20% no-show rates at concerts. And you noted in your prepared remarks and no-show rates that Live Nation promoted concerts in the U.S. are back to 2019 levels. Just want to ask like what are those levels if you can pinpoint it? And can you reconcile maybe if there is a divergence between what you\u2019re seeing and what the industry is seeing, and how no-show rates are trending internationally? Thanks.\nJoe Berchtold: So let me give you some facts on that. Thanks for that question. Because I think there\u2019s been a lot of reporting by anecdote out there, as opposed to reporting by collective facts. And I don\u2019t think our experience is any different than the industry is, as a total. I think that on occasion, you have aberrations for a variety of reasons. But just to give you a macro feel, I\u2019ll give you the \u2013 for first of all, arenas in 2019, if you look at the number of people that showed up for a concert versus the number of people that bought tickets, it ran at 93% in 2019. That number thus far, in 2022, over the past six weeks is running at 91%. So not materially different from the 93% for the total of 2019. For our theaters and clubs, the smaller shows, you tend to have a slightly higher no-show rate. And that number was 87% in 2019. It\u2019s running at 83% in 2022. So I think if you first of all recognize that there were a number of shows that have taken place over the past few months that were rescheduled, and when shows get rescheduled, people will naturally forget about the show or have a conflict different than what they originally had. It\u2019s probable that accounts for all or almost all of that difference in the attendance level. So we don\u2019t think that reporting is at all accurate.\nStephen Glagola: Appreciate the color, Joe. And can you just provide\u2026\nMichael Rapino: Just had that color that I remember reading those articles, they dramatize, I think they were saying as 15%, 20% weren\u2019t showing, but again, they weren\u2019t taking into account that on a normal year, 7%, 8% of people don\u2019t show up to shows. So you\u2019re already starting at that level. So if you look at what our current data says, we\u2019re basically back to 2019 levels and people are showing up at the same rates are not showing up in that 7% to 8%. The history has always kind of shown.\nStephen Glagola: Thanks, Michael. And can you guys just provide on Q4 concerts, the AOI margin was a little bit, the loss I think was a little wider and some expectations. I know you have \u2013 I think you have advertising dollars that flowed through there. But can you maybe just any comments on that, which drove that? And then how should we think about Q4 and I know it\u2019s far away, but 2022 as well as that could be just similar cadence of losses in that quarter for concerts?\nJoe Berchtold: I mean, I think if you look at Q4 versus 2019, you \u2013 Q4 is generally a loss. It\u2019s a lower activity quarter. You have, as you noted, prepaid advertising running through. If you look at our fan base in 2021 versus 2019, Q4 back that off. It\u2019s not surprising, you\u2019re still carrying your fixed cost plus you have your end advertising all against the lower volume.\nStephen Glagola: All right, Thanks, Joe, and looking forward to the Investor Day Tomorrow.\nJoe Berchtold: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks. Good afternoon. I had a couple of questions. First, Michael, I also noticed you mentioned the secondary market growing faster than primary a couple of times in your prepared remarks. And I was thinking of Ticketmaster as the clear market leader in primary and I know you\u2019re in secondary, but I \u2013 maybe I just don\u2019t think about Ticketmaster as the leading, is particularly focused on the secondary market. I\u2019m wondering if you could just talk about whether you see that accurately as I described it, or if you think you \u2013 there\u2019s anything you would change in the strategy for that business going forward, given what we\u2019re seeing in secondary, I noticed Joe also mentioned, we haven\u2019t seen the secondary shrink yet. So maybe that\u2019s tells me the answer. But I\u2019m just wondering if you guys are pivoting at all, as you think about the growth of those two parts of the ticketing business, because it does seem like secondary is quite robust?\nMichael Rapino: Yeah, I would \u2013 we\u2019ll get into this tomorrow, again, in our slides, but we have the two sides of the equation here, right? Ultimately, long-term. I don\u2019t think secondary is a great business, because I believe content will figure out how to price it better. So on the concert side, we\u2019re waking up every day, our goal isn\u2019t to increase secondary sales, it\u2019s to increase the gross for the artists in the show. That\u2019s why we talked about platinum and VIP and better analysis for the artist to capture more of the dollars. So \u2013 and we\u2019ve seen that over the last 5, 10 years, every year, the artist is capturing more of it. Now that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s an efficient market yet. It\u2019s going to take some more time for the artist to be more comfortable charging those prices where the market is affected, but it\u2019s happening you see it over time. And then 5, 10 years from now, if you are an artist manager, you wouldn\u2019t want to be waking up seeing lots of secondary tickets for your artists captured outside of your bundle. So our job mostly is to figure out how to get all of that secondary into the primary bucket for the artist. So they make the dollars and then we, obviously, that fires our flywheel. But the reality is, it\u2019s not an efficient market yet. And most of secondary is really in the sports business. So when we talk about the ticket side growing, we were never in secondary, as you said, when we took this business over. We integrated it, we built it, and we \u2013 and then we ramped it up fast for all of our sports clients. So we\u2019re the official secondary of the NFL, the NBA of the NHL, and others. And we have been able to grow that business over the last few years, fairly well in the sports business where most of the dollars are. So that business though, again, continues to be a business where the sports teams are getting more and more dollars directly. The NBA, the NFL are all looking at ways to capture the secondary for the team and/or for the league. So we think it\u2019s a business right now that is in transition, lots of dollars outside of the content. We think long-term content captures more of it. But we\u2019re also going to be part of that marketplace that if a fan or somebody wants to trade and sell their tickets, then we want to make sure we\u2019re part of that vertical solution at our marketplace.\nBen Swinburne: Got it. That makes sense. And then just wanted to go back to the forward bookings, numbers and leading indicators you guys talked about the 45% and the 30%. We heard some stats at least directionally similar on NSGs call, and I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a timing element to this. Just should we be extrapolating those into full year growth rates? Or are we seeing some activity happening sooner because we\u2019re still sort of dealing with the pandemic hangover or the pandemic? And so concerts are filling up the calendar sooner and going on sale sooner. I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any sort of caveat you\u2019d want to give us to think about translating those into a forecast? That makes sense?\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah, I certainly don\u2019t think of it as a caveat. But unquestionably, you\u2019ve got a timing advantage this year, you\u2019ve got a benefit from some shows that moved and you have a timing in general of a wide open market that we put shows on sale earlier. But that said, we look at all of that and we continue to see every indicator well up. So we think it\u2019ll plateau or normalize some, but it\u2019s still looking to be a very strong high growth relative to 2019.\nBen Swinburne: Yep, makes sense. Thanks, guys.\nJoe Berchtold: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Sundby with William Blair. Please go ahead with your question.\nRyan Sundby: Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. Just wanted to follow-up on the 25% growth in the U.S. and UK fan base over the last five months. Are there any comparison issues there we should think through in terms of maybe show count or, or mix of festivals that got moved around? We set a pretty apples-to-apples comparison.\nRyan Sundby: Yeah, so just to be fair, that was the outdoor activity over the last five months of last year. So stadiums, amphitheaters and festivals, there was definitely some benefits. You got a few festivals like Electric Daisy that moved into the fourth quarter from May and we pushed the amphitheater season later in the year. So I wouldn\u2019t try to take anything arithmetically from that as much as a very \u2013 2021 was a year of very strong fan return to outdoor events. 2022 setting up to be a very strong fan return to every site, every sort of venue, every sort of event.\nRyan Sundby: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then, in terms of the average fan revenue up double digits this year, I guess, I know, it\u2019s kind of early to make a call last quarter, but now that you\u2019ve had some more time to kind of look at the data there. Is that something you think you can hold on to permanently, or do you think this is some kind of indulgent spinning that we\u2019re seeing here just that number?\nJoe Berchtold: We think overall that number is real. We think that there is higher fan spending and there is greater fan acceptance of some higher pricing and there\u2019s greater fan demand for real hospitality some higher end luxuries. We gave some specific math last time that wouldn\u2019t have changed much in terms of what was the incremental span versus what was some mix issues, but it is largely what fans spending more money at out the shows and we think that continues.\nRyan Sundby: Okay. That\u2019s good to hear. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead with your question.\nJason Bazinet: If there was one mistake that I think investors make during COVID, it was sort of taking strength that we saw during the COVID period and sort of extrapolating it into future periods. And I\u2019m just wondering, when you guys look at the very robust numbers that you\u2019re putting up and all those leading indicators, how you guys sort of parsing out the sort of we\u2019ve all been locked up for two years, or we\u2019re going to go out and go crazy and spend a lot of money on food and beverage and merch and pay a higher price to get a premium seat versus everything sort of settling down to the sort of long run averages. Like do you think there\u2019s that dynamic going on? Or do you think this is really like something a permanent shift in sort of consumers behavior?\nJoe Berchtold: Well, I think the first thing you got to start with, Jason, is we don\u2019t have a hockey stick. We\u2019re not a COVID business that was floating along with near zero, and all of a sudden took off like a hockey stick. And everybody thought the hockey stick was going to continue forever. When you look at the long-term growth of the business, start with the most macro of GDP spending on goods shifting to experience, on increased demand for luxuries, on desire to go to concerts, on increased ticket pricing to concerts, everything on a global basis, s Michael said, all of this has been we\u2019ve been drawing the same chart since 2010. And most of our investors today, I think, have been looking at that chart and saying the best predictor of the future is the past. And we had a very bumpy couple of years from macro over time. This is a company and this is an industry that is able between their tailwinds, their ability to drive increase market share, their ability to drive global, to bring the supply to the latent demand that exists in the marketplace to continue to grow the business.\nJason Bazinet: I don\u2019t disagree with anything you said. If I can just sort of give you observations, we\u2019re seeing like a record per caps in inside movie theaters and regional theme parks and things that don\u2019t have that same sort of tailwinds.\nJoe Berchtold: But Jason, had those businesses that they tell you for the past five years, they went from $18 to $22 to $24 to $26 to $29. I mean, do they tell you \u2013 do they give you for the past six years, every year how they were consistently delivering growth? So we could debate is that growth rate continued? Is there some normalization? Is there a reversion to a mean over a number of years? You can have all of those debates, but don\u2019t frame it as a hockey stick, or somehow as the bumps in the road, the world is going to collapse back down to $18. I think you got to give us the credit that we\u2019ve set a strategy and we\u2019ve executed very consistently for a considerable period, and delivered on sustained growth. So yes, there\u2019s some catch up of a couple of years, because 2020 and 2021 didn\u2019t exist as much. Sure. But that doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re aberrations.\nJason Bazinet: I don\u2019t mean aberrations, but I just I mean, maybe we\u2019ll learn more about this tomorrow. But it just seems like to comp, if we have these really robust numbers this year, I\u2019d just be curious what counsel you have, as we think about 2023 and 2024 to build off those elevated numbers not taking away from\u2026\nJoe Berchtold: So right now, I have in front of me a list of 40 some tours for 2023 that are either confirmed or in our pipeline. Normally, at this point, a year from earlier, we\u2019d have a list of five to 10. So yes, we have a lot of confidence that 2023 and beyond look very good because there is a lot of pent-up supply, there is a lot of pent-up demand, and we expect it\u2019s a multi-year run.\nJason Bazinet: Awesome. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that was our last question for today. And that also concludes today\u2019s conference. All parties may now disconnect. Have a great evening. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joe Berchtold",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Given the unique seasonality we experienced last year, I'll provide an overview of our annual results, but also give some specifics on the fourth quarter as we believe that is a better indicator of what lies ahead for 2022 and beyond. Overall, our AOI of $324 million for the year was $1.3 billion better than 2020, led by an improvement of $800 million in ticketing, over $400 million in concerts and $150 million in sponsorship. For the fourth quarter, we delivered AOI of $160 million, led by a record quarterly AOI results in ticketing and strong performance in sponsorship. On the balance sheet, we ended the year with $1.5 billion in free cash and $2.3 billion in event-related deferred revenue. This deferred revenue is almost twice the level of Q4 2019, giving us one of several leading indicators for how strong 2022 is lucky. Let me give a bit more color on each division and then I will give you more on the 2022 leading indicators. First, in concerts, we had 16 million fans attend 9,300 events in the quarter, continuing to be led by the U.S. and the UK, which accounted for almost 90% of these fans. The strength of fan spending we discussed in Q3 continued through Q4, with consistent increases in ticket pricing and average per fan spending. Concert ticket pricing was up 11% overall for the year relative to 2019 14% in North America. As demand in many major venue types: amphitheaters, stadiums and festivals showed strong increases as we put more tickets in market-based platinum and VIP pricing offers. Similarly, average fan spending at our amphitheaters ended up in line with last quarter's commentary at $37 for the year, up 25% from 2019. While this was helped by fewer promotions, it was largely driven by higher purchases. His average fan spending increased across the Board from food and beverage, ticket add-ons, VIP and parking. For our major festivals, average spending per fan also rose double digits, largely as a result of higher food and beverage in VIP sale. Finally, as we also noted last quarter, operating costs per fan were up due to lower operating scale from fewer shows per venue, along with labor cost increases. But overall, our contribution margin per fan was up double digits as pricing on-site spending another revenue more than covered any incremental costs. Next sponsorship, largely followed concerts returned to activity over the course of the year and into the fourth quarter. As a result, 2021 sponsorship and advertising AOI of $242 million was about two-thirds of 2019 levels, while Q4 AOI of $115 million was 39% higher in 2019 Q4. This strength comes across on-site and online, as both parts of the business delivered record Q4 AOI. Again, our large festivals were a standout performer, increasing sponsorship revenue per fan by over 10% versus the same festivals in 2019. Finally, ticketing was clearly the star of the quarter, delivering $212 million of AOI, which surpassed its previous best quarter Q3 of this year by over 20% and was 60% higher than Q4 2019, which was our previous best Q4. Ticketing success was across the Board. Let me give you a few key statistics for the quarter. Transacted ticket volume, excluding refunds, were 65 million tickets, coming in even higher than Q4 2019. Transacted ticketing GTV, excluding refunds, was $6.6 billion, 20% higher than Q4 2019. This was driven by concerts and sporting events, whose GTV were up 22% and 55%, respectively. Price increases help drive the GTV levels, with average ticket prices up 17% for the fourth quarter relative to Q4 2019, in concerts and sporting event, ticketing, pricing, each app approximately 20%. Our growth came from both primary and secondary ticketing, with transacted GTV, excluding refunds, up 16% and 49%, respectively. And we added 17 million net new fee-bearing tickets from new clients to the marketplace in 2021, with most of that inventory coming online this year. And finally, our ongoing cost management help drive ticketing into Q4 results operating at substantially lower fixed costs in Q4 2019, as we both structurally reduced costs and also held the line on other costs being added back until we saw ticket sales fully return. As we look to 2022, first OCESA will benefit full year results as Mexico seen live events starting to return. Most notably their contribution will flow through our sponsorship and ticketing division. Looking at our leading indicators through mid-February 1, confirmed large venue show bookings were up 30% overall and double digits for each amphitheaters, arenas, stadiums and festivals. Second, we have sold 45 million tickets for concerts this year, up 45% from this point in 2019. While it's too early to have much data on ticket pricing, early indicators continue to show the inelasticity of demand for the best tickets. Looking at our top 10 concert tours this year versus this point in 2019, average pricing is up over 20% as our average platinum allocation has increased substantially. And looking at secondary ticketing demand in Ticketmaster, five of their top 10 highest demand events ever have taken place in 2022, signaling that secondary markets continue to grow even faster than primary tickets. On the sponsorship side, commitments are up double digits from this point in 2019 prior to including OCESA. And overall, we have more than 80% of our planned sponsorship net revenue for 2022 already committed. A few other 2022 points, we continue to maintain a lower cost structure, and this takes into account labor cost increases within our perimeter as at the start of 2020. But obviously, adding new businesses, including OCESA, will come with additional fixed costs. And from a seasonality standpoint, we're going to be even more Q2 and Q3-driven this year than usual. Q1 activities historically very arena-driven with limited outdoor activity. And as we plan the arena tours for this year, we had most of them starting Q2 instead of Q1 to give the international markets time to fully open. It appears we plan that correctly, we continue to be on track with those plans, and certainly the leading indicators suggests the full year will be at record fan levels, but with somewhat lower concert activity this Q1 versus 2019. In anticipation of the growth opportunities ahead of us this year, we expect 2022 capital expenditures to be approximately $375 million, with two-thirds of this spent on revenue-generating projects. In addition, we ended 2021 with $2.1 billion of available liquidity between free cash and untapped revolver capacity, giving us sufficient flexibility to invest in growth. We are comfortable with our current leverage, and we'll continue to reevaluate our balance sheet on an ongoing basis. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator? Yeah, this is Joe. We're certainly seeing them buy earlier. We're seeing these numbers benefit from the pent-up supply and the pent-up demand that exists out in the marketplace. I think given that we're just getting going, it's probably too early to call whether they're going to multiple concerts more likely, I think, we're going to have to play through the year and see more data before we can really make that determination. Yeah, I think we continue to be very excited by assessment. We've spent a lot of time with their team. We do think the top line opportunities are exactly as we've been laying out. First, we have the opportunity to bring more of our terrain through Mexico was a natural part of our terrain activities. And then second, because of their great strength with LatinX, which are red hot right now, more opportunities to build our market share in the Latin business and bring those into not just Mexico, but in the U.S. So we're excited about that top line opportunity. They're getting going as we get into Q2, they'll get going first with festivals, and then ramp-up the touring business. We expect them to have a very good year, this year. Again, the way they're structured, their economics really flow through \u2013 their \u2013 if you look at them, their sponsorship and their ticketing divisions, but we expect them to have a very solid year. I think it's probably premature to change your cost structure assumptions with them. As we further integrate Ticketmaster, I would expect that and as we get the concert machine more finely tuned that expected, but it's \u2013 the first focus is driving the top line. if we get the top line right, that business will do great, and then we'll follow with costs. We're not going to start with cost because you can't pick it \u2013 you can't catch up this year. Yeah, in terms of remaining inventory, as you know, a lot of our inventory is what we create and what our sponsorship team has the ability to come up with ideas for how we expand into new categories, and how we take existing categories and break them down in pieces. So we don't feel generally speaking inventory constrained. The team is often working on a variety of areas, fintech and others that we think can steer still deliver a lot this year and into next year. As Michael said, we'll get more into that tomorrow. But we still think there's a great runway in that business. And as you also noted, a lot of these deals are multi-year. So as we establish a new baseline this year, we just have the opportunity to keep growing from that next year and beyond. Well, I think, again, Brandon, you'll be there tomorrow. Well I think you just have to look at the size of the prize right now. I mean, if you look at it, just from a secondary perspective, how much unrealized underpriced are the tickets, unrealized pricing opportunity, if you want to call it. So I would say right now, Platinum is adopting a great tool to get a higher ticket price, but we still have very low penetration across a global business, huge upside still. Yeah, this is Joe. We see what everybody else sees, which is yes, insurance costs going up. We don't think it's material to the business overall. I think we're in a good position as it relates to inflation more broadly. If you look at inflation of inputs versus your ability to price on the outputs, I think, we're in a very good position that while you have some price pressures on your inputs, whether it's insurance or labor. We have, for your first question, a much greater level of pricing ability on the outside, which led us as we talked about, use the same logic as we had last summer at the amps, still drove CM per fan up double digits. So we're watching every cost is everybody else's, we understand which ones are movie where, and we're just figuring out how we make sure we're pricing overall to to keep our AOI. Sure. We like every business. I've seen employees are demanding some higher wages as you've come back from COVID. And as we built our cost \u2013 structural cost savings, we knew that was going to be the case. And we built that in and we talked in the past about the levels of those cost savings. So I just rather than get into every quarter trying to reconcile for you guys, well, how does your cost of living adjustment this year impact your structural savings? I want to make it clear we're delivering those savings, having expected that there was going to be some labor cost increases as we were going through, no different for us than anybody else. Well, yeah, it's the same point as what Brandon asked about. It's the inelasticity of demand for the best tickets, plus the general overall desire for fans to get back to live events. So if they didn't buy a ticket for the sporting event, or for the concert, they missed out, they're buying it on secondary, and they're paying whatever it takes on those best tickets to get in. So as we strive on the primary to be pricing it such that to bring the dollars back the content to the artists, so we think deserve every dollar for their performance. We're doing that through platinum and through other tools. As we do that, secondary continues to grow rapidly. We're not shrinking secondary yet. So we have the opportunity to continue to move pricing and primary as I was talking about earlier, while looking at secondary and figuring out how far do we go. So let me give you some facts on that. Thanks for that question. Because I think there's been a lot of reporting by anecdote out there, as opposed to reporting by collective facts. And I don't think our experience is any different than the industry is, as a total. I think that on occasion, you have aberrations for a variety of reasons. But just to give you a macro feel, I'll give you the \u2013 for first of all, arenas in 2019, if you look at the number of people that showed up for a concert versus the number of people that bought tickets, it ran at 93% in 2019. That number thus far, in 2022, over the past six weeks is running at 91%. So not materially different from the 93% for the total of 2019. For our theaters and clubs, the smaller shows, you tend to have a slightly higher no-show rate. And that number was 87% in 2019. It's running at 83% in 2022. So I think if you first of all recognize that there were a number of shows that have taken place over the past few months that were rescheduled, and when shows get rescheduled, people will naturally forget about the show or have a conflict different than what they originally had. It's probable that accounts for all or almost all of that difference in the attendance level. So we don't think that reporting is at all accurate. I mean, I think if you look at Q4 versus 2019, you \u2013 Q4 is generally a loss. It's a lower activity quarter. You have, as you noted, prepaid advertising running through. If you look at our fan base in 2021 versus 2019, Q4 back that off. It's not surprising, you're still carrying your fixed cost plus you have your end advertising all against the lower volume. Thanks. Yeah, I certainly don't think of it as a caveat. But unquestionably, you've got a timing advantage this year, you've got a benefit from some shows that moved and you have a timing in general of a wide open market that we put shows on sale earlier. But that said, we look at all of that and we continue to see every indicator well up. So we think it'll plateau or normalize some, but it's still looking to be a very strong high growth relative to 2019. Thank you. We think overall that number is real. We think that there is higher fan spending and there is greater fan acceptance of some higher pricing and there's greater fan demand for real hospitality some higher end luxuries. We gave some specific math last time that wouldn't have changed much in terms of what was the incremental span versus what was some mix issues, but it is largely what fans spending more money at out the shows and we think that continues. Well, I think the first thing you got to start with, Jason, is we don't have a hockey stick. We're not a COVID business that was floating along with near zero, and all of a sudden took off like a hockey stick. And everybody thought the hockey stick was going to continue forever. When you look at the long-term growth of the business, start with the most macro of GDP spending on goods shifting to experience, on increased demand for luxuries, on desire to go to concerts, on increased ticket pricing to concerts, everything on a global basis, s Michael said, all of this has been we've been drawing the same chart since 2010. And most of our investors today, I think, have been looking at that chart and saying the best predictor of the future is the past. And we had a very bumpy couple of years from macro over time. This is a company and this is an industry that is able between their tailwinds, their ability to drive increase market share, their ability to drive global, to bring the supply to the latent demand that exists in the marketplace to continue to grow the business. But Jason, had those businesses that they tell you for the past five years, they went from $18 to $22 to $24 to $26 to $29. I mean, do they tell you \u2013 do they give you for the past six years, every year how they were consistently delivering growth? So we could debate is that growth rate continued? Is there some normalization? Is there a reversion to a mean over a number of years? You can have all of those debates, but don't frame it as a hockey stick, or somehow as the bumps in the road, the world is going to collapse back down to $18. I think you got to give us the credit that we've set a strategy and we've executed very consistently for a considerable period, and delivered on sustained growth. So yes, there's some catch up of a couple of years, because 2020 and 2021 didn't exist as much. Sure. But that doesn't mean that they're aberrations. So right now, I have in front of me a list of 40 some tours for 2023 that are either confirmed or in our pipeline. Normally, at this point, a year from earlier, we'd have a list of five to 10. So yes, we have a lot of confidence that 2023 and beyond look very good because there is a lot of pent-up supply, there is a lot of pent-up demand, and we expect it's a multi-year run."

            "name": "Michael Rapino",
            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. The past two years have only reinforced the power of live music, and it's been great to see artists and fans reconnecting at scale around the world. Over the course of 2021, we saw the strength of live events. The year started in the midst of the pandemic, but by summer fans were returning to shows, and by the end of the year, we had a record pipeline of concerts, ticket sales and advertising commitments for 2022. Restarting our concerts business in the second half of the year, we put over 17,000 concerts for 35 million fans in 2021, mainly in the U.S. and UK markets. In the final five months of the year, in the U.S. and UK, we had over 15 million fans attend our outdoor events: festivals, stadiums, and amphitheaters, nearly 25% higher than during the same period in 2019. Through the ramp up, we saw demand driven price increases, particularly with platinum and other front of the house ticket pricing. Fans continue to seek the best tickets, and the ongoing rapid growth of the secondary market indicates there's more room to grow. Fans on-site also continued spending more, with average per fan revenue up double digits for the year relative to 2019 levels, across each of amphitheaters, festivals, theaters and clubs. And as shows came back, so did the desire of brands to connect to our fans. As a result, sponsorship and advertising AOI was roughly the same for the second half of 2021 as it was in 2019, which was a record level. This interest came from a mix of expanding long-term relationships with brands such as Bacardi, Heineken and O2, as well as adding new partners, including Coinbase, Hulu and Cinch. Our ticketing business had the dual benefit of strong ticket sales for events in 2021, while also being the first of our businesses to benefit from our 2022 pipeline. Ticket sales were at a record pace across every metric with October, November and December being our top three months ever for ticketing GTV, excluding refunds. And the fourth quarter and second half of the year also set records for a quarter and six-month period. At the same time, we continued to reorganize our business globally and improve our operations, establishing a more nimble and lower cost company. Looking to 2022 and beyond, with the strength in ticket sales, not surprisingly, we are seeing every leading indicator for 2022 up relative to 2019, reinforcing our confidence that we will have a record year in 2022 that sets us up for growth over the next several years. Helping accelerate our growth this year is the acquisition of OCESA, which gives us immediate scale in Mexico and establishes another path into a broader Latin American market. Looking at the leading indicators, starting with show count through February, we are up 30% relative to 2019 across our large venue shows, for stadium, amphitheater, arena and festivals. Ticket sales through mid-February, we have sold 45 million tickets for shows this year, up 45% from 2019. We already have eight artists selling over 500,000 tickets for tours this year, including Bad Bunny, Dua Lipa and Billie Eilish. And fans are coming to the shows, our most recent data over the past month indicates no-show rates at our concerts in the U.S. are back to 2019 levels, eliminating any lingering questions on the resilience of fan demand. Along with our fan growth, we continue building the portfolio of venues we operate, now at 320 globally, as we net added 31 additional venues in 2021, approximately half of which came through the OCESA acquisition. Building our venue portfolio enables us to more rapidly grow our show count and fan base in 2022, and over the next few years, and positions us to drive on-site spending more widely while also providing additional assets to brand partners. Our sponsorship and advertising pipeline is similarly set for a strong 2022, up double digits through mid-February relative to 2019, with 80% of our planned revenue for the year committed. Taking this strong activity pipeline and combining it with our more efficient cost structure, I expect 2022 to deliver record financial performance overall for each division. The two-year wait for artists and fans is over. Never have the tailwinds to our business been so strong, and I believe this is just the start of what will be the strongest multi-year period for the concert industry. With that I will let Joe take you through more details on our results. And it's Michael stepping in. And also, we know this company very well. Alex , the CEO is a professional. You don't get to be the third largest promoter in the world without being kind of an all round good businessman and operator. So he runs an incredible good business. But yes, like myself and our team through COVID, he was able to dig in and decide what's \u2013 where's some rust and some bureaucracy? And how can we streamline some of the business? So like us, I would expect him to hold on to some cost savings and run more efficient, regardless of the merger. And we think now together, we've already started the process of how do we elevate the ticket business? How do we upgrade the software? How do we introduce secondary? How do we excel the hospitality and sponsorship business? So I'm sure there's some cost savings, but we're more excited about, as Joe said, we think we can bring another gear to his already well-run machine. You know, and I will preface here. We have our Investor Day tomorrow. So we're going to dig into all of these topics probably in much more detail. So if we're a little shorter tonight, just expect us tomorrow, you'll have a much more opportunity to dig into all of these levers. International, it looks like everything is opening up fast and we see a full summer/spring business across the globe. Australia and New Zealand have only been \u2013 has been the only real I would say slower some of the Pacific Rim a little slower in some of the markets, China, Japan. But for our business, we think most of the business across Europe, international, South America, we start Coldplay March 18 in Costa Rica going down to Latin America. We believe most of our big Lollapalooza is in South America in March and April will happen. And all of our summer festivals in Europe are scheduled to happen. So it looks like 70% to 80% of the business around the world will be open, little bit of Pacific Rim might have some delays. Just had that color that I remember reading those articles, they dramatize, I think they were saying as 15%, 20% weren't showing, but again, they weren't taking into account that on a normal year, 7%, 8% of people don't show up to shows. So you're already starting at that level. So if you look at what our current data says, we're basically back to 2019 levels and people are showing up at the same rates are not showing up in that 7% to 8%. The history has always kind of shown. Yeah, I would \u2013 we'll get into this tomorrow, again, in our slides, but we have the two sides of the equation here, right? Ultimately, long-term. I don't think secondary is a great business, because I believe content will figure out how to price it better. So on the concert side, we're waking up every day, our goal isn't to increase secondary sales, it's to increase the gross for the artists in the show. That's why we talked about platinum and VIP and better analysis for the artist to capture more of the dollars. So \u2013 and we've seen that over the last 5, 10 years, every year, the artist is capturing more of it. Now that doesn't mean that it's an efficient market yet. It's going to take some more time for the artist to be more comfortable charging those prices where the market is affected, but it's happening you see it over time. And then 5, 10 years from now, if you are an artist manager, you wouldn't want to be waking up seeing lots of secondary tickets for your artists captured outside of your bundle. So our job mostly is to figure out how to get all of that secondary into the primary bucket for the artist. So they make the dollars and then we, obviously, that fires our flywheel. But the reality is, it's not an efficient market yet. And most of secondary is really in the sports business. So when we talk about the ticket side growing, we were never in secondary, as you said, when we took this business over. We integrated it, we built it, and we \u2013 and then we ramped it up fast for all of our sports clients. So we're the official secondary of the NFL, the NBA of the NHL, and others. And we have been able to grow that business over the last few years, fairly well in the sports business where most of the dollars are. So that business though, again, continues to be a business where the sports teams are getting more and more dollars directly. The NBA, the NFL are all looking at ways to capture the secondary for the team and/or for the league. So we think it's a business right now that is in transition, lots of dollars outside of the content. We think long-term content captures more of it. But we're also going to be part of that marketplace that if a fan or somebody wants to trade and sell their tickets, then we want to make sure we're part of that vertical solution at our marketplace."

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir.\nMichael Rapino : Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us. Live music roared back over the past quarter, driving all our business stipends to positive AOI for the first time in two years with companywide AOI of $306 million. The 2021 summer concert season rebounded quickly, with 17 million fans attending our shows in the quarter has returned to live, reflected tremendous pent-up demand. Festivals were large part of our return to live this summer with many of our festivals selling out in record time, and then overall ticket sales for major festivals was up 10% versus 2019.  Then we had a number of our tours are already sell over 500, 000 tickets for tours this year, including sellout tours by Harry Styles, Chris Stapleton, and others. In addition to increasing attendance, strong demand also enabled improving pricing with average amphitheater and major festival pricing up double-digits relative to 2019, and at our shows, fans spend at record levels with onsite spending per fan up over 20% in both amphitheaters and festivals compared to 2019.  We delivered these results with an operating environment that required us to wrap up quickly it's new health and safety protocols, and staff our frontline in a tight labor market. On the health and safety front, we set the industry standard by requiring proof of vaccine or testing for our shows, with no change in fan purchase behavior. More importantly, our protocols proved effective at mitigating major COVID disruptions to our business in the U.S. and UK, and allowed us to work in conjunction with local health officials to mitigate transmission risks from our events. On the labor front, we were able to set staffing requirements for our peak outdoor season without any show disruptions.  We also saw strong fan demand in our Ticketmaster results. We delivered its highest AOI quarter ever. Q3 was Ticketmaster's fourth highest fee-bearing GTV quarter excluding refunds, led by sports legs restarting and concert on-sales for 2022 ramping up. In addition, Ticketmaster's secondary business delivered its highest GTV month in September, showing continued growth in the segment, even as artists and content owners continue shifting more of the value to primary sales. And as the fans came back, so did our brand partners who continue to seek to connect to the live music fan.  As a result, our sponsorship and advertising business delivered over $100 million in AOI for the quarter, the first time at this level since Q3 of 2019. Return of sponsorship and advertising has been largely driven by historic major partners, along with the addition of new brands, including Truly Hard Seltzer, as well as Coinbase and Solana in the Fintech segment. As we look forward to 2022, we are encouraged by all our leading indicators across each business. Through October our confirmed show count across amphitheaters, arenas, stadium shows are up double-digits, relative to the point in 2019 to 2020 shows.  And through mid-October, we have already sold 22 million tickets for our shows in 2022 and demand has been stronger than ever for many of these on sales, with a million tickets sold for each of the Coldplay and Red-Hot Chili Peppers tours, and several other tours already selling over 500,000 tickets. Ticketmaster is on sale for 2022 also reinforcing this demand, as we expect  transacted fee-bearing GTV to be at record level, even after already selling 65 million fee-bearing tickets for events next year. Ticketmaster also added clients represented in over 14 million net new fee-bearing tickets so far this year, further accelerating its growth on a global basis.  And our Sponsorship and Advertising business had similar success, with confirmed pipeline for 2022 up double-digits relative to this time in 2019 to 2020. At the same time, we are continuing our cost focused deliver $200 million in structural savings from our pre -pandemic 2020 plan, making us nimbler and better positioned to invest for future growth. As we get close to turning the page in 2021, I remain more convinced than ever in the power and potential of live entertainment, and the strength of our position.  No industry was more impacted by the pandemic over the last two years, and no industry has so proven the durability of its demand in the face of such disruption. I fully expect we will continue to have bumps in the road in the coming months. And it will take some time for international artists maturing on a truly global basis. But the fundamental strength of live entertainment and Live Nation has proven out and expect we will only continue to grow from here. With that, I will let Joe take you through more details on our results.\nJoe Berchtold : Thanks, Michael and good afternoon, everyone. Before getting into the detail on each business, a few points of context for the quarter, first, this is primarily a U.S. and UK driven quarter. These markets accounted for 95% of our fans in Q3 versus 75% in Q3 of 2019. And they represented 90% of fee-bearing GTV in Q3 versus 80% in Q3 of 2019. Second, our concerts activity primarily ramped up in August with 90% of our attendance for shows occurring in August and September.  Let me now go into more detail on the divisions. First concerts, as Michael noted, pricing and onsite spending was up for both our amphitheaters and our major festivals in the U.S. and UK. With almost 1200 amphitheater shows played off, these shows give us the best data set for comparing to 2019. So, give you more detail on trends for these shows, and in general, the same trends also hold for our festivals.  On pricing, average ticket pricing at our amphitheaters was up 17% to $63. There are 2 primary drivers to this. First, ticket pricing, including more platinum and VIP tickets for shows this year, increased average ticket pricing by $7. Secondly, our concert week promotion and other promotions were smaller-scale this year, which had an impact of $2 per ticket. Then for onsite spending, average fan spending was up 25% to $36. This growth came from a combination of more orders per fan, more items per order, and higher average spend per order. Many of our fans shifted to buying higher-priced products, which was part of our higher spend per order. And the shift to cashless also helped as card transactions have historically been larger than cash transactions, and this has held up as we shifted to 100% cashless. Finally, operating costs, including labor costs were up. These higher labor costs are driven by several factors, fewer shows per building, our accelerated ramp up to open the buildings this summer, new health and safety protocols and a generally tightened labor market.  At the same time as noted with increased average ticket price and higher onsite spending, we increased the contribution margin per fan and did so to such a level that our profitability per fan, net of operating expenses rose double digits. Turning now to Ticketmaster, as Michael said, Ticketmaster had a record AOI of a $172 million for the quarter, driven by its fourth highest fee-bearing GTV quarter excluding refunds, and lower cost structure from its reorganization. Along with lower ramp-up labor costs as we accelerated activity faster than the return of staff.  Primary ticketing was driven substantially by concerts, which accounted for over 70% of fee-bearing GTV, while sports was the second largest category, and together they represented approximately 90% of all fee-bearing GTV. Geographically, North America accounted for 80% of fee-bearing GTV as activity remained limited internationally outside the UK. In secondary ticketing, we similarly saw concerts and sports account for over 90% of fee-bearing GTV, though in this case, sports were the primary driver with the launch of new football and basketball seasons.  Another contributor to our growth in ticketing is the continued signing of new clients with over 14 million net new fee-bearing tickets added this year through the third quarter. These new client additions have been particularly strong internationally, accounting for 2/3 of our new client tickets. Finally, sponsorship AOI surpassed a $100 million in the quarter for the first time in 2 years as it again had available ad units at scale, both on-site and online. Like our other businesses, it was largely U.S. and UK driven together accounting for approximately 90% of total activity. And as activity resumed, we were also able to engage new sponsors, adding 8 new strategic sponsors in the quarter.  As we look to Q4, we see a continuation of the same trends we had in Q3. With concerts, we expect North America and the UK to continue ramping toward historical activity levels. While the rest of Europe and other international markets have limited activity given the lead time to plan concerts. With ticketing we expect a broader recovery as most European markets put stadium and arena tours on sale in Q4, enabling GTV levels that could approach Q4 2019 levels, despite 65 million fee-bearing tickets already being sold for 2022 events.  And while Q4 is typically a seasonally slower period for sponsorship, it too should benefit from concerts and ticketing sales ramping up. Let us now turn to our cash and cost management. We have free cash at $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter, which includes $450 million earmarked for the OCESA acquisition. This was our first quarter since 2019 where our cash contribution margin was higher than our cash burn, contributing a net $166 million in free cash. We also added $850 million in cash in the quarter through our $400 million drawdown of our Term A loan and $450 million equity raise for ASESA, mentioned previously.  We then had free cash reduced by $370 million, largely resulting from long-term deferred revenue shifting into short-term for show's next summer as we previously indicated would be happening. This improved cash position was also helped by our ongoing cost and cash management program as this year, we expect to reduce costs by $900 million and cash spend by $1.5 billion relative to pre -pandemic plans and on the cash, side excluding ASESA. As we prepare for 2022 plans, we remain confident that we have structurally reduced our operating costs by $200 million relative to our pre -pandemic 2020 plans.  A few other balance sheet items. Our deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $1.9 billion. This is compared to $950 million at the end of Q3 of 2019, which gives us the best like for like view of the demand pipeline already in place. And then a reminder on our debt, that we continue with our liquidity covenants until we report Q4 this year, at which point we switch to a more traditional leverage test. Given our current liquidity and expected Q4 and 2022 activity levels, we do not anticipate any covenant issues through next year, and expect to continue investing in growth. With that, let me open the call for questions, Operator.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with J.P Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you. AC rob returned to target scale. What have you found about operating with a reduced cost structure, and how do you think about expense growth from here relative to pre -pandemic where I think you've noted you were just less focus as an organization on driving cost efficiencies? And then just a second question, how are you thinking about labor constraints as you ramp toward this huge wave supply coming in 2022, are there any concerns about finding out road as new crews and then to the extent costs you move up, who bears that  promoter or is that kind of goes to the artist. Thanks.\nJoe Berchtold : Sure. Just on operating with a reduced cost structure, we had the benefit if you will, of really 0 base in our cost structure over the past year and a half, so -- and we've talked through at various points, a lot of it around Ticketmaster's globalization and how we revised our approach on the concert side. So, we're not seeing any issues in terms of operating with this renewed cost structure because it's been a pretty methodical laid out approach to how we want to run the business.  And then I think as we move forward and we continue to grow the business, our expectations are that the incremental profitability of our business is as good or better than it's ever been, and that there continues to be a long runway to do so. In terms of the labor constraint as we talked, we were able to put on all of our shows this year without any issues. Looking forward to next year at the end of probably -- we don't think that there's any issue in terms of getting back to the level of activity that we've had, or the level of activity that we're talking about, in terms of our pipeline of shows.  Ultimately, that is what the short-term constraining is in terms of why we won't be doing 45 mega tours, where you can't have 80% growth in a given year. It does have to do with some of the short-term ability to get your buses or to get your staff, but there's no long-term constraints for the growth. And we're still able to grow it in next year. In terms of the costs incurred, it's different pieces for different folks that the artist is generally responsible for their crew and their operations that they're being out on the road and we're responsible for the venues that we operate.\nMichael Rapino : Just to add a little -- just to add texture to that, we would have absolutely in July or August with the idea that we had to instantly hire 20,000 people for summer amphitheaters usually would happen way back in April, we would've had concern but we surprisingly we're able to fully staff all of those jobs, as Joe said. Marginal cost increased a few million dollars.  So, we did see that the part-time seasonal workforce that needed to come back to help make the machine work were eager to get back. So, we didn't have that challenge. I think we're going to keep looking at how we do a better job of attracting and retaining them in today's environment, but we don't see that as a cost challenge, we think it's an exciting category so a lot of people like coming to work at the amphitheater, the club, the theatre, the lifestyle type job, and then as Joe said, we had no supply chain issues. The artist gets on stage, there's plenty of trucks, lights, staging, etc. to make the machine work on a global basis.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Q - Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Ross: Hello. Thanks for taking the questions. Just -- you talked about your quarter and how the return to lives has been predominantly in the U.S. and UK. Wondering if you could give an update on when I know it's a big world out there, but when we can expect the rest of the world to get back to those 2019 levels and beyond that we've seen in the US and the UK. And then I have a follow-up.\nMichael Rapino : Yeah, I'll jump in and Joe can jump. We've -- we had a global call yesterday this week with all of our different presidents. We're feeling very confident, obviously Canada, U.S., UK are fully open. Europe will be fully open by the end of the year. So, we'll have most of the main markets open into January. Pacific Rim, Latin America, all looks positive in terms of being open fully for international artists by April.  We think internationally, on a global basis by April the world will be moving around again. It doesn't overly affect our business short-term because most of the outdoor stadium festival business is summer time, so that will be all fully up and rolling. We have Lollapalooza starting in April in Latin America and Australia festivals. So, we think we'll be open for prime season, and we'll be rolling around indoors in the main markets of U.S., Europe, Canada, and the UK between now and April.\nBrandon Ross: Right, and I wanted to focus a little on your O&O business. You talked about that prime season starting into April, and you extended your AMP season and festival season this year as the summer got off to a late start, do you plan on keeping that summer season extended going forward? Is that a way for you to own more of the fans?\nJoe Berchtold : Yeah. It's a great point, right. You just forced yourself in this last 2 years to think differently and extract more value from your base, and we absolutely look at it now and see specially in most of Southern America we can stay open much longer than we historically have. So yes, we will look to extend the seasons in those markets for sure.\nBrandon Ross: Great. And then Michael, I saw on your social that you invested in some new international venues. Can you maybe explain to us what your new venue strategy is going forward, what you're trying to accomplish in other parts of the world?\nMichael Rapino : I always think we underestimate bragging about our venue portfolio. We are ready well over 200 venues that we operate somewhere in the world, amphitheaters, theaters, clubs, arenas in Dublin, Holland, etc. So, we know that the venue when we go vertical is a high-margin business for us. And I consider festivals almost venues, because you get to own the real estate for the weekend, you're owning all the revenue streams. So anytime that we can put a show in our festival or our venue on ticketed by Ticketmaster's, have our sponsorship able to use the asset and count all the revenue streams, it's our highest margin business.  What we've seen over time now is, in the last 5 years, is there has been a new real estate boom around the world where every major city in the world looks at live entertainment much like they used to look at movie theatres as being this incredible tenant in their development. So, we are talking ongoing to multiple developers around the world who are building something and they wanted 2,000-seat, a 5,000-seat, a 7,000-seat, maybe an arena than anchor into one of their developments.  So, we've really ramped up that division over the last 2 years and we see great opportunity around the world of continuing to expand our venue portfolio in these prime markets. I mean, Austin's an example where there's no arena. We're going to open that arena in the next couple of years. It's going to be a monster of a return for us as a great single venue in the Austin market right now, for live shows to complement our club, our theater, our amphitheater portfolio. So, we'll continue to be very opportunistic in the markets around the world where there's an opening for a live venue of any size.\nBrandon Ross: Great, thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Laszczyk: Great, thank you. I appreciate all the detail you provided on the pricing and spending trends in the quarter. I was just wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit more about how durable you think those trends will be into next year, especially now that you have the vantage point of seeing these trends play out across an entire summer conversely. And then, now that we're getting closer to 2022, and the slate's taking more shape, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the cadence of shows that you expect in 2022 and how that might compare to a normal year? Thank you.\nJoe Berchtold : Sure. This is Joe. I'll start on the pricing and the per-caps. I think we believe this is structurally a level of spend that we're seeing from the consumer now on the pricing, heavily driven by the front of the house, the best seats where we've long known there's this arbitrage because of the size and continued growth of the secondary market  even as we've been pricing and moving more money to the artists over the past several years. So, this year that trend continued. More VIP, more platinum tickets, getting that money to the artist. And we're seeing a relatively strong inelasticity on the demand for those best tickets.  And then on the onsite, I think because we're seeing it come from a number of fronts, we are confident that it's staying. So, we talked about it in the comments, right. Moving from cash to cashless just opens up increase spend. It's been a long existing difference between those 2 moving to a 100% cashless, just raises the average because instead of being half of each. And then we're seeing again structural trends people are going to a bit higher quality in terms of some of the alcohol, some of our product offerings are making more of a deal for people to take higher price point products.  All of those we think are a continuation of the trends that we've seen over the past several years and have no reason to expect that that would be any different going forward. In terms of the cadence for shows next year in general, and Michael talked about this a bit. You'll see similar where Q2 and Q3 will continue to be our strongest quarters. That's when we'll have a great stadium next year. It looks to be far and away the largest stadium we've ever -- we've had. That will be primarily in those Q2, Q3 outdoor months. Obviously, our amphitheaters and festivals, largely those months. And even the arena certainly here in the U.S. you just have more avails in those months because of the timing of the sport season. So, there's no reason not to expect similar seasonality in general as we've had historically.\nStephen Laszczyk: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Glagola with Cowen, please proceed with your question.\nStephen Glagola: Yes. Thank you. Joe on the ticketing segment that you had another great quarter, margins were at 46% on AOI. I know you said prior the Q2 is 40% margin shouldn't be extrapolated. And I know you love talking about margins, but I just wanted to see if you had an update on that mid-single-digit margin expansion that you talked about prior on annualized basis. Is that still how we should be thinking about the ticketing business coming out of the pandemic or are we talking about something higher than that now?\nJoe Berchtold : Well, I think we absolutely believe you'll continue to expect to see higher than historical margins because of the cost reductions. This year you've -- this quarter you've got the particular benefit of a few things, one being that we ramped up our activity faster than we ramped up our staff. As we said, we were doing from our cost management so we pushed our people and extracted more from that side.  And secondly, as we also talked, this is much more of a U.S. driven, and then secondly UK driven, and we've talked historically about the fact that the U.S. market is a higher service fee and therefore generally a higher margin market than internationally. So, some of that mix shift will convert back next year. I don't think we're ready to give exact numbers, but we certainly do think that the ticketing margin will improve relative to historical.\nStephen Glagola: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Katz: Hi, evening everyone, and thanks for taking my question. With everything going as well as it has, and the numbers starting to materialize, I wanted to ask a little bit longer term, like 2023, And if there's any evidence to support the trajectory continuing to move up. In 2023, I think Joe, you may have used the phrase at one point, there's no air pocket out there. Any help there would be welcome.\nMichael Rapino : Yes. I think to Joe's point, I think we've said it before. The good news is '22 is going to probably be a record year, but there's only so many Fridays and Saturdays and artists are pretty smart about how they route their tours and how they look at the world and find their right positioning. So, it\u2019s kind of self-regulates itself. You're never going to have a bunch of tours on the same weekend piled on.  So that just meant we have a more inventory to spread into '22, '23, and we're talking '24 now. So, I would say we have a backlog that needs to still work through the system in '22, '23. which will be incredibly strong years. And then we continue to get back to regular -- we've had over the year, double-digit growth in the live entertainment space ongoing. We project that to continue both on pricing and global volume as demand and supply continues to grow around the world.\nDavid Katz: Thank you for that. And if -- Michael, if I may just follow-up on the prospective deal front. I think when we last spoke, activity in terms of potential acquisitions were starting to ramp up again and become more active. Any update there that's worth sharing?\nMichael Rapino : If you follow my Twitter, or what we're up to, we've been pretty active. We're back with our backlog of 30 to 40 things around the world. We're looking at that can keep propelling our business and growing our scale. So good pipe -- good pipeline will continue to be very aggressive at growing our global market share and then monetizing products on top of it.\nDavid Katz: Thank you very much. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Sundby with William Blair, please proceed with your question.\nRyan Sundby: Hey, Michael. Hi, Jeff. Thanks for taking my question. If you look at the 14 million net new fee-bearing customers that Ticketmaster\u2019s added this year so far, what's been the primary drivers for growing that business? Are they looking for digital ticketing? Was there a change and particularly during COVID and then with 2/3 of them being international and finally, are these exclusive taking partners any color there would be great.\nJoe Berchtold : Sure. as you said, 2/3 of them international, I think is indicative of particularly in the international markets. Just what a strong leadership position Ticketmaster has with a lot of the investments we've been making over the past 5 years. So digital ticketing, as you said, is -- overnight goes from being a nice feature to a critical part of it because you're moving away from contactless of any sort, you need a digital ticket, and our leadership there is a big differentiator, we've been investing for a long time, we're not trying to play catch-up. And these tickets are a mix of where we have the full allocation in some markets and other markets, we have a partial allocation. But in aggregate it's adding 14 million tickets to the portfolio.\nMichael Rapino : William, I would just add I don't want to ever forget that Ticketmaster is incredibly great at what they do on a global basis. If you're -- if you own a stadium, an arena, high-volume ticket business with complex season owners and regular tickets -- it's a complex business to do at scale. So, a lot of our customers, sometimes we may lose a customer, they end up coming back.  So, one, I just want to remind you, we've been investing in this platform for the last few years. Our enterprise platform is a world-class platform. The U.S. ticket market is the most complicated market in the world. Reserved seats equal season seats are a complex model to manage the 10 AM on on-sale with box and all the things that pressure your system so when at the core enterprise platform is really good. So, we're more out competing for that offering. We end up just being ultimately winning the business because we are the best at it.  And we see that because we see the clients that may leave. But end up coming back because the functionality that we provide is superior to others. We're seeing this in a Brooklyn arena last week where the competitor was trying to do a presale that broke and that's a pretty basic stuff. So, I just remind people we are in a global basis, the best of what we do. That's why clients pick us. And then we happen to be global and opening up all of our technology to a global base is going to be our great runway for the next while.\nRyan Sundby: Got it. That makes a lot of sense. And then just sequencing at this past quarter, it didn't sound like you called out a big impact from Delta here. Did you feel?  And did you see a rebound then I guess as you move, pass it further out?\nJoe Berchtold : I think every month for us, we continue to see ongoing growth in the reopening, so it'd be hard to separate out Delta specifically versus reopening in general. But everything that we saw was more fans going to more shows consistently, contrary to some of the press I've seen very low no show rates, low to low single-digit increases in terms of no-shows as a result of the pandemic. So, it seems that the people that want to go to the shows are going to the shows. And that's just continue to grow as a portion of the fan base out there.\nRyan Sundby: That's good to hear. Thanks for the questions.\nMichael Rapino : And to Joe's point, I would just add what you also noticed is the -- it's all different genres in ages. So, this isn't just young kids are going to shows because they're not scared but the Eagles just had a wildly successful on arena tour that's going to finish up this week in Seattle. The Grateful Dead route doing full stadiums. Harry Styles obviously doing indoors to just record business as well as our amphitheater business.  So, we did -- we weren't sure going into the market what segment or what age demo would react differently, or if there would be a difference, and we saw huge demand across the board at all ages, all demos, all markets. So strong rebound back as we've seen with the early on sales going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and this concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation.",

            "name": "Joe Berchtold",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael and good afternoon, everyone. Before getting into the detail on each business, a few points of context for the quarter, first, this is primarily a U.S. and UK driven quarter. These markets accounted for 95% of our fans in Q3 versus 75% in Q3 of 2019. And they represented 90% of fee-bearing GTV in Q3 versus 80% in Q3 of 2019. Second, our concerts activity primarily ramped up in August with 90% of our attendance for shows occurring in August and September.  Let me now go into more detail on the divisions. First concerts, as Michael noted, pricing and onsite spending was up for both our amphitheaters and our major festivals in the U.S. and UK. With almost 1200 amphitheater shows played off, these shows give us the best data set for comparing to 2019. So, give you more detail on trends for these shows, and in general, the same trends also hold for our festivals.  On pricing, average ticket pricing at our amphitheaters was up 17% to $63. There are 2 primary drivers to this. First, ticket pricing, including more platinum and VIP tickets for shows this year, increased average ticket pricing by $7. Secondly, our concert week promotion and other promotions were smaller-scale this year, which had an impact of $2 per ticket. Then for onsite spending, average fan spending was up 25% to $36. This growth came from a combination of more orders per fan, more items per order, and higher average spend per order. Many of our fans shifted to buying higher-priced products, which was part of our higher spend per order. And the shift to cashless also helped as card transactions have historically been larger than cash transactions, and this has held up as we shifted to 100% cashless. Finally, operating costs, including labor costs were up. These higher labor costs are driven by several factors, fewer shows per building, our accelerated ramp up to open the buildings this summer, new health and safety protocols and a generally tightened labor market.  At the same time as noted with increased average ticket price and higher onsite spending, we increased the contribution margin per fan and did so to such a level that our profitability per fan, net of operating expenses rose double digits. Turning now to Ticketmaster, as Michael said, Ticketmaster had a record AOI of a $172 million for the quarter, driven by its fourth highest fee-bearing GTV quarter excluding refunds, and lower cost structure from its reorganization. Along with lower ramp-up labor costs as we accelerated activity faster than the return of staff.  Primary ticketing was driven substantially by concerts, which accounted for over 70% of fee-bearing GTV, while sports was the second largest category, and together they represented approximately 90% of all fee-bearing GTV. Geographically, North America accounted for 80% of fee-bearing GTV as activity remained limited internationally outside the UK. In secondary ticketing, we similarly saw concerts and sports account for over 90% of fee-bearing GTV, though in this case, sports were the primary driver with the launch of new football and basketball seasons.  Another contributor to our growth in ticketing is the continued signing of new clients with over 14 million net new fee-bearing tickets added this year through the third quarter. These new client additions have been particularly strong internationally, accounting for 2/3 of our new client tickets. Finally, sponsorship AOI surpassed a $100 million in the quarter for the first time in 2 years as it again had available ad units at scale, both on-site and online. Like our other businesses, it was largely U.S. and UK driven together accounting for approximately 90% of total activity. And as activity resumed, we were also able to engage new sponsors, adding 8 new strategic sponsors in the quarter.  As we look to Q4, we see a continuation of the same trends we had in Q3. With concerts, we expect North America and the UK to continue ramping toward historical activity levels. While the rest of Europe and other international markets have limited activity given the lead time to plan concerts. With ticketing we expect a broader recovery as most European markets put stadium and arena tours on sale in Q4, enabling GTV levels that could approach Q4 2019 levels, despite 65 million fee-bearing tickets already being sold for 2022 events.  And while Q4 is typically a seasonally slower period for sponsorship, it too should benefit from concerts and ticketing sales ramping up. Let us now turn to our cash and cost management. We have free cash at $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter, which includes $450 million earmarked for the OCESA acquisition. This was our first quarter since 2019 where our cash contribution margin was higher than our cash burn, contributing a net $166 million in free cash. We also added $850 million in cash in the quarter through our $400 million drawdown of our Term A loan and $450 million equity raise for ASESA, mentioned previously.  We then had free cash reduced by $370 million, largely resulting from long-term deferred revenue shifting into short-term for show's next summer as we previously indicated would be happening. This improved cash position was also helped by our ongoing cost and cash management program as this year, we expect to reduce costs by $900 million and cash spend by $1.5 billion relative to pre -pandemic plans and on the cash, side excluding ASESA. As we prepare for 2022 plans, we remain confident that we have structurally reduced our operating costs by $200 million relative to our pre -pandemic 2020 plans.  A few other balance sheet items. Our deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $1.9 billion. This is compared to $950 million at the end of Q3 of 2019, which gives us the best like for like view of the demand pipeline already in place. And then a reminder on our debt, that we continue with our liquidity covenants until we report Q4 this year, at which point we switch to a more traditional leverage test. Given our current liquidity and expected Q4 and 2022 activity levels, we do not anticipate any covenant issues through next year, and expect to continue investing in growth. With that, let me open the call for questions, Operator. Sure. Just on operating with a reduced cost structure, we had the benefit if you will, of really 0 base in our cost structure over the past year and a half, so -- and we've talked through at various points, a lot of it around Ticketmaster's globalization and how we revised our approach on the concert side. So, we're not seeing any issues in terms of operating with this renewed cost structure because it's been a pretty methodical laid out approach to how we want to run the business.

Looking forward to next year at the end of probably -- we don't think that there's any issue in terms of getting back to the level of activity that we've had, or the level of activity that we're talking about, in terms of our pipeline of shows.

It does have to do with some of the short-term ability to get your buses or to get your staff, but there's no long-term constraints for the growth. And we're still able to grow it in next year. In terms of the costs incurred, it's different pieces for different folks that the artist is generally responsible for their crew and their operations that they're being out on the road and we're responsible for the venues that we operate. Yeah. It's a great point, right. You just forced yourself in this last 2 years to think differently and extract more value from your base, and we absolutely look at it now and see specially in most of Southern America we can stay open much longer than we historically have.

            "content": "Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us. Live music roared back over the past quarter, driving all our business stipends to positive AOI for the first time in two years with companywide AOI of $306 million. The 2021 summer concert season rebounded quickly, with 17 million fans attending our shows in the quarter has returned to live, reflected tremendous pent-up demand. Festivals were large part of our return to live this summer with many of our festivals selling out in record time, and then overall ticket sales for major festivals was up 10% versus 2019.  Then we had a number of our tours are already sell over 500, 000 tickets for tours this year, including sellout tours by Harry Styles, Chris Stapleton, and others. In addition to increasing attendance, strong demand also enabled improving pricing with average amphitheater and major festival pricing up double-digits relative to 2019, and at our shows, fans spend at record levels with onsite spending per fan up over 20% in both amphitheaters and festivals compared to 2019.  We delivered these results with an operating environment that required us to wrap up quickly it's new health and safety protocols, and staff our frontline in a tight labor market. On the health and safety front, we set the industry standard by requiring proof of vaccine or testing for our shows, with no change in fan purchase behavior. More importantly, our protocols proved effective at mitigating major COVID disruptions to our business in the U.S. and UK, and allowed us to work in conjunction with local health officials to mitigate transmission risks from our events. On the labor front, we were able to set staffing requirements for our peak outdoor season without any show disruptions.  We also saw strong fan demand in our Ticketmaster results. We delivered its highest AOI quarter ever. Q3 was Ticketmaster's fourth highest fee-bearing GTV quarter excluding refunds, led by sports legs restarting and concert on-sales for 2022 ramping up. In addition, Ticketmaster's secondary business delivered its highest GTV month in September, showing continued growth in the segment, even as artists and content owners continue shifting more of the value to primary sales. And as the fans came back, so did our brand partners who continue to seek to connect to the live music fan.  As a result, our sponsorship and advertising business delivered over $100 million in AOI for the quarter, the first time at this level since Q3 of 2019. Return of sponsorship and advertising has been largely driven by historic major partners, along with the addition of new brands, including Truly Hard Seltzer, as well as Coinbase and Solana in the Fintech segment. As we look forward to 2022, we are encouraged by all our leading indicators across each business. Through October our confirmed show count across amphitheaters, arenas, stadium shows are up double-digits, relative to the point in 2019 to 2020 shows.  And through mid-October, we have already sold 22 million tickets for our shows in 2022 and demand has been stronger than ever for many of these on sales, with a million tickets sold for each of the Coldplay and Red-Hot Chili Peppers tours, and several other tours already selling over 500,000 tickets. Ticketmaster is on sale for 2022 also reinforcing this demand, as we expect  transacted fee-bearing GTV to be at record level, even after already selling 65 million fee-bearing tickets for events next year. Ticketmaster also added clients represented in over 14 million net new fee-bearing tickets so far this year, further accelerating its growth on a global basis.  And our Sponsorship and Advertising business had similar success, with confirmed pipeline for 2022 up double-digits relative to this time in 2019 to 2020. At the same time, we are continuing our cost focused deliver $200 million in structural savings from our pre -pandemic 2020 plan, making us nimbler and better positioned to invest for future growth. As we get close to turning the page in 2021, I remain more convinced than ever in the power and potential of live entertainment, and the strength of our position.  No industry was more impacted by the pandemic over the last two years, and no industry has so proven the durability of its demand in the face of such disruption. I fully expect we will continue to have bumps in the road in the coming months. And it will take some time for international artists maturing on a truly global basis. But the fundamental strength of live entertainment and Live Nation has proven out and expect we will only continue to grow from here. With that, I will let Joe take you through more details on our results. Just to add a little -- just to add texture to that, we would have absolutely in July or August with the idea that we had to instantly hire 20,000 people for summer amphitheaters usually would happen way back in April, we would've had concern but we surprisingly we're able to fully staff all of those jobs, as Joe said. Marginal cost increased a few million dollars.  So, we did see that the part-time seasonal workforce that needed to come back to help make the machine work were eager to get back. So, we didn't have that challenge. I think we're going to keep looking at how we do a better job of attracting and retaining them in today's environment, but we don't see that as a cost challenge, we think it's an exciting category so a lot of people like coming to work at the amphitheater, the club, the theatre, the lifestyle type job, and then as Joe said, we had no supply chain issues. The artist gets on stage, there's plenty of trucks, lights, staging, etc. to make the machine work on a global basis. Yeah, I'll jump in and Joe can jump. We've -- we had a global call yesterday this week with all of our different presidents. We're feeling very confident, obviously Canada, U.S., UK are fully open. Europe will be fully open by the end of the year. So, we'll have most of the main markets open into January. Pacific Rim, Latin America, all looks positive in terms of being open fully for international artists by April.  We think internationally, on a global basis by April the world will be moving around again. It doesn't overly affect our business short-term because most of the outdoor stadium festival business is summer time, so that will be all fully up and rolling. We have Lollapalooza starting in April in Latin America and Australia festivals. So, we think we'll be open for prime season, and we'll be rolling around indoors in the main markets of U.S., Europe, Canada, and the UK between now and April. I always think we underestimate bragging about our venue portfolio. We are ready well over 200 venues that we operate somewhere in the world, amphitheaters, theaters, clubs, arenas in Dublin, Holland, etc. So, we know that the venue when we go vertical is a high-margin business for us. And I consider festivals almost venues, because you get to own the real estate for the weekend, you're owning all the revenue streams. So anytime that we can put a show in our festival or our venue on ticketed by Ticketmaster's, have our sponsorship able to use the asset and count all the revenue streams, it's our highest margin business.  What we've seen over time now is, in the last 5 years, is there has been a new real estate boom around the world where every major city in the world looks at live entertainment much like they used to look at movie theatres as being this incredible tenant in their development. So, we are talking ongoing to multiple developers around the world who are building something and they wanted 2,000-seat, a 5,000-seat, a 7,000-seat, maybe an arena than anchor into one of their developments.  So, we've really ramped up that division over the last 2 years and we see great opportunity around the world of continuing to expand our venue portfolio in these prime markets. I mean, Austin's an example where there's no arena. We're going to open that arena in the next couple of years. It's going to be a monster of a return for us as a great single venue in the Austin market right now, for live shows to complement our club, our theater, our amphitheater portfolio. So, we'll continue to be very opportunistic in the markets around the world where there's an opening for a live venue of any size. Yes. I think to Joe's point, I think we've said it before. The good news is '22 is going to probably be a record year, but there's only so many Fridays and Saturdays and artists are pretty smart about how they route their tours and how they look at the world and find their right positioning. So, it's kind of self-regulates itself. You're never going to have a bunch of tours on the same weekend piled on.  So that just meant we have a more inventory to spread into '22, '23, and we're talking '24 now. So, I would say we have a backlog that needs to still work through the system in '22, '23. which will be incredibly strong years. And then we continue to get back to regular -- we've had over the year, double-digit growth in the live entertainment space ongoing. We project that to continue both on pricing and global volume as demand and supply continues to grow around the world. If you follow my Twitter, or what we're up to, we've been pretty active. We're back with our backlog of 30 to 40 things around the world. We're looking at that can keep propelling our business and growing our scale. So good pipe -- good pipeline will continue to be very aggressive at growing our global market share and then monetizing products on top of it. William, I would just add I don't want to ever forget that Ticketmaster is incredibly great at what they do on a global basis. If you're -- if you own a stadium, an arena, high-volume ticket business with complex season owners and regular tickets -- it's a complex business to do at scale. So, a lot of our customers, sometimes we may lose a customer, they end up coming back.  So, one, I just want to remind you, we've been investing in this platform for the last few years. Our enterprise platform is a world-class platform. The U.S. ticket market is the most complicated market in the world. Reserved seats equal season seats are a complex model to manage the 10 AM on on-sale with box and all the things that pressure your system so when at the core enterprise platform is really good. So, we're more out competing for that offering. We end up just being ultimately winning the business because we are the best at it.  And we see that because we see the clients that may leave. But end up coming back because the functionality that we provide is superior to others. We're seeing this in a Brooklyn arena last week where the competitor was trying to do a presale that broke and that's a pretty basic stuff. So, I just remind people we are in a global basis, the best of what we do. That's why clients pick us. And then we happen to be global and opening up all of our technology to a global base is going to be our great runway for the next while. And to Joe's point, I would just add what you also noticed is the -- it's all different genres in ages. So, this isn't just young kids are going to shows because they're not scared but the Eagles just had a wildly successful on arena tour that's going to finish up this week in Seattle. The Grateful Dead route doing full stadiums. Harry Styles obviously doing indoors to just record business as well as our amphitheater business.  So, we did -- we weren't sure going into the market what segment or what age demo would react differently, or if there would be a difference, and we saw huge demand across the board at all ages, all demos, all markets. So strong rebound back as we've seen with the early on sales going forward."

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir.\nMichael Rapino: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. As communities reopened, we're seeing the pent-up demand for live events play out as artists and fans are eager to reconnect in-person. In the U.S. and U.K., we're seeing strong ticket sales and the restart of our concerts and festivals highlighted over the past weekend by Lollapalooza and Rolling Loud in the U.S. and Latitude in the U.K. hosting three-quarters of a million fans combined. With the vaccine rollouts increasing throughout Canada and Europe, we expect additional markets to open up broadly in the coming months. And momentum for the return of live has been building every month, with ticket sales and concert attendance pacing faster than expected, underscoring the strength and resilience, the Concert business, live events in general. This progress combined with our cost discipline has enabled us to deliver positive AOI for the second quarter, well ahead of where we thought we would be for this quarter. We expect to see for the ramp up accelerate to the rest of the year with all segments returning to AOI profitability for the second half of the year, then it's up for a full-scale 2022. As we put more shows on sale for this year and next, ticket sales are the best early indicator for concerts and our overall business. To that end, June was Ticketmaster North America's fourth best month in history for transacted ticket volume. This was driven in part by our U.S. Concert division, putting the highest number of shows on sale ever during a single month, 50% more than the next highest mark back in 2019. In Concerts, our or recovery this summer continue to be led by our outdoor events at our festivals and amphitheaters. We expect to have over 6 million fans attend our festivals during the second half of the year, with about two-thirds of our festivals increasing their attendance compared to 2019. Most of our major festivals sold out in record time, while average ticket prices have been 10% higher than 2019. And while still early at our amphitheater shows over the past few weeks, we have delivered strong double-digit increase in average per fan revenue and onsite spending versus 2019. Looking forward to 2022 and that 2023, all our leading indicators continue to point to a roaring era for concerts and other live events. Starting with our Concerts division, every major venue type arenas, amphitheaters, and stadiums, our pipeline indicating double-digit growth in our show count and ticket sales relative to 2019 levels. In some cases, our pipeline is so strong, we are extending our planning into 2023 and even beginning to discuss tours that extended to 2024.  The same time, Ticketmaster's leading edge technology continues to attract new clients, adding 11 million net new feed bearing tickets so far this year, already surpassing any previous full year growth. As a result, Ticketmaster is set to benefit in 2022 from both increased Live Nation concert ticket sales, as well as additional sales from new clients. In our Sponsorship business, our brand partners have maintained and grown their interest in live events, with contracts and sponsorship up double-digits for 2022, where we were at this point in 2019 for 2020. As our revenue is rebounding, we continue to evolve our business to maximize opportunities and the global recovery and strengthen our flywheel. We have structurally reduced our cost basis by $200 million, making us more nimble and converting more of our revenue AOI. We have integrated our Ticketmaster team globally, enabling us to work toward a global product roadmap that will both reduce our costs and increase our flexibility and speed to deploy new client tools and approve our marketplace experience. And we continue to build our direct to consumer business initiatives ranging from streaming concerts NFTs to artists merchandise, bringing more value to artists and deepening fan relationships. These enhancements combined with our strongest supply and demand dynamics our industry has ever seen are fueling our core flywheel strategy and setting us up for multiple years of growth, attendance revenue, and AOI. And with that, I'll let Joe take you through more details of our results.\nJoe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As we've done over the past year, we've added some tables at the back of our earnings release that reconcile in more detail some of the numbers I will refer to today. In the second quarter, our AOI was positive for the first time since the start of the pandemic, as the U.S. by far our largest market, accelerated its reopening also driving our revenue to the highest level since the first quarter of last year. As a result, our contribution margin ramped up faster than expected, particularly in ticketing. Even with the increased activity, our monthly gross burn for the first half of the year was lower than the monthly burn during the last three quarters of 2020 due to our structural cost savings and continued cost discipline. As a result, we remain confident that actions taken to reduce cash burn and increased liquidity will provide us with the runway we need as shows return. And as we move toward reopening in more markets, we continue to balance the strong cost and cash management with making the necessary investments to grow the business. While we expect to generate positive AOI overall, and for each segment for the second half of the year, we will also reduce costs this year by over $800 million and reduce cash spend by $1.5 billion relative to pre-pandemic plans. Looking at our Q2 results. Revenue for the quarter was $576 million compared to $74 million in the second quarter of 2020 for growth of over $0.5 billion. All three of our business segments more than doubled their revenues from last year. Our AOI for the quarter was $10 million compared to a loss of $432 million for the second quarter of 2020. Our Q2, 2021 AOI consisted of $351 million of contribution margin, which included $364 million from operations, along with various one-time items, including gains from insurance recoveries and government support and losses from ticketing service fee refunds paid out. This was then offset by $341 million in operational fixed costs. Getting into our business segments a bit deeper, starting with ticketing, which was the primary driver of our results this quarter, contribution margin for the quarter was $204 million or nearly 60% of our total contribution margin delivering $99 million in AOI. Ticketing revenue for the quarter was $244 million or just over 40% of our total revenue for the quarter. Each month of a quarter, Ticketmaster had progressively stronger results, culminating with June being Ticketmaster North America's fourth best month ever for transacted ticket volume. In general, North America drove much of this resurgence, accounting for over 75% of total transacted tickets in the quarter as compared to approximately two-thirds of transacted tickets for 2019. Contract tickets drove much of this activity, and as a result, the top 10 artists sold over $513 million in GTV during second quarter this year compared to $329 million in the second quarter of 2019. Secondary ticketing has similarly rebounded. Our June GTV was only 8% below June of 2019. That trend has continued into the third quarter, with July 12th marking the highest resale GTV day in our history, driven by the U.S. Open along with strong NBA, NFL, and concert presale volumes. These results in ticketing are a leading indicator to our concerts business. For the second quarter, our concerts AOI loss of $84 million was an improvement of $127 million relative to Q2 last year, and our revenue was up $145 million relative to Q2 last year, as we promoted nearly 1,700 shows for 1.3 million fans during the quarter. More importantly, these tickets sales drove our event-related deferred revenue up to $2.1 billion, representing a pipeline of future activity, even higher than the $1.6 billion we had at the end of the second quarter in 2019. In part, this event-related deferred revenue is associated with over 25 million tickets we have sold for our concerts in the second half of this year, along with also being part of the 14 million tickets that we have already sold for concerts in 2022, which reflects strong double-digit growth in our 2022 pipeline for show count and fans relative to 2019. Sponsorship and advertising then naturally flow from our ticketing and concert platforms. Our sponsorship and advertising AOI for the quarter was $13 million and revenue was $45 million, with the bulk of our activity tied to our ticketing platform and concert presales. We continue to find brands are committed to maintaining or increasing their span with Live Nation to reach our music fans and other live event audiences. And during the quarter we added several long-term strategic partners, including Allegiant Air, Adobe and Cinch in the airline technology and auto sectors, respectively. And more broadly, we expect our sponsorship and advertising full-scale activity to return somewhere between ticketing and concerts timing. Most importantly, as we look out at our 2022 pipeline, confirmed activity is pacing well ahead of where we were in 2019 at this point. And with many multiyear contracts on the books, we are lining up to be growing this business in 2022 and beyond. Looking at free cash and liquidity. As of June 30th, we had total cash of $4 billion, including $1.1 billion in ticketing client cash and $1.8 billion in net concert event related cash, leaving free cash of $1.1 billion. This was flat relative to our first quarter reported number. Our free cash, along with $971 million of available debt capacity, gives us $2.1 billion in readily available liquidity up from $1.6 billion at the end of 2020, and steady with our Q1 ending liquidity. Benefiting our free cash position, the second quarter was $161 million in favorable timing, largely the result of classification of our event-related deferred revenue between short-term and long-term. Our total free cash usage in the quarter was $163 million or $54 million per month, which included $115 million per month of operational burn up from $100 million per month in the first quarter, as furloughed employees returned to prepare for our reopening and we reinstated full pay for most employees, plus another $58 million per month of non-operational costs, including investment in capital expenditures, acquisitions and artists and ticket client advances to give us $173 million average per month in gross burn. In Q2, we had $119 million average per month cash contribution margin, double our Q1 average. Turning to other balance sheet items, more on deferred revenue. At the end of the second quarter, event-related deferred revenue for shows that we'll play in the next 12 months was $2.1 billion, up from $1.5 billion at the end of the first quarter. Ticket sales in the second quarter were nearly $900 million, while refunds totaled $100 million and shifted deferred revenue from short-term to long-term for shows that were rescheduled into the back half of 2022, totaled $150 million. This long-term deferred revenue will then largely shift back to short-term during Q3 and Q4 reversing the timing benefit and free cash this quarter. Our total capital expenditures were $52 million for the first six months, with $38 million spent on revenue generating items. The markets have reopened faster than expected. We will similarly be accelerating some of our investments to take advantage of additional opportunities this year and into 2020. As a result, we now expect total capital expenditures for 2021 to be approximately $170 million, with over 60% of this spend going into revenue generating CapEx projects. Our total debt as of June 30th was $5.3 billion, and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.4%, with about 90% of that debt at a fixed rate. Finally, looking forward, as Michael said, we continue to expect concerts to scale further in the second half of this year in key markets, notably outdoor, and led by the U.S. and U.K. With this activity, we will continue to ramp up our operations, enabling Ticketmaster to run its on sale, the concerts division to book end market 2022 tours and sponsorship staff to support delivery for brands onsite and online. Given the COVID issues in our key markets appear to be short-term at this point, we continue to expect 2022 activity and results to exceed 2019 levels with continued growth opportunities from there. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session.  Your first question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Karnovsky: Hi. Thank you. Just with COVID kind of being what it is at the moment, the Delta variant, can you just maybe talk through how you're thinking about navigating some of the challenges that might come up in the next a month or two, like changing health mandates, shifts in demand, any hesitation or concerns on the part of the artist?\nJoe Berchtold: Sure. David, this is Joe. I think what we're seeing is a shift to increasing requirements for entry of either vaccinated or tested or fully vaccinated. We had Lollapalooza over the last weekend, very successfully done, over 90% of the people were fully vaccinated, which I think was a great signal in terms of people's commitment and support of being vaccinated in order to go to these shows. So, my expectation is that we will see that continue, whether at the artist's level, at the city level, like New York just announced or large crowds, frankly Lollapalooza certainly went above and beyond what was happening at baseball games in Chicago. And similarly, I think, in other markets we're going above what others are doing. So, we'll continue to focus on that. I think the great news is that at this point, the discussion is around what are the requirements to hold the events? What do we need to see in terms of vaccinations and testing? Not hearing discussions, certainly in the U.S. or the U.K. about impacting those shows to any scale.\nDavid Karnovsky: Got it. And I know you just restarted the amp and the festivals, but any early insights in the fan behavior so far. You mentioned per caps are up at the amp, is there any additional color you can provide what's driving that. And then, maybe with digital ticketing, any learnings from having that tech kind of rolled out at scale across your own music venue footprint? Thanks. \nJoe Berchtold: Yeah. At this point, we've probably done about 50 amp shows that we've gotten the data on in time for today's call. And as we said, all of that looks to be continuing to trend up. People are buying more food and beverage. We're selling more VIP packages, more upsells. So, in general, the pocket books are open. I think it's pretty mature to get any real specific inferences. And I think it's also just -- it's a little bit early to get the specific impact of digital ticketing. We believe that eliminating friction always helps commerce, but we probably won't have the data on that till our next call.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Laszczyk: Hey, great. Thank you. On the 2022 concert pipeline being up double-digits versus 2019, I was wondering if you could give us a sentence on how much of the pipeline is for sale today or sold today versus how much is still to come. And then, as you maybe look out over the next few quarters, how much headroom do you think is left to grow the concert slate in 2022, given some of the scheduling and health constraints you're working with, any commentary, there would be helpful.\nJoe Berchtold: Sure. We are -- go ahead.\nMichael Rapino: So, I'll start Joe, and then you jump. Most of our 2022 new tours wouldn't be on sale yet. Most of -- what you see on sale is what would have been rescheduled from 2021 are already on sale. So, we have a large on-sell slate plan between now and end of the year for most of the big global tours that will go out in 2022. And we're not -- we're very content with our 2022 lineup right now. We're talking mostly about what to add now into 2023 and 2024. So that idea that -- it's just one year of -- our bigness isn't really true. We've got three, four years here of strong demand that we're going to smooth out over the time, so everyone can get the right markets and the right Friday nights and the right dates. So, we see a good few year run with all this pent-up inventory.\nStephen Laszczyk: Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, on the Ticketmaster side, and you mentioned you had an 11 million net new fee bearing tickets year-to-date. I think I was up from around 5 million last quarter. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about who you're winning this ticket business from. Is this a certain types of venues, league teams, maybe some of the things that's resonating with your pitch with these potential ticketing partners. Thank you.\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah. It's really happening on a global basis. We're seeing it in the U.S. We're seeing in Europe. We're seeing it in Asia. We put out various releases in terms of -- as we've been picking up some clients, but I wouldn't say that there's one market or one type of client in particular. It's pretty broad. I do think what's resonating is we've been very loud in terms of artist clearing the extent to which we're continuing to invest in ticketing, in the shift to digital ticketing and the benefit that that's going to be giving to the teams, the venues and the customers. And that seems to be working with the clients we're talking to.\nStephen Laszczyk: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Janedis with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Janedis: Thanks. I just had two questions. One was, with the expectations for the touring supercycle over the next, call it, two to three years. Can you talk about how you're thinking about the demand side in terms of fans and do you assume sale ups for the cycle are at pre-pandemic levels or maybe higher or lower? And then, on the ticketing margin side, there was -- a lift there. Is that a chunk of the $200 million in cost savings is kicking in and there's something close to that level of new normal, or are there any items to call out?\nMichael Rapino: I'll do demand side. I think we -- from the data we're seeing so far, everything we seem to be putting on sale is doing better than pre-pandemic. So, demand seems to be pent-up most of what we see going up for 2022 is great quality, tourists and artists. So, we would expect, as we've seen over the last 10 years, demand, overall for live on a global basis, has continually been growing.  We like to always point out, we think that the product is still under priced, given all of the secondary business. So, this is still an attractive night out for a fan. And now that artists traveling more around the world, the fan base has grown for live as a functional -- entertainment item. So, we think global demand will continue, have double-digit growth as an industry for many years to come as the global landscape continues to grow.\nJoe Berchtold: And then, John, on the TM margin, I mean, clearly, I spoke in my comments that we're looking this year, that we're going to be reducing our total cost structure by about $800 million relative to where we were pre-pandemic. And the $200 million structural savings is a subset of that. So, what we're navigating this year is the pace at which we bring back some of the costs versus the pace at which we ramp up activity. And it's not going to be totally linear. We had a great month of June in TM, and we're finally getting back to scale there and we expect to have nice scale with Ticketmaster in the second half, but the first part of the year was lower scale. So, overall, yeah, we expect margins to improve, because a large chunk of that $200 million is going to come out of Ticketmaster and that would just naturally flow into a margin. I wouldn't try to overly analyze the single quarter and let's get you a few more quarters at more traditional scale, with more traditional costs and staffing over the next six months.\nJohn Janedis: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Ross: Thanks. A couple of questions ago, the conversation centered around ticketing wins and press releases for you guys. And I thought one of the more interesting developments in the quarter was the extension and expansion of your relationship with ASM. For two reasons, one is that ASM's, obviously half AEG and it didn't go to access. But more so that Ticketmaster could sell tickets for Live Nation promoted shows in the other ASM venues. And the North American ticket model's been exclusive for -- as long as I can remember, at least. Is this a sign of change in the future? Do you think that exclusivity model is here to stay, or do you think depending on event type, the promoter will ultimately control the ticket?\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah. I think the exclusive approach has worked well for the venues and the ecosystem is a large part of how the venues get funded and how the venues then make the rental costs approachable for promoters and artists. So, it's an ecosystem that's worked well in the U.S. and the Ticketmaster, as you know, has been a very large source of funding and the profit stream for the venues. I wouldn't read too much into this. If you look at ASM scale, that's not a common, typical scale in terms of the number of buildings they have. It's also a fairly unique situation where you have somebody who owns buildings. Who's saying, we're going to let you bring in Ticketmaster regardless of the situation. And they control both sides of that decision-making. It's not something that we are looking to do or that we see as any real mark of the industry going forward.\nMichael Rapino: What I would add, Brandon, I think the most -- Brandon, I wouldn't say the most important thing you said is what you lead with is the fact that ASM owned by AEG and a private equity fund, the largest venue management company, obviously did their homework and debated their own ticket options and renewed with Ticketmaster, because we ultimately provide the best global solution in ticketing for them. I assume they would have liked to have used their own in-house ticketing system. But I think our relationship and what we've done for all those venues for so long, won us that business, the met renewal. So that was a very important renewal, a very good testament to Ticketmaster. I give the ASM management team credit, they put their bias aside and what was the best option in the marketplace after looking at all options. So, we are very proud that that's a very good testament to the Ticketmaster core competency. You hit that part for sure.\nBrandon Ross: Cool. Thanks.\nMichael Rapino: And you can update your Twitter now that we've talked about COVID and Delta. We assumed it would -- what happened on this call.\nBrandon Ross: Great.\nOperator: Your next question comes from \u2026\nJoe Berchtold: Sorry. We missed that. Is there a question? Operator? Operator?\nOperator: I apologize. Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nBen Swinburne: Hi. Can you hear me?\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah. Ben, big build up.\nBen Swinburne: Yeah. Better not follow it. A couple of questions. So, you ended your prepared remarks, I think by saying you continue to expect 2022 activity levels to exceed 2019. And I apologize if that's a reiteration of prior guidance that I might've missed. But just wanted to ask you what you meant by that. Is that a comment about revenue and AOI? I know where -- the street expectations are, but I thought I'd give you a chance to maybe expand on that. And then, the second question is just, you made a helpful comment around sponsorship saying that I think contracted business is up double-digits for 2022 relative to where you were in 2019 for 2020. I guess similar question, the ticketing question, how much of the forward year is sort of already in the books typically to understand what that tells us about next year and make sure we don't over extrapolate that comment about growth for a sponsorship. Thank you.\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah. Just in terms of overall 2022 expectations. First, it starts for us with what are the concert bookings. What are the show count look like? And from that, our expectations on the ticket counts, both of which we think, again, are up relative to 2019 based on what we said. And I think as we've gone through the past three months, whatever we said three months ago, we're more confident in that at this point. And as a result, we expect then revenue and AOI growth relative to 2019 as well to be and sponsorship, then we'll be a part of that expectation, up double-digits and committed sponsorship. Usually you'd have -- I mean, we've talked about how much of our sponsorship is in the form of multiyear, multi-million dollar, multi-asset strategic sponsors. That's a large portion of our sponsorship base. So, last -- we probably wouldn't be talking about expectations of growth for next year already at this point, unless we had a pretty good feel that a lot of it was committed. \nBen Swinburne: Sure. Makes sense. Great. Thank you very much.\nJoe Berchtold: Operator? Operator, do we have any other questions? David Katz, if you're on the line, can you go ahead and ask your question? I think you're next to the queue. Can you hear us?\nOperator: Yes. I apologize. Your next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Katz: Okay. If you can all hear me okay.\nJoe Berchtold: Yep. No problem.\nDavid Katz: Appreciate you taking my question. Appreciate all the detail. What I wanted to ask about since it is prevalent in a lot of other areas of our coverage is, the issue of human resources and labor, where we have seen a lot of constraints around, frankly getting people to come back to work. You made a comment about it in your prepared remarks, bringing people back at full salaries and so forth. Is that a matter that you have had to deal with work around, strategize around and how do you see it?\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah. Start with, as you know, unfortunately we had to furlough a reasonable number of people over the course of the last year. At this point, we've brought back over 90% of our furloughed staff, of those we've called back over 90% have returned furlough. We had a fairly low turnover rate and we think turnover rate at, or below the overall entertainment industry. So, we feel very good about how we've been able to retain staff. I think it's a testimony to people's commitment to our industry and the culture that we've built here. So, in terms of the core people that are the ones that we've talked about, bringing back the shows, bringing back the ticketing and the sponsorship, those people are in place. As we've put on our shows in various amphitheaters and festivals sites around the country and around the world, we've been able to get the volume of people we needed. It hasn't been a material cost impact, taking in total. And we've had to work a bit harder at times to find the people, but it has not impacted our ability to put on the shows.\nDavid Katz: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nMichael Rapino: And I would add to that. I think the only piece that we're working through right now is the -- all the part-time employees that are on the front of the line at the amphitheater, at the festival, we're going to be rolling out soon our kind of mandated vaccine for our employees. We're going to move forward and be very progressive on ensuring all our employees are vaccinated. And we're going to move lower with artists and managers, where we're seeing there -- the likes of these artists that are going to want fully vaccinated and tested shows as ways to continue to keep the show moving forward. So, I think that the biggest challenge we've had is just scrambling on a day-to-day basis with part-time employees back, and abiding by different local COVID laws, mask, no mask, now test no test. I think that's been our only real challenge from an HR and communication. So, hats off to my frontline. They're doing an incredible job, running, hard, trying to adjust, and we're going to move to more central protocols now on mandating the backseat and helping them out, make sure they're all safe, too.\nDavid Katz: Super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve \u2026\nJoe Berchtold: We are back here, operator. We missed the name.\nMichael Rapino: Well, we can put a concert on, but on a conference call.\nOperator: Steve Glagola, your line is now live.\nMichael Rapino: Steve?\nJoe Berchtold: Hey, Steve. Go ahead.\nStephen Glagola: Hi, guys. Thank you. Well, you still have the best earnings call music. So, if that means anything. I'd say -- I just had a question on, can you discuss how much the ticketing GTV was tied to sports versus concerts in the quarter, and how you see that mix over the second half of the year?\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah. Those were certainly the two largest components, concerts and sports. And we'll again in the second half as we relaunch -- second half relaunch, NBA, NHL, NFL, all of those at scale. So you'll have a big full season of the three major sports. And at the same time, you're going to have a massive on sale for 2022. I wouldn't try to parse exactly which one's bigger than the other in a given month, but those two will be the two key drivers as they were in the past few months.\nStephen Glagola: Okay. Thanks, Joe. And I don't know if you've already said this, so I apologize. But on the guidance for AOI profitability across every segment in the second half, is that for each quarter or is that just the sum of Q3 and Q4?\nJoe Berchtold: We just -- our comment was for the sum of Q3 and Q4 that each segment, we expect to be AOI positive.\nStephen Glagola: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to close the call out. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joe Berchtold",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As we've done over the past year, we've added some tables at the back of our earnings release that reconcile in more detail some of the numbers I will refer to today. In the second quarter, our AOI was positive for the first time since the start of the pandemic, as the U.S. by far our largest market, accelerated its reopening also driving our revenue to the highest level since the first quarter of last year. As a result, our contribution margin ramped up faster than expected, particularly in ticketing. Even with the increased activity, our monthly gross burn for the first half of the year was lower than the monthly burn during the last three quarters of 2020 due to our structural cost savings and continued cost discipline. As a result, we remain confident that actions taken to reduce cash burn and increased liquidity will provide us with the runway we need as shows return. And as we move toward reopening in more markets, we continue to balance the strong cost and cash management with making the necessary investments to grow the business. While we expect to generate positive AOI overall, and for each segment for the second half of the year, we will also reduce costs this year by over $800 million and reduce cash spend by $1.5 billion relative to pre-pandemic plans. Looking at our Q2 results. Revenue for the quarter was $576 million compared to $74 million in the second quarter of 2020 for growth of over $0.5 billion. All three of our business segments more than doubled their revenues from last year. Our AOI for the quarter was $10 million compared to a loss of $432 million for the second quarter of 2020. Our Q2, 2021 AOI consisted of $351 million of contribution margin, which included $364 million from operations, along with various one-time items, including gains from insurance recoveries and government support and losses from ticketing service fee refunds paid out. This was then offset by $341 million in operational fixed costs. Getting into our business segments a bit deeper, starting with ticketing, which was the primary driver of our results this quarter, contribution margin for the quarter was $204 million or nearly 60% of our total contribution margin delivering $99 million in AOI. Ticketing revenue for the quarter was $244 million or just over 40% of our total revenue for the quarter. Each month of a quarter, Ticketmaster had progressively stronger results, culminating with June being Ticketmaster North America's fourth best month ever for transacted ticket volume. In general, North America drove much of this resurgence, accounting for over 75% of total transacted tickets in the quarter as compared to approximately two-thirds of transacted tickets for 2019. Contract tickets drove much of this activity, and as a result, the top 10 artists sold over $513 million in GTV during second quarter this year compared to $329 million in the second quarter of 2019. Secondary ticketing has similarly rebounded. Our June GTV was only 8% below June of 2019. That trend has continued into the third quarter, with July 12th marking the highest resale GTV day in our history, driven by the U.S. Open along with strong NBA, NFL, and concert presale volumes. These results in ticketing are a leading indicator to our concerts business. For the second quarter, our concerts AOI loss of $84 million was an improvement of $127 million relative to Q2 last year, and our revenue was up $145 million relative to Q2 last year, as we promoted nearly 1,700 shows for 1.3 million fans during the quarter. More importantly, these tickets sales drove our event-related deferred revenue up to $2.1 billion, representing a pipeline of future activity, even higher than the $1.6 billion we had at the end of the second quarter in 2019. In part, this event-related deferred revenue is associated with over 25 million tickets we have sold for our concerts in the second half of this year, along with also being part of the 14 million tickets that we have already sold for concerts in 2022, which reflects strong double-digit growth in our 2022 pipeline for show count and fans relative to 2019. Sponsorship and advertising then naturally flow from our ticketing and concert platforms. Our sponsorship and advertising AOI for the quarter was $13 million and revenue was $45 million, with the bulk of our activity tied to our ticketing platform and concert presales. We continue to find brands are committed to maintaining or increasing their span with Live Nation to reach our music fans and other live event audiences. And during the quarter we added several long-term strategic partners, including Allegiant Air, Adobe and Cinch in the airline technology and auto sectors, respectively. And more broadly, we expect our sponsorship and advertising full-scale activity to return somewhere between ticketing and concerts timing. Most importantly, as we look out at our 2022 pipeline, confirmed activity is pacing well ahead of where we were in 2019 at this point. And with many multiyear contracts on the books, we are lining up to be growing this business in 2022 and beyond. Looking at free cash and liquidity. As of June 30th, we had total cash of $4 billion, including $1.1 billion in ticketing client cash and $1.8 billion in net concert event related cash, leaving free cash of $1.1 billion. This was flat relative to our first quarter reported number. Our free cash, along with $971 million of available debt capacity, gives us $2.1 billion in readily available liquidity up from $1.6 billion at the end of 2020, and steady with our Q1 ending liquidity. Benefiting our free cash position, the second quarter was $161 million in favorable timing, largely the result of classification of our event-related deferred revenue between short-term and long-term. Our total free cash usage in the quarter was $163 million or $54 million per month, which included $115 million per month of operational burn up from $100 million per month in the first quarter, as furloughed employees returned to prepare for our reopening and we reinstated full pay for most employees, plus another $58 million per month of non-operational costs, including investment in capital expenditures, acquisitions and artists and ticket client advances to give us $173 million average per month in gross burn. In Q2, we had $119 million average per month cash contribution margin, double our Q1 average. Turning to other balance sheet items, more on deferred revenue. At the end of the second quarter, event-related deferred revenue for shows that we'll play in the next 12 months was $2.1 billion, up from $1.5 billion at the end of the first quarter. Ticket sales in the second quarter were nearly $900 million, while refunds totaled $100 million and shifted deferred revenue from short-term to long-term for shows that were rescheduled into the back half of 2022, totaled $150 million. This long-term deferred revenue will then largely shift back to short-term during Q3 and Q4 reversing the timing benefit and free cash this quarter. Our total capital expenditures were $52 million for the first six months, with $38 million spent on revenue generating items. The markets have reopened faster than expected. We will similarly be accelerating some of our investments to take advantage of additional opportunities this year and into 2020. As a result, we now expect total capital expenditures for 2021 to be approximately $170 million, with over 60% of this spend going into revenue generating CapEx projects. Our total debt as of June 30th was $5.3 billion, and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.4%, with about 90% of that debt at a fixed rate. Finally, looking forward, as Michael said, we continue to expect concerts to scale further in the second half of this year in key markets, notably outdoor, and led by the U.S. and U.K. With this activity, we will continue to ramp up our operations, enabling Ticketmaster to run its on sale, the concerts division to book end market 2022 tours and sponsorship staff to support delivery for brands onsite and online. Given the COVID issues in our key markets appear to be short-term at this point, we continue to expect 2022 activity and results to exceed 2019 levels with continued growth opportunities from there. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator? Sure. David, this is Joe. I think what we're seeing is a shift to increasing requirements for entry of either vaccinated or tested or fully vaccinated. We had Lollapalooza over the last weekend, very successfully done, over 90% of the people were fully vaccinated, which I think was a great signal in terms of people's commitment and support of being vaccinated in order to go to these shows. So, my expectation is that we will see that continue, whether at the artist's level, at the city level, like New York just announced or large crowds, frankly Lollapalooza certainly went above and beyond what was happening at baseball games in Chicago. And similarly, I think, in other markets we're going above what others are doing. So, we'll continue to focus on that. I think the great news is that at this point, the discussion is around what are the requirements to hold the events? What do we need to see in terms of vaccinations and testing? Not hearing discussions, certainly in the U.S. or the U.K. about impacting those shows to any scale. Yeah. At this point, we've probably done about 50 amp shows that we've gotten the data on in time for today's call. And as we said, all of that looks to be continuing to trend up. People are buying more food and beverage. We're selling more VIP packages, more upsells. So, in general, the pocket books are open. I think it's pretty mature to get any real specific inferences. And I think it's also just -- it's a little bit early to get the specific impact of digital ticketing. We believe that eliminating friction always helps commerce, but we probably won't have the data on that till our next call. Sure. We are -- go ahead. Yeah. It's really happening on a global basis. We're seeing it in the U.S. We're seeing in Europe. We're seeing it in Asia. We put out various releases in terms of -- as we've been picking up some clients, but I wouldn't say that there's one market or one type of client in particular. It's pretty broad. I do think what's resonating is we've been very loud in terms of artist clearing the extent to which we're continuing to invest in ticketing, in the shift to digital ticketing and the benefit that that's going to be giving to the teams, the venues and the customers. And that seems to be working with the clients we're talking to. And then, John, on the TM margin, I mean, clearly, I spoke in my comments that we're looking this year, that we're going to be reducing our total cost structure by about $800 million relative to where we were pre-pandemic. And the $200 million structural savings is a subset of that. So, what we're navigating this year is the pace at which we bring back some of the costs versus the pace at which we ramp up activity. And it's not going to be totally linear. We had a great month of June in TM, and we're finally getting back to scale there and we expect to have nice scale with Ticketmaster in the second half, but the first part of the year was lower scale. So, overall, yeah, we expect margins to improve, because a large chunk of that $200 million is going to come out of Ticketmaster and that would just naturally flow into a margin. I wouldn't try to overly analyze the single quarter and let's get you a few more quarters at more traditional scale, with more traditional costs and staffing over the next six months. Yeah. I think the exclusive approach has worked well for the venues and the ecosystem is a large part of how the venues get funded and how the venues then make the rental costs approachable for promoters and artists. So, it's an ecosystem that's worked well in the U.S. and the Ticketmaster, as you know, has been a very large source of funding and the profit stream for the venues. I wouldn't read too much into this. If you look at ASM scale, that's not a common, typical scale in terms of the number of buildings they have. It's also a fairly unique situation where you have somebody who owns buildings. Who's saying, we're going to let you bring in Ticketmaster regardless of the situation. And they control both sides of that decision-making. It's not something that we are looking to do or that we see as any real mark of the industry going forward. Sorry. We missed that. Is there a question? Operator? Operator? Yeah. Ben, big build up. Yeah. Just in terms of overall 2022 expectations. First, it starts for us with what are the concert bookings. What are the show count look like? And from that, our expectations on the ticket counts, both of which we think, again, are up relative to 2019 based on what we said. And I think as we've gone through the past three months, whatever we said three months ago, we're more confident in that at this point. And as a result, we expect then revenue and AOI growth relative to 2019 as well to be and sponsorship, then we'll be a part of that expectation, up double-digits and committed sponsorship. Usually you'd have -- I mean, we've talked about how much of our sponsorship is in the form of multiyear, multi-million dollar, multi-asset strategic sponsors. That's a large portion of our sponsorship base. So, last -- we probably wouldn't be talking about expectations of growth for next year already at this point, unless we had a pretty good feel that a lot of it was committed. Operator? Operator, do we have any other questions? David Katz, if you're on the line, can you go ahead and ask your question? I think you're next to the queue. Can you hear us? Yep. No problem. Yeah. Start with, as you know, unfortunately we had to furlough a reasonable number of people over the course of the last year. At this point, we've brought back over 90% of our furloughed staff, of those we've called back over 90% have returned furlough. We had a fairly low turnover rate and we think turnover rate at, or below the overall entertainment industry. So, we feel very good about how we've been able to retain staff. I think it's a testimony to people's commitment to our industry and the culture that we've built here.

            "name": "Michael Rapino",
            "content": "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. As communities reopened, we're seeing the pent-up demand for live events play out as artists and fans are eager to reconnect in-person. In the U.S. and U.K., we're seeing strong ticket sales and the restart of our concerts and festivals highlighted over the past weekend by Lollapalooza and Rolling Loud in the U.S. and Latitude in the U.K. hosting three-quarters of a million fans combined. With the vaccine rollouts increasing throughout Canada and Europe, we expect additional markets to open up broadly in the coming months. And momentum for the return of live has been building every month, with ticket sales and concert attendance pacing faster than expected, underscoring the strength and resilience, the Concert business, live events in general. This progress combined with our cost discipline has enabled us to deliver positive AOI for the second quarter, well ahead of where we thought we would be for this quarter. We expect to see for the ramp up accelerate to the rest of the year with all segments returning to AOI profitability for the second half of the year, then it's up for a full-scale 2022. As we put more shows on sale for this year and next, ticket sales are the best early indicator for concerts and our overall business. To that end, June was Ticketmaster North America's fourth best month in history for transacted ticket volume. This was driven in part by our U.S. Concert division, putting the highest number of shows on sale ever during a single month, 50% more than the next highest mark back in 2019. In Concerts, our or recovery this summer continue to be led by our outdoor events at our festivals and amphitheaters. We expect to have over 6 million fans attend our festivals during the second half of the year, with about two-thirds of our festivals increasing their attendance compared to 2019. Most of our major festivals sold out in record time, while average ticket prices have been 10% higher than 2019. And while still early at our amphitheater shows over the past few weeks, we have delivered strong double-digit increase in average per fan revenue and onsite spending versus 2019. Looking forward to 2022 and that 2023, all our leading indicators continue to point to a roaring era for concerts and other live events. Starting with our Concerts division, every major venue type arenas, amphitheaters, and stadiums, our pipeline indicating double-digit growth in our show count and ticket sales relative to 2019 levels. In some cases, our pipeline is so strong, we are extending our planning into 2023 and even beginning to discuss tours that extended to 2024.  The same time, Ticketmaster's leading edge technology continues to attract new clients, adding 11 million net new feed bearing tickets so far this year, already surpassing any previous full year growth. As a result, Ticketmaster is set to benefit in 2022 from both increased Live Nation concert ticket sales, as well as additional sales from new clients. In our Sponsorship business, our brand partners have maintained and grown their interest in live events, with contracts and sponsorship up double-digits for 2022, where we were at this point in 2019 for 2020. As our revenue is rebounding, we continue to evolve our business to maximize opportunities and the global recovery and strengthen our flywheel. We have structurally reduced our cost basis by $200 million, making us more nimble and converting more of our revenue AOI. We have integrated our Ticketmaster team globally, enabling us to work toward a global product roadmap that will both reduce our costs and increase our flexibility and speed to deploy new client tools and approve our marketplace experience. And we continue to build our direct to consumer business initiatives ranging from streaming concerts NFTs to artists merchandise, bringing more value to artists and deepening fan relationships. These enhancements combined with our strongest supply and demand dynamics our industry has ever seen are fueling our core flywheel strategy and setting us up for multiple years of growth, attendance revenue, and AOI. And with that, I'll let Joe take you through more details of our results. So, I'll start Joe, and then you jump. Most of our 2022 new tours wouldn't be on sale yet. Most of -- what you see on sale is what would have been rescheduled from 2021 are already on sale. So, we have a large on-sell slate plan between now and end of the year for most of the big global tours that will go out in 2022. And we're not -- we're very content with our 2022 lineup right now. We're talking mostly about what to add now into 2023 and 2024. So that idea that -- it's just one year of -- our bigness isn't really true. We've got three, four years here of strong demand that we're going to smooth out over the time, so everyone can get the right markets and the right Friday nights and the right dates. So, we see a good few year run with all this pent-up inventory. I'll do demand side. I think we -- from the data we're seeing so far, everything we seem to be putting on sale is doing better than pre-pandemic. So, demand seems to be pent-up most of what we see going up for 2022 is great quality, tourists and artists. So, we would expect, as we've seen over the last 10 years, demand, overall for live on a global basis, has continually been growing.  We like to always point out, we think that the product is still under priced, given all of the secondary business. So, this is still an attractive night out for a fan. And now that artists traveling more around the world, the fan base has grown for live as a functional -- entertainment item. So, we think global demand will continue, have double-digit growth as an industry for many years to come as the global landscape continues to grow. What I would add, Brandon, I think the most -- Brandon, I wouldn't say the most important thing you said is what you lead with is the fact that ASM owned by AEG and a private equity fund, the largest venue management company, obviously did their homework and debated their own ticket options and renewed with Ticketmaster, because we ultimately provide the best global solution in ticketing for them. I assume they would have liked to have used their own in-house ticketing system. But I think our relationship and what we've done for all those venues for so long, won us that business, the met renewal. So that was a very important renewal, a very good testament to Ticketmaster. I give the ASM management team credit, they put their bias aside and what was the best option in the marketplace after looking at all options. So, we are very proud that that's a very good testament to the Ticketmaster core competency. You hit that part for sure. And you can update your Twitter now that we've talked about COVID and Delta. We assumed it would -- what happened on this call. And I would add to that. I think the only piece that we're working through right now is the -- all the part-time employees that are on the front of the line at the amphitheater, at the festival, we're going to be rolling out soon our kind of mandated vaccine for our employees. We're going to move forward and be very progressive on ensuring all our employees are vaccinated. And we're going to move lower with artists and managers, where we're seeing there -- the likes of these artists that are going to want fully vaccinated and tested shows as ways to continue to keep the show moving forward. So, I think that the biggest challenge we've had is just scrambling on a day-to-day basis with part-time employees back, and abiding by different local COVID laws, mask, no mask, now test no test. I think that's been our only real challenge from an HR and communication. So, hats off to my frontline. They're doing an incredible job, running, hard, trying to adjust, and we're going to move to more central protocols now on mandating the backseat and helping them out, make sure they're all safe, too. Well, we can put a concert on, but on a conference call. Steve?"

In the UK, over 50% of the population has received at least one vaccine dose and their reopening roadmap is tracking to plan. And although Europe remains a few months behind on vaccinations, they are progressing and recent discussions about reopening to international visitors this summer are encouraging. Around the world, people are showing the need to get out and socialize once again, which reinforces our expectation that a return to concerts will be the logical progression as vaccines are readily available to everyone who wants one. This is generally already in the case in the US, where we are confidently planning our reopenings, particularly front door shows, and we expect other major markets will follow this summer. Alongside these trends, we are seeing the effects of significant pent-up demand as fans are buying tickets and events are selling out faster than ever. In the US, Bonnaroo, Electric Daisy and Rolling Loud festivals all sold out in record times at full capacity. In the UK, we have 11 festivals planned this summer, including our largest ones Reading, Leeds and Parklife where tickets are already sold out. New Zealand, the country's largest festival, Rhythm and Vines quickly sold out. And as we get further clarity on reopening timelines, we are announcing more tours for late this summer, including Dave Matthews, Luke Bryan, Maroon 5 and others to come, showing artists' increasing confidence in performing this summer.\nJoe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As we have done over the past few quarters, we've added some tables at the back of our earnings release, to reconcile in more detail some of the numbers I will refer to today. For the first quarter, all the key cost and cash numbers improved relative to Q4 2020 and are at or better than what we expected at the start of the quarter. We remain confident that our actions taken to cut costs and increased liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until we bring shows back, which will begin to scale in key markets outdoor this summer. As we move toward reopening, we continue to balance strong cost and cash management. We are now making the necessary investments to grow the business. While we expect the second quarter to be our first year-on-year improvement since Q4 of 2019, and to also be generating positive AOI through the second half of the year, we still plan on reducing costs this year by $750 million and reducing cash spend by $1.5 billion, relative to pre-pandemic plans.\nMichael Rapino: Before taking questions, I wanted to cover one other thing. Kathy Willard, our CFO for the past 15 years will be retiring as of June 30. She will be than staying on as an advisor throughout the end of the year. As of July 1, the plan is for Joe Berchtold to become CFO. Kathy as you know has been an invaluable part of our executive team for the past 15 years and been with Live Nation for over 20. We are a much stronger company because of her, not just from her role as CFO, but as a champion for women at the company and the industry, an important adviser to me on a range of issues. Because she built such an effective finance organization, I'm confident we will remain in good shape as Joe steps in. He and Kathy have been working together closely for over a decade now and he has gotten more deeply involved over the past year, as we have been planning this transition. In addition, late last year we elevated Jackie Beato, EVP of Operations to take on greater responsibility and give Joe the bandwidth he will need for the job. More than anything, I want to thank Kathy for her impact on the Company, her commitment and her friendship. Operator, let's open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session.  Your first question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Karnovsky: I'm going to a question.  And Kathy, if you're on the call, good luck and you'll will be missed. And I guess with regards to the summer, early fall, Michael or Joe, can you provide a sense for how much is booked at this point relative to a normal year in the US or UK? And just given the lead time, how much room do you have still kind of ramp that higher shoot conditions improve further from here?\nJoe Berchtold: Yes. This is Joe. David, I'd say that the summer and early fall, next three to four months is largely booked. We obviously have a lot that is shifted from last year into this year. We've added some tours so we've also added a number of festivals, all of which have been selling well. So the typical ramp show is probably a couple of months' lead time, so I think we'll still have room to be adding more as we get into August and September, but the majority has been booked at this point.\nDavid Karnovsky: Okay. And then, can you maybe just expand a bit on the reviews following landscape over the next 12 to 18 months given all the supply that's built on? How do you expect to kind of efficiently allocated out all the tours? Are there any capacity constraints, not necessarily in terms of venues, but just in terms of maybe like the weekend nights that are available?\nJoe Berchtold: Yes. We're currently in that good position. We have lots of great conversations with probably every artist you can imagine, talking about when they're going to be back on the road. And artist typically tours once every three years on a cycle, so we're kind of condensing 2021 and '22. So the good news is we've got incredible supply and now we're just sorting through what makes sense to go out in '20 -- at the end of '21 still -- into '22, and some artists were talking about moving into '23. So I would say, the artists are patient and they're smart in terms of what their cycle is predicting, maybe they have a record coming out in the fall, maybe it's in Q1. So right now, we have a great supply. We don't have any issues in terms of availability. But we're also not looking to cram everything in three years into one year. We're looking to stage a good '22 into '23 year. So when you spread it over those two years, you find enough Fridays and enough weekends and enough routing challenges come to be solved that way.\nDavid Karnovsky: Okay. And if I could just sneak one more in. I guess this Concerts activity is now ramping up, can you maybe just discuss a little bit about what the process has been for Live Nation? What are you finding you can do it differently versus prior to the pandemic? And maybe just what your overall confidence level is in hitting your prior target for structural cost savings? Thanks.\nJoe Berchtold: Yes. We're very confident we're going to hit the structural $200 million cost savings we given you. As we've talked about, we've done it the opposite way, which is we took $950 million of cost out, and so now it's a matter of how we let $750 million of costs back in over a period of time. So that gives us -- that makes it more real if you will. We've done a number of things. On the Ticketing side, we've talked about, we've shifted that to a truly global organization as part of moving into a true single approach on the marketplace, on the enterprise and on all the technology. On the Concert side, we have a longstanding local network, which is very important to continue to understand the markets. So the 80% of your shows now booked to be tours, you don't need to have an entire infrastructure in every local market. So we've been seeing that there are ways of streamlining it and when we were growing double-digits every year through most of the last decade, it wasn't worth the potential disruption. But as we've stopped, we've asked ourselves, what's the best way to do this rebuilding from the ground up. And we're very confident, it's going to deliver those savings and be an even more effective organization for driving future growth.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you.\nMichael Rapino: And just to add to Joe, I think there's two ways to look at the business. We got -- we had a great workout, testing a new muscle for the last 12 months in terms of our balance sheet, our fixed costs and how we can become more efficient. And I think that you're going to see come to life through our $200 million-plus. But I think the real win of the downtime was what is the new products of the kind of Live Nation 3.0? What else are we going to do with this incredible scale we have across our consumer base? So I would say whether it's Sponsorship, Concerts or Ticketmaster, we would have a new level of new products in the pipe that we had not historically had the time, nor the skill set to kind of unlock. So I'm very confident over the next couple of years, we're going to see some exciting new things coming out of the Concert division. Our consumer side of the business -- our Subscription business, our Ticketmaster business, our new Ad business models we're looking at. So a bunch of exciting ideas now finally had months and months to put some people around and skill set that we've acquired to advance that part of our business. So, we look at the future is not only can we run the largest concert company in the world more efficiently and the best at it, but also what other new products will drive our business to think differently about the customer and the artist.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Ross: Hello. Just -- I guess you just mentioned Live Nation 3.0, so figured I take it web 3.0. And you earlier mentioned the digital ticket and the ability to now integrates blockchain. I was wondering if you could help us understand what the extra advantages are to utilizing the blockchain versus your current version of the digital ticket? And maybe how heavy of a lift that is for you and what tactic plan to use?\nMichael Rapino: Thanks, Brandon. It's a great question. We got asked it every day and I read a new article every day on all the great things it's going to solve. So let's step back in blockchain, we think it's a very exciting technology. We're currently using blockchain technology in our products. We've invested in this business for a few years now and we think it's a great technology that will help our business. I would step back from what are the problems that we're trying to solve or what are the opportunities that blockchain specifically brings to the Ticketing business. One of the great advantages in the industry is when we went from a TDF to a digital ticket, we unlocked a lot of what you keep reading about the blockchain is going to do in the future. So the digital ticket or your mobile ticket that you are now buying has solved the biggest problem that unlocked we've been talking about this for two years Identity. Identity for us, the fan, the artist, the team and the venue knowing who sits on that seat, who is actually coming to the venue, having a communication directly with them, having a verified ticket, being able to trade that ticket, putting rules on that ticket. We currently do that now. If you want to, can you transfer it with a certain cap, all of those things that content could decide to do if they wanted to with the digital ticket. And the service fee, I read about being reduced. I mean the service fee could be reduced tomorrow. It's just a function of the venue, not the ticket company. So digital ticket and moving from the old TDF model that historically around the industry has been achieved to date, we've been talking the last couple of years about the progression of adoption. COVID obviously has really sped that up. Most tickets access now does not want to be in the contact business, so having a ticket on your mobile phone, walking into that venue and then being able to buy a drink, communicate with each other, upsell, you name the ideas when you have a direct communication with your fan, those are all being unlocked right now by sports teams, by venues and artists. So we think the blockchain technology is a great part of a technology solution to keep providing a better communication and identity platform for the fan. But that's already in place. There is nothing blockchain would bring to that that we can't or others currently achieved. So we'll continue to lose blockchain to supplement and augment our platform, and continue to look to be better at it. And we think it's a great opportunity in ticketing, just getting this full access. I would step back and Brandon, you and I've talked about this before in terms of what does the ticket company do? I mean, quite honestly, selling the ticket is the easiest part of being a ticketing company. When we talk to clients, they don't pick us because we can sell a ticket. They pick us because we have market -- marketing and distribution reach. They pick us because we have one of the largest marketplaces in the world to help them sell tickets. They pick us because we have a secured great technology platform they can plug-and-play with their APIs and their databases and their consumer needs. And they also pick us because it's a financing mechanism. A ticketing business is about financing the venues and exchanging that for ticketing rights. So it's a full bundle to be a ticketing company, and that's what Ticketmaster has delivered so successfully for so many years. And we'll continue to think lead with blockchain and bringing identity and all of the transparency and benefit but now having that ticket with an ownership to market.\nBrandon Ross: And can you maybe talk a little bit about -- hello?\nMichael Rapino: Yes.\nBrandon Ross: Can you maybe talk a little bit about the collectibles' angle to it?\nMichael Rapino: Right.\nBrandon Ross: Obviously, NFTs are very popular right now. How does that integrate into your ticketing system? Or is that something that would be separate from Ticketmaster?\nMichael Rapino: Right. No. That's -- and we think that's the great opportunity. NFTs are just another way of saying, can I add value to the customer relationship? Can I put a contract or privileges on that ticket for the customer? And that's a great mechanism and it's a great vehicle. I mean, whether we sell a T-shirt to that customer coming into a concert or we sell them a PDF with a unique piece of artwork or concert moment, it's another mechanism to engage your customer, find unique products that will let those magic memories of that event live on. So, macro level, we're always in the business of figuring out what else can we add to that experience that the customer would engage in to cement that magic moment called the concert. So NFTs specifically, on the Ticketmaster side, they're working already with sports teams and festivals and everyone else about how they would -- how they can layer an NFT on a ticket. You can mint a ticket and mint an NFT right on top of a Ticketmaster platform and deliver it how you want. So that's -- Ticketmaster will be in the delivery business using their ticket -- digital ticket, blockchain. And then as the customer creates its own NFT, we can sell those and bridge those together on whatever minting system and/or marketplace they use. On the Live Nation side, we're deep in exploration. We have a great team that's been working on this and working with the Mark Cubans of the world and others who are smart in this space. And I think you'll see us come out with an interesting Live Nation concert NFT angle. We think it's a great way for us to engage with our fans using that NFT and that direct relationship now to add rewards, add perks, add souvenir moments. We've all learned from top shops at the NBA, so we envision Live Nation with the marketplace and looking at some of its concert moments as magic moments that we could mint and attach to our ongoing ticket festivals and special moments. So we think it's -- if you have IP, we think it's an exciting time to use that IP to create some exciting moments with fans that can trade it ongoing and live that moment and kind of cement that relationship they have with that. July 16, the first concert back at Jones Beach, and I got an NFT and a special souvenir ticket that's mine forever. I can trade it. I can put it in my wallet and own that moment forever. So we think it's a fabulous moment to take a boring PDF and turn it into a magic souvenir with unlimited ideas on how you can bring that to life for the fan. So we think it's an exciting time. We think we'll be able to use our scalable IP to launch our own ways to engage with the fan in this space, as well as empowering our artists through our management company that we've been doing to date.\nBrandon Ross: Makes sense. And then, I guess while we're on ticketing, just one last one. With the Vivid back, thought maybe it would be a good time to get some updated -- your updated thoughts on the secondary ticketing market. Do you see that as a growth market, I guess, as an industry, first of all, and then for Ticketmaster, secondly? And kind of maybe how you see the competitive landscape in that arena now?\nJoe Berchtold: Yes. We absolutely believe in the secondary market. It's another set of distribution platforms of getting tickets in the hands of fans. For all the reasons Michael talked about in terms of digital ticketing and identity, we think that more and more of the control over secondary will go to content. The sports teams and the artists, as they have a wide set of agendas in terms of what they'd like to accomplish and how they'd like to have their relationship with their fans. So we think it -- we think there's some evolution as it goes to digital ticketing, and we absolutely support the content having more control over how that happens. We support there being more transparency in secondary. But we think it's here to stay, and it will continue to be an important distribution platform. We'll continue to focus on pricing to get as much of the value of those tickets in the hands of fans as we can. And I think as we look at Vivid, they've all got a similar business model, right, so all a service fee business model. They've got customer acquisition costs associated with a lot of search in digital, and we have more customer acquisition costs associated with alignment with content. But it's similar at the end of the day business model. We think we've got a great proposition by aligning with content and by also leveraging the scale of our Ticketmaster platform. So we like the position we're in, whether it grows or shrinks exactly as artists price their content to market value is less of a concern and making sure we're delivering on that content agenda.\nBrandon Ross: Great. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you. Michael, you kind of freaked me out with that July 2021 because I have a ticket to the Black Rose at Jones Beach on that day. So maybe you're going to be there as well, probably in better seats. I guess just picking up quickly on the secondary conversation with Brandon. Any comments or reaction to the noise out of DC on safe tickets and what's going on? I thought it was -- first I thought it was sort of unusual to be bringing up and defending sort of the secondary market in that context. But I didn't know -- you know, we sort of put the consent decree behind us, I thought. I don't know if you had any comment on that stuff since it came out over the last month or so?\nMichael Rapino: Yes. It would surprise us, too, that right now where we are. But (inaudible) has been on this mission for quite a while, so we would love to sit with his team and educate him on the business so we can get all of the idiosyncrasies nailed because it's never as simple as it seems. So I really -- we look at that as a bit of a nuance.  They seem to be obviously, scalpers are doing a good job of convincing his staff that we are going to do a digital ticket in a closed platform. So that's their great fear that we're going to have a digital ticket, and we're going to tell you when you buy that ticket, you can only resell it at Ticketmaster. That's never been our intent. So their -- kind of their main claim (inaudible) if they would sit down with us, we'd explain it's never been our intent to have a closed platform. We've actually -- the biggest thing I've done at Ticketmaster since taken over is rebuild this Company so we can have an open platform. Our goal is to sell that first ticket. But as we did with the NFL last year, we have an open platform with the NFL. We power the NFL. And if those secondary companies are approved by the NFL, then that ticket you buy for the NFL can be freely sold on any other platform and used to get in the show. So that's -- we think it's the best model. We think we have the largest kind of footprint from a primary platform. We believe that if the ticket is to be resold, we have a great marketplace for that, for the Ticketmaster fan. But we're also working and have been working towards an open platform that it can be sold in other places if the content like the NFL or venues want that path forward. So not sure there's much meat to the claim. We're not looking to limit distribution. We're looking to increase distribution for the teams, venues and artists. And the best platforms will win in the end that offer the best value to the content and the fan. So that's our plan. We think we have an incredible opportunity in ticketing in that. The amount of people that buy at Ticketmaster and actually resell their ticket is very, very low, so we think we have a natural huge audience that we should do a better job of allowing you, the fan, if you just bought to think about how you can resell on our platform, and maybe there's better incentives we can do for you as a fan to make that even more seamless. But if you want to sell on other platforms as we do on the NFL, then we'll be happy to validate that ticket and let the content decide where it's sold.\nBen Swinburne: That's very helpful. Second, just on Veeps, I think you guys announced 60 venues have been equipped with their technology. Just any updated thoughts on how substantial that opportunity is as you guys look into reopening later this year and into next year from a business point of view -- a business model point of view?\nMichael Rapino: Well, I think it's, you know, no different than we just talked about NFTs, right? Our job is to keep looking at our core business and making sure we can add more exciting products around that core business. We're just thrilled with the acquisition partnership with the Madden Brothers, who run this on a daily basis. It's their -- soul and sweat they put in, it's really all them. We've just added a bit of a firehose by helping them with our distribution. I think they're up to over 1,000 shows in the last year, probably grow somewhere over 10 million, so a good start to that business. But now you're going to see with our new clubs, we do 10,000 club shows. So you start digging into that a little bit, adding some amphitheaters, and the part we think is really exciting is our festivals. Opening up that model that in Lollapalooza instead of just rebroadcasting that for free. What if for $49, you could watch the Lollapalooza weekend, or you could buy the Lollapalooza day at home and continue your party at home if you couldn't make it to the venue. So we've seen great success in our EDM business. (inaudible) blown the numbers up on his business when he does that. So we think extending the festival, which is a bit of a party at home model, it's got a great opportunity. And I would much rather use my festivals to add another revenue ticket to the equation than treat it as promotion value. So we're going to test that this summer, and we think we'll get some learning, and that'll help us move forward in that place. If you just launch festival TV, you have a proposition itself there with our 150-plus festivals. So we think that's exciting plus our club business for young artists. So new space for us. We think it's an exciting place to add value. We think there is subscription ideas forward with that and we think we can bundle it with other things. We think there is a great foundation to our core business here that we can keep exploring and innovating on.\nBen Swinburne: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Glagola with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Glagola: Hi. Thanks for the question. The July through November period for the festivals in the US and the UK appears pretty crowded. Outside the major festivals that you guys highlighted on the press release, is there -- is that having any -- is there any impact adversely on consumer demand in some of those other festivals given the crowded slate? And then also with the 2021 Rock in Rio rescheduled for 2022, does that mean you will have that festival two years in a row now '23 also?\nMichael Rapino: Well, I'll answer it backward. We'll -- we're debating the Rock in Rio decision, so we'll get to that -- Rock in Rio decision, we'll get to that later after we get '22 done. No, we don't have any fear of a crowded slate. I think as you saw maybe some of our releases, we just went up with Travis Scott yesterday or the day before and sold 100,000 tickets or Club (inaudible) went up because long -- it's biggest on sale ever. And Rolling Loud just was amazing. We sold 100,000 tickets in about an hour and had 200,000 people in the waiting line. So we're just seeing demand beyond any other historic moment. So Garth Brooks, this morning, I'm so proud, he broke every Ticketmaster record in history for the fastest stadium sale out. So I'm thrilled for the crowd, but I'm more thrilled that our ongoing investment in Ticketmaster and the amount of strain that causes to be the fastest-selling stadium in history or do 100,000 tickets in an hour is a testament to the Ticketmaster platform because the demand, the bots,  the load that hits you in that hour is amazing. So I'm proud that the Ticketmaster team is delivering, but also the demand right now is far exceeding any of our scheduling festivals right now.\nStephen Glagola: Thanks, Michael. And one more, if I can. Just you spoke about the NFT impact and blockchain impact on your Ticketmaster operations. From the standpoint of artists potentially making more money, monetizing their back catalog or whatnot, does that make them become less reliant on touring as an earnings driver going forward in your view?\nMichael Rapino: Not sure if that was a statement or a question. But no, I would say that I think you've got to look at the macro pie always, right? There is always going to be a few artists that are able to sell their business at the top end. But if you look at the macro numbers, the percentage that comes from the road, the amount of artists that are dying to get back on the road, we're seeing right now a greater demand than ever from artists calling us saying, when could we get back out? And these are some very successful and wealthy artists. So we always look at that two hours on stage at a stadium is a drug that, that artist tends to want to run for his entire career. So we don't see any decline in that desire for that artist to get on stage. I think the reason you see Mick Jagger and The Stones on stage isn't financial at this point. I think it delivers something much bigger than a paycheck. So I think that magic moment on stage is non-duplicatable for the fan and something that artist doesn't get at home.\nStephen Glagola: Yes. Looking forward to going back to shows in the second half. Thanks, Michael.\nMichael Rapino: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Katz: Hi. Good evening, and thanks for taking my questions. There's been an awful lot of discussion about the near-term demand. I wonder what data points or information or perspectives you might have about demand beyond, say, the next 12 or 18 months, and how you think about sort of the demand curve longer term?\nMichael Rapino: Yes. (Multiple Speakers) I guess if you're going to model that out, you'd probably -- you'd be thrilled that your first data point is the biggest demand in history. So I think however you model that out for the next, you know, I don't think you're going to see any cliff on that demand. I don't think these consumers are saying, I can't wait to get through '22, and then it's over. So I think this is showing. I mean, look, we always look at the -- I think the most important demand curve is the 17, 16 and 14 year-old of today excited about going to the show as the last kind of generation, right. We always get that question on who is the next Rolling Stones. And our data will continually show that, that young artist is capable of selling out stadiums and arenas very fast. I mean, Bad Bunny just went on sale and sold out arenas very fast, huge Latino star. So we're just seeing pockets of strengths coming from young artists every day. Billie Eilish is selling out instantly. So we see young artists regenerating the supply side. We see new 14-year olds going crazy for BTS all around the globe. That's a part to me is what I look at is, is it still as important to a 14 year old to see from the Beatles to go to NSYNC to Backstreet to Britney Spears to BTSs of today, right? So they seem to be -- my 10 year old is excited about concerts as I was when I was 10 or even more, I guess, so where he is based. But we see a great young vibrant supply demand in the business, to me, that's what you want to model in. And over time, it's still as important to a 15 year old of today and a 20 year old of today as it was 10 and 20 years ago.\nDavid Katz: Thank you. Sorry. Go ahead.\nJoe Berchtold: And David, just one other thing to add. I wouldn't just use what are the on sales of the past month as part of your indicator. This is a supply-constrained business with a lot of latent demand out there. And if you look at the past decade, and you look at how Live Nation went from 40 million fans a year to 100 million fans a year, it was by bringing more artists to more markets to more people, and unlock that latent demand because of the desire that Michael talked about. So there is a long track record that would say, concern about is the demand going to be there when you've got these great artists out on the road.\nDavid Katz: Agreed. And if I may follow up quickly. With respect to M&A, how are you thinking about sort of the timing and the boundaries and the catalysts for maybe getting out and putting some deals back on the board to grow that way?\nJoe Berchtold: Yes. We -- go ahead.\nMichael Rapino: Yes. No, I was just saying, I think we're -- we've been looking at our current pipe. We have a good pipe that was already in process when COVID started. We probably have 15 to 20 different venues around the world that are in some level of construction or development or opening, those are on plan, and we'll be opening up from theaters to amphitheaters. We've got an ongoing list of promoters and festivals around the world that we've been in conversations with. We've been closed a couple of those recently, and we'll keep doing that. So we will continue on our bolt-on strategy as we have been for many years to keep bolstering our global foundation and opportunity markets.\nJoe Berchtold: We're a growth business, and whether it's growth CapEx or M&A, we're going to be continuing to invest in the business. We're obviously, at a higher leverage level, but we are confident that as we continue to grow our AOI and that returns in 2022 and beyond, that we'll have plenty of flexibility to continue to drive that growth.\nDavid Katz: I appreciate it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Sundby with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nJessye McVane: Hi. It's actually, Jessye McVane on for Ryan. Thanks for taking our question. Last call, you guys talked about ticket sales in the UK benefiting once guidelines and timelines for reopenings. But put in place, when we see states like New York announced this week that they will start to remove capacity restrictions later this month, or other states like Texas have already acted on. Are you seeing a similar step-change in demand here in the US? Or does it need to be done at a national level to have a similar effect?\nJoe Berchtold: We're absolutely seeing massive demand. I mean today is a great example, we added the first half dozen shows -- broadway shows have their presales wildly outperformed all expectations. So just whatever it was two or three days ago, they relaxed in New York on sales today, going great. Governors Ball, as Michael referred to, went on sale, far and away, the best first day for Governors Ball. So as every market is getting unlocked, that's telling the fans to be comfortable going out and buying the tickets, and it's consistent as we go market-to-market.\nJessye McVane: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And this does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joe Berchtold",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As we have done over the past few quarters, we've added some tables at the back of our earnings release, to reconcile in more detail some of the numbers I will refer to today. For the first quarter, all the key cost and cash numbers improved relative to Q4 2020 and are at or better than what we expected at the start of the quarter. We remain confident that our actions taken to cut costs and increased liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until we bring shows back, which will begin to scale in key markets outdoor this summer. As we move toward reopening, we continue to balance strong cost and cash management. We are now making the necessary investments to grow the business. While we expect the second quarter to be our first year-on-year improvement since Q4 of 2019, and to also be generating positive AOI through the second half of the year, we still plan on reducing costs this year by $750 million and reducing cash spend by $1.5 billion, relative to pre-pandemic plans. Yes. This is Joe. David, I'd say that the summer and early fall, next three to four months is largely booked. We obviously have a lot that is shifted from last year into this year. We've added some tours so we've also added a number of festivals, all of which have been selling well. So the typical ramp show is probably a couple of months' lead time, so I think we'll still have room to be adding more as we get into August and September, but the majority has been booked at this point. Yes. We're currently in that good position. We have lots of great conversations with probably every artist you can imagine, talking about when they're going to be back on the road. And artist typically tours once every three years on a cycle, so we're kind of condensing 2021 and '22. So the good news is we've got incredible supply and now we're just sorting through what makes sense to go out in '20 -- at the end of '21 still -- into '22, and some artists were talking about moving into '23. So I would say, the artists are patient and they're smart in terms of what their cycle is predicting, maybe they have a record coming out in the fall, maybe it's in Q1. So right now, we have a great supply. We don't have any issues in terms of availability. But we're also not looking to cram everything in three years into one year. We're looking to stage a good '22 into '23 year. So when you spread it over those two years, you find enough Fridays and enough weekends and enough routing challenges come to be solved that way. Yes. We're very confident we're going to hit the structural $200 million cost savings we given you. As we've talked about, we've done it the opposite way, which is we took $950 million of cost out, and so now it's a matter of how we let $750 million of costs back in over a period of time. So that gives us -- that makes it more real if you will. We've done a number of things. On the Ticketing side, we've talked about, we've shifted that to a truly global organization as part of moving into a true single approach on the marketplace, on the enterprise and on all the technology. On the Concert side, we have a longstanding local network, which is very important to continue to understand the markets. So the 80% of your shows now booked to be tours, you don't need to have an entire infrastructure in every local market. So we've been seeing that there are ways of streamlining it and when we were growing double-digits every year through most of the last decade, it wasn't worth the potential disruption. But as we've stopped, we've asked ourselves, what's the best way to do this rebuilding from the ground up. And we're very confident, it's going to deliver those savings and be an even more effective organization for driving future growth. Yes. We absolutely believe in the secondary market. It's another set of distribution platforms of getting tickets in the hands of fans. For all the reasons Michael talked about in terms of digital ticketing and identity, we think that more and more of the control over secondary will go to content. The sports teams and the artists, as they have a wide set of agendas in terms of what they'd like to accomplish and how they'd like to have their relationship with their fans. So we think it -- we think there's some evolution as it goes to digital ticketing, and we absolutely support the content having more control over how that happens. We support there being more transparency in secondary. But we think it's here to stay, and it will continue to be an important distribution platform. We'll continue to focus on pricing to get as much of the value of those tickets in the hands of fans as we can. And I think as we look at Vivid, they've all got a similar business model, right, so all a service fee business model. They've got customer acquisition costs associated with a lot of search in digital, and we have more customer acquisition costs associated with alignment with content. But it's similar at the end of the day business model. We think we've got a great proposition by aligning with content and by also leveraging the scale of our Ticketmaster platform. So we like the position we're in, whether it grows or shrinks exactly as artists price their content to market value is less of a concern and making sure we're delivering on that content agenda. And David, just one other thing to add. I wouldn't just use what are the on sales of the past month as part of your indicator. This is a supply-constrained business with a lot of latent demand out there. And if you look at the past decade, and you look at how Live Nation went from 40 million fans a year to 100 million fans a year, it was by bringing more artists to more markets to more people, and unlock that latent demand because of the desire that Michael talked about. So there is a long track record that would say, concern about is the demand going to be there when you've got these great artists out on the road. Yes. We -- go ahead. We're a growth business, and whether it's growth CapEx or M&A, we're going to be continuing to invest in the business. We're obviously, at a higher leverage level, but we are confident that as we continue to grow our AOI and that returns in 2022 and beyond, that we'll have plenty of flexibility to continue to drive that growth. We're absolutely seeing massive demand. I mean today is a great example, we added the first half dozen shows -- broadway shows have their presales wildly outperformed all expectations. So just whatever it was two or three days ago, they relaxed in New York on sales today, going great. Governors Ball, as Michael referred to, went on sale, far and away, the best first day for Governors Ball. So as every market is getting unlocked, that's telling the fans to be comfortable going out and buying the tickets, and it's consistent as we go market-to-market."

            "name": "Michael Rapino",
            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. When we spoke last in February, I was optimistic that we will soon be returning to live events, and since then, our confidence has increased for our key markets. In the US, over 40% of the population received at least one vaccine dose, and most states are now fully or partially reopening with more restrictions being lifted daily. In the UK, over 50% of the population has received at least one vaccine dose and their reopening roadmap is tracking to plan. And although Europe remains a few months behind on vaccinations, they are progressing and recent discussions about reopening to international visitors this summer are encouraging. Around the world, people are showing the need to get out and socialize once again, which reinforces our expectation that a return to concerts will be the logical progression as vaccines are readily available to everyone who wants one. This is generally already in the case in the US, where we are confidently planning our reopenings, particularly front door shows, and we expect other major markets will follow this summer. Alongside these trends, we are seeing the effects of significant pent-up demand as fans are buying tickets and events are selling out faster than ever. In the US, Bonnaroo, Electric Daisy and Rolling Loud festivals all sold out in record times at full capacity. In the UK, we have 11 festivals planned this summer, including our largest ones Reading, Leeds and Parklife where tickets are already sold out. New Zealand, the country's largest festival, Rhythm and Vines quickly sold out. And as we get further clarity on reopening timelines, we are announcing more tours for late this summer, including Dave Matthews, Luke Bryan, Maroon 5 and others to come, showing artists' increasing confidence in performing this summer. Before taking questions, I wanted to cover one other thing. Kathy Willard, our CFO for the past 15 years will be retiring as of June 30. She will be than staying on as an advisor throughout the end of the year. As of July 1, the plan is for Joe Berchtold to become CFO. Kathy as you know has been an invaluable part of our executive team for the past 15 years and been with Live Nation for over 20. We are a much stronger company because of her, not just from her role as CFO, but as a champion for women at the company and the industry, an important adviser to me on a range of issues. Because she built such an effective finance organization, I'm confident we will remain in good shape as Joe steps in. He and Kathy have been working together closely for over a decade now and he has gotten more deeply involved over the past year, as we have been planning this transition. In addition, late last year we elevated Jackie Beato, EVP of Operations to take on greater responsibility and give Joe the bandwidth he will need for the job. More than anything, I want to thank Kathy for her impact on the Company, her commitment and her friendship. Operator, let's open the call for questions. And just to add to Joe, I think there's two ways to look at the business. We got -- we had a great workout, testing a new muscle for the last 12 months in terms of our balance sheet, our fixed costs and how we can become more efficient. And I think that you're going to see come to life through our $200 million-plus. But I think the real win of the downtime was what is the new products of the kind of Live Nation 3.0? What else are we going to do with this incredible scale we have across our consumer base? So I would say whether it's Sponsorship, Concerts or Ticketmaster, we would have a new level of new products in the pipe that we had not historically had the time, nor the skill set to kind of unlock. So I'm very confident over the next couple of years, we're going to see some exciting new things coming out of the Concert division. Our consumer side of the business -- our Subscription business, our Ticketmaster business, our new Ad business models we're looking at. So a bunch of exciting ideas now finally had months and months to put some people around and skill set that we've acquired to advance that part of our business. So, we look at the future is not only can we run the largest concert company in the world more efficiently and the best at it, but also what other new products will drive our business to think differently about the customer and the artist. Thanks, Brandon. It's a great question. We got asked it every day and I read a new article every day on all the great things it's going to solve. So let's step back in blockchain, we think it's a very exciting technology. We're currently using blockchain technology in our products. We've invested in this business for a few years now and we think it's a great technology that will help our business. I would step back from what are the problems that we're trying to solve or what are the opportunities that blockchain specifically brings to the Ticketing business. One of the great advantages in the industry is when we went from a TDF to a digital ticket, we unlocked a lot of what you keep reading about the blockchain is going to do in the future. So the digital ticket or your mobile ticket that you are now buying has solved the biggest problem that unlocked we've been talking about this for two years Identity. Identity for us, the fan, the artist, the team and the venue knowing who sits on that seat, who is actually coming to the venue, having a communication directly with them, having a verified ticket, being able to trade that ticket, putting rules on that ticket. We currently do that now. If you want to, can you transfer it with a certain cap, all of those things that content could decide to do if they wanted to with the digital ticket. And the service fee, I read about being reduced. I mean the service fee could be reduced tomorrow. It's just a function of the venue, not the ticket company. So digital ticket and moving from the old TDF model that historically around the industry has been achieved to date, we've been talking the last couple of years about the progression of adoption. COVID obviously has really sped that up. Most tickets access now does not want to be in the contact business, so having a ticket on your mobile phone, walking into that venue and then being able to buy a drink, communicate with each other, upsell, you name the ideas when you have a direct communication with your fan, those are all being unlocked right now by sports teams, by venues and artists. So we think the blockchain technology is a great part of a technology solution to keep providing a better communication and identity platform for the fan. But that's already in place. There is nothing blockchain would bring to that that we can't or others currently achieved. So we'll continue to lose blockchain to supplement and augment our platform, and continue to look to be better at it. And we think it's a great opportunity in ticketing, just getting this full access. I would step back and Brandon, you and I've talked about this before in terms of what does the ticket company do? I mean, quite honestly, selling the ticket is the easiest part of being a ticketing company. When we talk to clients, they don't pick us because we can sell a ticket. They pick us because we have market -- marketing and distribution reach. They pick us because we have one of the largest marketplaces in the world to help them sell tickets. They pick us because we have a secured great technology platform they can plug-and-play with their APIs and their databases and their consumer needs. And they also pick us because it's a financing mechanism. A ticketing business is about financing the venues and exchanging that for ticketing rights. So it's a full bundle to be a ticketing company, and that's what Ticketmaster has delivered so successfully for so many years. And we'll continue to think lead with blockchain and bringing identity and all of the transparency and benefit but now having that ticket with an ownership to market. Yes. Right. Right. No. That's -- and we think that's the great opportunity. NFTs are just another way of saying, can I add value to the customer relationship? Can I put a contract or privileges on that ticket for the customer? And that's a great mechanism and it's a great vehicle. I mean, whether we sell a T-shirt to that customer coming into a concert or we sell them a PDF with a unique piece of artwork or concert moment, it's another mechanism to engage your customer, find unique products that will let those magic memories of that event live on. So, macro level, we're always in the business of figuring out what else can we add to that experience that the customer would engage in to cement that magic moment called the concert. So NFTs specifically, on the Ticketmaster side, they're working already with sports teams and festivals and everyone else about how they would -- how they can layer an NFT on a ticket. You can mint a ticket and mint an NFT right on top of a Ticketmaster platform and deliver it how you want. So that's -- Ticketmaster will be in the delivery business using their ticket -- digital ticket, blockchain. And then as the customer creates its own NFT, we can sell those and bridge those together on whatever minting system and/or marketplace they use. On the Live Nation side, we're deep in exploration. We have a great team that's been working on this and working with the Mark Cubans of the world and others who are smart in this space. And I think you'll see us come out with an interesting Live Nation concert NFT angle. We think it's a great way for us to engage with our fans using that NFT and that direct relationship now to add rewards, add perks, add souvenir moments. We've all learned from top shops at the NBA, so we envision Live Nation with the marketplace and looking at some of its concert moments as magic moments that we could mint and attach to our ongoing ticket festivals and special moments. So we think it's -- if you have IP, we think it's an exciting time to use that IP to create some exciting moments with fans that can trade it ongoing and live that moment and kind of cement that relationship they have with that. July 16, the first concert back at Jones Beach, and I got an NFT and a special souvenir ticket that's mine forever. I can trade it. I can put it in my wallet and own that moment forever. So we think it's a fabulous moment to take a boring PDF and turn it into a magic souvenir with unlimited ideas on how you can bring that to life for the fan. So we think it's an exciting time. We think we'll be able to use our scalable IP to launch our own ways to engage with the fan in this space, as well as empowering our artists through our management company that we've been doing to date. Yes. It would surprise us, too, that right now where we are. But (inaudible) has been on this mission for quite a while, so we would love to sit with his team and educate him on the business so we can get all of the idiosyncrasies nailed because it's never as simple as it seems. So I really -- we look at that as a bit of a nuance.  They seem to be obviously, scalpers are doing a good job of convincing his staff that we are going to do a digital ticket in a closed platform. So that's their great fear that we're going to have a digital ticket, and we're going to tell you when you buy that ticket, you can only resell it at Ticketmaster. That's never been our intent. So their -- kind of their main claim (inaudible) if they would sit down with us, we'd explain it's never been our intent to have a closed platform. We've actually -- the biggest thing I've done at Ticketmaster since taken over is rebuild this Company so we can have an open platform. Our goal is to sell that first ticket. But as we did with the NFL last year, we have an open platform with the NFL. We power the NFL. And if those secondary companies are approved by the NFL, then that ticket you buy for the NFL can be freely sold on any other platform and used to get in the show. So that's -- we think it's the best model. We think we have the largest kind of footprint from a primary platform. We believe that if the ticket is to be resold, we have a great marketplace for that, for the Ticketmaster fan. But we're also working and have been working towards an open platform that it can be sold in other places if the content like the NFL or venues want that path forward. So not sure there's much meat to the claim. We're not looking to limit distribution. We're looking to increase distribution for the teams, venues and artists. And the best platforms will win in the end that offer the best value to the content and the fan. So that's our plan. We think we have an incredible opportunity in ticketing in that. The amount of people that buy at Ticketmaster and actually resell their ticket is very, very low, so we think we have a natural huge audience that we should do a better job of allowing you, the fan, if you just bought to think about how you can resell on our platform, and maybe there's better incentives we can do for you as a fan to make that even more seamless. But if you want to sell on other platforms as we do on the NFL, then we'll be happy to validate that ticket and let the content decide where it's sold. Well, I think it's, you know, no different than we just talked about NFTs, right? Our job is to keep looking at our core business and making sure we can add more exciting products around that core business. We're just thrilled with the acquisition partnership with the Madden Brothers, who run this on a daily basis. It's their -- soul and sweat they put in, it's really all them. We've just added a bit of a firehose by helping them with our distribution. I think they're up to over 1,000 shows in the last year, probably grow somewhere over 10 million, so a good start to that business. But now you're going to see with our new clubs, we do 10,000 club shows. So you start digging into that a little bit, adding some amphitheaters, and the part we think is really exciting is our festivals. Opening up that model that in Lollapalooza instead of just rebroadcasting that for free. What if for $49, you could watch the Lollapalooza weekend, or you could buy the Lollapalooza day at home and continue your party at home if you couldn't make it to the venue. So we've seen great success in our EDM business. (inaudible) blown the numbers up on his business when he does that. So we think extending the festival, which is a bit of a party at home model, it's got a great opportunity. And I would much rather use my festivals to add another revenue ticket to the equation than treat it as promotion value. So we're going to test that this summer, and we think we'll get some learning, and that'll help us move forward in that place. If you just launch festival TV, you have a proposition itself there with our 150-plus festivals. So we think that's exciting plus our club business for young artists. So new space for us. We think it's an exciting place to add value. We think there is subscription ideas forward with that and we think we can bundle it with other things. We think there is a great foundation to our core business here that we can keep exploring and innovating on. Well, I'll answer it backward. We'll -- we're debating the Rock in Rio decision, so we'll get to that -- Rock in Rio decision, we'll get to that later after we get '22 done. No, we don't have any fear of a crowded slate. I think as you saw maybe some of our releases, we just went up with Travis Scott yesterday or the day before and sold 100,000 tickets or Club (inaudible) went up because long -- it's biggest on sale ever. And Rolling Loud just was amazing. We sold 100,000 tickets in about an hour and had 200,000 people in the waiting line. So we're just seeing demand beyond any other historic moment. So Garth Brooks, this morning, I'm so proud, he broke every Ticketmaster record in history for the fastest stadium sale out. So I'm thrilled for the crowd, but I'm more thrilled that our ongoing investment in Ticketmaster and the amount of strain that causes to be the fastest-selling stadium in history or do 100,000 tickets in an hour is a testament to the Ticketmaster platform because the demand, the bots,  the load that hits you in that hour is amazing. So I'm proud that the Ticketmaster team is delivering, but also the demand right now is far exceeding any of our scheduling festivals right now. Not sure if that was a statement or a question. But no, I would say that I think you've got to look at the macro pie always, right? There is always going to be a few artists that are able to sell their business at the top end. But if you look at the macro numbers, the percentage that comes from the road, the amount of artists that are dying to get back on the road, we're seeing right now a greater demand than ever from artists calling us saying, when could we get back out? And these are some very successful and wealthy artists. So we always look at that two hours on stage at a stadium is a drug that, that artist tends to want to run for his entire career. So we don't see any decline in that desire for that artist to get on stage. I think the reason you see Mick Jagger and The Stones on stage isn't financial at this point. I think it delivers something much bigger than a paycheck. So I think that magic moment on stage is non-duplicatable for the fan and something that artist doesn't get at home. Thank you. Yes. (Multiple Speakers) I guess if you're going to model that out, you'd probably -- you'd be thrilled that your first data point is the biggest demand in history. So I think however you model that out for the next, you know, I don't think you're going to see any cliff on that demand. I don't think these consumers are saying, I can't wait to get through '22, and then it's over. So I think this is showing. I mean, look, we always look at the -- I think the most important demand curve is the 17, 16 and 14 year-old of today excited about going to the show as the last kind of generation, right. We always get that question on who is the next Rolling Stones. And our data will continually show that, that young artist is capable of selling out stadiums and arenas very fast. I mean, Bad Bunny just went on sale and sold out arenas very fast, huge Latino star. So we're just seeing pockets of strengths coming from young artists every day. Billie Eilish is selling out instantly. So we see young artists regenerating the supply side. We see new 14-year olds going crazy for BTS all around the globe. That's a part to me is what I look at is, is it still as important to a 14 year old to see from the Beatles to go to NSYNC to Backstreet to Britney Spears to BTSs of today, right? So they seem to be -- my 10 year old is excited about concerts as I was when I was 10 or even more, I guess, so where he is based. But we see a great young vibrant supply demand in the business, to me, that's what you want to model in. And over time, it's still as important to a 15 year old of today and a 20 year old of today as it was 10 and 20 years ago. Yes. No, I was just saying, I think we're -- we've been looking at our current pipe. We have a good pipe that was already in process when COVID started. We probably have 15 to 20 different venues around the world that are in some level of construction or development or opening, those are on plan, and we'll be opening up from theaters to amphitheaters. We've got an ongoing list of promoters and festivals around the world that we've been in conversations with. We've been closed a couple of those recently, and we'll keep doing that. So we will continue on our bolt-on strategy as we have been for many years to keep bolstering our global foundation and opportunity markets."

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir.\nMichael Rapino: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. In 2022, fans around the world continue to prioritize their spend on attending live events, particularly concerts. Our research consistently tells us that concerts are top priority for discretionary spending. And one of the last experiences fans will cut back on. And we're seeing this play out in both our 2022 results and early indicators for 2023. With the strong demand last year in the cancer business, we had 121 million fans attend our shows across 45 countries. While in ticketing, we helped connect 550 million fans with their favorite artists, teams and performers. In both cases, the majority of our growth came from international markets, further reinforcing the global nature of untapped fan demand and the opportunities we have for growth as we help artists reach more fans with their live music. Before getting into details on our division, just to note that 2019 is the best comparison for us in terms of understanding our results. Most of our metrics will be relative to full year 2019. In concerts, despite many markets still closed for part of last year, we grew attendance by 24% to 121 million fans at 44,000 events, which drove revenue up 43% to $13.5 billion. This growth came from all markets and venue types. Every venue type from clubs and theaters, to stadiums, to festivals, had double-digit attendance growth. We invested $9.6 billion in putting artist shows on in 2022, working with the largest superstars to artists just getting started and all those in between. This is up 45% and further reinforces our role as the largest contributor to our artist income. As part of this, we helped shift $700 million to artists with more market value ticket pricing, even as the entry price to a show stayed below $35 in the U.S. Typically, 90% of ticket sales for Live Nation shows go to artists. This is particularly important as artists are increasingly reliant on touring as they get much smaller rev shares from other music revenue streams. Part of our fan growth continues to come from the venues we operate globally, closed almost 50 million fans in 2022 with international markets, again, delivering the majority of our growth. In Venue Nation, we continued our focus on elevating the fan experience and providing a range of options for enhanced products and services. As a result, last year, we grew our average revenue per fan by 20% at all venue types. In ticketing, our strategy for success is simple. We focus on developing the leading software for venues to ensure we deliver the best enterprise platform, we invest tens of millions of dollars every year to continue innovating every aspect of ticketing technology products. Artists are the venue's largest clients, and we're regularly being asked to create new products to help address their ticketing needs. Amongst our innovations are products such as Verified Fan, designed to help artists cut down resale, and we've seen this successfully for over 400 tours, including the most recent on sales for Beyonce\u0301, Madonna and Morgan Wallen. Generally, Verified Fan onsales have approximately 5% in inventory end up on resale sites versus 20% to 30% that is typical for non-Verified Fan on sales. Venue and their artist clients see the result in the ticket sales, which is the large part why so many venues choose to work with us. Looking at our 2022 results, we grew fee-bearing ticket volume by 28% to $280 million, which in turn drove our fee-bearing GTV, up by over 50% to $28 billion across 38 countries. As a result, our ticketing revenue was $2.2 billion, up 45%. Along with these results for the year, we signed 23 million net new tickets in 2022, 70% were with international clients in the stage for continued global growth. In our sponsorship business, we have seen that brands are as eager as fans to reengage with platforms. In 2022, we had 120 large strategic sponsors globally across our businesses, 32% more than we had in 2019, including brands such as PayPal, Go PoP, Google and Snap. These large partners drove over 80% of our growth, with overall revenue up 64% to $1 billion. As with concerts and ticketing, our international markets led this growth with international sponsorship ROI up 70%. Looking ahead to 2023, as we announce any of our 2023 shows on sale. We continue to see strong consumer demand globally with no sign of any slowdown. We have four key leading indicators at this time of the year, all pointing towards another record year and even greater success in 2023. First, our deferred revenue at the end of 2022 was $2.7 billion, up 125% from 2019 and 18% from 2021, which benefited from a high volume of rescheduled chose. Next, as of mid-February, ticket sales for our shows this year exceeded 50 million fans, up 20% from this point last year with international growth of 25%. Then our global ticketing fee-bearing GTV is up 33% to $9.8 billion through the same period. And finally, over 70% of our planned sponsorship activity for the year is confirmed, again, up double digits relative to this time last year. Before I turn it over to Joe, I want to comment on the regulatory environment and industry reforms. On the regulatory front, the ticketing industry is more competitive than ever, and our market share has gone down, not up since the merger. Because of the competitive bidding process, venues regularly take more of the economics on every renewal as they set and keep a majority of the service fees. In signing the extended consent decree related to the Ticketmaster merger, we remain in constant conversations with the DOJ monitors and do not believe there have been any violations. On ticketing reforms, we believe the greater transparency on the entire ticketing ecosystem will improve the industry, and we've been engaging with policymakers to advocate for reforms. The biggest challenge facing the industry is a chaos at the on sale where fans can't get the ticket at the price they are set yet they see page of secondary sites with tickets five times the face value because of scalpers. This has been a big topic in the industry and conversations at the pulse our live conference this week, focused on how to protect the connection between the artists and their fans. To help drive progress, we launched the Fair Ticketing Act, which says artists should decide resell lots selling, speculative tickets should be illegal. The scope of the BOT Act should be expanded and enforced. And it needs to be industry-wide all-in pricing, so fans see the full cost they are paying upfront. Artists create their music and their concerts. It's only fair to create their ticket and rules too. We will always be on the side of the artist who is the best advocate for their career and their fan base. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through more details.\nJoe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Given the uniqueness with our seasonality in 2022 after emerging from the pandemic, I will largely focus on our annual results. And as with prior quarters, 2019 is the best comparison for us in terms of understanding our results so much of our discussion will be relative to the full year 2019. For the company, our reported revenue of $16.7 billion for the year was $5.1 billion better than 2019 or an increase of 44%. On a constant currency basis, our revenue was $17.3 billion for the year. So there was roughly a 4% unfavorable impact due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, primarily against the euro and the pound. Our reported AOI of $1.407 billion for the year was also a record for the company, $465 million better than 2019, up 49%, led by an improvement of $345 million in ticketing and $226 million in sponsorship. On a constant currency basis, our full year AOI was $1.464 billion. The FX impact was negative $57 million or 4%. And we have converted roughly 69% of this AOI to adjusted free cash flow of $967 million, leading to a year-end free cash balance of nearly $1.8 billion. Net income for the year was also a record at $296 million, $226 million better than 2019, resulting in earnings per share of $0.64. Let me give a bit more color on each division. First, in concerts, we had the most concert fans ever with 121 million fans attending our shows in 2022, up 24% compared to 2019 when we had close to 98 million fans. Show count was 43,600 events, up 8% compared to 2019, with more fans per show due to a heavier mix of stadium and festival events. As a result, our concerts revenue for the year grew by 43% to $13.5 billion, while we delivered $170 million of AOI. Looking a bit deeper at our fan metrics. We had strong growth across the board. Stadium attendance more than doubled to 18.4 million fans this year up from 7.8 million fans in 2019. Festival attendance was 13.2 million fans for the year, up over 30% from 2019, with premier events, including Rock in Rio in Brazil, Rock Werchter in Belgium, Reading & Leeds in the UK and Lollapalooza in Chicago. Arena, amphitheater and club and theater attendance were all up double digits. And finally, our international fan count grew by nearly 50% in 2022, fueled by tremendous outdoor season in the UK and across Mainland Europe, and very strong growth in our South American markets as well as the addition of OCESA in Mexico. Giving you more details on ancillary per fan revenue by venue type, in our North America amphitheaters ancillary per fan revenue was $37, an increase of $8 per fan over 2019 levels or over 25% growth. At our major festivals globally, increased spending on concessions, camping and DIP experiences drove ancillary per fan revenue up nearly 30%. And there are theaters and clubs in the U.S. and the UK ancillary per fan revenue increased by 20%, driven by higher concession sales, fast lane entry, night of show upgrades and the move to cashless payments. As we have discussed in past quarters, we've had some headwinds associated with labor and supply chain cost pressures at venues we operate, notably amphitheaters and festivals as well as costs related to the reopening of our international markets during the year. Despite this, we still increased our per fan profitability, taking into account our company-wide revenue streams for fans attending shows at our venues. We have seen these pressures subside in recent months and do not expect the same level of impact in 2023. With this, along with our ongoing revenue initiatives and continued cost focus, we expect to continue to grow per fan profitability in 2023. Next, ticketing, where our numbers reflect sustained fan demand for the live experience. In 2022, we sold $281 million fee-bearing tickets, up 28% compared to 2019. It was the first year that our fee-bearing ticket sales exceeded non-fee-bearing ticket sales as we continue to build our global non-sports client base, particularly in international markets. With this increased ticket volume, GTV for the year was $27.5 billion, up 54% compared to 2019. Ours continues to be largely a primary ticketing business with secondary ticketing accounting for only a mid-teens percent of our overall GTV. With this activity level, revenues are over $2.2 billion for the year with AOI of $830 million. As we projected last quarter, we delivered full year margins in the high 30s, coming in at 37%. On the pricing front, average ticket prices on primary tickets rose by 17% compared to 2019, driven by fan demand for the best seats at premier concert and sporting events. Secondary ticketing pricing also rose by 12% on average and so the average secondary ticket price in the U.S. remained more than double that of a primary ticket. This shows the extent to which concerts and other live events remain priced below market value. We also saw revenue from nonservice fees grow double digits as we further build ancillary revenue streams, including insurance, upgrades and other upsells. Lastly, as Michael noted, we signed 23 million net new tickets and expect these client wins will help drive an increase in fee-bearing tickets sold for this year, positioning us for ongoing growth. Before leaving ticketing, I wanted to add a few comments on the regulatory front that Michael spoke to you. There has been a lot of discussion lately about so-called junk fees. We tend to get thrown into that conversation because the compensation to venues to help run their businesses and to Ticketmaster to distribute tickets is separately called out as a service fee instead of embedded in the price of the ticket. Very few people understand that and even fewer understand that most of the money goes to the venues. They think the service charges are just some arbitrary add-on to Ticketmaster pockets, which is not the case. We agree that real junk fees, hidden charges attached the goods and services that obscure the true price should be illegal. As one of the reasons we're advocating for legislation mandating all-in pricing where the consumer first sees the total price he or she is going to pay, as well as the breakdown of any fees. There are a range of other policy points that we're advocating for because we're strong proponents of artists and content rights, but none of these have a direct material impact on our business. Finally, it was a record year for our sponsorship business with top line revenue of $968 million, up 64%. Our AOI for this high-margin business was $592 million, up 62%. Looking back at sponsorship's growth during the year, our festival business increased by 75% and our platform integrations more than doubled. Once again, we had high growth in both on-site and online sponsorship of 61% and 64%, respectively, compared to 2019. Our international markets had an exceptional growth rate this year with AOI increasing by over 70% compared to 2019 due to greater festival activity across Europe and our expanding business in South America and Mexico. A few other points on 2023, while it's still very early in the year, based on current FX rates, we project very little impact on our revenue and AOI this year, less than 1%. We expect CapEx to be approximately $450 million this year, with two thirds on revenue-generating projects, including new venue builds and renewals and as well as other organic investments to support our growth. This is slightly higher relative to the past few years as we come out of supply chain constraints and generally tight spend controls. However, as a percentage of revenue, this is well within our historical range and consistent with our growth trajectory. We ended the year with $2.3 billion of available liquidity between free cash an untapped revolver capacity, giving us sufficient flexibility to continue investing in growth. As you're aware, in January, we issued $1 billion principal amount of 3.8 percent convertible senior notes due in 2029. As part of that transaction, we then developed a hedge to increase the effective convert price to $144. We used roughly half the net proceeds to repurchase the 2.5% convertible notes that were due in 2023, meaning we expect minimal dilution from this convert offering. We're comfortable with our leverage. Over 85% of our debt is at a fixed rate with an average cost of debt of roughly 4.7%, positioning us well in this interest rate environment. In addition, the majority of our debt is long dated and nothing is maturing within the next 18 months. Given that we're at the beginning of the year, we want to provide with more guidance on a few line items below AOI, which impact our earnings per share calculation. We anticipate the noncash compensation will be largely in line with 2022 and acquisition transaction expenses will run about two thirds of last year. As we continue our global expansion, we expect depreciation and amortization to grow by approximately $50 million for the year, evenly phased amongst the quarters. Given our recent financing, interest expense will increase to approximately $90 million per quarter. We're projecting accretion to be about 25% higher than last year, resulting from stronger forecasted future performance at a number of our joint ventures. And we anticipate that NCI and income tax expense will grow in line with AOI. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with Lightshed Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Ross: Yes thanks for taking the question. You laid out your prescription for solving many of the structural issues in ticketing today. But there is a lot of elected officials and fans that think you're way too big despite the slipping share that you highlighted. And I want to know why are both your ticketing and promotion business is so dominant? And why wouldn't a more competitive industry solve any of these issues at hand with the ticket buying experience?\nJoe Berchtold: Thanks Brandon. It's Joe. I think when you look at our business, our business in both concerts and ticketing have been successful because they very effectively serve their constituents. So on the concert side, I mean if you go back to ten years, we and AG were roughly similar size. We've had a very focused strategy of super serving the artist, which has led to a lot of success in terms of continuing to work with more of the artists. In ticketing, we have the best product out there, full stop. Michael spoke to why it is, we've been effective continuing to work with a large number of venues because we have the best software platform for them, and we work with them to develop tools and products for artists who are their key constituents when figuring out where they're going to be touring. So, it's hard to answer your question with where would we be if we didn't have someone who developed such great tools for the venues and such, and serve the artists so well, I think, we would have a smaller industry. I think we have consistently grown the industry through our approaches to the business. And overall, the ecosystem is better for it.\nBrandon Ross: Okay. And then you talked about the amount of junk that's in ticket fees, and it's a huge concern of, I think, fans and regulators. The amount of fees or the percentage of fees that go into each ticket sale. Can you get a little more granular on why ticket prices are so high? What percentage of the fees goes to you and what is \u201cjunk\u201d? And then you have these growing junk fees, you're giving venues of bigger and bigger cut, and now there's the consumer and regulatory pressure, why should the investors be worried about the sustainability of the Ticketmaster and the Live Nation O&O venue ticket fees as we look to the future?\nJoe Berchtold: Yes. Just first, correction, these aren't junk fees. Junk fees are low-value hidden fees to show up later. This is our version of the markup of the base wholesale price of the product is shared by us and the venue. Amazon collects 50% of the retail price, Apple collects 30%. So this is a version of the amount of the money that goes the venue for the services they provide, Ticketmaster for the services they provide. So it's not junk fees. What we've said is that the majority of the fees go to the venue. And typically, when you renew with a venue because of the competitive nature of the bidding process, more of the fees goes to the venue. I don't think it makes much sense for us to give exact breakdowns because then, obviously, everybody below the average in the next discussion once they get to be above the average. And so it's not a very commercially wise move for us to give those specific numbers. But generally, that's been the trend, and that's what's been happening. The venue sets the fees and the venues costs have been going up, service fees have been going up. I think it would be a very unique situation where you would tell the building what their fees could be. I think it's more likely you got all-in pricing, where they see the total cost upfront quite transparently. And frankly, if you were to cap fees, what would end up happening is you then have increased rent and other costs for the artists would go up because the venue needs to recoup their costs as part of the ecosystem.\nBrandon Ross: So you are saying if ticket prices or ticket fees were regulated, then ticket prices would just stay the same because they would just be passed on in another way?\nJoe Berchtold: Very possible that's what happened, yes.\nBrandon Ross: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nMichael Rapino: Historically, Brandon, there was a division on what the artist was charging to the consumer and then what were the added revenue streams or fees that were going to be added on top of that. And it\u2019s kind of in search state historically. But now, as you know, we've said it many times, the artist takes most of that ticket fee base. So the way that the venue, the promoter or the ticketing company earn their revenue fees is through that extra fee. You're right we would love to more just to make it all in pricing. So the consumer is very clear from the beginning that to go see the true cost to the show isn't $25, it's $50 because that's how all of the participants need to be participate for that show to happen. Now tomorrow, if someone said, you know what, those $25 fees, you shouldn't have them. Well, then the van you would say, okay, artist, the rent isn't $50,000 anymore, it's $100,000. And the fees would add up and then all of a sudden, that ticket price wouldn't be $25, it would be $50 on a value. So it is inefficient. That's why we're a big proponent of all-in pricing and all our pricing at the beginning of the process, which you don't see right now on most companies other than ours. So we believe that we all want to know what is the true cost to see the show when I start shopping. We wish that would be mandated tomorrow across the board that would relieve a lot of the stress, the consumer's perception that there's this magical extra fee added on that is not kind of part of the overall show cost.\nBrandon Ross: Got it. Thanks for the explanation.\nMichael Rapino: And to your point on Live Nation owned and operated, just to hammer the point home to your point is right. If tomorrow, someone said, you know you can't charge 20% service fees on your amphitheater, you have to be $10, well, then the $75,000 house not rent that we charge Argus, would be $100,000, right? So we couldn't \u2013 we wouldn't absorb the cost. We still have to pay staff capital, run the building so we have to find the revenue in the other means. So the true cost of going to a show and making the show happen isn't the full price all in. We just need to now market that upfront better.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with J.P. Morgan.\nDavid Karnovsky: Hi. Thank you. Michael, I think over the years we've become accustomed to seeing some level of criticism against Live Nation or Ticketmaster from politicians, trade press, social media that certainly elevated lately though. So I wanted to ask what actions were you thinking about taking to be more proactive in managing the public perception or your relationship with lawmakers that could maybe help limit what's become a periodic concern for investors.\nMichael Rapino: Yes, it's a great question. First, I want to kind of look at where the drama that gets created, if you kind of zoom out, we did 550 million tickets last year, about 540 million of those were happy customers that were seamlessly delivered. About 10 million of those are five tours historically a year, have this incredible demand with supply demand is out of whack and it creates lots of tension and unhappy customers. And that's kind of always kind of been the historic challenge in the business. At Live Nation Ticketmaster, historically we've really been a B2B business. Our Ticketmaster job is to service the venue and our concert job is to service the artist. And we've done a fabulous job building those businesses and having very, very happy customers. And part of that proposition historically has been to take a bit of the heat at the front end. When the ticket prices are high, when the service fees are high, if the demand supplies out of whack, Ticketmaster has historically been the one that's taken the punch or the ticket seller in general, if you look at all ticket companies, all their NPL scores are all kind of the same. There's only two customers as Fred Rosen famously said, the one that got the ticket is happy and all the ones that didn't are pissed off, right? So you never always \u2013 you can never kind of make \u2013 this is an industry where there's just not enough inventory to make everyone happy. And we've lived that historically. But absolutely, we've got to now start adjusting on our B2C side. We've got to get much more lean forward on our government relations and our PR side. We've historically not had a big incentive to kind of shout out loud that venues are charging high service fees or artist costs are expensive that hasn't been a big business incentive to date. But I think now education is paramount. We've got to now go out and do a much better job. So the policymakers, some consumers understand how the business does operate and how we all have a hand on the wheel, and we've got to all probably do a better job going forward. One of the real challenges that I think has kind of highlighted this this core problem, right? For 40 years, there's always been a show that with not enough tickets and a fan was unhappy. Obviously, in the last while, I think which kind of set the nuclear chaos on this on sale is the secondary business. You think of what happens on those four or five big demand tours a year, that passionate fan, which is the hallmark of our business, thank god, fans are passionate. They're more passionate about the artist's relationship than they are sports or anything else. They're committed, and they want to see that artist at all costs. Now what's happening is you announce an on sale. I think Irving said it famously yesterday. We haven't announced the U2 on sale yet. We haven't announced when the dates will play. But secondary sites have U2 dates up with tickets on sale. So the consumer on these high demand on sales has really over the last couple of years, started to get pissed off and doesn't understand the process. Why are there so many tickets on spec selling sites? Why is 10 o'clock if I didn't get a ticket, are there five pages of scalper sites selling tickets for 5 times to face value. Ticketmaster, you must have given them tickets. This must \u2013 this doesn't seem fair. And that's kind of the digital ticket going online to add then a SeatGeek, StubHub, Vivid, the big scalpers with all of their ways of getting tickets before, after that's really highlighted, right? That's really become a new thing over the last few years that the consumers could see now online. They don't understand why they couldn't get a ticket and why there's so many tickets on secondary. So I think that's the part that we've got to now really lean in on that. We did that today with the Fair Act. I would tell you, yesterday, sitting at the industry conference at Polestar, if any of you want to hear the panel between Irvin, Garth Brooks, Jim Dolan and the DOJ ex-employee. I think it was fabulous because I think it really shows a united music industry in that conference yesterday was venue, promoters, managers, agents and artists. And I would say it was the most excited and most united I've ever seen them in the sense of we've got to now stand up as an industry. Artists historically have not been great at lobbying together and really the only lobbyists that exists is the Ticket Broker Association, they've done a good job. But I would say yesterday, that room was lit up that the artist and fan relationship and that books a moment when he sat out there and said, \"When I want to charge a certain price for a ticket, I don't want someone in the middle making money off my IP, I want to deliver that ticket to my fan at my price\". So I think we've been too passive in our approach on how we need to educate and act. This week was the start of where we're going to start moving. You're going to see us lean forward a lot more on education reform. And then ultimately, the part that matters the most is just being better at our products. We still are the best at the game right now. We're the only ones that have developed Verified Fan products to try to stock the secondary box. We're going to get better and better at that. We're going to be more transparent. We're going to do some new products on the Live Nation venue side that will lead the industry. So I think you'll see this year a lot more action from our side pushing back, leaning forward and ultimately better products with the artist. But I would tell you if there's one place you want to be standing right now is where we are. We work for the artist, they're very united behind us. We're doing a fabulous job for them. Scalpers have done a great job of hijacking the narrative. Obviously, when [indiscernible] start witness as the CEO of SeatGeek, we\u2019ve not done a good job. We're going to move forward this year much more aggressive telling the artist side of the story. I think FAIR Act today is a good start at that.\nDavid Karnovsky: Okay. And then for Joe, just on the quarter, the sponsorship AOI margin was a little lower than we normally see. I think there were some festivals and amp shows that had got scheduled later. So wondering if there was a mix factor there. And then just free cash flow conversion for the year, I think it was like 10% higher than you had expected? Wondering if you could just walk through the drivers of that and how sustainable that might be? Thanks.\nJoe Berchtold: Yes. I think, obviously we finished up a fantastic year. As I've told you guys in the past, I don't overly read too much in this quarter specific comparisons. You've got a lot of moving pieces. We obviously had some changes in the business with the addition of OCESA, a lot of impact last year. Timing of APAC closed most of the year. Europe only opened in the second half. So it was really just some timing shifts, nothing to read particularly into it or to read as a go-forward indication on the margin side. And then as you said, yes, our free cash flow came in very strong as the conversion to AOI. I think a little higher than expected, in part, just the overall AOI level, gave us some leverage on that. And then just some of the below the line pieces were a bit lower than what we expected. So I think we outperformed last year on that free cash flow conversion.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Laszczyk: Hey. Great, thank you. Maybe on the demand front for Michael. Thanks for the commentary on ticket sales being up 20% year-over-year on a global basis so far this year. I was hoping you could maybe expand on that a little bit by talking more about what you're seeing in demand so far through February, particularly in markets that were opened this time last year, I think like the U.S., Canada and maybe parts of Europe? As consumer pricing trends remain stable versus what you saw last year as growth accelerated or decelerated, especially now lapping some of the reopening benefits that we saw in 2022?\nMichael Rapino: So thanks Stephen.\nJoe Berchtold: I'll start.\nMichael Rapino: Go ahead Joe.\nJoe Berchtold: I'll just start with some of the numbers and then Michael can fill in with some color. So as Michael said, we're up 20% this year relative to where we were at this point last year. That's even with last year having the benefit of all those rescheduled shows, which totaled around 20 million fans. About 20 million fans got rescheduled. We think half of those would have happened last year anyway, but that means that 20% growth comp is against an inflated number, if you will. So the actual growth even stronger than that. As we noted in the release \u2013 within that international is up around 25%, which would mean that North America is still up high teens. So very good growth. If you look just at the ticket sales sold in January through mid-February this year on a global basis, we've sold roughly twice the number of tickets as we sold last year. So even looking at the most recent activity continues to be very robust globally.\nMichael Rapino: Yes. And my commentary is similar. We are just amazed at the resilience of the customer this year. I think we all lived the November air pocket thesis and everyone's view on was 2022 an exception to the rule. Could we keep growing? Where was the customer? Was it just a bubble? We see nothing but strong growth demand everywhere in the world right now. We're up right now with stadiums in Asia, South America, Eastern Europe, all of our festivals are outperforming last year around the world. Our clubs and theaters are doing well. Our on-site spend in most of those clubs and theaters we see tracking in the right direction. We'd always \u2013 in this business, you always worry about the first \u2013 the superstars are going to sell out, and then how is the rest of the business do? That's kind of the meeting the potatoes of our business. How the amphitheater shows? How is all the middle stuff going to do? And we're just seeing incredible strength right now across the board on our festivals, our big festivals or niche festivals, our theaters, clubs, we think this is going to be a continual buyer, consumers, as we said. Still look at concerts, let's zoom out again as we always do, let's forget about the 3% of shows that are going to consume political tweaks. 97% of that shows are very affordable for consumers. We're still incredibly affordable option for fans to go have a memorable night out, much more affordable than concerts. I said to Joe earlier, we absolutely have done a bad job on PR because the Super Bowl, it was a badge of honor that tickets were $5,000 or $6,000 each, and most people couldn't attain it. But concerts are still incredibly cheap overall experience versus a best ball game, a dinner, a night out or a theme park. So we think that plays in. We haven't seen any pullback. We've seen more demand top to bottom on a global basis. We think that will rise through this year.\nStephen Laszczyk: Great. And then maybe one more on regulation for Joe. You recently made a pretty notable hire on the legal front. Could you talk a little bit about the rationale for that hire and maybe update us on where you stand in the process for any potential investigation with the DOJ?\nJoe Berchtold: So we're delighted. We hired Dan Wall, for those of you who didn't see it, joined us formally following his retirement from Latham at the end of January. This is actually a conversation Dan and I started in May of 2019 at BottleRock. So Dan was planning on retiring from Latham, found working with us to be an exciting, fun business. And we talked that in 2020, he was going to announced his retirement, retire at the end of 2020, come join us. Like so many other people's plans, those got upended. So he didn't end up retiring until January, but this has been something that's been in the works now for three years that Dan wanted to do. He'll be instrumental in terms of our ongoing discussion. He's been in non-stop dialogue with the DOJ. It seems like for the past 13 years. He understands exactly the questions they asked their motivations. He just put together an op-ed piece that everybody should certainly read that was in Polestar today laying out on a fact basis as opposed to so many analysts and pundits that people refer to making broad statements about the DOJ, their process, the consent decree, risks of us being broken up. I think he does a fantastic job of laying out in very specific detail why so many of those beliefs are unfounded and I think creates a little higher requirement for people that are going to talk that way to need to disprove what he lays out there as opposed to generally speculating.\nStephen Laszczyk: Okay. Thank you for that.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Stephen Glagola with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Glagola: Yes. Thank you. Building off what you said earlier, Michael, about one of your main ticketing competitors testifying against you. Just in light of the Fair Ticketing Act, do you think there's any political will in United States to allow for primary ticketing players like Live Nation to help artists utilize their digital ticketing technology to impose controls on the resale of ticket?\nMichael Rapino: Well, I believe that the artist has the best shot when they unite around their IP. I don't think \u2013 there is \u2013 the U.S. is probably about the only country in the world that doesn't have some level of regulation. I mean most other countries walk up and said, \"Geez, if the artist wants to charge $300 an underpriced product for the fan to get a cheaper ticket why would a middleman be able to make $1,000. It doesn't seem logical, right? So most IP, if you look at the artist, you wouldn't be able to look, think about how much work Netflix is doing on password sharing just to save $7.99. So I think there's a lot of pent-up artists who are underpriced their product every day. I mean we're pretty much the only product in the world that's worth more of the second it's sold. I think they've done that for the betterment of their fan base. And like everyone else, they've seen now the sunlight online of the abuse that's been taken on their IP. So I like our position. I like stand up with the artist. I think the artists, Irving, you saw it yesterday with Garth. I do believe that the artist will have more control of their ticket like the PROJAM [ph] model they should. That doesn't mean that you are not going to transfer the tickets. We believe in tickets should have a fair exchange platform, and you should be able to exchange and sell tickets. And if an artist doesn't care about secondary then great, let the \u2013 the rush will then will move. If you do care and you want to limit it, you want to cap it at 30%, 20%. I just think that the artist since they're making the decision on how to underprice their product for the betterment of the fan should have a seat at saying, well, how does it go to market? Because we don't want the artist to continually say, well, I'm just going to charge $5,000 then, that's not better for the fan to charge market. So if they're going to charge under market, I believe that they should have a say in it. I do believe they'll be very persuasive over time with lawmakers when that story is presented. As you know, the secondary are running around trying to make sure that the second \u2013 tickets are freely transferred so they can sell them. I think that the good news in all of that's gone on in the last while, don't let a crisis go unused. I think that this has created a lot of great news as painful as it is for us some days. The bottle got on \u2013 the genie's out of the bottle. We were kind of suppressed on the back foot, not wanting to talk out loud too much about a lot of this business while we service our customers. I think the champagne bottle has been popped. I think artists I thought yesterday was very unique. I think you're going to see \u2013 we've been all sleeping, while the scalpers have done a fabulous job lobbying. I think they got woken up yesterday and recently. And I think the artist and the venue, remember have a big stake in this, right, especially sports. So I think the sports teams, sports leagues, content owners in general, like any other industry. May Kim was very clear yesterday. He talks a lot about the artist IP. We think that's a very valid position. We think that the artist or the content owner will be able to have more control on how and when they want to sell their tickets, and I think that's a big step forward.\nStephen Glagola: Thanks Michael for that. And Joe, I just had one on your CapEx spend for 2023 to $450 million. So one-third of that on maintenance CapEx implies flat with 2019 and then two-thirds implies 50% growth, I think, above 2022 levels, 82% growth above 2019 levels. Can you just provide some more color here on what those investments are? Is this in the Venue Nation business? And then any color on the hurdle rate you guys factor into this capital spend would be appreciated? Thanks.\nJoe Berchtold: Yes. A lot of the growth is certainly in the Venue Nation side. As you can imagine in 2020 and 2021, we had a substantial amount of deferred CapEx that we then do that the building is needed. Then in 2022, we were faced with a lot of supply chain constraints had to prioritize where to use the scarce resources that we were able to get. So that was a limiting factor. So there's some catch-up on the maintenance side of it. The return is really more of a rev gen side than a maintenance side. Most of the maintenance is required for continuing operation, health and safety issues. On the growth side, we have return requirements that are well above our cost of capital, haven't given specific ones, differs a bit by project, whether it's a brand-new project or it's just a \u2013 you're adding a new bar at a venue. So those are opportunities that we just think are continuing to present themselves as we expand the global footprint.\nStephen Glagola: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Bazinet: I just had a question on Concert's AOI per fan. I know you called out some of the headwinds, reopening costs, inflation for the venues you own and said it would get better. But can you just sort of frame what a reasonable AOI per fan is? I think it was $1.40 this year and maybe $2.50 or something back in 2019?\nJoe Berchtold: Yes. I don't think Concerts AOI per fan is a logical way to look at it, Jason. I think if you look at how we've talked about our business, we've talked about our business across the multiple pieces. So you have to look at it, what's the concerts plus sponsorship plus ticketing AOI per fan, which we've grown \u2013 and what we've said is that the concert business has been hit by some of these cost increases, supply chain constraints, increased costs on some of the inputs, but we've increased the overall profitability per fan both by executing on site with those fans coming to our venues, but then also by dramatically increasing our sponsorship per fan and by growing some of our ticketing revenue per fan, including the non-service fee side. So we look at it more holistically, recognizing there are going to be some puts and takes in a given year, certainly on the business.\nJason Bazinet: Can I just follow up? Because it's...\nMichael Rapino: But also just I want to give some color there. Just to remind everyone, when we sat here a year ago, we didn't think we were going to be open in the summer. We had no staff. We ran 100 miles an hour to get open for May, hire 20,000 staff, every tour, concert couldn't find trust double cost for generators. I mean, we were running hard last year. Overpaying staff, suppliers, getting the show back together was tough last year. We still obviously delivered incredible numbers, but we're now back to that 2019 level of staff in place, costs have all come down, suppliers are all back in line, generators are normal cost. So we do obviously expect 2023 to be in terms of a cost basis back to a continual normal business.\nJason Bazinet: Can I just ask 1 follow-up? Do you think the right way to look at it is that there's some sort of permanent shift in profit pools towards sponsorship and advertising and ticketing and away from concerts? In other words...\nJoe Berchtold: I think it's premature to say that. I mean let me give you another just piece on what hit us last year with concerts was we had those. I talked about the 20 million fans for shows that got rescheduled. Those are shows that went on sale in 2019 or early 2020, and we're priced at the price level for those shows back then. Fast forward a couple of years later, nobody was repricing the rescheduled shows, and yet the market particularly for the best tickets and moved up substantially. So in 2022, you were operating a pretty good chunk of your business with a 2019, 2020 revenue stream against the 2022 cost structure. That's not going to replicate itself. That was a one-time unusual event. So I think you got to take a beat, let this year play out before you draw in a conclusion off of a single data point.\nJason Bazinet: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: And at this time, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the floor back over to the management team for closing remarks.\nMichael Rapino: Thank you, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.",

            "name": "Joe Berchtold",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Given the uniqueness with our seasonality in 2022 after emerging from the pandemic, I will largely focus on our annual results. And as with prior quarters, 2019 is the best comparison for us in terms of understanding our results so much of our discussion will be relative to the full year 2019. For the company, our reported revenue of $16.7 billion for the year was $5.1 billion better than 2019 or an increase of 44%. On a constant currency basis, our revenue was $17.3 billion for the year. So there was roughly a 4% unfavorable impact due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, primarily against the euro and the pound. Our reported AOI of $1.407 billion for the year was also a record for the company, $465 million better than 2019, up 49%, led by an improvement of $345 million in ticketing and $226 million in sponsorship. On a constant currency basis, our full year AOI was $1.464 billion. The FX impact was negative $57 million or 4%. And we have converted roughly 69% of this AOI to adjusted free cash flow of $967 million, leading to a year-end free cash balance of nearly $1.8 billion. Net income for the year was also a record at $296 million, $226 million better than 2019, resulting in earnings per share of $0.64. Let me give a bit more color on each division. First, in concerts, we had the most concert fans ever with 121 million fans attending our shows in 2022, up 24% compared to 2019 when we had close to 98 million fans. Show count was 43,600 events, up 8% compared to 2019, with more fans per show due to a heavier mix of stadium and festival events. As a result, our concerts revenue for the year grew by 43% to $13.5 billion, while we delivered $170 million of AOI. Looking a bit deeper at our fan metrics. We had strong growth across the board. Stadium attendance more than doubled to 18.4 million fans this year up from 7.8 million fans in 2019. Festival attendance was 13.2 million fans for the year, up over 30% from 2019, with premier events, including Rock in Rio in Brazil, Rock Werchter in Belgium, Reading & Leeds in the UK and Lollapalooza in Chicago. Arena, amphitheater and club and theater attendance were all up double digits. And finally, our international fan count grew by nearly 50% in 2022, fueled by tremendous outdoor season in the UK and across Mainland Europe, and very strong growth in our South American markets as well as the addition of OCESA in Mexico. Giving you more details on ancillary per fan revenue by venue type, in our North America amphitheaters ancillary per fan revenue was $37, an increase of $8 per fan over 2019 levels or over 25% growth. At our major festivals globally, increased spending on concessions, camping and DIP experiences drove ancillary per fan revenue up nearly 30%. And there are theaters and clubs in the U.S. and the UK ancillary per fan revenue increased by 20%, driven by higher concession sales, fast lane entry, night of show upgrades and the move to cashless payments. As we have discussed in past quarters, we've had some headwinds associated with labor and supply chain cost pressures at venues we operate, notably amphitheaters and festivals as well as costs related to the reopening of our international markets during the year. Despite this, we still increased our per fan profitability, taking into account our company-wide revenue streams for fans attending shows at our venues. We have seen these pressures subside in recent months and do not expect the same level of impact in 2023. With this, along with our ongoing revenue initiatives and continued cost focus, we expect to continue to grow per fan profitability in 2023. Next, ticketing, where our numbers reflect sustained fan demand for the live experience. In 2022, we sold $281 million fee-bearing tickets, up 28% compared to 2019. It was the first year that our fee-bearing ticket sales exceeded non-fee-bearing ticket sales as we continue to build our global non-sports client base, particularly in international markets. With this increased ticket volume, GTV for the year was $27.5 billion, up 54% compared to 2019. Ours continues to be largely a primary ticketing business with secondary ticketing accounting for only a mid-teens percent of our overall GTV. With this activity level, revenues are over $2.2 billion for the year with AOI of $830 million. As we projected last quarter, we delivered full year margins in the high 30s, coming in at 37%. On the pricing front, average ticket prices on primary tickets rose by 17% compared to 2019, driven by fan demand for the best seats at premier concert and sporting events. Secondary ticketing pricing also rose by 12% on average and so the average secondary ticket price in the U.S. remained more than double that of a primary ticket. This shows the extent to which concerts and other live events remain priced below market value. We also saw revenue from nonservice fees grow double digits as we further build ancillary revenue streams, including insurance, upgrades and other upsells. Lastly, as Michael noted, we signed 23 million net new tickets and expect these client wins will help drive an increase in fee-bearing tickets sold for this year, positioning us for ongoing growth. Before leaving ticketing, I wanted to add a few comments on the regulatory front that Michael spoke to you. There has been a lot of discussion lately about so-called junk fees. We tend to get thrown into that conversation because the compensation to venues to help run their businesses and to Ticketmaster to distribute tickets is separately called out as a service fee instead of embedded in the price of the ticket. Very few people understand that and even fewer understand that most of the money goes to the venues. They think the service charges are just some arbitrary add-on to Ticketmaster pockets, which is not the case. We agree that real junk fees, hidden charges attached the goods and services that obscure the true price should be illegal. As one of the reasons we're advocating for legislation mandating all-in pricing where the consumer first sees the total price he or she is going to pay, as well as the breakdown of any fees. There are a range of other policy points that we're advocating for because we're strong proponents of artists and content rights, but none of these have a direct material impact on our business. Finally, it was a record year for our sponsorship business with top line revenue of $968 million, up 64%. Our AOI for this high-margin business was $592 million, up 62%. Looking back at sponsorship's growth during the year, our festival business increased by 75% and our platform integrations more than doubled. Once again, we had high growth in both on-site and online sponsorship of 61% and 64%, respectively, compared to 2019. Our international markets had an exceptional growth rate this year with AOI increasing by over 70% compared to 2019 due to greater festival activity across Europe and our expanding business in South America and Mexico. A few other points on 2023, while it's still very early in the year, based on current FX rates, we project very little impact on our revenue and AOI this year, less than 1%. We expect CapEx to be approximately $450 million this year, with two thirds on revenue-generating projects, including new venue builds and renewals and as well as other organic investments to support our growth. This is slightly higher relative to the past few years as we come out of supply chain constraints and generally tight spend controls. However, as a percentage of revenue, this is well within our historical range and consistent with our growth trajectory. We ended the year with $2.3 billion of available liquidity between free cash an untapped revolver capacity, giving us sufficient flexibility to continue investing in growth. As you're aware, in January, we issued $1 billion principal amount of 3.8 percent convertible senior notes due in 2029. As part of that transaction, we then developed a hedge to increase the effective convert price to $144. We used roughly half the net proceeds to repurchase the 2.5% convertible notes that were due in 2023, meaning we expect minimal dilution from this convert offering. We're comfortable with our leverage. Over 85% of our debt is at a fixed rate with an average cost of debt of roughly 4.7%, positioning us well in this interest rate environment. In addition, the majority of our debt is long dated and nothing is maturing within the next 18 months. Given that we're at the beginning of the year, we want to provide with more guidance on a few line items below AOI, which impact our earnings per share calculation. We anticipate the noncash compensation will be largely in line with 2022 and acquisition transaction expenses will run about two thirds of last year. As we continue our global expansion, we expect depreciation and amortization to grow by approximately $50 million for the year, evenly phased amongst the quarters. Given our recent financing, interest expense will increase to approximately $90 million per quarter. We're projecting accretion to be about 25% higher than last year, resulting from stronger forecasted future performance at a number of our joint ventures. And we anticipate that NCI and income tax expense will grow in line with AOI. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator? Thanks Brandon. It's Joe. I think when you look at our business, our business in both concerts and ticketing have been successful because they very effectively serve their constituents. So on the concert side, I mean if you go back to ten years, we and AG were roughly similar size. We've had a very focused strategy of super serving the artist, which has led to a lot of success in terms of continuing to work with more of the artists. In ticketing, we have the best product out there, full stop. Michael spoke to why it is, we've been effective continuing to work with a large number of venues because we have the best software platform for them, and we work with them to develop tools and products for artists who are their key constituents when figuring out where they're going to be touring. So, it's hard to answer your question with where would we be if we didn't have someone who developed such great tools for the venues and such, and serve the artists so well, I think, we would have a smaller industry. I think we have consistently grown the industry through our approaches to the business. And overall, the ecosystem is better for it. Yes. Just first, correction, these aren't junk fees. Junk fees are low-value hidden fees to show up later. This is our version of the markup of the base wholesale price of the product is shared by us and the venue. Amazon collects 50% of the retail price, Apple collects 30%. So this is a version of the amount of the money that goes the venue for the services they provide, Ticketmaster for the services they provide. So it's not junk fees. What we've said is that the majority of the fees go to the venue. And typically, when you renew with a venue because of the competitive nature of the bidding process, more of the fees goes to the venue. I don't think it makes much sense for us to give exact breakdowns because then, obviously, everybody below the average in the next discussion once they get to be above the average. And so it's not a very commercially wise move for us to give those specific numbers. But generally, that's been the trend, and that's what's been happening. The venue sets the fees and the venues costs have been going up, service fees have been going up. I think it would be a very unique situation where you would tell the building what their fees could be. I think it's more likely you got all-in pricing, where they see the total cost upfront quite transparently. And frankly, if you were to cap fees, what would end up happening is you then have increased rent and other costs for the artists would go up because the venue needs to recoup their costs as part of the ecosystem. Very possible that's what happened, yes. Yes. I think, obviously we finished up a fantastic year. As I've told you guys in the past, I don't overly read too much in this quarter specific comparisons. You've got a lot of moving pieces. We obviously had some changes in the business with the addition of OCESA, a lot of impact last year. Timing of APAC closed most of the year. Europe only opened in the second half. So it was really just some timing shifts, nothing to read particularly into it or to read as a go-forward indication on the margin side. And then as you said, yes, our free cash flow came in very strong as the conversion to AOI. I think a little higher than expected, in part, just the overall AOI level, gave us some leverage on that. And then just some of the below the line pieces were a bit lower than what we expected. So I think we outperformed last year on that free cash flow conversion. I'll start. I'll just start with some of the numbers and then Michael can fill in with some color. So as Michael said, we're up 20% this year relative to where we were at this point last year. That's even with last year having the benefit of all those rescheduled shows, which totaled around 20 million fans. About 20 million fans got rescheduled. We think half of those would have happened last year anyway, but that means that 20% growth comp is against an inflated number, if you will. So the actual growth even stronger than that. As we noted in the release \u2013 within that international is up around 25%, which would mean that North America is still up high teens. So very good growth. If you look just at the ticket sales sold in January through mid-February this year on a global basis, we've sold roughly twice the number of tickets as we sold last year. So even looking at the most recent activity continues to be very robust globally. So we're delighted. We hired Dan Wall, for those of you who didn't see it, joined us formally following his retirement from Latham at the end of January. This is actually a conversation Dan and I started in May of 2019 at BottleRock. So Dan was planning on retiring from Latham, found working with us to be an exciting, fun business. And we talked that in 2020, he was going to announced his retirement, retire at the end of 2020, come join us. Like so many other people's plans, those got upended. So he didn't end up retiring until January, but this has been something that's been in the works now for three years that Dan wanted to do. He'll be instrumental in terms of our ongoing discussion. He's been in non-stop dialogue with the DOJ. It seems like for the past 13 years. He understands exactly the questions they asked their motivations. He just put together an op-ed piece that everybody should certainly read that was in Polestar today laying out on a fact basis as opposed to so many analysts and pundits that people refer to making broad statements about the DOJ, their process, the consent decree, risks of us being broken up. I think he does a fantastic job of laying out in very specific detail why so many of those beliefs are unfounded and I think creates a little higher requirement for people that are going to talk that way to need to disprove what he lays out there as opposed to generally speculating. Yes. A lot of the growth is certainly in the Venue Nation side. As you can imagine in 2020 and 2021, we had a substantial amount of deferred CapEx that we then do that the building is needed. Then in 2022, we were faced with a lot of supply chain constraints had to prioritize where to use the scarce resources that we were able to get. So that was a limiting factor. So there's some catch-up on the maintenance side of it. The return is really more of a rev gen side than a maintenance side. Most of the maintenance is required for continuing operation, health and safety issues. On the growth side, we have return requirements that are well above our cost of capital, haven't given specific ones, differs a bit by project, whether it's a brand-new project or it's just a \u2013 you're adding a new bar at a venue. So those are opportunities that we just think are continuing to present themselves as we expand the global footprint. Yes. I don't think Concerts AOI per fan is a logical way to look at it, Jason. I think if you look at how we've talked about our business, we've talked about our business across the multiple pieces. So you have to look at it, what's the concerts plus sponsorship plus ticketing AOI per fan, which we've grown \u2013 and what we've said is that the concert business has been hit by some of these cost increases, supply chain constraints, increased costs on some of the inputs, but we've increased the overall profitability per fan both by executing on site with those fans coming to our venues, but then also by dramatically increasing our sponsorship per fan and by growing some of our ticketing revenue per fan, including the non-service fee side.

            "name": "Michael Rapino",
            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. In 2022, fans around the world continue to prioritize their spend on attending live events, particularly concerts. Our research consistently tells us that concerts are top priority for discretionary spending. And one of the last experiences fans will cut back on. And we're seeing this play out in both our 2022 results and early indicators for 2023. With the strong demand last year in the cancer business, we had 121 million fans attend our shows across 45 countries. While in ticketing, we helped connect 550 million fans with their favorite artists, teams and performers. In both cases, the majority of our growth came from international markets, further reinforcing the global nature of untapped fan demand and the opportunities we have for growth as we help artists reach more fans with their live music. Before getting into details on our division, just to note that 2019 is the best comparison for us in terms of understanding our results. Most of our metrics will be relative to full year 2019. In concerts, despite many markets still closed for part of last year, we grew attendance by 24% to 121 million fans at 44,000 events, which drove revenue up 43% to $13.5 billion. This growth came from all markets and venue types. Every venue type from clubs and theaters, to stadiums, to festivals, had double-digit attendance growth. We invested $9.6 billion in putting artist shows on in 2022, working with the largest superstars to artists just getting started and all those in between. This is up 45% and further reinforces our role as the largest contributor to our artist income. As part of this, we helped shift $700 million to artists with more market value ticket pricing, even as the entry price to a show stayed below $35 in the U.S. Typically, 90% of ticket sales for Live Nation shows go to artists. This is particularly important as artists are increasingly reliant on touring as they get much smaller rev shares from other music revenue streams. Part of our fan growth continues to come from the venues we operate globally, closed almost 50 million fans in 2022 with international markets, again, delivering the majority of our growth. In Venue Nation, we continued our focus on elevating the fan experience and providing a range of options for enhanced products and services. As a result, last year, we grew our average revenue per fan by 20% at all venue types. In ticketing, our strategy for success is simple. We focus on developing the leading software for venues to ensure we deliver the best enterprise platform, we invest tens of millions of dollars every year to continue innovating every aspect of ticketing technology products. Artists are the venue's largest clients, and we're regularly being asked to create new products to help address their ticketing needs. Amongst our innovations are products such as Verified Fan, designed to help artists cut down resale, and we've seen this successfully for over 400 tours, including the most recent on sales for Beyonce\u0301, Madonna and Morgan Wallen. Generally, Verified Fan onsales have approximately 5% in inventory end up on resale sites versus 20% to 30% that is typical for non-Verified Fan on sales. Venue and their artist clients see the result in the ticket sales, which is the large part why so many venues choose to work with us. Looking at our 2022 results, we grew fee-bearing ticket volume by 28% to $280 million, which in turn drove our fee-bearing GTV, up by over 50% to $28 billion across 38 countries. As a result, our ticketing revenue was $2.2 billion, up 45%. Along with these results for the year, we signed 23 million net new tickets in 2022, 70% were with international clients in the stage for continued global growth. In our sponsorship business, we have seen that brands are as eager as fans to reengage with platforms. In 2022, we had 120 large strategic sponsors globally across our businesses, 32% more than we had in 2019, including brands such as PayPal, Go PoP, Google and Snap. These large partners drove over 80% of our growth, with overall revenue up 64% to $1 billion. As with concerts and ticketing, our international markets led this growth with international sponsorship ROI up 70%. Looking ahead to 2023, as we announce any of our 2023 shows on sale. We continue to see strong consumer demand globally with no sign of any slowdown. We have four key leading indicators at this time of the year, all pointing towards another record year and even greater success in 2023. First, our deferred revenue at the end of 2022 was $2.7 billion, up 125% from 2019 and 18% from 2021, which benefited from a high volume of rescheduled chose. Next, as of mid-February, ticket sales for our shows this year exceeded 50 million fans, up 20% from this point last year with international growth of 25%. Then our global ticketing fee-bearing GTV is up 33% to $9.8 billion through the same period. And finally, over 70% of our planned sponsorship activity for the year is confirmed, again, up double digits relative to this time last year. Before I turn it over to Joe, I want to comment on the regulatory environment and industry reforms. On the regulatory front, the ticketing industry is more competitive than ever, and our market share has gone down, not up since the merger. Because of the competitive bidding process, venues regularly take more of the economics on every renewal as they set and keep a majority of the service fees. In signing the extended consent decree related to the Ticketmaster merger, we remain in constant conversations with the DOJ monitors and do not believe there have been any violations. On ticketing reforms, we believe the greater transparency on the entire ticketing ecosystem will improve the industry, and we've been engaging with policymakers to advocate for reforms. The biggest challenge facing the industry is a chaos at the on sale where fans can't get the ticket at the price they are set yet they see page of secondary sites with tickets five times the face value because of scalpers. This has been a big topic in the industry and conversations at the pulse our live conference this week, focused on how to protect the connection between the artists and their fans. To help drive progress, we launched the Fair Ticketing Act, which says artists should decide resell lots selling, speculative tickets should be illegal. The scope of the BOT Act should be expanded and enforced. And it needs to be industry-wide all-in pricing, so fans see the full cost they are paying upfront. Artists create their music and their concerts. It's only fair to create their ticket and rules too. We will always be on the side of the artist who is the best advocate for their career and their fan base. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through more details. Historically, Brandon, there was a division on what the artist was charging to the consumer and then what were the added revenue streams or fees that were going to be added on top of that. And it's kind of in search state historically. But now, as you know, we've said it many times, the artist takes most of that ticket fee base. So the way that the venue, the promoter or the ticketing company earn their revenue fees is through that extra fee. You're right we would love to more just to make it all in pricing. So the consumer is very clear from the beginning that to go see the true cost to the show isn't $25, it's $50 because that's how all of the participants need to be participate for that show to happen. Now tomorrow, if someone said, you know what, those $25 fees, you shouldn't have them. Well, then the van you would say, okay, artist, the rent isn't $50,000 anymore, it's $100,000. And the fees would add up and then all of a sudden, that ticket price wouldn't be $25, it would be $50 on a value. So it is inefficient. That's why we're a big proponent of all-in pricing and all our pricing at the beginning of the process, which you don't see right now on most companies other than ours. So we believe that we all want to know what is the true cost to see the show when I start shopping. We wish that would be mandated tomorrow across the board that would relieve a lot of the stress, the consumer's perception that there's this magical extra fee added on that is not kind of part of the overall show cost. And to your point on Live Nation owned and operated, just to hammer the point home to your point is right. If tomorrow, someone said, you know you can't charge 20% service fees on your amphitheater, you have to be $10, well, then the $75,000 house not rent that we charge Argus, would be $100,000, right? So we couldn't \u2013 we wouldn't absorb the cost. We still have to pay staff capital, run the building so we have to find the revenue in the other means. So the true cost of going to a show and making the show happen isn't the full price all in. We just need to now market that upfront better. Yes, it's a great question. First, I want to kind of look at where the drama that gets created, if you kind of zoom out, we did 550 million tickets last year, about 540 million of those were happy customers that were seamlessly delivered. About 10 million of those are five tours historically a year, have this incredible demand with supply demand is out of whack and it creates lots of tension and unhappy customers. And that's kind of always kind of been the historic challenge in the business. At Live Nation Ticketmaster, historically we've really been a B2B business. Our Ticketmaster job is to service the venue and our concert job is to service the artist. And we've done a fabulous job building those businesses and having very, very happy customers. And part of that proposition historically has been to take a bit of the heat at the front end. When the ticket prices are high, when the service fees are high, if the demand supplies out of whack, Ticketmaster has historically been the one that's taken the punch or the ticket seller in general, if you look at all ticket companies, all their NPL scores are all kind of the same. There's only two customers as Fred Rosen famously said, the one that got the ticket is happy and all the ones that didn't are pissed off, right? So you never always \u2013 you can never kind of make \u2013 this is an industry where there's just not enough inventory to make everyone happy. And we've lived that historically. But absolutely, we've got to now start adjusting on our B2C side. We've got to get much more lean forward on our government relations and our PR side. We've historically not had a big incentive to kind of shout out loud that venues are charging high service fees or artist costs are expensive that hasn't been a big business incentive to date. But I think now education is paramount. We've got to now go out and do a much better job. So the policymakers, some consumers understand how the business does operate and how we all have a hand on the wheel, and we've got to all probably do a better job going forward. One of the real challenges that I think has kind of highlighted this this core problem, right? For 40 years, there's always been a show that with not enough tickets and a fan was unhappy. Obviously, in the last while, I think which kind of set the nuclear chaos on this on sale is the secondary business. You think of what happens on those four or five big demand tours a year, that passionate fan, which is the hallmark of our business, thank god, fans are passionate. They're more passionate about the artist's relationship than they are sports or anything else. They're committed, and they want to see that artist at all costs. Now what's happening is you announce an on sale. I think Irving said it famously yesterday. We haven't announced the U2 on sale yet. We haven't announced when the dates will play. But secondary sites have U2 dates up with tickets on sale. So the consumer on these high demand on sales has really over the last couple of years, started to get pissed off and doesn't understand the process. Why are there so many tickets on spec selling sites? Why is 10 o'clock if I didn't get a ticket, are there five pages of scalper sites selling tickets for 5 times to face value. Ticketmaster, you must have given them tickets. This must \u2013 this doesn't seem fair. And that's kind of the digital ticket going online to add then a SeatGeek, StubHub, Vivid, the big scalpers with all of their ways of getting tickets before, after that's really highlighted, right? That's really become a new thing over the last few years that the consumers could see now online. They don't understand why they couldn't get a ticket and why there's so many tickets on secondary. So I think that's the part that we've got to now really lean in on that. We did that today with the Fair Act. I would tell you, yesterday, sitting at the industry conference at Polestar, if any of you want to hear the panel between Irvin, Garth Brooks, Jim Dolan and the DOJ ex-employee. I think it was fabulous because I think it really shows a united music industry in that conference yesterday was venue, promoters, managers, agents and artists. And I would say it was the most excited and most united I've ever seen them in the sense of we've got to now stand up as an industry. Artists historically have not been great at lobbying together and really the only lobbyists that exists is the Ticket Broker Association, they've done a good job. But I would say yesterday, that room was lit up that the artist and fan relationship and that books a moment when he sat out there and said, \"When I want to charge a certain price for a ticket, I don't want someone in the middle making money off my IP, I want to deliver that ticket to my fan at my price\". So I think we've been too passive in our approach on how we need to educate and act. This week was the start of where we're going to start moving. You're going to see us lean forward a lot more on education reform. And then ultimately, the part that matters the most is just being better at our products. We still are the best at the game right now. We're the only ones that have developed Verified Fan products to try to stock the secondary box. We're going to get better and better at that. We're going to be more transparent. We're going to do some new products on the Live Nation venue side that will lead the industry. So I think you'll see this year a lot more action from our side pushing back, leaning forward and ultimately better products with the artist. But I would tell you if there's one place you want to be standing right now is where we are. We work for the artist, they're very united behind us. We're doing a fabulous job for them. Scalpers have done a great job of hijacking the narrative. Obviously, when [indiscernible] start witness as the CEO of SeatGeek, we've not done a good job. We're going to move forward this year much more aggressive telling the artist side of the story. I think FAIR Act today is a good start at that. So thanks Stephen. Go ahead Joe. Yes. And my commentary is similar. We are just amazed at the resilience of the customer this year. I think we all lived the November air pocket thesis and everyone's view on was 2022 an exception to the rule. Could we keep growing? Where was the customer? Was it just a bubble? We see nothing but strong growth demand everywhere in the world right now. We're up right now with stadiums in Asia, South America, Eastern Europe, all of our festivals are outperforming last year around the world. Our clubs and theaters are doing well. Our on-site spend in most of those clubs and theaters we see tracking in the right direction. We'd always \u2013 in this business, you always worry about the first \u2013 the superstars are going to sell out, and then how is the rest of the business do? That's kind of the meeting the potatoes of our business. How the amphitheater shows? How is all the middle stuff going to do? And we're just seeing incredible strength right now across the board on our festivals, our big festivals or niche festivals, our theaters, clubs, we think this is going to be a continual buyer, consumers, as we said. Still look at concerts, let's zoom out again as we always do, let's forget about the 3% of shows that are going to consume political tweaks. 97% of that shows are very affordable for consumers. We're still incredibly affordable option for fans to go have a memorable night out, much more affordable than concerts. I said to Joe earlier, we absolutely have done a bad job on PR because the Super Bowl, it was a badge of honor that tickets were $5,000 or $6,000 each, and most people couldn't attain it. But concerts are still incredibly cheap overall experience versus a best ball game, a dinner, a night out or a theme park. So we think that plays in. We haven't seen any pullback. We've seen more demand top to bottom on a global basis. We think that will rise through this year. Well, I believe that the artist has the best shot when they unite around their IP. I don't think \u2013 there is \u2013 the U.S. is probably about the only country in the world that doesn't have some level of regulation. I mean most other countries walk up and said, \"Geez, if the artist wants to charge $300 an underpriced product for the fan to get a cheaper ticket why would a middleman be able to make $1,000. It doesn't seem logical, right? So most IP, if you look at the artist, you wouldn't be able to look, think about how much work Netflix is doing on password sharing just to save $7.99. So I think there's a lot of pent-up artists who are underpriced their product every day. I mean we're pretty much the only product in the world that's worth more of the second it's sold. I think they've done that for the betterment of their fan base. And like everyone else, they've seen now the sunlight online of the abuse that's been taken on their IP. So I like our position. I like stand up with the artist. I think the artists, Irving, you saw it yesterday with Garth. I do believe that the artist will have more control of their ticket like the PROJAM [ph] model they should. That doesn't mean that you are not going to transfer the tickets. We believe in tickets should have a fair exchange platform, and you should be able to exchange and sell tickets. And if an artist doesn't care about secondary then great, let the \u2013 the rush will then will move. If you do care and you want to limit it, you want to cap it at 30%, 20%. I just think that the artist since they're making the decision on how to underprice their product for the betterment of the fan should have a seat at saying, well, how does it go to market? Because we don't want the artist to continually say, well, I'm just going to charge $5,000 then, that's not better for the fan to charge market. So if they're going to charge under market, I believe that they should have a say in it. I do believe they'll be very persuasive over time with lawmakers when that story is presented. As you know, the secondary are running around trying to make sure that the second \u2013 tickets are freely transferred so they can sell them. I think that the good news in all of that's gone on in the last while, don't let a crisis go unused. I think that this has created a lot of great news as painful as it is for us some days. The bottle got on \u2013 the genie's out of the bottle. We were kind of suppressed on the back foot, not wanting to talk out loud too much about a lot of this business while we service our customers. I think the champagne bottle has been popped. I think artists I thought yesterday was very unique. I think you're going to see \u2013 we've been all sleeping, while the scalpers have done a fabulous job lobbying. I think they got woken up yesterday and recently. And I think the artist and the venue, remember have a big stake in this, right, especially sports. So I think the sports teams, sports leagues, content owners in general, like any other industry. May Kim was very clear yesterday. He talks a lot about the artist IP. We think that's a very valid position. We think that the artist or the content owner will be able to have more control on how and when they want to sell their tickets, and I think that's a big step forward. But also just I want to give some color there. Just to remind everyone, when we sat here a year ago, we didn't think we were going to be open in the summer. We had no staff. We ran 100 miles an hour to get open for May, hire 20,000 staff, every tour, concert couldn't find trust double cost for generators. I mean, we were running hard last year. Overpaying staff, suppliers, getting the show back together was tough last year. We still obviously delivered incredible numbers, but we're now back to that 2019 level of staff in place, costs have all come down, suppliers are all back in line, generators are normal cost. So we do obviously expect 2023 to be in terms of a cost basis back to a continual normal business. Thank you, everyone."

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir.\nMichael Rapino: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Live Nation delivered the biggest summer concert season in history that drove a record quarter. These results demonstrate the ongoing and increasing demand for live events globally, with attendance at events of all sizes from clubs to stadiums. Fans around the world continue prioritizing their spend on live events, particularly concerts. Despite varying economic headwinds, including inflation, we have not seen any pullback in demand as on-sales on-site spending, advertising, all other operating metrics continue showing strong year-on-year growth. With this demand, revenue was up over 60% relative to 2019 with each division up at least 30% and AOI up 45% to $621 million, with all divisions up at least 25%. As we expected, our performance this quarter was led by our concert business, which held 11,000 concerts to 44 million fans across 50 countries. As a result, we generated over $5 billion of revenue and $281 million AOI for the quarter, up 67% and 44% respectively relative to 2019 Q3. Shows of all types continue having strong demand with double-digit attendance growth across all venue types, including clubs, theaters, amphitheaters, arenas, stadiums and festivals. Stadiums had a particularly strong quarter with fan count more than tripling to nearly 9 million fans driven by the global demand of the top acts across a number of genres and audiences such as Bad Bunny, The Weeknd and Red Hot Chili Peppers. We delivered double-digit attendance growth across established and emerging markets around the globe from North America to Europe to South America showing our long runway of global growth. Our Venue Nation division hosted more fans with attendance up 14% relative to 2019 to $19 million for the quarter and 38 million fans year-to-date. Based on our current pacing, we expect to host more than 50 million fans at our Venue Nation and Festival division. As we have grown attendance, we have also continued driving greater market pricing for our concerts and now expect to transfer over $550 million of additional payments to artists this year, continuing our effort to help artists get the full value from their shows. And over the course of the summer, we continue to see strong onsite spend with no reduction in consumer buying habits. Ancillary per fan spending was up 20% to 30% year-to-date in our operated venues across the U.S. and Europe. The consistent theme is that fans are eager to enhance their experience, but we continue elevating our hospitality operations to provide more premium options. We still have tremendous room to expand these high-quality experiences throughout our venue portfolio, which includes over 400 venues and festivals globally, with almost 40 new venues in the pipeline. Fan demand for live events was also clear in our ticketing business. We transacted $6.7 billion of fee-generating GTV on 71 million tickets, up 69% and 42% respectively relative to 2019. This demand remained strong throughout the quarter as 2 of the 3 months were amongst the top 10 transacted GTV, excluding refund months ever. At this point, all top 10 months occurred within the past year. GTV growth was strong across both primary and secondary, up 61% and 132% respectively. Concerts were up 80% of the growth in primary GTV, while concerts and sports together accounted for over 90% of our secondary growth. Globally, new venue clients continue to seek out Ticketmaster\u2019s service due to its effectiveness of our enterprise software platform, driving venue revenue, combined with our leading online marketplace. As a result, we contracted 19 million net new tickets so far this year on a global basis. At Ticketmaster, we continue to advocate for fee transparency and live event ticketing. We advocated for all-in pricing mandate passed in New York early this year, which requires face value prices and fees to be shown upfront. And so we support the FTC mandating this nationally. We operate ticketing marketplaces in more than 30 countries around the world and have seen all-in pricing adopted successfully in many countries when mandated across the board. It only works with all ticketing marketplaces adopt together and the consumers truly can accurately compare as they shop for tickets. Sponsorship had its biggest quarter ever, following our previous record last quarter, driven by the strength of our festival and online partnerships. Our performance drove AOI of $226 million, 56% higher in 2019. Our sponsorship revenue growth has been broad-based with North America up 48% and international up 93% and we see strong demand both on-site and online, up 64% and 63% respectively this year. And our unique theater live events platforms continue to attract new brands and expand relationships with current partners. Festival sponsorship has been our largest growth driver to-date as we have effectively leveraged record festival attendance this year and compounded this growth with double-digit increases in per fan sponsorship. Platform integrations have been a great growth driver with online partnerships. As we continue to drive value and monetize opportunities via Ticketmaster\u2019s purchase process with non-service fee revenues, up double-digits relative to 2019. Clearly, 2022 has been an incredible year of returning to live events and we expect to finish strong. Ticket sales for concerts this year were up 34% for the quarter and now stand at 115 million tickets sold for the shows this year, up 37%. And more importantly, momentum is strong with early signs pointing to continued growth in 2023 across our businesses. Ticket sales for shows in 2023 are pacing even stronger than they were heading into 2022, up double-digits year-over-year, excluding sales from rescheduled shows. In our sponsorship business, confirmed commitments for 2023 are up 30% from this time last year, showing the resiliency and long-term commitments that brands have for our business. Beyond these specific leading indicators, going into 2023, we expect we will drive growth in our concert business by adding more venues to our portfolio, continued increase in ancillary per fan revenue and furthering our efforts to deliver market value for the shows to the artists. And in ticketing, we expect to also benefit from these market pricing trends while continuing to globally add new clients to our world class platform. With that, I will turn it over to Joe.\nJoe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael and good afternoon everyone. As with last quarter, 2019 is the best comparison for us in terms of understanding our results. So, most of our discussion will be relative to Q3 of 2019. For the company, our reported revenue of $6.2 billion for the quarter was $2.4 billion better than Q3 2019 or an increase of 63%. On a constant currency basis, our revenue was $6.4 billion for the quarter. So, there was roughly a 3% impact due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar. This was a record quarter for revenue for the second quarter in a row and bested our Q2 figure by 39%. And our reported AOI of $621 million for the quarter was $194 million better than 2019, up 45% and led by an improvement of over $86 million in concerts and $81 million in sponsorship. On a constant currency basis, our Q3 AOI was $645 million. The FX impact of negative $24 million or 4% was largely driven by the devaluation of the euro and the pound. And year-to-date, we have converted roughly 76% of this AOI to adjusted free cash flow of $996 million. Let me give a bit more color on each division then I will give you more on leading indicators. First, in concerts, our AOI was $281 million for the quarter, which compares to $194 million in Q3 of 2019, an improvement of 44%. U.S. concert\u2019s strongest quarter ever far surpassing the previous record of $200 million AOI in Q3 of 2018. It was a stellar summer season for concerts. We had over 44 million fans in the quarter, the most ever, growing 40% compared to Q3 of 2019 when we had close to 32 million fans. Looking a bit deeper at our fan metrics, stadium attendance more than tripled to 8.7 million fans in Q3 of this year and festival attendance was 6.5 million fans in the quarter, up nearly 40% from Q3 of 2019 with premier events, including Rock in Rio, Rock Werchter, Reading and Lollapalooza. Pricing has been a key part of our strategy in 2022 capturing market pricing for the best tickets while maintaining an affordable entry point for all fans. For tickets sold to shows at our amphitheaters, arenas and stadiums globally this year, front-of-house pricing increased for each by double-digits relative to 2019, while starting prices for all shows in the U.S. rose just 6% and remain under $35 on average. And giving you more details on ancillary per fan revenue by venue type in our U.S. amphitheaters, ancillary per fan revenue was $38, an increase of $8 per fan over 2019 levels or close to 30% growth. At our major festivals globally, increased spending on concessions, camping and VIP experiences drove ancillary per fan revenue up by nearly 30%. And that our theaters and clubs in the U.S. and the UK, ancillary per fan revenue increased by over 20%, driven by higher concession sales, fast lane entry, night of show upgrades and the move to cashless payments. On the cost side, as indicated before, increases continue to impact this primarily in the venues we operate, amphitheaters, theaters and clubs and festivals. But in all cases, we are delivering double-digit growth in profitability per fan due to increased ticket sales and ancillary revenue. Next, ticketing had another successful quarter, delivering $163 million in AOI, nearly 30% higher than Q3 of 2019. Q3 was our top quarter ever in terms of reported ticket sales in GTV and it was our second highest quarter ever in terms of transacted ticket sales in GTV behind only Q2 of this year. When we look at the year-to-date performance of our ticketing business, the numbers reflect the incredible demand we have had. Through September 30, we have sold 197 million fee-bearing tickets, up 38 million tickets or 24% compared to 2019. GTV for the first 9 months is $19 billion, up $6.3 billion or 49% compared to 2019. As a result, revenues are close to $1.6 billion for the first 9 months of the year, which is up almost $500 million or 45% compared to 2019. And with all this, we drove AOI to $600 million, up 71% as we deliver strong operating leverage. Across both sporting and concert events, ticket buyers continue to prioritize purchasing the best seats available, driving a 17% average price increase in the primary market year-to-date relative to 2019. Secondary pricing has risen by 10% on average with sales volume up as well. With these increases, the average secondary ticket price in the U.S. remains almost twice that of a primary ticket, demonstrating additional opportunities for market-based pricing as well as a large buffer from any demand shifts. For those of you focused on margins, as we have indicated previously, it\u2019s difficult to evaluate based on a single quarter. Q3 margins were impacted by our mix of clients and shows, along with technology investments. All of this is as expected and in line with our full year margin expectations in the high-30s as we have been indicating over the past few quarters. Finally, growth in our high-margin sponsorship business continued this quarter, with revenue up 59% relative to Q3 2019 and now up 64% year-to-date. We once again had high growth in both onsite and online sponsorship, driving record Q3 AOI of $226 million, 56% higher than our Q3 2019 AOI. Looking back at sponsorship\u2019s growth through the first 9 months, we have seen our festival business nearly double and our platform integrations more than double. Our strategic multiyear multi-asset sponsors now generate $0.75 billion in revenue for us. Back in 2017, we had 56 such clients, representing approximately two-thirds of our total sponsorship revenue. Today, that number has grown to over 100 such partners that account for 80% of our revenue, growth in both the number of partners and the level of their spend, which demonstrates the value we deliver and the importance they place on our unique on-site and online scale platforms. As we look to the remainder of 2022, starting with our leading indicators through late October, all relative to 2019, concert ticket sales are over 115 million tickets for events this year, up 37% and 20% higher than our full year 2019 fan count. Second, Ticketing has sold over 200 million primary fee-bearing tickets for events this year, up 27% relative to 2019 at this point. Of these, 135 million tickets are for concert events, which is 38% higher than 2019. Related to this, we had $1.9 billion in event-related deferred revenue, consistent with our levels in Q3 of 2021, despite the deferred shows in last year\u2019s numbers. Excluding the deferred shows from last year\u2019s numbers, we would be up 35% year-on-year. A few other points on 2022, given our presence in the UK and mainland Europe, we have experienced FX headwinds. And through the end of September, our AOI has been negatively impacted by $47 million. This was almost entirely in the second and third quarters as the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against the euro and British pound. Based on current forward rates, we expect a 4% impact to AOI in the final quarter of this year. Due to some delays in construction projects as a result of supply chain disruptions, our 2022 capital expenditures forecast is now approximately $300 million, with roughly two-thirds allocated to revenue-generating projects. We expect the key revenue-generating projects, which are delayed, will still be completed early next year. So don\u2019t anticipate any impact next year on the return from these projects. We expect free cash flow conversion from AOI to be in the mid to high 50s for the full year. We ended Q3 with $2.6 billion of available liquidity between free cash and untapped revolver capacity, giving us sufficient flexibility to continue investing in growth. We are comfortable with our leverage with over 85% of our debt at a fixed rate, and our average cost of debt is roughly 4.5% positioning us well in this interest rate environment. In addition, the majority of our debt is long dated with only our 2023 convertible debt maturing within the next 2 years. We will continue to optimize our capital structure based on market conditions. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Ross: Hey, everyone. At this point, most investor focus is on 2023. So I wanted to dig a little more there. And I know it\u2019s hard to determine the demand side for the full year. But can you speak maybe quantitatively and qualitatively about the supply side for next year? I think last year, you gave that kind of top touring apps for the year ahead and what that looked like year-over-year. How is that trending? And then what\u2019s your view on the quality of the supply next year versus this current year?\nMichael Rapino: I\u2019ll start on the quality. We\u2019re seeing a really good pipe for next year. I would say there would be no difference in \u201823 to \u201822 in terms of quality. If you were a stadium act, a large selling arena act, you probably debated whether you went out in \u201822 or you went out in \u201823. So, lots of great artists in the pipe from clubs to stadiums to arenas. It will look like a similar year in terms of quality.\nBrandon Ross: Second piece. So...\nJoe Berchtold: Yes and \u2013 just a few other specifics. As Michael said, our sales for next year are up double digits. I mean if you want to take these three so-called quality references, we\u2019re most up in stadiums which, by their definition are going to be the largest artists that can sell the most tickets. So that would indicate we are off to a good quality start. The other is if we look at tickets sold per show that we have on sale for next year from amps, arenas, stadiums, festivals in all cases, our tickets sold at the on sales are up relative to what they were at this point last year for 2022 shows. So I think those are all good indicators of both the breadth and the depth of the supply that\u2019s going out.\nBrandon Ross: Great. And then keeping on \u201823, you said your book sponsorship is, I think, up 30% year-over-year. And that\u2019s kind of a different story than we\u2019re hearing across the ad and sponsorship universe. Have you seen any recent slowdown there? And why generally do you think your trends in Sponsorship are different than what we\u2019re seeing?\nJoe Berchtold: No. We haven\u2019t seen any slowdown. I think it\u2019s different pools of money from strategy. The Sponsorship relationships with us are not decided week-to-week, month-to-month based on what they are trying to get out of performance marketing. These are long-term commitments by major brands. Michael gave you the stats. It\u2019s really being driven by these big multiyear, multi-asset, multimillion-dollar relationships. So we\u2019re up 30% with over half our book of business for next year already filled and not seeing a slowdown. So we\u2019re feeling very comfortable with it.\nMichael Rapino: Brandon, for comparison, the \u2013 if the NFL was a public company or NBA, I\u2019m sure that would be reporting record sponsorship also. So we kind of put us off from that league, right? He\u2019s not having any pullback. If you\u2019ve got a scarce commodity like a beyond state tour or an NFL game, those are still very rare pieces of business that you want to be associated with, and they have longevity to them. So we haven\u2019t seen any slowdown talking to the NBA and NFL. We haven\u2019t seen it over there either. So I think those are the comparables for you.\nBrandon Ross: Okay. And then just finally, on the regulatory front, there is noise is kind of there always is. What would \u2013 I know you went on the offensive on the Ticketing transparency, but what would be the fallout if there are changes to that law for you? And is there any other potential pressure, regulatory pressure that you\u2019re seeing or otherwise contending with right now?\nJoe Berchtold: Yes. We don\u2019t believe there will be any impact whatsoever if there was a nationwide mandate for all-in pricing. We think it makes sense. It just has to be done collectively at the same time. And if you look back and you listen to the comments, the comments were all about transparency, which is really all-in pricing. The commentary was not about fee levels or any of the other issues that some people have brought up. That\u2019s been looked at, and we feel comfortable with what our business model is in that regard. So I think that we will work with the FTC. We will work with the DA in the State of New York, and we\u2019re very supportive of that and some other shifts to make ticketing more transparent and a better consumer experience.\nMichael Rapino: Just a couple of points to jump on, we tend to do better as regulation comes into play in this space. A lot of our business has been chasing the secondary business for years that\u2019s kind of unregulated. We would love spec selling to be outlawed. We\u2019d love better rules on bot ticketing. We love all-in pricing. We\u2019re adhering to all-in pricing in New York right now. I think we\u2019re probably the only ticketing company actually adhering to those regulations right now. So we like sunlight coming to the business. The most part of the business that\u2019s been unregulated and most of the noise is generated from the secondary business. So we love regulation, puts us on an equal footing ground. Right now, in our secondary business, we don\u2019t do spec selling. That\u2019s probably 30% to 40% of what inventory sits on secondary sites. We don\u2019t price below face value. So we actually operate at a disadvantage right now because we are operating in a higher standard. So we had a lot more transparency. We\u2019d love to have the fees more transparent upfront, all-in pricing. We just have to make sure everybody plays by the same rules, but we\u2019re going to lead those pieces. As far as the fees, just to remind you, it\u2019s the venues that set the fee and take most of the fees. So I think if you bought \u2013 if you build a multi-hundred million arena or a stadium, I think your prerogative to decide what is the fee you want to charge on your sports and music tickets. We get a piece of that, but those are set by the venue and monetized by the venue. So just kind of some of the ongoing transparencies of the business, we\u2019ve got to do a better job explaining.\nBrandon Ross: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thanks. Maybe I\u2019ll flip Brandon\u2019s first question around and push on the demand side. But you\u2019ve been able to maintain AOI growth in a low double-digit range over a long period. And you\u2019ve done that in markets even a time for fan attendance has been down. And I know you just spoke to the supply, but given that uncertain demand environment, how do you think about some of the other factors in your control on revenue or cost that can kind of keep you in that historical range?\nMichael Rapino: I\u2019m going to let Joe jump in, but I just want to make sure, don\u2019t discount the supply side, right? That\u2019s like talking to Disney and saying, if you only have Marvel movies, how is your demand going to be? It\u2019s going to be great. Supply and content drives the demand. So if you\u2019ve got a lot of great, great quality supply, the demand is a little easier. So I don\u2019t want you to discount that. We\u2019re very proud that we work with the best artists in the world. We have the best global platform for those artists and attractive to our platform. That\u2019s what you have to make sure you first have. So we have the blockbusters top to bottom. That\u2019s going to drive the demand. Now Joe will take over in terms of explaining the demand strength so far we\u2019ve seen.\nJoe Berchtold: Yes. So again, just to \u2013 I mean, to repeat the numbers, which are the mix of supply and demand, which is that our tickets sold for the shows that we have on sale for next year are up consistently across all venue types relative to a year ago. So the demand is absolutely coming for the supply that\u2019s showing up. Now on a broader basis, you\u2019re right, we\u2019ve consistently \u2013 if you looked at 2010 to 2019, we\u2019ve consistently grown our business double-digit AOI. In 2011, we grew our business double-digit AOI while fan attendance was down. So we do have a number of other levers, and Michael spoke to those as part of his commentary. We\u2019re continuing to grow our venue base. And fans that shows in our venues are much more profitable than others. We continue to have increased on-site spend. We continue to have pricing as a lever, which drives through both our concerts business and our ticketing business continuing to add globally Ticketmaster clients. And then I\u2019ve given you the numbers on Sponsorship, which we think continues to be a double-digit growth business into the future. So all of those levers on top of the supply-demand dynamic is what gives us confidence as we continue to look to our future of the growth potential.\nMichael Rapino: And Joe, I just want to jump in on the demand in terms of how the demand is spread. There is certain thesis as they like to get spread. Our demand is \u2013 overall concert ticket is still a really affordable ticket. Most majority of the tickets are sold are $50 to $75. So, although we have a great premium business that does attract a high-end customer or someone that\u2019s a rapid fan, our business is split from clubs to theaters to stadiums, we\u2019re seeing demand strong on all levels. Whether it\u2019s a $19 ticket, it\u2019s filling up the clubs or the premium at the stadiums and arenas. So we do think we have something for everyone. It is a very accessible ticket even in a pull back time. And we\u2019re seeing that the demographic of our buyer is very, very wide and split across all sizes.\nJoe Berchtold: Yes, Michael, sorry, just to jump back in on you. Again, counter to some of the commentary that I\u2019ve heard out there were also \u2013 we\u2019re not dependent on acts that have been around for a long time. If you look at how vibrant the new artists are \u2013 I mean, I look at our top artists we\u2019ve had this year, the Harry Styles, Dua Lipas, Billy Eilish, Bad Bunny, Morgan Wallen, The Weeknd, Olivia Rodrigo. These are all artists that are at the early stages of their career. Across, as Michael talked about, all genres, most of those are obviously in arenas and stadiums, but these are tremendous talents that are just showing the breadth of supply that we have in our business.\nDavid Karnovsky: Okay. And then I had a question on online sponsorship, which is really strong in the quarter. How do we think about the driver of growth here in terms of band or traffic increases on your website or apps versus actions which are more in your control, like the platform integration, as you mentioned? And then how much kind of room is there to grow some of these sponsorships?\nJoe Berchtold: Yes. Our focus this year has obviously been on the latter of how do we create new assets on this Ticketmaster platform that can continue to drive the economics. And then as you improve your volume of tickets or improve your site visits, the math is just additional growth on top of that. So, we feel like we would view any other platform we own in its own way just a counterpart to the on-site. We have people\u2019s attention through a period of time. We have them going through a purchase process. And all of that is something that we can monetize. We saw a great progress on the platform integrations, particularly around the checkout this year. We think there is earlier upstream. We think there is advertising dollars that can still be significant that we can drive from it. And we are focused much more on how do we use Ticketmaster as a platform to drive its own set of non-service fee revenue streams. And we think that has a long runway.\nDavid Karnovsky: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Laszczyk: Hey. Great. Thank you. Maybe one for Michael on pricing, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the advice you are giving to most artists with respect to pricing their concerts next year. Is your messaging more that maybe there is still some opportunity to take price, given the strong demand that you are seeing this year, or is maybe at \u201823 is a year where artists need to be a little bit more focused on selling out rather than taking price?\nMichael Rapino: Yes. I wouldn\u2019t say \u201823 \u2013 our conversation is any different than it\u2019s been in any year. We have an incredible \u2013 great pricing team, a lot of data scientists that are talking and analyzing the business with our managers and agents. So, as you know, there is no one paint brush, depending on what artists \u2013 where you are in your cycle and what your demand is. So, I just saw some counts this morning for Shenoy [ph] went up, up-sell. Today, big, big numbers out of the box. She is an iconic artist. So, you are not worried about pricing if you are talking to Shenoy and how she prices her tour, if you are a little baby going on tour next year. You have a younger demo, you are building your audience, maximizing your growth isn\u2019t your priority. It\u2019s getting to as many markets and fans as you can. So, I wouldn\u2019t say \u201823 is even in my buyers\u2019 minds right now. What is in their head is over the last few years, it\u2019s just better pricing dynamic strategy from day one on the market. Price is different on a Friday than a Tuesday, the aisle seat\u2019s worth more than the middle. The front is always underpriced. We have yet to see anything get close to secondary demand yet. So, most of our shows are still going to be underpriced in the front. So, our job is to do what we can up-sell the front, so we can lower the price in the back, get sell-through all the way through. So, I wouldn\u2019t say that any artist or manager is having any panic of talking to me about demand for next year. They know the Taylor Swift ticket Verified Fan that went up this week that\u2019s probably going to break all records. I mean artists are seeing the demand is there. If you price it smart, you have got the right markets. You have been out of the market maybe 3 years, 4 years. We are not feeling the demand from inflation or \u201823 pressures that are driving strategy. It\u2019s just overall us being better at what we do today than we were last year and the year before on pricing strategy per market by artist for territory.\nStephen Laszczyk: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then perhaps somewhat related to that, secondary GTV grew more than twice as fast as primary GTV in the third quarter, could you just comment on some of the key factors driving that outsized growth in secondary? And is this something you think you can continue in light of the pricing strategy you outlined?\nJoe Berchtold: Yes. I think as Michael will talk to you, first and foremost, our strategy is to help ours get paid market value for their show. And we are spending more and more on having the people and the data to help them do that. That said, for a lot of reasons that he went over around how they want to build their fan base, how they want to build their brands, they are leaving money on the table. And we are continuing to see that just almost insatiable demand in the secondary market. I talked about average price of a secondary ticket is still almost twice that of a primary ticket. So, that continues to grow, and we continue to price a little bit trying to catch up to that. So, we don\u2019t see the secondary market going away anytime soon, and we are going to be active participants. And I talked, I think last quarter about the fact that we believe the shift to secondary tickets has helped us because it\u2019s just eliminated friction to use us as the secondary platform to buy and sell the tickets. As we get better and better with that Ticketmaster app, you can manage your tickets, you can sell them, you can buy them on our secondary. As all of that gets easier and easier, I think that just naturally continues to build the business with us.\nStephen Laszczyk: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Glagola with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Glagola: Hi. Thanks for the question. Michael and Joe, can you maybe just update us on \u2013 and I know you spoke earlier around the regulatory risk and concerns around \u2013 on FTC regulation and all-in pricing. But I think there is also investor concerns around the DoJ still. And maybe just update us where things stand with your consent decree? And maybe also touching on in relation to that, client wins on ticketing have been very strong over the last 21 months, 36 million in tickets. So, maybe the competitiveness of the primary ticketing market in the United States and how you see that relative to those wins and with regards to regulation? Thanks.\nJoe Berchtold: As regards to the consent decree, we have an ongoing discussion. We have an external monitor who we have regular dialogue with. We have an internal monitor who oversees everything. We are very happy that we have got an active dialogue now, which is what was lacking in the first 10 years post our merger. We feel good about all of those discussions. I don\u2019t think there is anything structural, substantive that we are finding that\u2019s inconsistent with the message that we send all of our people, which is these are independent decisions on promotion and ticketing and the two shouldn\u2019t be tied together. So, we feel good about that process that we have with them. As we look at Ticketmaster, I think it\u2019s continuing to be successful because it\u2019s a very effective platform. I think if you look at \u2013 again, we have talked a lot over the past few quarters about because of our continually improving in high-quality platform, both for the enterprise side as well as the customer side, particularly internationally, that\u2019s differentiated and driving a lot of wins internationally. North America, where it\u2019s more a mature market, you need to be able to compete on price in addition to features. And I think our business has shown that we can continue to scale that, grow it and do so very profitably.\nStephen Glagola: Thanks Joe. And if \u2013 I just have one more follow-up here. On industry publications, have reported a trend of tickets for top-tier act seen strong demand and then the lesser known and emerging artists are struggling. I know you had some commentary today where that wasn\u2019t the case. But as you look out over the next 12 months or so, does that \u2013 are you seeing that potentially an impact on your business or a trend? And maybe can you just talk about both of those segments of artists in a recessionary environment and how they would hold up the high-end top-tier acts relative to the emerging artists and lesser known ones? Thanks.\nMichael Rapino: Yes. Just on a macro level, this is a business that overall we don\u2019t win \u2013 most shows don\u2019t sell out. Majority of your shows don\u2019t sell out, always room for a few more tickets to be sold. So, although the press always talks about the expensive tickets or the sold-out ticket, that\u2019s not your real business. Your real business is night and day, theater, clubs, amphitheaters, arenas, selling those tickets night by night. So, most tours ultimately do well in the end, artists make money and we make money. There are some tours a small percentage that just don\u2019t sell enough ticket, the demand isn\u2019t there. And the tour that gets canceled or the promoter and the artist lose money. So, I have seen some of those publications where they want to grab those six tours or some that didn\u2019t make money and then try to extrapolate something larger. So, I just don\u2019t see that trend. We did over 8,000 club shows last year and 95% are going to make money and do well and the artists will deliver those 400 tickets or 1,100 tickets as they are building their business and their costs are associated with it. It was a tougher year for all of the industry as the supply chain challenges, labor, everyone getting back to work, getting the security guards, everyone\u2019s costs were up this year. So, that would have affected all artists on the road relative to their revenue. But those seem to have worked their way through the system. So, I don\u2019t see any trend that the emerging or younger artists are having any harder time than any young emerging artists when they are taking those risks building their businesses on the way up. Generally, majority are going to be okay in terms of selling enough tickets, paying the bills and building their business. So, we don\u2019t see any trends in the bottom end, any new trends that would suggest that the club and the emerging artists space isn\u2019t growing. There is more clubs opening up all the time, lots of demand in every market, lots of options for artists to play 500 seats, 1,000 seats. We just know from our venue portfolio on the demand on opening up and building theaters and clubs is bigger than ever. So, that demand wouldn\u2019t be driven if the supply wasn\u2019t there.\nStephen Glagola: Thank you, Michael. Appreciate it.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Supino: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. First on Taylor Swift, I just want to say with my 16-year-old daughter and I are signed up for the pre-sale, very much appreciate you support on the 15th of the month. Moving on, in the press release, you highlighted that growth in your concert business in \u201823 will come from adding more venues to your operating portfolio and increasing ancillary per fan revenue. So, we didn\u2019t see any mention of fan growth. And then in the discussion today, we have obviously heard a lot of talk about a robust first half of \u201823. And so if you will forgive me kind of picking up this \u201823 topic, again, I would love to understand how much visibility the company has into the second half of the year. I think booking cycles for the big venues are six months to nine months out. So, that\u2019s one question. And second one was just as strong as your fan growth has been this year, does this change how aggressively you might go out and invest in new venues, possibly larger ones, even ones outside of the country? Thanks so much.\nJoe Berchtold: So, just technically, Peter, just to answer your first question, I think the way that we have laid out the story in the release and then Michael talked about it is, first, he talked about the fact that ticket sales are up. He talked about the sponsorship growth. And then he said, in addition to those, there are a number of other levers that we have to continue to grow the business. So, I don\u2019t think he ever said anything that said we weren\u2019t \u2013 the fan growth didn\u2019t come into this. At this point, looking at \u201823, yes, we have got some of the stadiums we talked about high growth in arenas. Some of that\u2019s booked. It\u2019s still somewhat early for the second half of the year. But macro in terms of our pipeline for next year, it would account for more fans than we had going into this year. The hard part that we have is just sorting out because of the shows that were rescheduled, trying to figure out how many of those were naturally flown into this year versus not. But we are feeling very good about the attendance levels for next year. Michael will talk about the venues.\nMichael Rapino: Yes. I think just on Joe\u2019s point, we are excited to be sitting here. We knew the thesis that you could sell on was that there was an air pocket. We heard that comment a lot \u201823 was an exceptional year. And it was \u2013 \u201822, I mean been an exceptional year. The idea that we were able to grow this business for so long on our high-double digits on \u2013 high-single digits on our fan base and then to have a year like \u201822, you blow the doors off it, and now to be able to sit here and say, and we think we will still grow on top. We are very proud of our business and our outlook, given the headwinds and the size of the gains we had this year. So, we are looking into now beyond that and how we keep growing the business forward. Venues, I have laid out over the last year or 2 years, we think it\u2019s a great business. We have 300 in our portfolio. It\u2019s a great way to obviously maximize that live event fully when you are vertical. So, we like our global pipeline we have right now. We are seeing a lot of white space where our content can help drive that business case from arenas to amphitheaters to big ballrooms and theaters. So, you will continually see us adding as we have been over the last many years to that portfolio.\nPeter Supino: Thanks Michael. Thanks Joe.\nOperator: We have time for one final question from the line of David Katz from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Katz: Thanks for taking my question. In the past, you have talked about the evolution of digital ticketing. And I know there was some commentary, I believe in the spending to that end. An update on sort of how that\u2019s progressed, where it is and what we might expect in the near-term and longer term would be helpful, please.\nJoe Berchtold: Yes. I think digital ticketing at this point is nearly ubiquitous in North America. It has grown rapidly internationally. It\u2019s still a year or 2 years behind. I would expect this to be pretty much there sometime between next year and maybe the year after, just depending a bit by market. And as it\u2019s gotten established, it\u2019s already helped us in a number of areas. I talked about secondary a few minutes ago. So, we are seeing some direct benefits as we continue to improve the ability in terms of how fans manage their tickets. I think you will continue to see more products get added on to the app. They continue to improve what the fan \u2013 how the fans can manage their tickets. And then it sets us up for the advertising and up-sells that we have been talking about. And we now have enough scale. We started doing some things this year at scale, working with sponsors who want to deliver value on site to our fans, working with the concert side of the business to enable direct up-sells. And I think all of those features that come from having a direct connection to the people actually attending the shows will be a key focus for how we continue to drive our sponsorship business over the next few years.\nDavid Katz: And there is a sort of clear quantifiable earnings benefit where the rubber meets the road from that, correct?\nJoe Berchtold: Yes. And I think you see part of that as we talked about what is our non-Ticketmaster, what\u2019s our non-service fee revenue that we are driving and the fact that, that\u2019s up double digits from \u201819. This is all a part of that.\nDavid Katz: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mike for closing comments.\nEnd of Q&A:\nMichael Rapino: Thank you everyone. We will see you at our Investor Day in Liberty in November. You can check our website for more details. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joe Berchtold",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael and good afternoon everyone. As with last quarter, 2019 is the best comparison for us in terms of understanding our results. So, most of our discussion will be relative to Q3 of 2019. For the company, our reported revenue of $6.2 billion for the quarter was $2.4 billion better than Q3 2019 or an increase of 63%. On a constant currency basis, our revenue was $6.4 billion for the quarter. So, there was roughly a 3% impact due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar. This was a record quarter for revenue for the second quarter in a row and bested our Q2 figure by 39%. And our reported AOI of $621 million for the quarter was $194 million better than 2019, up 45% and led by an improvement of over $86 million in concerts and $81 million in sponsorship. On a constant currency basis, our Q3 AOI was $645 million. The FX impact of negative $24 million or 4% was largely driven by the devaluation of the euro and the pound. And year-to-date, we have converted roughly 76% of this AOI to adjusted free cash flow of $996 million. Let me give a bit more color on each division then I will give you more on leading indicators. First, in concerts, our AOI was $281 million for the quarter, which compares to $194 million in Q3 of 2019, an improvement of 44%. U.S. concert's strongest quarter ever far surpassing the previous record of $200 million AOI in Q3 of 2018. It was a stellar summer season for concerts. We had over 44 million fans in the quarter, the most ever, growing 40% compared to Q3 of 2019 when we had close to 32 million fans. Looking a bit deeper at our fan metrics, stadium attendance more than tripled to 8.7 million fans in Q3 of this year and festival attendance was 6.5 million fans in the quarter, up nearly 40% from Q3 of 2019 with premier events, including Rock in Rio, Rock Werchter, Reading and Lollapalooza. Pricing has been a key part of our strategy in 2022 capturing market pricing for the best tickets while maintaining an affordable entry point for all fans. For tickets sold to shows at our amphitheaters, arenas and stadiums globally this year, front-of-house pricing increased for each by double-digits relative to 2019, while starting prices for all shows in the U.S. rose just 6% and remain under $35 on average. And giving you more details on ancillary per fan revenue by venue type in our U.S. amphitheaters, ancillary per fan revenue was $38, an increase of $8 per fan over 2019 levels or close to 30% growth. At our major festivals globally, increased spending on concessions, camping and VIP experiences drove ancillary per fan revenue up by nearly 30%. And that our theaters and clubs in the U.S. and the UK, ancillary per fan revenue increased by over 20%, driven by higher concession sales, fast lane entry, night of show upgrades and the move to cashless payments. On the cost side, as indicated before, increases continue to impact this primarily in the venues we operate, amphitheaters, theaters and clubs and festivals. But in all cases, we are delivering double-digit growth in profitability per fan due to increased ticket sales and ancillary revenue. Next, ticketing had another successful quarter, delivering $163 million in AOI, nearly 30% higher than Q3 of 2019. Q3 was our top quarter ever in terms of reported ticket sales in GTV and it was our second highest quarter ever in terms of transacted ticket sales in GTV behind only Q2 of this year. When we look at the year-to-date performance of our ticketing business, the numbers reflect the incredible demand we have had. Through September 30, we have sold 197 million fee-bearing tickets, up 38 million tickets or 24% compared to 2019. GTV for the first 9 months is $19 billion, up $6.3 billion or 49% compared to 2019. As a result, revenues are close to $1.6 billion for the first 9 months of the year, which is up almost $500 million or 45% compared to 2019. And with all this, we drove AOI to $600 million, up 71% as we deliver strong operating leverage. Across both sporting and concert events, ticket buyers continue to prioritize purchasing the best seats available, driving a 17% average price increase in the primary market year-to-date relative to 2019. Secondary pricing has risen by 10% on average with sales volume up as well. With these increases, the average secondary ticket price in the U.S. remains almost twice that of a primary ticket, demonstrating additional opportunities for market-based pricing as well as a large buffer from any demand shifts. For those of you focused on margins, as we have indicated previously, it's difficult to evaluate based on a single quarter. Q3 margins were impacted by our mix of clients and shows, along with technology investments. All of this is as expected and in line with our full year margin expectations in the high-30s as we have been indicating over the past few quarters. Finally, growth in our high-margin sponsorship business continued this quarter, with revenue up 59% relative to Q3 2019 and now up 64% year-to-date. We once again had high growth in both onsite and online sponsorship, driving record Q3 AOI of $226 million, 56% higher than our Q3 2019 AOI. Looking back at sponsorship's growth through the first 9 months, we have seen our festival business nearly double and our platform integrations more than double. Our strategic multiyear multi-asset sponsors now generate $0.75 billion in revenue for us. Back in 2017, we had 56 such clients, representing approximately two-thirds of our total sponsorship revenue. Today, that number has grown to over 100 such partners that account for 80% of our revenue, growth in both the number of partners and the level of their spend, which demonstrates the value we deliver and the importance they place on our unique on-site and online scale platforms. As we look to the remainder of 2022, starting with our leading indicators through late October, all relative to 2019, concert ticket sales are over 115 million tickets for events this year, up 37% and 20% higher than our full year 2019 fan count. Second, Ticketing has sold over 200 million primary fee-bearing tickets for events this year, up 27% relative to 2019 at this point. Of these, 135 million tickets are for concert events, which is 38% higher than 2019. Related to this, we had $1.9 billion in event-related deferred revenue, consistent with our levels in Q3 of 2021, despite the deferred shows in last year's numbers. Excluding the deferred shows from last year's numbers, we would be up 35% year-on-year. A few other points on 2022, given our presence in the UK and mainland Europe, we have experienced FX headwinds. And through the end of September, our AOI has been negatively impacted by $47 million. This was almost entirely in the second and third quarters as the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against the euro and British pound. Based on current forward rates, we expect a 4% impact to AOI in the final quarter of this year. Due to some delays in construction projects as a result of supply chain disruptions, our 2022 capital expenditures forecast is now approximately $300 million, with roughly two-thirds allocated to revenue-generating projects. We expect the key revenue-generating projects, which are delayed, will still be completed early next year. So don't anticipate any impact next year on the return from these projects. We expect free cash flow conversion from AOI to be in the mid to high 50s for the full year. We ended Q3 with $2.6 billion of available liquidity between free cash and untapped revolver capacity, giving us sufficient flexibility to continue investing in growth. We are comfortable with our leverage with over 85% of our debt at a fixed rate, and our average cost of debt is roughly 4.5% positioning us well in this interest rate environment. In addition, the majority of our debt is long dated with only our 2023 convertible debt maturing within the next 2 years. We will continue to optimize our capital structure based on market conditions. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator? Yes and \u2013 just a few other specifics. As Michael said, our sales for next year are up double digits. I mean if you want to take these three so-called quality references, we're most up in stadiums which, by their definition are going to be the largest artists that can sell the most tickets. So that would indicate we are off to a good quality start. The other is if we look at tickets sold per show that we have on sale for next year from amps, arenas, stadiums, festivals in all cases, our tickets sold at the on sales are up relative to what they were at this point last year for 2022 shows. So I think those are all good indicators of both the breadth and the depth of the supply that's going out. No. We haven't seen any slowdown. I think it's different pools of money from strategy. The Sponsorship relationships with us are not decided week-to-week, month-to-month based on what they are trying to get out of performance marketing. These are long-term commitments by major brands. Michael gave you the stats. It's really being driven by these big multiyear, multi-asset, multimillion-dollar relationships. So we're up 30% with over half our book of business for next year already filled and not seeing a slowdown. So we're feeling very comfortable with it. Yes. We don't believe there will be any impact whatsoever if there was a nationwide mandate for all-in pricing. We think it makes sense. It just has to be done collectively at the same time. And if you look back and you listen to the comments, the comments were all about transparency, which is really all-in pricing. The commentary was not about fee levels or any of the other issues that some people have brought up. That's been looked at, and we feel comfortable with what our business model is in that regard. So I think that we will work with the FTC. We will work with the DA in the State of New York, and we're very supportive of that and some other shifts to make ticketing more transparent and a better consumer experience. Yes. So again, just to \u2013 I mean, to repeat the numbers, which are the mix of supply and demand, which is that our tickets sold for the shows that we have on sale for next year are up consistently across all venue types relative to a year ago. So the demand is absolutely coming for the supply that's showing up. Now on a broader basis, you're right, we've consistently \u2013 if you looked at 2010 to 2019, we've consistently grown our business double-digit AOI. In 2011, we grew our business double-digit AOI while fan attendance was down. So we do have a number of other levers, and Michael spoke to those as part of his commentary. We're continuing to grow our venue base. And fans that shows in our venues are much more profitable than others. We continue to have increased on-site spend. We continue to have pricing as a lever, which drives through both our concerts business and our ticketing business continuing to add globally Ticketmaster clients. And then I've given you the numbers on Sponsorship, which we think continues to be a double-digit growth business into the future. So all of those levers on top of the supply-demand dynamic is what gives us confidence as we continue to look to our future of the growth potential. Yes, Michael, sorry, just to jump back in on you. Again, counter to some of the commentary that I've heard out there were also \u2013 we're not dependent on acts that have been around for a long time. If you look at how vibrant the new artists are \u2013 I mean, I look at our top artists we've had this year, the Harry Styles, Dua Lipas, Billy Eilish, Bad Bunny, Morgan Wallen, The Weeknd, Olivia Rodrigo. These are all artists that are at the early stages of their career. Across, as Michael talked about, all genres, most of those are obviously in arenas and stadiums, but these are tremendous talents that are just showing the breadth of supply that we have in our business. Yes. Our focus this year has obviously been on the latter of how do we create new assets on this Ticketmaster platform that can continue to drive the economics. And then as you improve your volume of tickets or improve your site visits, the math is just additional growth on top of that. So, we feel like we would view any other platform we own in its own way just a counterpart to the on-site. We have people's attention through a period of time. We have them going through a purchase process. And all of that is something that we can monetize. We saw a great progress on the platform integrations, particularly around the checkout this year. We think there is earlier upstream. We think there is advertising dollars that can still be significant that we can drive from it. And we are focused much more on how do we use Ticketmaster as a platform to drive its own set of non-service fee revenue streams. And we think that has a long runway. Yes. I think as Michael will talk to you, first and foremost, our strategy is to help ours get paid market value for their show. And we are spending more and more on having the people and the data to help them do that. That said, for a lot of reasons that he went over around how they want to build their fan base, how they want to build their brands, they are leaving money on the table. And we are continuing to see that just almost insatiable demand in the secondary market. I talked about average price of a secondary ticket is still almost twice that of a primary ticket. So, that continues to grow, and we continue to price a little bit trying to catch up to that. So, we don't see the secondary market going away anytime soon, and we are going to be active participants. And I talked, I think last quarter about the fact that we believe the shift to secondary tickets has helped us because it's just eliminated friction to use us as the secondary platform to buy and sell the tickets. As we get better and better with that Ticketmaster app, you can manage your tickets, you can sell them, you can buy them on our secondary. As all of that gets easier and easier, I think that just naturally continues to build the business with us. As regards to the consent decree, we have an ongoing discussion. We have an external monitor who we have regular dialogue with. We have an internal monitor who oversees everything. We are very happy that we have got an active dialogue now, which is what was lacking in the first 10 years post our merger. We feel good about all of those discussions. I don't think there is anything structural, substantive that we are finding that's inconsistent with the message that we send all of our people, which is these are independent decisions on promotion and ticketing and the two shouldn't be tied together. So, we feel good about that process that we have with them. As we look at Ticketmaster, I think it's continuing to be successful because it's a very effective platform. I think if you look at \u2013 again, we have talked a lot over the past few quarters about because of our continually improving in high-quality platform, both for the enterprise side as well as the customer side, particularly internationally, that's differentiated and driving a lot of wins internationally. North America, where it's more a mature market, you need to be able to compete on price in addition to features. And I think our business has shown that we can continue to scale that, grow it and do so very profitably. So, just technically, Peter, just to answer your first question, I think the way that we have laid out the story in the release and then Michael talked about it is, first, he talked about the fact that ticket sales are up. He talked about the sponsorship growth. And then he said, in addition to those, there are a number of other levers that we have to continue to grow the business. So, I don't think he ever said anything that said we weren't \u2013 the fan growth didn't come into this. At this point, looking at \u201823, yes, we have got some of the stadiums we talked about high growth in arenas. Some of that's booked. It's still somewhat early for the second half of the year. But macro in terms of our pipeline for next year, it would account for more fans than we had going into this year. The hard part that we have is just sorting out because of the shows that were rescheduled, trying to figure out how many of those were naturally flown into this year versus not. But we are feeling very good about the attendance levels for next year. Michael will talk about the venues. Yes. I think digital ticketing at this point is nearly ubiquitous in North America. It has grown rapidly internationally. It's still a year or 2 years behind. I would expect this to be pretty much there sometime between next year and maybe the year after, just depending a bit by market. And as it's gotten established, it's already helped us in a number of areas. I talked about secondary a few minutes ago. So, we are seeing some direct benefits as we continue to improve the ability in terms of how fans manage their tickets. I think you will continue to see more products get added on to the app. They continue to improve what the fan \u2013 how the fans can manage their tickets. And then it sets us up for the advertising and up-sells that we have been talking about. And we now have enough scale. We started doing some things this year at scale, working with sponsors who want to deliver value on site to our fans, working with the concert side of the business to enable direct up-sells. And I think all of those features that come from having a direct connection to the people actually attending the shows will be a key focus for how we continue to drive our sponsorship business over the next few years. Yes. And I think you see part of that as we talked about what is our non-Ticketmaster, what's our non-service fee revenue that we are driving and the fact that, that's up double digits from \u201819. This is all a part of that."

            "name": "Michael Rapino",
            "content": "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Live Nation delivered the biggest summer concert season in history that drove a record quarter. These results demonstrate the ongoing and increasing demand for live events globally, with attendance at events of all sizes from clubs to stadiums. Fans around the world continue prioritizing their spend on live events, particularly concerts. Despite varying economic headwinds, including inflation, we have not seen any pullback in demand as on-sales on-site spending, advertising, all other operating metrics continue showing strong year-on-year growth. With this demand, revenue was up over 60% relative to 2019 with each division up at least 30% and AOI up 45% to $621 million, with all divisions up at least 25%. As we expected, our performance this quarter was led by our concert business, which held 11,000 concerts to 44 million fans across 50 countries. As a result, we generated over $5 billion of revenue and $281 million AOI for the quarter, up 67% and 44% respectively relative to 2019 Q3. Shows of all types continue having strong demand with double-digit attendance growth across all venue types, including clubs, theaters, amphitheaters, arenas, stadiums and festivals. Stadiums had a particularly strong quarter with fan count more than tripling to nearly 9 million fans driven by the global demand of the top acts across a number of genres and audiences such as Bad Bunny, The Weeknd and Red Hot Chili Peppers. We delivered double-digit attendance growth across established and emerging markets around the globe from North America to Europe to South America showing our long runway of global growth. Our Venue Nation division hosted more fans with attendance up 14% relative to 2019 to $19 million for the quarter and 38 million fans year-to-date. Based on our current pacing, we expect to host more than 50 million fans at our Venue Nation and Festival division. As we have grown attendance, we have also continued driving greater market pricing for our concerts and now expect to transfer over $550 million of additional payments to artists this year, continuing our effort to help artists get the full value from their shows. And over the course of the summer, we continue to see strong onsite spend with no reduction in consumer buying habits. Ancillary per fan spending was up 20% to 30% year-to-date in our operated venues across the U.S. and Europe. The consistent theme is that fans are eager to enhance their experience, but we continue elevating our hospitality operations to provide more premium options. We still have tremendous room to expand these high-quality experiences throughout our venue portfolio, which includes over 400 venues and festivals globally, with almost 40 new venues in the pipeline. Fan demand for live events was also clear in our ticketing business. We transacted $6.7 billion of fee-generating GTV on 71 million tickets, up 69% and 42% respectively relative to 2019. This demand remained strong throughout the quarter as 2 of the 3 months were amongst the top 10 transacted GTV, excluding refund months ever. At this point, all top 10 months occurred within the past year. GTV growth was strong across both primary and secondary, up 61% and 132% respectively. Concerts were up 80% of the growth in primary GTV, while concerts and sports together accounted for over 90% of our secondary growth. Globally, new venue clients continue to seek out Ticketmaster's service due to its effectiveness of our enterprise software platform, driving venue revenue, combined with our leading online marketplace. As a result, we contracted 19 million net new tickets so far this year on a global basis. At Ticketmaster, we continue to advocate for fee transparency and live event ticketing. We advocated for all-in pricing mandate passed in New York early this year, which requires face value prices and fees to be shown upfront. And so we support the FTC mandating this nationally. We operate ticketing marketplaces in more than 30 countries around the world and have seen all-in pricing adopted successfully in many countries when mandated across the board. It only works with all ticketing marketplaces adopt together and the consumers truly can accurately compare as they shop for tickets. Sponsorship had its biggest quarter ever, following our previous record last quarter, driven by the strength of our festival and online partnerships. Our performance drove AOI of $226 million, 56% higher in 2019. Our sponsorship revenue growth has been broad-based with North America up 48% and international up 93% and we see strong demand both on-site and online, up 64% and 63% respectively this year. And our unique theater live events platforms continue to attract new brands and expand relationships with current partners. Festival sponsorship has been our largest growth driver to-date as we have effectively leveraged record festival attendance this year and compounded this growth with double-digit increases in per fan sponsorship. Platform integrations have been a great growth driver with online partnerships. As we continue to drive value and monetize opportunities via Ticketmaster's purchase process with non-service fee revenues, up double-digits relative to 2019. Clearly, 2022 has been an incredible year of returning to live events and we expect to finish strong. Ticket sales for concerts this year were up 34% for the quarter and now stand at 115 million tickets sold for the shows this year, up 37%. And more importantly, momentum is strong with early signs pointing to continued growth in 2023 across our businesses. Ticket sales for shows in 2023 are pacing even stronger than they were heading into 2022, up double-digits year-over-year, excluding sales from rescheduled shows. In our sponsorship business, confirmed commitments for 2023 are up 30% from this time last year, showing the resiliency and long-term commitments that brands have for our business. Beyond these specific leading indicators, going into 2023, we expect we will drive growth in our concert business by adding more venues to our portfolio, continued increase in ancillary per fan revenue and furthering our efforts to deliver market value for the shows to the artists. And in ticketing, we expect to also benefit from these market pricing trends while continuing to globally add new clients to our world class platform. With that, I will turn it over to Joe. I'll start on the quality. We're seeing a really good pipe for next year. I would say there would be no difference in \u201823 to \u201822 in terms of quality. If you were a stadium act, a large selling arena act, you probably debated whether you went out in \u201822 or you went out in \u201823. So, lots of great artists in the pipe from clubs to stadiums to arenas. It will look like a similar year in terms of quality. Brandon, for comparison, the \u2013 if the NFL was a public company or NBA, I'm sure that would be reporting record sponsorship also. So we kind of put us off from that league, right? He's not having any pullback. If you've got a scarce commodity like a beyond state tour or an NFL game, those are still very rare pieces of business that you want to be associated with, and they have longevity to them. So we haven't seen any slowdown talking to the NBA and NFL. We haven't seen it over there either. So I think those are the comparables for you. Just a couple of points to jump on, we tend to do better as regulation comes into play in this space. A lot of our business has been chasing the secondary business for years that's kind of unregulated. We would love spec selling to be outlawed. We'd love better rules on bot ticketing. We love all-in pricing. We're adhering to all-in pricing in New York right now. I think we're probably the only ticketing company actually adhering to those regulations right now. So we like sunlight coming to the business. The most part of the business that's been unregulated and most of the noise is generated from the secondary business. So we love regulation, puts us on an equal footing ground. Right now, in our secondary business, we don't do spec selling. That's probably 30% to 40% of what inventory sits on secondary sites. We don't price below face value. So we actually operate at a disadvantage right now because we are operating in a higher standard. So we had a lot more transparency. We'd love to have the fees more transparent upfront, all-in pricing. We just have to make sure everybody plays by the same rules, but we're going to lead those pieces. As far as the fees, just to remind you, it's the venues that set the fee and take most of the fees. So I think if you bought \u2013 if you build a multi-hundred million arena or a stadium, I think your prerogative to decide what is the fee you want to charge on your sports and music tickets. We get a piece of that, but those are set by the venue and monetized by the venue. So just kind of some of the ongoing transparencies of the business, we've got to do a better job explaining. I'm going to let Joe jump in, but I just want to make sure, don't discount the supply side, right? That's like talking to Disney and saying, if you only have Marvel movies, how is your demand going to be? It's going to be great. Supply and content drives the demand. So if you've got a lot of great, great quality supply, the demand is a little easier. So I don't want you to discount that. We're very proud that we work with the best artists in the world. We have the best global platform for those artists and attractive to our platform. That's what you have to make sure you first have. So we have the blockbusters top to bottom. That's going to drive the demand. Now Joe will take over in terms of explaining the demand strength so far we've seen. And Joe, I just want to jump in on the demand in terms of how the demand is spread. There is certain thesis as they like to get spread. Our demand is \u2013 overall concert ticket is still a really affordable ticket. Most majority of the tickets are sold are $50 to $75. So, although we have a great premium business that does attract a high-end customer or someone that's a rapid fan, our business is split from clubs to theaters to stadiums, we're seeing demand strong on all levels. Whether it's a $19 ticket, it's filling up the clubs or the premium at the stadiums and arenas. So we do think we have something for everyone. It is a very accessible ticket even in a pull back time. And we're seeing that the demographic of our buyer is very, very wide and split across all sizes. Yes. I wouldn't say \u201823 \u2013 our conversation is any different than it's been in any year. We have an incredible \u2013 great pricing team, a lot of data scientists that are talking and analyzing the business with our managers and agents. So, as you know, there is no one paint brush, depending on what artists \u2013 where you are in your cycle and what your demand is. So, I just saw some counts this morning for Shenoy [ph] went up, up-sell. Today, big, big numbers out of the box. She is an iconic artist. So, you are not worried about pricing if you are talking to Shenoy and how she prices her tour, if you are a little baby going on tour next year. You have a younger demo, you are building your audience, maximizing your growth isn't your priority. It's getting to as many markets and fans as you can. So, I wouldn't say \u201823 is even in my buyers' minds right now. What is in their head is over the last few years, it's just better pricing dynamic strategy from day one on the market. Price is different on a Friday than a Tuesday, the aisle seat's worth more than the middle. The front is always underpriced. We have yet to see anything get close to secondary demand yet. So, most of our shows are still going to be underpriced in the front. So, our job is to do what we can up-sell the front, so we can lower the price in the back, get sell-through all the way through. So, I wouldn't say that any artist or manager is having any panic of talking to me about demand for next year. They know the Taylor Swift ticket Verified Fan that went up this week that's probably going to break all records. I mean artists are seeing the demand is there. If you price it smart, you have got the right markets. You have been out of the market maybe 3 years, 4 years. We are not feeling the demand from inflation or \u201823 pressures that are driving strategy. It's just overall us being better at what we do today than we were last year and the year before on pricing strategy per market by artist for territory. Yes. Just on a macro level, this is a business that overall we don't win \u2013 most shows don't sell out. Majority of your shows don't sell out, always room for a few more tickets to be sold. So, although the press always talks about the expensive tickets or the sold-out ticket, that's not your real business. Your real business is night and day, theater, clubs, amphitheaters, arenas, selling those tickets night by night. So, most tours ultimately do well in the end, artists make money and we make money. There are some tours a small percentage that just don't sell enough ticket, the demand isn't there. And the tour that gets canceled or the promoter and the artist lose money. So, I have seen some of those publications where they want to grab those six tours or some that didn't make money and then try to extrapolate something larger. So, I just don't see that trend. We did over 8,000 club shows last year and 95% are going to make money and do well and the artists will deliver those 400 tickets or 1,100 tickets as they are building their business and their costs are associated with it. It was a tougher year for all of the industry as the supply chain challenges, labor, everyone getting back to work, getting the security guards, everyone's costs were up this year. So, that would have affected all artists on the road relative to their revenue. But those seem to have worked their way through the system. So, I don't see any trend that the emerging or younger artists are having any harder time than any young emerging artists when they are taking those risks building their businesses on the way up. Generally, majority are going to be okay in terms of selling enough tickets, paying the bills and building their business. So, we don't see any trends in the bottom end, any new trends that would suggest that the club and the emerging artists space isn't growing. There is more clubs opening up all the time, lots of demand in every market, lots of options for artists to play 500 seats, 1,000 seats. We just know from our venue portfolio on the demand on opening up and building theaters and clubs is bigger than ever. So, that demand wouldn't be driven if the supply wasn't there. Yes. I think just on Joe's point, we are excited to be sitting here. We knew the thesis that you could sell on was that there was an air pocket. We heard that comment a lot \u201823 was an exceptional year. And it was \u2013 \u201822, I mean been an exceptional year. The idea that we were able to grow this business for so long on our high-double digits on \u2013 high-single digits on our fan base and then to have a year like \u201822, you blow the doors off it, and now to be able to sit here and say, and we think we will still grow on top. We are very proud of our business and our outlook, given the headwinds and the size of the gains we had this year. So, we are looking into now beyond that and how we keep growing the business forward. Venues, I have laid out over the last year or 2 years, we think it's a great business. We have 300 in our portfolio. It's a great way to obviously maximize that live event fully when you are vertical. So, we like our global pipeline we have right now. We are seeing a lot of white space where our content can help drive that business case from arenas to amphitheaters to big ballrooms and theaters. So, you will continually see us adding as we have been over the last many years to that portfolio."

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir.\nMichael Rapino: Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. The second quarter confirmed that live entertainment industry is back globally and bigger than ever. Live Nation led this return and continues to deliver the best global network to support artists as they play shows for the fans around the world. Every key operating metric is at an all-time high as we promoted more concerts, had more fans attend shows, they spent more money, sold more tickets and enable brands to connect with fans at a scale we have never seen before. As a result, relative to 2019, with over a 40% increase in revenue to $4.4 billion and a 50% increase in AOI to $480 million. With most of the world fully reopened, it's clear that concerts remain a high priority for fans. Consumers are seeking out and spending more on experiences. And the growing demand for live music and events is driving our business to record levels, far outpacing any macro issues or cost increases. Momentum across our business has remained strong in recent months and weeks, and demand combined with the substantial concert pipeline gives us confidence in our ongoing growth this year and into 2023. During the second quarter, we promoted over 12,000 concerts for 33.5 million fans, each up over 20% relative to the second quarter of 2019. Of the over 6 million additional fans this quarter, 5 million of that growth came from international markets, driven by the addition of OCESA and the reopening of most global markets with particularly strong focus and demand through Europe and Latin America. Growth was broad-based with double-digit attendance increased at venues of all types, demonstrating strong demand for events at all sizes from large-scale stadiums and festivals, sentiment clubs and theaters. Even as show count and attendance grew, fans demonstrated their willingness to pay more for the best seats with the average price of a ticket for our concerts this year up 10% globally relative to 2019, which remains less in the U.S. inflation level over the period. At the same time, our average entry price for concerts remain affordable at $33, up only 5% from 2019. With market-based pricing being widely adopted by most tours, we expect to shift over 500 million from the secondary market to artists this year, continuing to support those who created the concert and ensuring they are benefiting from it. On the venue side of our concert business, we continue to build our portfolio of operated venues with an active pipeline of almost 30 new venues across the globe. We are seeing the benefit of operating more venues as a number of fans who attended shows in our owned and operated venues during the quarter was up 13% to over 14 million fans, and we expect that figure to reach over 50 million fans for the full year. And fans are spending more on site with average per fan revenue up 20% at each of our amphitheaters, festivals, theaters and clubs relative to 2019, with the average per fan revenue at our amphitheaters this year at $38.50, up 30% relative to 2019. Our ticket business also demonstrated strong growth in the quarter, transacted fee-bearing ticket volume up 48% to 77 million tickets and transacted GTV up 76% to $7.3 billion, both relative to 2019. This is our highest fee-bearing GTV quarter ever, with April, May and June, accounting for three of our top five all-time fee-bearing months. 75% of this growth came from concerts, another indicator of the high demand for live music. Along with the volume increase, transacted ticket prices globally was up approximately 15% for the first half of the year relative to 2019 as both concerts and sporting events saw similar low double-digit price increases during the period. Even with strong primary ticketing sales and increased pricing, demand for live events on our secondary ticketing marketplace remain high. And as a result, our GTV more than doubled for the quarter relative to 2019. We are continuing to see the benefits of our technology investments at Ticketmaster, including our global leadership in digital ticketing between new capabilities and the sales effectiveness of our ticketing marketplace, we consistently deliver high ticket sales for our event organizers. As a result, we continue to win business from new and existing clients. And to the first half of this year, we had a 12.8 million net new fee-bearing tickets to our marketplace, led again this year by our international markets, which accounted for 60% of this new growth. Sponsorship has also benefited from the concert flywheel this quarter, driving 74% growth in revenue relative to 2019. As we further enabled more brands to connect with an increasing number of fans on a global basis, festival sponsorship has performed particularly well during the first half of the year, more than doubling from 2019, led by nine new festivals in our Mexico and Latin American businesses that accounted for roughly half this increase, along with broad growth in sponsorship levels across most of the North American festivals. And we continue adding more clients in technology, telecom and purchase path integration, including Google, AWS and Hulu, with these categories collectively more than doubling this sponsorship since 2019. As we look forward to the second half of 2022 and into 2023, we have sold over 100 million tickets for our concerts this year, more than we sold for the entire year 2019. Fan demand remained strong and continued growth in ticket buying and on-site spending. And given the long-term nature of most of our sponsorship partnerships, our planned sponsorship for the year is now fully committed. As we prepare for 2023, everywhere globally is open for concerts. And we are actively rooting all of our markets with the largest artist pipeline we have ever seen at this point of the year. And for the 2023 tours we have put on sale so far, all signs continue pointing to strong fan demand. With that, I will let Joe take you through more details of our results.\nJoe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As with last quarter, 2019 is the best comparison for us in terms of understanding our operations and key performance indicators, so most of our focus will be relative to Q2 of 2019. For the Company, our reported revenue of $4.4 billion for the quarter was $1.3 billion better than Q2 2019 or an increase of 40%. On a constant currency basis, our revenue was $4.6 billion for the quarter, so there was roughly a 4% impact due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. In our reported AOI of $480 million for the quarter was $160 million better than 2019, up 50% and led by an improvement of over $100 million in ticketing and $80 million in sponsorship. On a constant currency basis, our Q2 AOI was $502 million. The FX impact of negative $23 million or 4% was largely driven by the devaluation of the euro and the pound. This was not only our highest Q2 AOI ever but it was also our highest quarterly AOI ever, beating our prior record quarter, which was Q3 of 2019 by 12%. Notable given that Q3 is traditionally our highest AOI quarter each year, and we converted almost 80% of this AOI to adjusted free cash flow of $379 million. Let me give a bit more color on each division, and then I'll give you more on full year leading indicators. First, in concerts, our AOI was $123 million for the quarter, which compares to $133 million in Q2 of 2019. It was one of concert's strongest second quarters ever despite limited activity in our Asia Pacific region and operating cost increases. Additionally, while OCESA had a very strong return to activity, its AOI largely flows through sponsorship and ticketing while their concerts division absorbs most of its costs. In the quarter, we had over 33 million fans attend 12,500 events, growing nearly 25% compared to Q2 of 2019 when we had 27 million fans attend 10,000 shows. And we continue to see growth in our on-site spend with no signs of change. Here's what we're seeing so far this year by venue type across our owned or operated buildings. In our amphitheaters, ancillary per fan revenue has risen to $38.5, an increase of $9 per fan over 2019 levels or 30% growth. At our theaters and clubs in the U.S., ancillary per fan revenue has increased by over 25%, driven by higher concession sales and increased purchases of premium packages, fast lane entry and night of show upsells. In our theaters and clubs in the U.K., ancillary per fan revenue has risen by 20% compared to 2019, largely as a result of increased food and beverage consumption, pricing optimization as well as the shift to cashless payment. Finally, at our major festivals, increased spending on concessions, campaign and VIP experiences has driven ancillary per fan revenue up by over 30%. The consistent theme here is that as we continue elevating our hospitality operations and create more premium options, fans are eager to enhance their experience. At this point, we still have a lot more room to grow these higher-quality experience offerings throughout our owned or operated portfolio, which includes over 400 venues and festivals globally at this point. Next, ticketing had another very successful quarter, delivering $231 million of AOI, making it the most profitable quarter ever for ticketing, beating the record set just last year in the fourth quarter and nearly doubling the Q2 2019 AOI results of $124 million. Our growth came from both primary and secondary ticketing with transacted ticketing GTV up 69% and 141%, respectively. Transacted ticket volume, excluding refunds, was 77 million tickets, our highest quarter ever, besting our former record of 65 million tickets in Q4 2021 by 18% and 25 million tickets or 48% higher than Q2 of 2019. Transacted ticketing GTV, excluding refunds, was $7.3 billion, our highest quarter ever, besting our former record of $6.6 billion of Q4 of 2021 by 11% and $3.1 billion and 76% higher than Q2 of 2019. International markets are now largely back and contributing to this growth with transacted ticketing GTV up 67% relative to Q2 2019. As Michael mentioned, approximately 75% of our growth came from concerts, which was due to both higher fan attendance at our concerts and also timing with a number of on sales expected to happen in Q3 getting moved up into Q2. Even as more of the ticket value is captured for content organizers, our secondary marketplaces continue to grow rapidly with four of our five best resale days ever in Q2 and 12 of our top 20 resale days in 2022. We continue to believe that the secondary market is a leading indicator for primary pricing opportunities over the next few years as well as a buffer against any demand fluctuations. Finally, sponsorship had its biggest quarter ever with AOI of $178 million, 80% higher than our Q2 2019 AOI of $98 million. With the U.S., the U.K. and now Mainland Europe all fully opened, we had high growth in both on-site and online sponsorship with each delivering record Q2 AOI. The growth in our large multiyear multi-asset sponsor speaks to our value of connecting live music fans with global brands. We are nearing in on 100 such major sponsors that, in total, generate well over $0.5 billion in revenue and represents nearly 75% of our growth relative to 2019. As we look to the remainder of 2022, starting with our leading indicators through late July, all relative to 2019. First, confirmed show bookings are up over 30%, driven by double-digit increases in every market and across all venue types. Our concert ticket sales through the end of July are over 100 million tickets for events this year, up 38% and higher than our full year 2019 fan count. As a result, we expect a very strong Q3 for concerts with more shows and higher attendance, including fan growth at our owned or operated venues where we are continuing to see strong APF increases. Also, similar to last year, we are extending the amphitheater later in the year, adding over 1 million fans in Q4 this year relative to 2019. Michael also gave the numbers around much of our Q2 fan growth being driven by international markets, which is a great indicator of the broadly global health of our fan base. But I don't want anyone to over extrapolate this to the U.S. market as we expect North America will drive much of our fan growth in Q3. Second, ticketing has sold 183 million primary fee-bearing tickets for events this year, up 30%. Of these, 122 million tickets are for concert events, which is 42% higher than 2019. Related to this, we have $3.2 billion in event-related deferred revenue, double our level in Q2 of 2019. These are largely tickets that have been sold by Ticketmaster for Live Nation concerts but the revenue and AOI hasn't flowed through yet, and we'll do so over the course of the next year as the events occur. We remain on course for a strong Q3 in ticketing as our deferred revenue is recognized but also impacted by the shift of some of the on sales that moved into Q2. On the sponsorship side, we expect to see continued growth driven by our strong Q3 festival lineup with some of this activity also involving on-site activation support. On the cost side, increases continue to impact us primarily in the venues we operate, amphitheaters, theaters and clubs and festivals. But in all cases, we are delivering increased profitability per fan due to increased ticket and ancillary revenue. A few other points on 2022, given our presence in the U.K. and mainland Europe, we've experienced FX headwinds. And through the end of June, our AOI has been adversely impacted by $23 million. This was almost entirely in the second quarter as the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against the euro and the British pound. Based on current rates, we expect our AOI to continue having a 3% to 4% hit in the second half. We provided detailed guidance on line items that impact our EPS calculation last quarter, and there's just one update that I wanted to make here, which is, as noted, we expect the headwinds with FX rates to continue through the remainder of the year, which at current forward rates result in approximately $15 million quarterly below-the-line expense due to currency exchange losses on the revaluation of our foreign balance sheet balances to U.S. dollars. In anticipation of the growth opportunities ahead of us this year, we continue to expect 2022 capital expenditures to be approximately $375 million, with 2/3 allocated to revenue-generating projects. We expect free cash flow conversion from AOI to be back in the mid-50s for the full year. And we ended Q2 with $2.5 billion of available liquidity between free cash and untapped revolver capacity giving us sufficient flexibility to continue investing in growth. We are comfortable with our leverage with over 85% of our debt at a fixed rate and our average cost of debt of roughly 4.3%, positioning us well in this interest rate environment. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Karnovsky: Michael, I wanted to get your thoughts on pricing in VIP tickets. We've seen artists and VIP inventory even amid some fan pushback and negative press, which looks to me to be a break from prior years. So do you think the industry has collectively gotten to a place where artists are now kind of comfortable reclaiming the secondary market economics? And then, how much more room is there to kind of drive this process?\nMichael Rapino: Yes. Thank you. I think we've been saying for a few years that over time, we believe that, that secondary 10 billion, 12 billion, depending on what number you see globally has to start getting captured by the artist at some level. It's just too transparent. The more they see all of the online pricing while they work so hard to put that show on. So I do think that right artists looking at us saying, I'd like to count some of it in the front end. I don't want to be sold out at 10 01 at $200 to have someone else make $2,000. Fans not getting a deal anyway, they're spending $2,000 from somebody else. So I do think they're looking and saying, the front of the house, can we capture some demand? Now, the advantage is the, artist has one objective as we do as the venue to fill every seat. So you're never looking for the gross, you're looking to make sure that every seat is filled for the best experience. We want that. We just want that. So I do think the new dynamic pricing, the better we have become, these tools to the artists, they're looking at the holistic picture. Maybe I can charge a bit more in the front row. I got to charge less in the back row because net I'm going to sell through the back end of the house that maybe is always spot in our business. Now if you can still get the same gross, but you can lower the ticket price in the back part of the house, that's a win for everyone. So, we're right now -- Joe has the exact math. We looked at it yesterday. It's still a small percentage of the total growth is price platinum and/or dynamic, 1%, 2% kind of numbers, and really nonexistent outside of America. We just -- so yes, there's a long runway where the artists will look at the small, again, even as much always, as you heard about the Springsteen sale, than 1% of the tickets were priced a little higher to capture the second business versus 99% of the house. So to the artist, I think they'll look at us -- and then the premium, the dynamic, how do I better price my product, fill the house, lower the price on the back, capture more of the front, and we think that's got many years of runway for us to expand on a global basis.\nDavid Karnovsky: Okay. Great. And then I just wanted to ask on concerts AOI in the quarter. I think it was roughly flat versus '19, and that's with the increase in fans and the per caps. Just wondering if you could speak to the impact of things like cost inflation, mix. I know you said APAC wasn't fully open and then maybe timing as well. I think Q2 '19, if I remember correctly, had some pull forward from Q3 in that year?\nJoe Berchtold: This is Joe. Yes, I'll take that. I think we laid out a handful of factors that we think were some combination of timing and one-offs that impacted this quarter. Asia Pacific is not fully open yet we've got the organization up and running to prepare for being open. Just the structure of OCESA's P&L is they really drive their economics through ticketing and sponsorship whereas most of their cost structure is in the concert side. We talked about some operating cost increases for our operated venues, still driving per fan profitability increases, but you have some costs there. And then it's just -- I wouldn't over read one quarter. I gave you in mind, for instance, that a lot of this was in international markets that we had our growth, less growth in this quarter in North America. But then we have a lot of growth in Q3 in North America. As I look at the numbers overall, North America, if you look at our 100 million tickets, North America has 30% growth. So as that flows through and Q3, you'd expect to see some of that flip it around. I just don't want to read too much into it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Ross: Just wanted to drill down a little more on David's question about platinum ticketing. And I was wondering, Michael, if you could just -- because I think a lot of investors and fans are not really educated on how platinum ticketing works, can you talk about who sets the prices and kind of the cadence of ticket releases? And how you think about the -- when tickets are going to be released kind of this move from fast ticketing where everything was available at the on sale to maybe trickling out tickets more over time? And then how you think about the balance of dollars and maximizing profits for the artists with this idea of fandom and fairness and what your role in that is?\nMichael Rapino: All right. That's a lot. I'll try to take some pieces. We work for the artist. We're a B2B business. The artist is that decides when they tour, how they tour. Our job is to provide all the tools, platform and services to help them succeed in that tour from -- a year. Now our decision is -- they're genius brand managers. They have to balance the needs of their fans, supply demand and pricing. And some brands, like the Rolling Stones, have been very good at always saying expensive experience and we're that proud and enable to deliver that brand position. But I think artists are always trying to find a fine line on how do I make the show accessible? How do I make sure all my fans can show? How do I price it fairly versus how much money can I make? So I think they see that. I think today, while the technology is advancing and they're starting to look at more technology and more pricing data, I think they can now -- good shows and realize that some ways they keep price, 1, 2% of the house higher and achieved some of those economics versus the scalper while still pricing 98% of the house at a very stable brand position. So we can achieve both. This is an industry that for 30 years, we would do a tour. They would set three ticket prices 140, 79 and 39, and that will be the three prices in every city for every night for the market, as you know. That's way it's going to operate forward, a different price on a Friday in New York than Indianapolis on a Tuesday. So dynamic smart pricing, now that we're able to provide that sophistication, the bands are much more sophisticated. And they're now able to have tools to figure out how do I price it better and -- some better economics, get some of the leakage of secondary, but still maintain an overall ticket price, leaving dollars on the table, but still finding that balance between the consumer demand, the brand and the slippage of the economics to secondary they've been losing.\nJoe Berchtold: Sorry, Brandon. Sorry, Brandon. Sorry, just one comment I have to respond to. Your commentary about trickling out tickets, that's not a practice. That's not something that is the norm or something that we do. I think that the speed of ticketing has to do with just what's the pace at which some of them sell out with the theory being for some artists, if they price a lot of tickets at market price, they may not all sell out in the first hour, so it has nothing to do. Ticketmaster takes all the tickets. It gets -- puts them directly on sale. It does nothing to try to limit supply or anything in that manner. So I just want to make sure we're crystal clear on that.\nBrandon Ross: Yes. No, I wasn't agreed on that decision anyway.\nMichael Rapino: Yes. But I think we're just addressing because the marketplace. The consumer obviously gets a little -- time when at 10:00, there's lots of secondary tickets, right? So historically, the Bruce fan would have been sold out at 10 and had to go to a secondary to buy that good seat. So today, we're sorting through that process where we can provide information to the fans. But our job at Ticketmasters is put every sale on ticket -- provide none into the secondary market and provide all the data to the artists that they can invest up and down and as the market adjusts.\nBrandon Ross: Got it. And then talking about dynamic pricing, if there was to be some kind of downturn in the next year or so that actually affected the live entertainment business, do you see kind of the same tools as flexibility to respond to market conditions in bringing ticket prices down as much as you bring them up in this demand environment?\nJoe Berchtold: Sure. Controls can be used -- go ahead, Michael.\nMichael Rapino: No. I said it before in our last call, I mean, we looked at the last recession, there was a single-digit back in some ticket sales, but we were -- years ago, not even in the same -- indication on pricing nor did we have the tool. So yes, we look at data pricing now, dynamic pricing, look at all market data algorithms to figure out what is the price point that we'll sell through. And we do believe that because of the upside right now in the premium secondary side of our business, that if we had to pull back ticket sales and dropped prices by 5% or 10% to match supply/demand of inflation, we have so much flexibility in pricing to get that done and still sell through the house and lower price if that was needed for a band to sell-through tickets.\nJoe Berchtold: And artist...\nMichael Rapino: The number one goal is to set -- their number one goal -- sell every ticket. So there are always going to be in a variable -- of how do I price it -- what do I got to reduce our end of house, front end of the house? What do we need to do a sell-through on a Tuesday night in Indianapolis? Let's adjust pricing.\nJoe Berchtold: The other part of the buffer, Brandon, is just the secondary market itself, and how big it is, its continued growth, right? I gave you the numbers. The secondary market for us grew 140% this quarter. So that tells you that even if some pricing is going up on the primary side, the secondary is growing up -- going up even faster, both in terms of volume and price points. So our first line of defense is keeping our eye on secondary and using that buffer if there is any variations in demand.\nBrandon Ross: Got it. And then finally, if you could just double-click a little on 30 additional venues that you're talking about adding. Are those -- what venue types are those? And how impactful do you see that to be in the future?\nMichael Rapino: Well, I think in our investor conference, we wanted to kind of highlight -- I think it's always been an under -- strong business, but we've put more focus on it from an operational design development. We've got over those 300 venues. We manage -- we've been adding 20 to 30 a year over the last few years. As you know, Boston been an incredible success in which will provide more return. And those 30 that we have in the pipe now, another 75 behind of those on a global basis are everything from clubs to arenas depending on where the hole in the market may exist. And we see great platform there. And as we've said before, when we show in an operated venue that we have the sponsorship and the ticketing and the food and beverage and all the revenue streams, that's our highest return for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Laszczyk: On fan growth for the year, maybe for Joe, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks, not extrapolating international growth or contribution on the U.S. market this year. Can you maybe unpack that for us a little bit and maybe touch on what portion of fan growth you expect will come from acquisitions versus organic growth in markets like the U.S. or the U.K. this year?\nJoe Berchtold: Sure. I'll use as the basis, the 100-or-so million tickets that we sold through July because I think that just -- that gives the numbers and the facts. And as I indicated, within that, the U.S. is up about just over 30% and international was up 40-odd percent. So you have strong organic growth across both North America and international. Our primary acquisition, of course, would be OCESA, and that would be somewhat less than half of the international growth. So the international growth, even absent acquisitions would be in the mid- to high 20s. So again, this is not an acquisition dependent growth? This is organic plus acquisition.\nStephen Laszczyk: Great. That's helpful. And then maybe one for Michael. I was curious if you're seeing any unique trends develop in terms of fan behavior this year. For example, we've seen more first-time concert goers come out this year or fan set to attend events with greater frequency. I'd be curious if you've seen any of those data points or any of these trends that you're seeing, open portions of the market up going forward that maybe you haven't seen come into the industry before?\nJoe Berchtold: Yes. I'll take this. Michael is having some audio problems here. I think that what we're seeing is a very broad-based, high priority of going to concerts against fans that are interested in going to concerts. So it's a bit of all of the above. We're certainly we have people who haven't gone to concerts in a long time going. We have concerts that will go to one, now going to two. We have concerts -- we have people that are going to many. So it's not -- I don't think you could pull it apart as one factor. I think you're seeing a broad-based high demand return to shows and when they're there, a broad-based pattern on site.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Glagola with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Glagola: Concert ticket prices, I want to go back to that being up 10% year-over-year versus 2019. Joe, can you just break out how much of this increase is being driven by market pricing versus price ticketing increases at the on sale?\nJoe Berchtold: Yes. As Michael said, the dynamically priced tickets represent a very small percentage of the overall tickets. So it's not going to be felt by most people. I would -- I don't have the exact numbers. I would guess that it's less than half of the impact is from that. And then there is a general increase. I can probably use the fact that the entry price of $33 is up about 5% from 2019 as a proxy for what's going on with the overall ticket pricing. And then maybe the remainder is driven by the more front-of-house activity. And again, those numbers are -- because there's a lot of attention on how much the overall ticket prices are up. If you look at the U.S. market, the U.S. is up between 12% and 13% in terms of inflation over the past three years as a comparative.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Katz: I wanted to just get a little more color, if we can, about international markets and international landscapes. And if we obviously are seeing a lot of strong demand, is it relatively even if we look at international markets relative to the U.S.? Or are there any that are stronger or weaker, et cetera?\nMichael Rapino: Yes, we're seeing no difference right now in demand across the globe. You can look at, I guess, Springsteen just went on sale last week, global stadiums across Europe everywhere, sold out just as fast in Europe as it did here similar to Post Malone, Kendrick. So the tours that are selling here are selling it as fast in our international markets, Latin America, Mexico, continue to see completely record demand in all those markets. We're also still seeing walk up strong at our festivals and on-site as of last weekend, right? So that's kind of current data. There's still spending money. They're still buying tickets at high demand. So we have pullback yet in Europe or any international market.\nDavid Katz: Great. And am I permitted to follow up? Or would you prefer I went back in the queue?\nMichael Rapino: Go ahead.\nDavid Katz: Okay. With respect to digital initiatives around ticketing, if you could just talk about kind of -- it's obviously exciting and productive, sort of what inning you'd say we're in and any observation surprising or otherwise so far?\nJoe Berchtold: Yes, we're still in early innings. This is the first summer that we're really deploying at scale, the data and the technology so that we can reach out to fans once they bought the ticket, do upsells, first people who are going to shows that our venues, connecting them with sponsors, seeing some very good increases in our upsell levels as we talk about some of our average per fan spending, and the increase on premiums at our amphitheaters, for instance, more premium parking, more premium entry, VIP clubs. It's certainly enhanced by our ability to reach -- have a platform that can reach out and sell to those fans effectively, and you're not depending on them just figuring it out night of. So we're very happy with the early progress we're making.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ryan Sundby with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nRyan Sundby: With Asia Pac still limited this quarter, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about, one, how quickly that ramps from here? And then maybe two, a little more on the long-term opportunity there volume, the recent acquisitions in Thailand and the Philippines, I think plans in place to bring Lollapalooza to India next year. Any color on how that kind of comes together and how large not really, that would be great?\nMichael Rapino: Yes, most of that, I think it was Asia reference. We're currently in 40 countries, hundred offices in 40 countries, varying degree of market share from the U.S. to Cape Town or South Africa. So we've got a global platform, and that was always our first priority. So we can say that any artists, we can put you on the road in any market sponsorship make it happen. Then when we get kind of our flag in the ground, we start to maybe launch or build festivals, operate venues, build up our ticketing, sponsorship and the model and the flywheel start to work. You can kind of look at our business across the globe, different markets we're in varying degrees of that growth. Latin America, we were very, very undeveloped in all markets. Obviously, now with OCESA, we've got that flywheel in Mexico. We bought festivals in Latin America with Rockland Rio and then bringing Lala, a lot of couple of promoters. We're going to get some venues going. So the flywheel is starting to work in Brazil and Colombia and Argentina, but we're kind of go from zero market share to big opportunity there. So that will continue to be a big focus for us. Western Europe, there's still some markets we're undeveloped in whether be Portugal or Spain, certain markets, we don't have the full flywheel and you'll see us continually add a festival or a promoter or a venue to those markets. Asia, we have a good platform. We have people on the ground. We've got a really strong business in Australia and New Zealand. But as we moved up to Pacific Rim, we've been slowly building the flywheel in all those markets. Japan is probably the one market that's the best and biggest in that market. We've got to do more work on that. But we look at Asia as really undeveloped territory, low market share, huge opportunity over the next while. We like everyone else in the world, we look at Asia, we look at Latin America, and we're looking to the Middle East and Eastern Europe is areas where we have no real market share. But that consumer now on TikTok knows that Drake dropped the video last night, whether they live in Singapore, India, Cape Town. So we've got a global product, and we've got lots of opportunity to keep growing.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matthew Harrigan with Benchmark. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Harrigan: Recognizing that you can't alter the weather or nature and there's an amphitheater season and all that, you're really inducing a lot of serial correlation, I think, activity among concertgoers. I mean people are going back and even when people, I think, go to movie theaters, you get people -- there's a hit movie and there tends to be a lot of repeat behavior. Do you think that all the initiatives you're undertaking are going to alter the seasonality in your business somewhat and maybe make Q4 a lot more active even on a relative basis than has historically been because it feels like there are a lot of things pushing in that direction if you take out concerns with weather and all that?\nJoe Berchtold: Yes. This is Joe. I gave you some numbers that in our amphitheaters. We do expect to have about 1 million more fans attending shows than we had in 2019. So, we're certainly seeing an extension of the amphitheater outdoor season, particularly through the more southern states. Theaters and clubs have always been very active in Q4. Arenas tend not to be quite as big just because it gets -- the routing gets interrupted by more of the holidays. So, we'll see a bit. I don't think it will dramatically change.\nMichael Rapino: But it will be -- why we look at our business as global. In the U.S., the arenas, NBA, NHL and NFL clog up the venues in the fall into the winter. But that's why we take a lot of these artists now and say let's go to Asia Pacific and Pacific Rim and Latin America. Let's get off-site middle of America and go to those markets as those open up. So there is a big 12-month-a-year business on a global basis. This industry is focused too much on the U.S. Western Europe summer business. But you are right, as the business expands in a lot of those markets, you have a 12-month strong market where you can put a sell-out show in other markets while you're waiting for a summer business here.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Paul Golding with Macquarie Capital. Please proceed with your question.\nPaul Golding: Michael and Joe, congrats on the quarter. I just wanted to ask, given the strong demand that we're seeing across the board here and what I presume is some overflow in terms of demand that is unable to get a seat, where does streaming fit into the medium-term strategy now? I know it was more of a focal point, of course, during the pandemic, but just seeing opportunity for sponsorship or advertising through that. How much incremental focus will there be on that going forward or sort of walking back from that a bit? Just help us think about monetization there or investment if it's still a strategic point for you.\nMichael Rapino: I think we were clearing things a bit. We were not moved by the thesis that might have been for a moment that live is duplicated and digital. What we've always said that this magic two hours, you have to physically experience this. But we love the . It's a very unique space. It can't be duplicatable. But we've always said that we have all these shows and the most accessible, especially in dedicated fan, but you can expand that show and there's an audience that wants to watch their favorite artist over the weekend. We had an incredible broadcast on Hulu for today's high-quality filming and broadcasting live  festival, fabulous. So we've always thought the screen is an extension. It's great for our sponsorship business, where we have 900 sponsors looking always to be part of the show, both on and off. So, we love beats, we love the opportunity. We're doing thousands of shows. And we think it's an ancillary business that helps our overall sponsorship business as well as our committed festival business. Our business is so big now. I wouldn't say it's a material piece on its own. We never thought it would be, but it's another service we provide to both the artist, festival and sponsor, and it's something you have to be in.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I'd like to turn the call back to Michael Rapino for closing remarks.\nMichael Rapino: Thank you, everybody. Have a great summer, and we'll talk in the fall.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation.",

            "name": "Joe Berchtold",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As with last quarter, 2019 is the best comparison for us in terms of understanding our operations and key performance indicators, so most of our focus will be relative to Q2 of 2019. For the Company, our reported revenue of $4.4 billion for the quarter was $1.3 billion better than Q2 2019 or an increase of 40%. On a constant currency basis, our revenue was $4.6 billion for the quarter, so there was roughly a 4% impact due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. In our reported AOI of $480 million for the quarter was $160 million better than 2019, up 50% and led by an improvement of over $100 million in ticketing and $80 million in sponsorship. On a constant currency basis, our Q2 AOI was $502 million. The FX impact of negative $23 million or 4% was largely driven by the devaluation of the euro and the pound. This was not only our highest Q2 AOI ever but it was also our highest quarterly AOI ever, beating our prior record quarter, which was Q3 of 2019 by 12%. Notable given that Q3 is traditionally our highest AOI quarter each year, and we converted almost 80% of this AOI to adjusted free cash flow of $379 million. Let me give a bit more color on each division, and then I'll give you more on full year leading indicators. First, in concerts, our AOI was $123 million for the quarter, which compares to $133 million in Q2 of 2019. It was one of concert's strongest second quarters ever despite limited activity in our Asia Pacific region and operating cost increases. Additionally, while OCESA had a very strong return to activity, its AOI largely flows through sponsorship and ticketing while their concerts division absorbs most of its costs. In the quarter, we had over 33 million fans attend 12,500 events, growing nearly 25% compared to Q2 of 2019 when we had 27 million fans attend 10,000 shows. And we continue to see growth in our on-site spend with no signs of change. Here's what we're seeing so far this year by venue type across our owned or operated buildings. In our amphitheaters, ancillary per fan revenue has risen to $38.5, an increase of $9 per fan over 2019 levels or 30% growth. At our theaters and clubs in the U.S., ancillary per fan revenue has increased by over 25%, driven by higher concession sales and increased purchases of premium packages, fast lane entry and night of show upsells. In our theaters and clubs in the U.K., ancillary per fan revenue has risen by 20% compared to 2019, largely as a result of increased food and beverage consumption, pricing optimization as well as the shift to cashless payment. Finally, at our major festivals, increased spending on concessions, campaign and VIP experiences has driven ancillary per fan revenue up by over 30%. The consistent theme here is that as we continue elevating our hospitality operations and create more premium options, fans are eager to enhance their experience. At this point, we still have a lot more room to grow these higher-quality experience offerings throughout our owned or operated portfolio, which includes over 400 venues and festivals globally at this point. Next, ticketing had another very successful quarter, delivering $231 million of AOI, making it the most profitable quarter ever for ticketing, beating the record set just last year in the fourth quarter and nearly doubling the Q2 2019 AOI results of $124 million. Our growth came from both primary and secondary ticketing with transacted ticketing GTV up 69% and 141%, respectively. Transacted ticket volume, excluding refunds, was 77 million tickets, our highest quarter ever, besting our former record of 65 million tickets in Q4 2021 by 18% and 25 million tickets or 48% higher than Q2 of 2019. Transacted ticketing GTV, excluding refunds, was $7.3 billion, our highest quarter ever, besting our former record of $6.6 billion of Q4 of 2021 by 11% and $3.1 billion and 76% higher than Q2 of 2019. International markets are now largely back and contributing to this growth with transacted ticketing GTV up 67% relative to Q2 2019. As Michael mentioned, approximately 75% of our growth came from concerts, which was due to both higher fan attendance at our concerts and also timing with a number of on sales expected to happen in Q3 getting moved up into Q2. Even as more of the ticket value is captured for content organizers, our secondary marketplaces continue to grow rapidly with four of our five best resale days ever in Q2 and 12 of our top 20 resale days in 2022. We continue to believe that the secondary market is a leading indicator for primary pricing opportunities over the next few years as well as a buffer against any demand fluctuations. Finally, sponsorship had its biggest quarter ever with AOI of $178 million, 80% higher than our Q2 2019 AOI of $98 million. With the U.S., the U.K. and now Mainland Europe all fully opened, we had high growth in both on-site and online sponsorship with each delivering record Q2 AOI. The growth in our large multiyear multi-asset sponsor speaks to our value of connecting live music fans with global brands. We are nearing in on 100 such major sponsors that, in total, generate well over $0.5 billion in revenue and represents nearly 75% of our growth relative to 2019. As we look to the remainder of 2022, starting with our leading indicators through late July, all relative to 2019. First, confirmed show bookings are up over 30%, driven by double-digit increases in every market and across all venue types. Our concert ticket sales through the end of July are over 100 million tickets for events this year, up 38% and higher than our full year 2019 fan count. As a result, we expect a very strong Q3 for concerts with more shows and higher attendance, including fan growth at our owned or operated venues where we are continuing to see strong APF increases. Also, similar to last year, we are extending the amphitheater later in the year, adding over 1 million fans in Q4 this year relative to 2019. Michael also gave the numbers around much of our Q2 fan growth being driven by international markets, which is a great indicator of the broadly global health of our fan base. But I don't want anyone to over extrapolate this to the U.S. market as we expect North America will drive much of our fan growth in Q3. Second, ticketing has sold 183 million primary fee-bearing tickets for events this year, up 30%. Of these, 122 million tickets are for concert events, which is 42% higher than 2019. Related to this, we have $3.2 billion in event-related deferred revenue, double our level in Q2 of 2019. These are largely tickets that have been sold by Ticketmaster for Live Nation concerts but the revenue and AOI hasn't flowed through yet, and we'll do so over the course of the next year as the events occur. We remain on course for a strong Q3 in ticketing as our deferred revenue is recognized but also impacted by the shift of some of the on sales that moved into Q2. On the sponsorship side, we expect to see continued growth driven by our strong Q3 festival lineup with some of this activity also involving on-site activation support. On the cost side, increases continue to impact us primarily in the venues we operate, amphitheaters, theaters and clubs and festivals. But in all cases, we are delivering increased profitability per fan due to increased ticket and ancillary revenue. A few other points on 2022, given our presence in the U.K. and mainland Europe, we've experienced FX headwinds. And through the end of June, our AOI has been adversely impacted by $23 million. This was almost entirely in the second quarter as the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against the euro and the British pound. Based on current rates, we expect our AOI to continue having a 3% to 4% hit in the second half. We provided detailed guidance on line items that impact our EPS calculation last quarter, and there's just one update that I wanted to make here, which is, as noted, we expect the headwinds with FX rates to continue through the remainder of the year, which at current forward rates result in approximately $15 million quarterly below-the-line expense due to currency exchange losses on the revaluation of our foreign balance sheet balances to U.S. dollars. In anticipation of the growth opportunities ahead of us this year, we continue to expect 2022 capital expenditures to be approximately $375 million, with 2/3 allocated to revenue-generating projects. We expect free cash flow conversion from AOI to be back in the mid-50s for the full year. And we ended Q2 with $2.5 billion of available liquidity between free cash and untapped revolver capacity giving us sufficient flexibility to continue investing in growth. We are comfortable with our leverage with over 85% of our debt at a fixed rate and our average cost of debt of roughly 4.3%, positioning us well in this interest rate environment. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator? This is Joe. Yes, I'll take that. I think we laid out a handful of factors that we think were some combination of timing and one-offs that impacted this quarter. Asia Pacific is not fully open yet we've got the organization up and running to prepare for being open. Just the structure of OCESA's P&L is they really drive their economics through ticketing and sponsorship whereas most of their cost structure is in the concert side. We talked about some operating cost increases for our operated venues, still driving per fan profitability increases, but you have some costs there. And then it's just -- I wouldn't over read one quarter. I gave you in mind, for instance, that a lot of this was in international markets that we had our growth, less growth in this quarter in North America. But then we have a lot of growth in Q3 in North America. As I look at the numbers overall, North America, if you look at our 100 million tickets, North America has 30% growth. So as that flows through and Q3, you'd expect to see some of that flip it around. I just don't want to read too much into it. Sorry, Brandon. Sorry, Brandon. Sorry, just one comment I have to respond to. Your commentary about trickling out tickets, that's not a practice. That's not something that is the norm or something that we do. I think that the speed of ticketing has to do with just what's the pace at which some of them sell out with the theory being for some artists, if they price a lot of tickets at market price, they may not all sell out in the first hour, so it has nothing to do. Ticketmaster takes all the tickets. It gets -- puts them directly on sale. It does nothing to try to limit supply or anything in that manner. So I just want to make sure we're crystal clear on that. Sure. Controls can be used -- go ahead, Michael. And artist... The other part of the buffer, Brandon, is just the secondary market itself, and how big it is, its continued growth, right? I gave you the numbers. The secondary market for us grew 140% this quarter. So that tells you that even if some pricing is going up on the primary side, the secondary is growing up -- going up even faster, both in terms of volume and price points. So our first line of defense is keeping our eye on secondary and using that buffer if there is any variations in demand. Sure. I'll use as the basis, the 100-or-so million tickets that we sold through July because I think that just -- that gives the numbers and the facts. And as I indicated, within that, the U.S. is up about just over 30% and international was up 40-odd percent. So you have strong organic growth across both North America and international. Our primary acquisition, of course, would be OCESA, and that would be somewhat less than half of the international growth. So the international growth, even absent acquisitions would be in the mid- to high 20s. So again, this is not an acquisition dependent growth? This is organic plus acquisition. Yes. I'll take this. Michael is having some audio problems here. I think that what we're seeing is a very broad-based, high priority of going to concerts against fans that are interested in going to concerts. So it's a bit of all of the above. We're certainly we have people who haven't gone to concerts in a long time going. We have concerts that will go to one, now going to two. We have concerts -- we have people that are going to many. So it's not -- I don't think you could pull it apart as one factor. I think you're seeing a broad-based high demand return to shows and when they're there, a broad-based pattern on site. Yes. As Michael said, the dynamically priced tickets represent a very small percentage of the overall tickets. So it's not going to be felt by most people. I would -- I don't have the exact numbers. I would guess that it's less than half of the impact is from that. And then there is a general increase. I can probably use the fact that the entry price of $33 is up about 5% from 2019 as a proxy for what's going on with the overall ticket pricing. And then maybe the remainder is driven by the more front-of-house activity. And again, those numbers are -- because there's a lot of attention on how much the overall ticket prices are up. If you look at the U.S. market, the U.S. is up between 12% and 13% in terms of inflation over the past three years as a comparative. Yes, we're still in early innings. This is the first summer that we're really deploying at scale, the data and the technology so that we can reach out to fans once they bought the ticket, do upsells, first people who are going to shows that our venues, connecting them with sponsors, seeing some very good increases in our upsell levels as we talk about some of our average per fan spending, and the increase on premiums at our amphitheaters, for instance, more premium parking, more premium entry, VIP clubs. It's certainly enhanced by our ability to reach -- have a platform that can reach out and sell to those fans effectively, and you're not depending on them just figuring it out night of. So we're very happy with the early progress we're making. Yes. This is Joe. I gave you some numbers that in our amphitheaters. We do expect to have about 1 million more fans attending shows than we had in 2019. So, we're certainly seeing an extension of the amphitheater outdoor season, particularly through the more southern states. Theaters and clubs have always been very active in Q4. Arenas tend not to be quite as big just because it gets -- the routing gets interrupted by more of the holidays. So, we'll see a bit. I don't think it will dramatically change."

            "name": "Michael Rapino",
            "content": "Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. The second quarter confirmed that live entertainment industry is back globally and bigger than ever. Live Nation led this return and continues to deliver the best global network to support artists as they play shows for the fans around the world. Every key operating metric is at an all-time high as we promoted more concerts, had more fans attend shows, they spent more money, sold more tickets and enable brands to connect with fans at a scale we have never seen before. As a result, relative to 2019, with over a 40% increase in revenue to $4.4 billion and a 50% increase in AOI to $480 million. With most of the world fully reopened, it's clear that concerts remain a high priority for fans. Consumers are seeking out and spending more on experiences. And the growing demand for live music and events is driving our business to record levels, far outpacing any macro issues or cost increases. Momentum across our business has remained strong in recent months and weeks, and demand combined with the substantial concert pipeline gives us confidence in our ongoing growth this year and into 2023. During the second quarter, we promoted over 12,000 concerts for 33.5 million fans, each up over 20% relative to the second quarter of 2019. Of the over 6 million additional fans this quarter, 5 million of that growth came from international markets, driven by the addition of OCESA and the reopening of most global markets with particularly strong focus and demand through Europe and Latin America. Growth was broad-based with double-digit attendance increased at venues of all types, demonstrating strong demand for events at all sizes from large-scale stadiums and festivals, sentiment clubs and theaters. Even as show count and attendance grew, fans demonstrated their willingness to pay more for the best seats with the average price of a ticket for our concerts this year up 10% globally relative to 2019, which remains less in the U.S. inflation level over the period. At the same time, our average entry price for concerts remain affordable at $33, up only 5% from 2019. With market-based pricing being widely adopted by most tours, we expect to shift over 500 million from the secondary market to artists this year, continuing to support those who created the concert and ensuring they are benefiting from it. On the venue side of our concert business, we continue to build our portfolio of operated venues with an active pipeline of almost 30 new venues across the globe. We are seeing the benefit of operating more venues as a number of fans who attended shows in our owned and operated venues during the quarter was up 13% to over 14 million fans, and we expect that figure to reach over 50 million fans for the full year. And fans are spending more on site with average per fan revenue up 20% at each of our amphitheaters, festivals, theaters and clubs relative to 2019, with the average per fan revenue at our amphitheaters this year at $38.50, up 30% relative to 2019. Our ticket business also demonstrated strong growth in the quarter, transacted fee-bearing ticket volume up 48% to 77 million tickets and transacted GTV up 76% to $7.3 billion, both relative to 2019. This is our highest fee-bearing GTV quarter ever, with April, May and June, accounting for three of our top five all-time fee-bearing months. 75% of this growth came from concerts, another indicator of the high demand for live music. Along with the volume increase, transacted ticket prices globally was up approximately 15% for the first half of the year relative to 2019 as both concerts and sporting events saw similar low double-digit price increases during the period. Even with strong primary ticketing sales and increased pricing, demand for live events on our secondary ticketing marketplace remain high. And as a result, our GTV more than doubled for the quarter relative to 2019. We are continuing to see the benefits of our technology investments at Ticketmaster, including our global leadership in digital ticketing between new capabilities and the sales effectiveness of our ticketing marketplace, we consistently deliver high ticket sales for our event organizers. As a result, we continue to win business from new and existing clients. And to the first half of this year, we had a 12.8 million net new fee-bearing tickets to our marketplace, led again this year by our international markets, which accounted for 60% of this new growth. Sponsorship has also benefited from the concert flywheel this quarter, driving 74% growth in revenue relative to 2019. As we further enabled more brands to connect with an increasing number of fans on a global basis, festival sponsorship has performed particularly well during the first half of the year, more than doubling from 2019, led by nine new festivals in our Mexico and Latin American businesses that accounted for roughly half this increase, along with broad growth in sponsorship levels across most of the North American festivals. And we continue adding more clients in technology, telecom and purchase path integration, including Google, AWS and Hulu, with these categories collectively more than doubling this sponsorship since 2019. As we look forward to the second half of 2022 and into 2023, we have sold over 100 million tickets for our concerts this year, more than we sold for the entire year 2019. Fan demand remained strong and continued growth in ticket buying and on-site spending. And given the long-term nature of most of our sponsorship partnerships, our planned sponsorship for the year is now fully committed. As we prepare for 2023, everywhere globally is open for concerts. And we are actively rooting all of our markets with the largest artist pipeline we have ever seen at this point of the year. And for the 2023 tours we have put on sale so far, all signs continue pointing to strong fan demand. With that, I will let Joe take you through more details of our results. Yes. Thank you. I think we've been saying for a few years that over time, we believe that, that secondary 10 billion, 12 billion, depending on what number you see globally has to start getting captured by the artist at some level. It's just too transparent. The more they see all of the online pricing while they work so hard to put that show on. So I do think that right artists looking at us saying, I'd like to count some of it in the front end. I don't want to be sold out at 10 01 at $200 to have someone else make $2,000. Fans not getting a deal anyway, they're spending $2,000 from somebody else. So I do think they're looking and saying, the front of the house, can we capture some demand? Now, the advantage is the, artist has one objective as we do as the venue to fill every seat. So you're never looking for the gross, you're looking to make sure that every seat is filled for the best experience. We want that. We just want that. So I do think the new dynamic pricing, the better we have become, these tools to the artists, they're looking at the holistic picture. Maybe I can charge a bit more in the front row. I got to charge less in the back row because net I'm going to sell through the back end of the house that maybe is always spot in our business. Now if you can still get the same gross, but you can lower the ticket price in the back part of the house, that's a win for everyone. So, we're right now -- Joe has the exact math. We looked at it yesterday. It's still a small percentage of the total growth is price platinum and/or dynamic, 1%, 2% kind of numbers, and really nonexistent outside of America. We just -- so yes, there's a long runway where the artists will look at the small, again, even as much always, as you heard about the Springsteen sale, than 1% of the tickets were priced a little higher to capture the second business versus 99% of the house. So to the artist, I think they'll look at us -- and then the premium, the dynamic, how do I better price my product, fill the house, lower the price on the back, capture more of the front, and we think that's got many years of runway for us to expand on a global basis. All right. That's a lot. I'll try to take some pieces. We work for the artist. We're a B2B business. The artist is that decides when they tour, how they tour. Our job is to provide all the tools, platform and services to help them succeed in that tour from -- a year. Now our decision is -- they're genius brand managers. They have to balance the needs of their fans, supply demand and pricing. And some brands, like the Rolling Stones, have been very good at always saying expensive experience and we're that proud and enable to deliver that brand position. But I think artists are always trying to find a fine line on how do I make the show accessible? How do I make sure all my fans can show? How do I price it fairly versus how much money can I make? So I think they see that. I think today, while the technology is advancing and they're starting to look at more technology and more pricing data, I think they can now -- good shows and realize that some ways they keep price, 1, 2% of the house higher and achieved some of those economics versus the scalper while still pricing 98% of the house at a very stable brand position. So we can achieve both. This is an industry that for 30 years, we would do a tour. They would set three ticket prices 140, 79 and 39, and that will be the three prices in every city for every night for the market, as you know. That's way it's going to operate forward, a different price on a Friday in New York than Indianapolis on a Tuesday. So dynamic smart pricing, now that we're able to provide that sophistication, the bands are much more sophisticated. And they're now able to have tools to figure out how do I price it better and -- some better economics, get some of the leakage of secondary, but still maintain an overall ticket price, leaving dollars on the table, but still finding that balance between the consumer demand, the brand and the slippage of the economics to secondary they've been losing. Yes. But I think we're just addressing because the marketplace. The consumer obviously gets a little -- time when at 10:00, there's lots of secondary tickets, right? So historically, the Bruce fan would have been sold out at 10 and had to go to a secondary to buy that good seat. So today, we're sorting through that process where we can provide information to the fans. But our job at Ticketmasters is put every sale on ticket -- provide none into the secondary market and provide all the data to the artists that they can invest up and down and as the market adjusts. No. I said it before in our last call, I mean, we looked at the last recession, there was a single-digit back in some ticket sales, but we were -- years ago, not even in the same -- indication on pricing nor did we have the tool. So yes, we look at data pricing now, dynamic pricing, look at all market data algorithms to figure out what is the price point that we'll sell through. And we do believe that because of the upside right now in the premium secondary side of our business, that if we had to pull back ticket sales and dropped prices by 5% or 10% to match supply/demand of inflation, we have so much flexibility in pricing to get that done and still sell through the house and lower price if that was needed for a band to sell-through tickets. The number one goal is to set -- their number one goal -- sell every ticket. So there are always going to be in a variable -- of how do I price it -- what do I got to reduce our end of house, front end of the house? What do we need to do a sell-through on a Tuesday night in Indianapolis? Let's adjust pricing. Well, I think in our investor conference, we wanted to kind of highlight -- I think it's always been an under -- strong business, but we've put more focus on it from an operational design development. We've got over those 300 venues. We manage -- we've been adding 20 to 30 a year over the last few years. As you know, Boston been an incredible success in which will provide more return. And those 30 that we have in the pipe now, another 75 behind of those on a global basis are everything from clubs to arenas depending on where the hole in the market may exist. And we see great platform there. And as we've said before, when we show in an operated venue that we have the sponsorship and the ticketing and the food and beverage and all the revenue streams, that's our highest return for us. Yes, we're seeing no difference right now in demand across the globe. You can look at, I guess, Springsteen just went on sale last week, global stadiums across Europe everywhere, sold out just as fast in Europe as it did here similar to Post Malone, Kendrick. So the tours that are selling here are selling it as fast in our international markets, Latin America, Mexico, continue to see completely record demand in all those markets. We're also still seeing walk up strong at our festivals and on-site as of last weekend, right? So that's kind of current data. There's still spending money. They're still buying tickets at high demand. So we have pullback yet in Europe or any international market. Go ahead. Yes, most of that, I think it was Asia reference. We're currently in 40 countries, hundred offices in 40 countries, varying degree of market share from the U.S. to Cape Town or South Africa. So we've got a global platform, and that was always our first priority. So we can say that any artists, we can put you on the road in any market sponsorship make it happen. Then when we get kind of our flag in the ground, we start to maybe launch or build festivals, operate venues, build up our ticketing, sponsorship and the model and the flywheel start to work. You can kind of look at our business across the globe, different markets we're in varying degrees of that growth. Latin America, we were very, very undeveloped in all markets. Obviously, now with OCESA, we've got that flywheel in Mexico. We bought festivals in Latin America with Rockland Rio and then bringing Lala, a lot of couple of promoters. We're going to get some venues going. So the flywheel is starting to work in Brazil and Colombia and Argentina, but we're kind of go from zero market share to big opportunity there. So that will continue to be a big focus for us. Western Europe, there's still some markets we're undeveloped in whether be Portugal or Spain, certain markets, we don't have the full flywheel and you'll see us continually add a festival or a promoter or a venue to those markets. Asia, we have a good platform. We have people on the ground. We've got a really strong business in Australia and New Zealand. But as we moved up to Pacific Rim, we've been slowly building the flywheel in all those markets. Japan is probably the one market that's the best and biggest in that market. We've got to do more work on that. But we look at Asia as really undeveloped territory, low market share, huge opportunity over the next while. We like everyone else in the world, we look at Asia, we look at Latin America, and we're looking to the Middle East and Eastern Europe is areas where we have no real market share. But that consumer now on TikTok knows that Drake dropped the video last night, whether they live in Singapore, India, Cape Town. So we've got a global product, and we've got lots of opportunity to keep growing. But it will be -- why we look at our business as global. In the U.S., the arenas, NBA, NHL and NFL clog up the venues in the fall into the winter. But that's why we take a lot of these artists now and say let's go to Asia Pacific and Pacific Rim and Latin America. Let's get off-site middle of America and go to those markets as those open up. So there is a big 12-month-a-year business on a global basis. This industry is focused too much on the U.S. Western Europe summer business. But you are right, as the business expands in a lot of those markets, you have a 12-month strong market where you can put a sell-out show in other markets while you're waiting for a summer business here. I think we were clearing things a bit. We were not moved by the thesis that might have been for a moment that live is duplicated and digital. What we've always said that this magic two hours, you have to physically experience this. But we love the . It's a very unique space. It can't be duplicatable. But we've always said that we have all these shows and the most accessible, especially in dedicated fan, but you can expand that show and there's an audience that wants to watch their favorite artist over the weekend. We had an incredible broadcast on Hulu for today's high-quality filming and broadcasting live  festival, fabulous. So we've always thought the screen is an extension. It's great for our sponsorship business, where we have 900 sponsors looking always to be part of the show, both on and off. So, we love beats, we love the opportunity. We're doing thousands of shows. And we think it's an ancillary business that helps our overall sponsorship business as well as our committed festival business. Our business is so big now. I wouldn't say it's a material piece on its own. We never thought it would be, but it's another service we provide to both the artist, festival and sponsor, and it's something you have to be in. Thank you, everybody. Have a great summer, and we'll talk in the fall."

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir.\nMichael Rapino: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Momentum has picked up for all of our businesses over the course of the first quarter. And as a result, we have delivered financial performance that greatly surpassed our previous expectations with AOI of $209 million. Artists are back on the road and fan demand has never been stronger. The reflection of live events remain a clear priority for consumers as our social lives restart. Ticket buying serves as a leading indicator to our overall business. Ticketmaster's strong first quarter performance drove the company's overall profitability and shows how well our concert and sponsorship businesses are positioned to deliver record results this year. Despite some markets taking longer to reopen, the quarter was our second highest ever we transacted GTV, excluding refunds, trailing only Q4 2021 with March being our highest transacted GTV month ever. In primary ticketing, we're now benefiting from the 17 million new fee-bearing tickets we gained in 2021, which helped us drive transacted GTV for the quarter up 33% relative to 2019. This quarter was also added 7 million new additional tickets through new contracts with Venues as well as content creators, setting us up for ongoing growth this year and into 2023. Our secondary ticketing GTV growth was even higher up 106% relative to 2019 driven largely by average retail ticket price up 20% relative to 2019 and a tremendous fan demand pushed up the market pricing, Ticketmaster, gaining additional market share by effectively leveraging its team and league partnerships across NFL, NBA and other sporting events. And the market continued growing at double-digit pace, demonstrating high demand for live events, as well as how much runway there is for continued pricing, efficiently. Fan demand and signing of new contracts accelerated even faster than expected this quarter, reinforcing the Ticketmaster as the enterprise platform for choice of teams, artists and content creators, and continuing to be the most effective fan marketplace. Our sponsorship activity fully returned in Q1, delivering financial results that well exceeded 2019. We're seeing growth across a number of dimensions, expansion of existing relationships, new categories expanding our breadth to partners and new ad units being created both onsite and online. The number of strategic sponsors that generated over $1 million of revenue per year has risen by almost 30% since 2019. With our committed span up 70% and accounting for 80% of our total sponsorship revenue, about 60% of this growth has come from three categories of particular priority over the past two years; technology, telecom and purchase path integration, which has collectively more than doubled their sponsorships since 2019. Much of our focus with brand partners is how we collectively elevate the fan experience. We've had great success with this in recent years. And so far this year through our partnership with Verizon, we started powering our Venues with cutting edge 5G connectivity and are launching initiative with Snap to give artists augmented reality capabilities at shows and festivals. At this point, sponsorship sales are up double digits relative to 2019, and we have a solid 90% of our planned sponsored for the year, positioning us for continued strong financial performance. The concert division, all leading indicators, point to double-digit growth and fan attendance at our concerts relative to 2019. Approximately 11 million fans attended our shows in the first quarter compared to 15 million fans in 2019. This was expected as we planned for limited concert activity in the early months of the year to allow for markets to open. But more importantly, we continue to build our flywheel with over 70 million tickets now sold for shows in 2022, up to 36 million, compared to 2019 and committed show count is up 44% through the end of April, relative to 19%, setting us up for continued ticket sales over the year. We continue to see the fans are showing up for the concerts they have tickets for, with attendance rates in the US across all venue types at 2019 levels with no shows generally in the low mid-single digits. The industry continues to embrace market-based pricing, particularly on the best tickets, shifting $500 million to artists for shows this year, resulting from a double-digit increase in ticket pricing and reducing the price arbitrage in the secondary market. At the same time in the US, the average entry level price to get in and enjoy the show remains under $35, approachable for almost all fans. Early reads on consumer spending on our shows across the US and UK also indicate fans continue their spending when they get to the show. We had two million fans at 10 shows at our theaters and clubs in the first quarter with average per fan revenue up 30% relative to 2019. And we've had four festivals over the past few months to lean over 300,000 fans with average per fan revenue up 30% also. Looking ahead to the summer and the rest of the year, we remain optimistic that we are just getting going as all leading indicators reinforce record activity levels and financial results. Ticket sales were at record levels in Q1 with momentum building over February and March. We sold almost 20 million more tickets to our concerts this year in this point in time in 2019, with large number of tours still to go on sale and concert fans are showing no sign of slowing down. They're paying for the best tickets, attending the shows and spending more on site as they create lifetime memories. We're continuing to build Venue Nation, our platform of operated Venues with a pipeline of 20 Venues, including the recently open Moody Center in Austin, in addition to adding 38 more festivals this year. Sponsors are looking to spend more this year on live entertainment than ever and Live Nation's scale and global platform is making us the partner of choice. While the US and UK have driven much of our activity over the past year, the rest of the world is now rapidly opening up. Assess this financial performance for the quarter, exceeded its 2019 results and both Latin America and Western Europe are expected to have record attendance for our concerts this year. I continue to expect this just to be the start of our run, the global addressable markets for concerts, ticketing and sponsorship, all provide a long runway for continued growth. We have over 60 tours already under discussion for 2023, our earliest indicators of next year in great positioning for ongoing growth. With that, I'll turn it over to Joe.\nJoe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael and good afternoon, everyone. Given the unique situation in 2020 and 2021, Q1 of 2019 is the best comparison for us in terms of understanding our operations and key performance indicators. So while I will provide some commentary around our results relative to Q1 of 2021, most of our focus will be relative to 2019. Overall, our AOI of $209 million for the quarter was $361 million better than 2021, led by an improvement of $269 million in ticketing, $66 million in sponsorship and $26 million in concerts. This was our highest Q1 AOI ever exceeding Q1 of 2019 by $94 million, which had been our previous record first quarter. Let me give a bit more color on each division. Then I will give you more on 2022 leading indicators. First ticketing was again the star of the quarter delivering $206 million in AOI, making it the second best quarter ever for ticketing and more than doubling the Q1 2019 AOI results of a $100 million. The first quarter of 2021 was heavily impacted by the pandemic resulting in an AOI loss of $63 million. Ticketing was successful across the board. Let me give a few key statistics for the quarter. Our growth came from both primary and secondary ticketing with transacted GTV, excluding refunds up 33% and 106% respectively. Transacted ticket volume, excluding refunds were 63 million tickets, our fourth highest quarter ever, and 7 million tickets higher than Q1 of 2019. Transacted ticketing GTV excluding refunds was $6.3 billion, our second highest quarter ever after Q4 of 2021 and 39% higher than Q1 2019. This was driven by concerts and sporting events whose GTV were up 49% and 73% respectively relative to Q1 2019. A continued shift toward more market-based pricing help grow our GTV levels with average primary ticket prices up double-digits for the first quarter, relative to Q1 2019. And in resale, our average price increased 18% while our overall resale GTV doubled compared to the first quarter of 2019, indicating that demand for the top seats across all live events continues to outpace efforts by sports teams, artists, and others, to capture more of the full value from their events. As the first effectively normal Q1 since 2019, we are seeing that digital tickets have now become the norm across live events with the NFL and NBA leading the way with 96% of fans using digital tickets to enter games up from 53% in Q1 of 2019. More broadly, 72% of our tickets globally were digital in Q1 of 2022, relative to 33% in Q1 2019. With this level of digital adoption, we can now accelerate our efforts to foster our direct fan relationships this year and into 2023. Next, sponsorship continued to ramp up with the reopening of Venues and expanded online opportunities. As a result, 2022 Q1 sponsorship and advertising AOI of $70 million grew by 75% relative to 2019 Q1 AOI of $40 million. This strength comes across both onsite and online each delivering record Q1 AOI. The growth versus 2019 was driven by expansion of our online business, new festivals that launched in the quarter and the addition of O's brand partners. Finally, in concerts, our AOI was a loss of $49 million, which compares to a loss of $74 million in Q1 of 2021 and positive AOI of $5 million in Q1 of 2019. As we indicated on the last call, we planned for fewer arena tours in Q1 this year, which typically drives our first quarter performance, resulting in concert seasonality that will be even more Q2 and Q3 driven this year than has historically been the case. In the quarter, we had nearly 11 million fans attend 6,600 events continuing to be led by the US and the UK, which accounted for almost 80% of these fans. In comparison, Q1 of 2019 had 15 million fans and 8,200 shows when all of our markets and all venue types were fully open. For ticket sales through late April for shows playing off this year, our average ticket price was up double digits relative to the first quarter of 2019, again mainly driven by demand for the best seats. At the same time, our average entry price remains less than $35 overall and less than $30 for amphitheatre and club shows. Michael mentioned that no-how rates were back to pre-COVID levels. So I wanted to give a few more specifics to hopefully set the record straight. Looking at the full year through mid-April for the US, our no-show rates were the same or better than the same period for 2019. For arenas, they were 1% better for amphitheatres, they were 4% better, for theaters and clubs, they were on par and all up, we are 2% better. We haven't had enough volume on other outdoor events to have meaningful metrics yet, but generally those Venues had strong re-openings last summer and so we don't expect any issues there and used there. In general, the US was ahead of the rest of the world, but the UK is now fully backed to pre-pandemic, no-show rates as well and we have not seen any evidence in any markets of any long-term impact on our shows. Michael gave you the top line on our first quarter average revenue per fan growth up 30% for both theaters and clubs and festivals. For theaters and clubs, key drivers include onsite concessions and upsells and for festivals, the growth was heavily driven by onsite concessions and increased VIP purchases. All indicators have continued strong fans spending as they look to make the most of going to the show. Finally, COVID continues to have less and less impact on our concert schedule and by March in the US, we cancelled only around 1% of our planned concerts. As we look to the remainder of 2022, looking at our leading indicators through the end of April 1, confirmed show bookings are up over 40% overall and up double-digits for each amphitheatres, arenas, stadiums and festivals. Second, ticketing has sold 130 million fee bearing tickets for events this year up 26% from this point in 2019, of these, 88 million tickets over concert events, which is 40% higher than 2019. Related to this, we have $3.5 billion in event-related deferred revenue, almost twice the level of Q1 2019. These are largely tickets that have been sold by Ticketmaster for Live Nation concerts, but the revenue in AOI hasn't flowed through yet and will do so over the course of this year, as events happen. On the sponsorship side, commitments are up double-digits from this point in 2019 and overall we have more than 90% of our plan sponsorship net revenue for 2022 set. On the cost side, we're obviously tracking closely cost increases associated both with labor and in general, with supply chain challenges and inflation. These costs tend to hit us primarily in the Venues we operate; amphitheatres, theaters and clubs and festivals. For amphitheatres and theaters and clubs, labor is the largest factor given we have our Venues in place. Across this entire fan base, we expect our variable cost per fan, excluding talent to increase by $2 to $2.50 relative to 2019. This remains well below our average revenue per fan growth and so we still expect to grow average per fan profitability across our operated Venues this year. Festivals have a broader range of costs given the wider set of equipment and services involved in building these events. Current projections are that variable costs per fan excluding talent will be up 7% this year, which is well below our expected increase in ticket revenue per fan. Helping offset all these costs is the $200 million cost reduction exercise that we executed last year, which remains well in place. A few other points on 2022, we now expect OCESA will deliver full year results in line with 2019 levels as Mexico is fully active with most of their AOI flowing through our sponsorship and ticketing divisions. In light of the OCESA acquisition, we wanna provide more guidance on a few mine items below AOI, which impact our earnings per share calculation. First on depreciation and amortization, we expect the combination of these accounts to be roughly in line with 2019. The addition of OCESA is offset by the impacts of our reduced investment in CapEx and M&A over the past two years. With the acquisition of OCESA and anticipated strong performance of our festivals, many of which are joined ventures, we expect non-controlling interest expense will be roughly double 2019 levels. We are projecting increasing to be about $150 million this year. Again, the increase compared to 2019 is largely attributable to the OCESA acquisition. As a result of the additional financing opportunities over the past two years, our interest expense is now roughly $70 million per quarter. Finally, in comparison to 2019, we expect income tax expense will grow in line with our AOI growth. In anticipation and the growth opportunities ahead of us this year, we continue to expect 2022 capital expenditures to be approximately $375 million with two thirds of this spent on revenue generating projects. We generated $89 million of adjusted free cash flow this quarter and expect free cash flow conversion from AOI to be back in the fifties for the full year. We ended Q1 with $1.9 billion of available liquidity between free cash and untapped revolver capacity, giving us sufficient flexibility to invest in growth. We are comfortable with our leverage with over 85% of our debt at a fixed rate and our average cost of debt is roughly 4.3% positioning as well in this interest rate environment. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator:  Your first question comes from line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Karnovsky: All right. Thank you. Michael, you've given a lot of great leading indicators for '22. So I apologize to jump ahead, but you did mention in the release 60 tours and discussion for '23 and was hoping you could put some context around that. How elevated would that number be, kind of relative to what you might normally be looking at this early on and is there a way to kind of think through how much of that is sort of backlog continue to work through from the pandemic versus sort of just you organically increasing your footprint?\nMichael Rapino: Yeah, thank you. The '23 is really no backlog. '22 is the year where we would've flushed out any reschedule tours from 2019 '21, wherever. So 2023 is kind of if you want to call almost back to business and yes, it's a very vibrant pipe. I think we said at the Investor Date, if you want to kind of scale back and look at the next five years, you can kind of look at what we did going into '19, where we looked at the industry growing at almost 10% a year on a compounded basis. We think the industry is going to be doing that again. It's back to full growth, high quality growth sector industry and we think we tend to outperform the industry. So we look at '23 will be a, if you want to call it a record year coming off of '22, and we think we're in for multiple record years of growth.\nDavid Karnovsky: Okay. Grant, and then just on Ticketmaster, I was wondering if you could just walk through some of the drivers of the strong secondary growth you're seeing in particular, you mentioned share gains, whereas in the past, I think we tended to think of market shares for you and your competitors as generally stable. Maybe you could just speak to some of the initiatives, you taking it to league or team level to kind of drive that higher. And then just as a follow on, is there any update you can provide on the NFL relationship just given that's now extended to 2026. Thanks.\nJoe Berchtold: Hey David, this is Joe I'll take it. And I think the questions are related. Start with the NFL. We entered the partnership with the NFL four years ago, I guess, and that relationship was really technology driven and it was a mutual strategy of figuring out how do we shift the industry to digital ticketing? How do we understand identity-enabled relationships with the fans, for the leagues, for the teams as well as for Ticketmaster and that's proven to be very successful and obviously coming out of COVID not surprisingly, the NFL said, what's the next technology agenda. We worked with them on deploying NFTs and they said, this is all great, better to talk now about linking back up for the next five years. So we know we can work together and figure out what's the next technology unlocked. How do we continue to use technology is really it's the core of the relationship or the starting point of the relationship with the fans. So that's what led to the renewal. We're excited about it. We think the NFL's been a great partner and we'll continue to be. So naturally as you do that, we continue at Ticketmaster to get smarter and smarter about the fan as well. That lets us continue to use our alignment and our mutual interest with the teams and the league in terms of driving Ticketmaster share in the secondary. So we're taking all the data we have, all the information we're working with them on all of their assets to help acquire customers, to use all the season ticket holder inventory, to continue to drive our share and provide a great marketplace, a great experience for fans to be buying those tickets. So combination of all of those has led to increasing share which is as Michael talked about part of how we've doubled secondary in the first quarter relative to 2019.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Stephen Laszczyk - Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Laszczyk: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just to start, I think there's been a fair amount of concern on the macro front. You touched on a little bit at the end of your prepared remarks, but I was curious if you're seeing any signs of consumers changing their spending habits, whether that's on the initial ticket purchase or once they get to the venue against what's turning out to be a pretty difficult inflationary environment. Any data points from the last few weeks I think would be helpful there.\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah, I think this is Joe. I think all of the data points that we're seeing continue to be very strong. Look at our concert ticket sales as we look in March and April, each of those months the ticket sales were up 20% plus relative to 2019. So through March and April, I think we've seen some of these pressures, the gas and so on for a few months now. So not just a few weeks, so we've seen no impact at all on the concert ticket sales. We talked about the pricing, seeing no impact on the take rate of those tickets and the onsite spending the EFs again seeing those up substantially relative to 2019. So no impact there. So from all the different angles that we've looked at it, we have not seen any pullback in consumer behavior. I think that this continues to be part of people want to get out, have a social life, to spend on experiences taking money away from spending on goods. And a lot of what we do is we spoke to the $35 overall average entry price for a ticket or $30 for clubs and amphitheatre. It continues to be a very affordable night out for those that need to be most conscious of that.\nStephen Laszczyk: Thanks. That's helpful. And then I think in the pressure release, you mentioned some opportunity to create new ad units on the sponsorship side, both on site and online. I was wondering if you talk a little bit more about this opportunity and the new inventory, how much of it you expect to create over time and whether that might help bring in new ad categories?\nJoe Berchtold: Well, it is creating new ad categories, right? We talked about that in the technology space, in the FinTech space, throughout the whole purchase path integration, all of that is creating new categories and that's, what's driving even this year a lot of the growth in the sponsorship business. Michael talked very explicitly about what you're seeing on site. Two great examples of how technology's being used to enhance the live experience with Verizon, putting in the infrastructure with the 5G connectivity and with snap as a great product development, product design organization, coming up with some ways to use their products and augmented reality to enhance the onsite experience. So really on the onsite piece, this is all about how do you make a better and better fan experience? And we've got great brands, partners that we work with that are looking to do more and more to make that possible and then as we continue to work on the Ticketmaster marketplace, tie that in with the increased data that we have from the digital ticketing that we were just talking about, how do we create more tailored ad units and make more opportunities for more sponsors to connect with those fans as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Ross: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to build the macro concerns that the last analyst kind of laid out and insofar as inflation and gas prices are concerned, I think the results speak for themselves, but investor pushback has now moved to the possibility of recession and how that would affect you given how deeply consumer discretionary you are. How do you think about your positioning at this point, if a recession scenario played out? Your company and the industry looks very different than it did in 2010 when we lost less of that kind of macro pressure, can you kind of compare and contrast and I know you were booking those acts for next year, kind of far in advance, how much flexibility is there in those contracts?\nJoe Berchtold: Sure. Brandon, This is Joe. Oh, go ahead.\nMichael Rapino: I was -- I'll start and then Joe and jump in. What we always think is one of the great advantages of our business is the pricing is variable, right? So there is no set cost of good. The cost of good is determined by the artist if they go on the road and they're variable. So that makes our product something that can move around on pricing, whether it's taking advantage of the front row pricing, that's under-priced or moving the total ticket price down in the back end of the house or reducing the overall price of the ticket to meet the market and the demand. So historically this is an industry that's been fairly recession proof. It's still, as we've seen, this is still one of the top three entertainment choices for consumer, but the most affordable. So you may not in a recession take that trip. You may not have a large out a purchase of a dishwasher, but you will still go down to amphitheatre or the club or the theater and have a great adventure and a night out for the value. So we have always seen historically over time, the consumer still looks at the concert as a high value item that even during the recession, if there was a pullback, this is something they still can afford to do. And it's actually a great alternative to a higher priced, maybe travel package. So one, we think it is a -- still a much a very affordable option for consumers and pricing will continue to be something that we can adjust. If we see any pullback, artists will always have one motive the same as ours, fill the house, get everyone in the house. So right up until the hour of the show, we always look at variable and dynamic pricing options to say, how do we get the house full. Joe?\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah. And just to build on that first is we now have a level of information that is very -- we didn't have even 10 years ago and almost no industry has called the secondary market. So to Michael's point on pricing flexibility, we have the benefit of knowing real time, what is market pricing and so on one level, you can think that billion dollars plus of price arbitrage that exists on our tickets, that's the first wall of defense in any recessionary environment that pricing comes out first before our pricing's even impacted. And we have a great read on what is the supply that dynamic to be adjusting as we go along. And then along with that, again, you have, again, the macros of the shift of spend from experience -- from goods to experiences, which is continuing. You have the wealth built up and the biggest gains in terms of the income with a lower quartile. So you've got good revenue there. Still, you've got affordable entry prices that we've talked about on the tickets. So we continue to think that as long as we stay focused on what is the value perceived by the fan, stay aligned with that. We'll be able to bring the acts out and sell the tickets.\nBrandon Ross: Great. And then for the first time that I can remember, at least you called out the per caps at theatres, clubs and festivals, it's not something you usually talk about. That's usually the amphitheatre opportunity. Can you kind of help us understand where you stand relative to the amphitheatre opportunity on per caps at those other owned and operated venue types and how much upside there could be for investors in that area?\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah, we called out the theatres and clubs in the festivals this quarter because we knew that all you guys were going to want some data on what's going on with the fans on site. It being the first quarter, we don't really have amphitheatre data yet. So we were trying to use what data we could have on our other buildings, the theatres and clubs and festivals and then also to tie that back to any questions on costs. So that was the purpose of doing that was to give everybody comfort that we had still a very strong onsite consumer behavior. We don't have the date on amputates yet for the summer, but again, taking that as the leading indicator, we feel good about it. And we think there's a long runway. We talked in February about how we still think that there's 30%, 40%, 50% increase in our onsite spend, as we do a better job on some of the VIP and premium offers and do a better job of how it is we're marketing and selling upsell opportunities on site.\nBrandon Ross: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Stephen Glagola with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Glagola: Yes. Thanks for the question. Joe, on Latin America expansion, can we just unpack sort of the assessor guidance of delivering full year results in line with 2019 a bit more? I have, for my calculation, it's about like $500 million in revenue and $85 million in EBITDA. Is that correct? Is that sort of the baseline, and then typically you guys have been able to organically grow on your M&A 70%, 80% plus in the first couple years after consolidating that asset. Is that a similar type of growth that we should expect as analysts in our model?\nJoe Berchtold: So I guess, let me break into a couple of pieces there. So this year we expect both Mexico and Latin America broadly to do well. I think that it would be a very strong Latin America year relative to '19, even without OCESA, having OCESA only makes it all that much stronger. Your numbers aren't terribly far off. You have to kind of triangulate. They're within the general ballpark of what our numbers would be for '19 and therefore for '22. I don't think we're ready to start declaring the specifics of what OCESA is going to be in '23 or '24 yet. Give us a little time to get there with them and we'll keep you updated on it. But we do see Mexico and Latin America more broadly, certainly as one of our great growth drivers over the next few years.\nStephen Glagola: Okay. And then thanks for that.\nMichael Rapino: Both concerts -- both concerts and Ticketmaster, just to remind you, it's a huge upside in Mexico and ticketing and that we, we're only a 30% owner to Mexico. And now that we own it, we've already had the team down there. We're upgrading, they're still living on a green screen with not much feature functionality. So big upside secondary, etcetera, to add in Mexico and throughout Europe. So big growth opportunity, both in concerts and sponsorship and ticketing.\nStephen Glagola: Okay. Thanks Michael. And just one more on modeling questions for the rest of this year and guidance, you have these two, obviously the big Rock and Rio festival scheduled this year that had a outsize impact. I believe on the sponsorship segment in 2019. Just, how should we be thinking about that impact on the P&L this year? And then also, this is the fourth consecutive quarter now with ticketing AOI margins above 40%. Is this -- I believe this is probably just driven because most of the business in the US and UK right now, but is that something, we can expect throughout the remainder of the year, or do you expect that to moderate closer to the mid-thirties as the year progresses?\nJoe Berchtold: In terms of Rock and Rio, I think we've got that again this year. So I think it would be consistent with '19 in that regard and in terms of Ticketmaster you're right. It's continuing to do great. The margins are flowing through it is benefiting from the US waiting if you will right now, but with the cost taken out, we think it, this year probably be a high thirties margin when all is said and done, and you get some rebalancing with some of the international, which is a lower margin business.\nStephen Glagola: All right, appreciate it. Thank you, Joe. Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Katz: Hi afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. There was some earlier discussion around broad-based consumer trends, but I recall your investor event, there was a fair amount of talk about utilizing the premium end of pricing and platinum and other kinds of high end. Can you maybe unpack the price ranges on things and Joe, I know some of your comments were addressed more toward the average or even the value customer. Are you seeing any change at all, positive or negative at the high end?\nJoe Berchtold: No, absolutely. The over the overall double-digit increase is driven by the high end across our major stadiums arenas. Amphitheatres, I think we've probably about doubled the number of tickets to go into what we call the platinum or market based pricing. So more than anything else is probably more of the tickets are getting market priced or closer to market priced, and then depending on the artist than the show, yes, it's also flexing upward from where it would've been historically, as we try to get closer to the true market price. Even as doing this, you can tell by our commentary about the size, growth of the secondary we've helped move $500 million to the artist this year, but I think the secondary has grown more on our tickets. So it's not that we're out there capturing every penny even while getting these increases this year, but we're continuing to try to move in that direction.\nDavid Katz: Understood. And if I may follow up in a different direction it's the first time probably in 2.5 years that we would even raise it. But how are you thinking about leverage and cap structure and how much cash versus how much debt. Is that, I see a pattern going back a number of years, but any change in how you might think about that going forward?\nJoe Berchtold: Well, I think one of the things that gives us a lot of comfort is that over 85% of our debt is fixed rate. So we're sitting at 4.3% in a pretty fixed debt structure with short-term increases having a fairly limited impact on us. So I think we're feeling fine about our about our total debt level. Our total coverage based on our AOI, I think continues to be very robust and we don't have any concerns about being able to grow in from an AOI standpoint and into our debt.\nDavid Katz: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thanks. Good afternoon. I have two questions. First, just on -- back on Ticketmaster, I think you guys talked about or had in the release 7 million new tickets one in the quarter, 14 last year. It's really strong in terms of adding new business. Can you talk a little bit about, any context to what kind of business you're adding, US versus international, venue type and what's driving that and whether you're seeing any increased competitive behaviour. We sort of hear about competition on the primary side, including on price, but it doesn't seem like it's affecting Ticketmaster share gains at all. So just be interested in some more color around the success there and whether this taste can keep up.\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah. I think the 7 million story is the same as the 17 million story. When you're at this scale, it's everything. International has been very strong, which has been driven by the dramatic improvements in the international product that we've had as we move to a single integrated platform. And that has further differentiated us, particularly internationally, relative to where we've been. At the same time, we've had continued success in the US and many of the discussions are product driven. The confidence that working with Ticketmaster, you're only going to have the best enterprise products in the best marketplace today, but the level of investment that we're making and the scale of the dollars being spent to build new product is unparalleled in its commitment to continuing to enhance for the teams and the artists and the fans, what their experience is gonna be. You always have price pressure, you have price competition and everything. There's no new news there. That's what you always have. It's always your job as a company to figure out how do I continue to create my product so that it's differentiated so that it reduces the price. And then how do I continue to get more efficient and make money in other ways off my flywheel so that overall my aggregate economics continue to improve, nothing new there.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Got it. And then just on back on the macro, I know everyone's concern given some of the other earnings results we've seen in this quarter. Your sponsorship business, Joe, I think it's largely sort of longer term contracts. I think you might have some, kind of display advertising in there. We've heard some of the big digital ad players that businesses have softened here in the second quarter. Can you just remind us how long duration that business is for you guys and if you're seeing any signs of softening in any part of your sponsorship business has given what we've heard from other companies. Thank you.\nJoe Berchtold: We're not seeing any signs of softening. Michael gave you some of the numbers on these -- on the large relationships that we have, the million dollar plus relationships that have been our focus on growing the number of those relationships, the breadth of assets that we provide to them, and just how much of our sponsorship base they represent. So they're coming at it from multiyear, multi-asset saying we want to be present at the festival at the amphitheatre. We also are going to have an online presence. It's a much higher level of integration than just a simple ad by with some of the other players out there. So we're not seeing that impact at all.\nMichael Rapino: And, Ben, just to jump in also on, I know you had brought it up also, our no-show rates I know that's always been some rumour go out there, but as we stated in our release, we're seeing no challenges at all. People are showing up to the shows. We are showing similar to 2018, '19, your regular low digit no-show rate of people that don't make it to the show. But back to normal, people come and drum to those shows no issues at all in terms of showing up.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Yep. I saw that you, Michael.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ryan Sundby with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nRyan Sundby: Hey guys. Thanks for the question. You mentioned 20 new Venues in the pipeline and 38 new festivals, I guess, starting on the, the festival side is something coming from OCESA. How many of these are, or maybe first time and were you able to pick up a, a large number here of festivals that struggle during COVID and then on the venue side, how should we think about the, the timing of those opening up and maybe the size in terms of overall staying capacity that could add.\nMichael Rapino: On the festival side, we, we have a, a few great festival companies in Europe and America. And part of the success of live nation has been about organic growth, continuing to grow the business finding you know, new market shares, new global entry points and festivals being a big part of regenerating our business. So we're always looking to add every year and let our festival companies launch new ideas. And this year we've had some great success. One of our young companies, C3, it's been in business with a strong festival promoter, Jeff Shoeman. We launched a, when we were, when we were young festival out of Vegas, we hoped to sell 40,000 tickets. We sold over 160,000 tickets in Vegas; so huge success in a brand new festival. So we love those stories. We encourage all of our festival entrepreneurs to take swings every year. We usually have a 50% success rate. Some of those go on to be great brands. Some you fail fast to move on. So 38 was a indicator. I'll let you know, we have a large, a hundred plus portfolio of festivals around the world, like amphitheater and Venues. There are high margin business because of sponsorship, food, and beverage. And not only do we look to acquire and bolt on when we can, but we are a big machine of organically creating new festivals that the majority of our growth and this year we're back to full speed on letting our entrepreneurs go swing and create some new revenue for us.\nRyan Sundby: Great. How about here Venues?\nMichael Rapino: Joe? Joe can jump in. It's a similar story. We're just starting, continuing, I mean, Venues would be one that we didn't really slow-down during COVID because they have a longer lead time. So if you, you look at our venue nation division that we highlighted in the investor day and kind of our continued focus around our 300 plus Venues that we operate around the world. I think we said we have probably 75 in the pipe and we annually open up probably about 20 new festivals around the world. So we're on plan, continuing to move on that aggressive front to continue expand on a global basis club theatre and a theatre. We just opened a beautiful arena in Austin last week to record sales, record results proud of that one and more to come. So continued opening and phasing throughout the years we've been doing historically.\nRyan Sundby: Great. And then it sounded like 72% of tickets were, were digital and Q1 versus 33% in, '19. I know most of the attendance this quarter though came from the U.S. and the UK, which I assume led the, the digital rollout. So I guess how should we think about digital penetration moving forward? And I maybe, can you talk a little bigger picture if you, if you're starting to act on, on that data that you're collecting?\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah, I you're right. It's helped a little bit. I still think we end the year probably around 80% globally. A lot of this has to do with not just the infrastructure on our end, but rolling out the access control new systems that have to get deployed for each of these Venues and doing that on a global basis, just with some of the supply chain in terms of getting those pieces in place. It'll take a little bit of time, but we're making great progress and we're already acting on the data. Just saw some of the information yesterday, looking at how we're using it for more effectively targeting the marketing. So when you, your email from live nation on what concerts, it's much more tailored to you than it was in 2019 as a result, the click through rates and the buy rates are up substantially. And then as we get into the summer, and we have people going to our operated amphitheater as our operated festivals, we expect that we'll be able to use that digital connection to more effectively market upsell connect sponsors with fans. So we'll see all of that activity beginning in much more earnest in the in this year.\nJoe Berchtold: Great. Hear, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matthew Hargan with Benchmark. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Hargan: Thank you. Two conceptual questions, firstly the end  it feels like it's a nice digital memorabilia compliment in experience versus something that someone buys it at Sotheby's and it's right in your wheelhouse. You know, what innovation are you seeing with the NBA this season in the NFL? And there's a way to really personalize it even more and have more variety? And then secondly, at your investor today, you talked a lot about hyper slicing nomenclature sounds very Elon Musk, does that also have some affectability to Mexico with ESSA and even some of the European markets? I know you talked about that really keeping the U.S. around 40% of the TA, but some of those other larger markets, it seemed like you could apply that concept of local act acts over a period of time? Thank you.\nMichael Rapino: Yeah. On the NFT, I think I think we're deep into discussions and product development and testing. Like all of the leagues are doing, we have a, a dual a lens. If you want to call it on Ticketmaster side, we are working in hand in tandem with the NFL and NBA on minting, all of the tickets. We did all the super bowl tickets through Ticketmaster that were NFT souvenirs. We're doing it for the teams. We've been working with mark Cuban and others. So on the Ticketmaster side, we're getting to see all of the best versions of what some sports teams and brands are doing with NFTs. On the concert side, we've worked on our artist management division with our artists and seen some of the versions that they're looking at, whether it's in the metaverse, whether it's a fortnight or whether it's a song on an NFT. So we're looking and learning on that side and on the live nation side the NFC is really just an extension of what someone mentioned earlier, the digital ticket. I mean, the, the most important thing for us overall is to have identity tied to the ticket. So, so moving from a PDF ticket where we knew nobody, it had no contract, it had no rights, it had no carry on value, moving to a block-chain, digital NFT ticket in general that just opens up the doors to first having identity tied to the ticket. So we can have a better conversation with you. And we think NFT to that ticket, we can create a community of value and look at and ways to add value to you on an ongoing basis if you've opened up and been part of the live ticket stub NFT today. So we're we think it's great opportunity to add more value to the relationship with that purchaser. And we're going to, we're going to keep experiment ideas on that front. The second question, I, I didn't quite even I didn't hear it well enough. Yeah. Joe and jump in on you.\nJoe Berchtold: I'm Sorry. On the hyperly thing. No, I got it. I got it. Yeah. So on the hyper local strategy that we've been talking about absolutely applies in throughout Europe, throughout Mexico, Latin America, all of the markets in we're going into each country, we're establishing a beachhead, getting to some scale, leveraging that scale to then say, what are each of the specific markets that we can go to and expand the operation. So that's a core part. Somebody was talking earlier how we, when we make the acquisition, we grow it substantially. Well, our, our, with Germany, when we grew in, they were operating in two cities and then selling off the con the concert in all the other cities that there are 10, 12 cities in Germany where you could easily have the population to route your chore through. So that became the focus and that's how we grew that business. So we'll be following that playbook globally. It is a large part of when you look at the Tam and why the Tam is so large, it's because all of that demand exists through so many different markets, not just the ones where we're historically bringing shows to. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your final question comes from Barton Crockett with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nBarton Crockett: Okay, great. Thank you for taking the question. You know, I wanted to ask a little bit about this 60 tour marker booked already for 2023, which is you know, sounds compelling, but, but it'd be great to have a little bit more context. And I was wondering if this might kind of get at it. Can you give us a sense of at this time of 2019, how many tours, if any, did you have already booked for 2021? That might be one way to look at it. And secondarily if you've got 60 tours already booked for 2023, how many do you have booked right now for 2022?\nMichael Rapino: I, I think I can give you generalities to make you feel good that '23 going to look good. I mean, that's obviously what you're, you're trying to get at. So I think in, if you look at '20 to your point of how many did we have booked, or how many would we be reviewing for, for, for a historic year at this time period, we would, we would be about double where, where a historic marker would be if you want to use that as a, as a basic line. So, 60 would be a, a fabulous number to be talking about this time of year for a, for a next year activity. So that's, that kind of gives you a kind of a robust feeling of what's what '23 will look to be.\nBarton Crockett: Okay. And switch gears a little bit on the recession question. You know, back in the, the last kind of the great recession. Oh, 8 or 9 or 10 were concerts in your experience at live nation, more, a lagging indicator or a leading indicator, I would guess lagging. And so if there is a recession impact, you might be the last to feel it, but I was wondering if you had any thoughts about that?\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah, it was a lagging indicator. It didn't hit till 2010. We had it for one summer. And I think we had a lot less data on the market then, than we have now, I talked about the secondary market and how that provides such great transparency today into the specific supply demand dynamics, the pricing, not just in the front of the house, but through the whole building. We didn't have that back then. So we were making a lot of decisions, a lot more blindly. So we have better information. We're set up to be much more nimble in terms of how we respond to that information. And again, that was the one year out of not just the last recession, but if you look over the past 30 years at a handful of different recessions, it was the one year when there was any\nOperator: Decline in our business.\nBarton Crockett: Okay. That's great. Thank you,\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question and answer session, and I'd like to turn a call back to Mr. Joe behold and Michael Rapino for closing remarks.\nMichael Rapino: All right, everybody. Thank you. Have a great summer. We'll talk soon.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joe Berchtold",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael and good afternoon, everyone. Given the unique situation in 2020 and 2021, Q1 of 2019 is the best comparison for us in terms of understanding our operations and key performance indicators. So while I will provide some commentary around our results relative to Q1 of 2021, most of our focus will be relative to 2019. Overall, our AOI of $209 million for the quarter was $361 million better than 2021, led by an improvement of $269 million in ticketing, $66 million in sponsorship and $26 million in concerts. This was our highest Q1 AOI ever exceeding Q1 of 2019 by $94 million, which had been our previous record first quarter. Let me give a bit more color on each division. Then I will give you more on 2022 leading indicators. First ticketing was again the star of the quarter delivering $206 million in AOI, making it the second best quarter ever for ticketing and more than doubling the Q1 2019 AOI results of a $100 million. The first quarter of 2021 was heavily impacted by the pandemic resulting in an AOI loss of $63 million. Ticketing was successful across the board. Let me give a few key statistics for the quarter. Our growth came from both primary and secondary ticketing with transacted GTV, excluding refunds up 33% and 106% respectively. Transacted ticket volume, excluding refunds were 63 million tickets, our fourth highest quarter ever, and 7 million tickets higher than Q1 of 2019. Transacted ticketing GTV excluding refunds was $6.3 billion, our second highest quarter ever after Q4 of 2021 and 39% higher than Q1 2019. This was driven by concerts and sporting events whose GTV were up 49% and 73% respectively relative to Q1 2019. A continued shift toward more market-based pricing help grow our GTV levels with average primary ticket prices up double-digits for the first quarter, relative to Q1 2019. And in resale, our average price increased 18% while our overall resale GTV doubled compared to the first quarter of 2019, indicating that demand for the top seats across all live events continues to outpace efforts by sports teams, artists, and others, to capture more of the full value from their events. As the first effectively normal Q1 since 2019, we are seeing that digital tickets have now become the norm across live events with the NFL and NBA leading the way with 96% of fans using digital tickets to enter games up from 53% in Q1 of 2019. More broadly, 72% of our tickets globally were digital in Q1 of 2022, relative to 33% in Q1 2019. With this level of digital adoption, we can now accelerate our efforts to foster our direct fan relationships this year and into 2023. Next, sponsorship continued to ramp up with the reopening of Venues and expanded online opportunities. As a result, 2022 Q1 sponsorship and advertising AOI of $70 million grew by 75% relative to 2019 Q1 AOI of $40 million. This strength comes across both onsite and online each delivering record Q1 AOI. The growth versus 2019 was driven by expansion of our online business, new festivals that launched in the quarter and the addition of O's brand partners. Finally, in concerts, our AOI was a loss of $49 million, which compares to a loss of $74 million in Q1 of 2021 and positive AOI of $5 million in Q1 of 2019. As we indicated on the last call, we planned for fewer arena tours in Q1 this year, which typically drives our first quarter performance, resulting in concert seasonality that will be even more Q2 and Q3 driven this year than has historically been the case. In the quarter, we had nearly 11 million fans attend 6,600 events continuing to be led by the US and the UK, which accounted for almost 80% of these fans. In comparison, Q1 of 2019 had 15 million fans and 8,200 shows when all of our markets and all venue types were fully open. For ticket sales through late April for shows playing off this year, our average ticket price was up double digits relative to the first quarter of 2019, again mainly driven by demand for the best seats. At the same time, our average entry price remains less than $35 overall and less than $30 for amphitheatre and club shows. Michael mentioned that no-how rates were back to pre-COVID levels. So I wanted to give a few more specifics to hopefully set the record straight. Looking at the full year through mid-April for the US, our no-show rates were the same or better than the same period for 2019. For arenas, they were 1% better for amphitheatres, they were 4% better, for theaters and clubs, they were on par and all up, we are 2% better. We haven't had enough volume on other outdoor events to have meaningful metrics yet, but generally those Venues had strong re-openings last summer and so we don't expect any issues there and used there. In general, the US was ahead of the rest of the world, but the UK is now fully backed to pre-pandemic, no-show rates as well and we have not seen any evidence in any markets of any long-term impact on our shows. Michael gave you the top line on our first quarter average revenue per fan growth up 30% for both theaters and clubs and festivals. For theaters and clubs, key drivers include onsite concessions and upsells and for festivals, the growth was heavily driven by onsite concessions and increased VIP purchases. All indicators have continued strong fans spending as they look to make the most of going to the show. Finally, COVID continues to have less and less impact on our concert schedule and by March in the US, we cancelled only around 1% of our planned concerts. As we look to the remainder of 2022, looking at our leading indicators through the end of April 1, confirmed show bookings are up over 40% overall and up double-digits for each amphitheatres, arenas, stadiums and festivals. Second, ticketing has sold 130 million fee bearing tickets for events this year up 26% from this point in 2019, of these, 88 million tickets over concert events, which is 40% higher than 2019. Related to this, we have $3.5 billion in event-related deferred revenue, almost twice the level of Q1 2019. These are largely tickets that have been sold by Ticketmaster for Live Nation concerts, but the revenue in AOI hasn't flowed through yet and will do so over the course of this year, as events happen. On the sponsorship side, commitments are up double-digits from this point in 2019 and overall we have more than 90% of our plan sponsorship net revenue for 2022 set. On the cost side, we're obviously tracking closely cost increases associated both with labor and in general, with supply chain challenges and inflation. These costs tend to hit us primarily in the Venues we operate; amphitheatres, theaters and clubs and festivals. For amphitheatres and theaters and clubs, labor is the largest factor given we have our Venues in place. Across this entire fan base, we expect our variable cost per fan, excluding talent to increase by $2 to $2.50 relative to 2019. This remains well below our average revenue per fan growth and so we still expect to grow average per fan profitability across our operated Venues this year. Festivals have a broader range of costs given the wider set of equipment and services involved in building these events. Current projections are that variable costs per fan excluding talent will be up 7% this year, which is well below our expected increase in ticket revenue per fan. Helping offset all these costs is the $200 million cost reduction exercise that we executed last year, which remains well in place. A few other points on 2022, we now expect OCESA will deliver full year results in line with 2019 levels as Mexico is fully active with most of their AOI flowing through our sponsorship and ticketing divisions. In light of the OCESA acquisition, we wanna provide more guidance on a few mine items below AOI, which impact our earnings per share calculation. First on depreciation and amortization, we expect the combination of these accounts to be roughly in line with 2019. The addition of OCESA is offset by the impacts of our reduced investment in CapEx and M&A over the past two years. With the acquisition of OCESA and anticipated strong performance of our festivals, many of which are joined ventures, we expect non-controlling interest expense will be roughly double 2019 levels. We are projecting increasing to be about $150 million this year. Again, the increase compared to 2019 is largely attributable to the OCESA acquisition. As a result of the additional financing opportunities over the past two years, our interest expense is now roughly $70 million per quarter. Finally, in comparison to 2019, we expect income tax expense will grow in line with our AOI growth. In anticipation and the growth opportunities ahead of us this year, we continue to expect 2022 capital expenditures to be approximately $375 million with two thirds of this spent on revenue generating projects. We generated $89 million of adjusted free cash flow this quarter and expect free cash flow conversion from AOI to be back in the fifties for the full year. We ended Q1 with $1.9 billion of available liquidity between free cash and untapped revolver capacity, giving us sufficient flexibility to invest in growth. We are comfortable with our leverage with over 85% of our debt at a fixed rate and our average cost of debt is roughly 4.3% positioning as well in this interest rate environment. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator? Hey David, this is Joe I'll take it. And I think the questions are related. Start with the NFL. We entered the partnership with the NFL four years ago, I guess, and that relationship was really technology driven and it was a mutual strategy of figuring out how do we shift the industry to digital ticketing? How do we understand identity-enabled relationships with the fans, for the leagues, for the teams as well as for Ticketmaster and that's proven to be very successful and obviously coming out of COVID not surprisingly, the NFL said, what's the next technology agenda. We worked with them on deploying NFTs and they said, this is all great, better to talk now about linking back up for the next five years. So we know we can work together and figure out what's the next technology unlocked. How do we continue to use technology is really it's the core of the relationship or the starting point of the relationship with the fans. So that's what led to the renewal. We're excited about it. We think the NFL's been a great partner and we'll continue to be. So naturally as you do that, we continue at Ticketmaster to get smarter and smarter about the fan as well. That lets us continue to use our alignment and our mutual interest with the teams and the league in terms of driving Ticketmaster share in the secondary. So we're taking all the data we have, all the information we're working with them on all of their assets to help acquire customers, to use all the season ticket holder inventory, to continue to drive our share and provide a great marketplace, a great experience for fans to be buying those tickets. So combination of all of those has led to increasing share which is as Michael talked about part of how we've doubled secondary in the first quarter relative to 2019. Yeah, I think this is Joe. I think all of the data points that we're seeing continue to be very strong. Look at our concert ticket sales as we look in March and April, each of those months the ticket sales were up 20% plus relative to 2019. So through March and April, I think we've seen some of these pressures, the gas and so on for a few months now. So not just a few weeks, so we've seen no impact at all on the concert ticket sales. We talked about the pricing, seeing no impact on the take rate of those tickets and the onsite spending the EFs again seeing those up substantially relative to 2019. So no impact there. So from all the different angles that we've looked at it, we have not seen any pullback in consumer behavior. I think that this continues to be part of people want to get out, have a social life, to spend on experiences taking money away from spending on goods. And a lot of what we do is we spoke to the $35 overall average entry price for a ticket or $30 for clubs and amphitheatre. It continues to be a very affordable night out for those that need to be most conscious of that. Well, it is creating new ad categories, right? We talked about that in the technology space, in the FinTech space, throughout the whole purchase path integration, all of that is creating new categories and that's, what's driving even this year a lot of the growth in the sponsorship business. Michael talked very explicitly about what you're seeing on site. Two great examples of how technology's being used to enhance the live experience with Verizon, putting in the infrastructure with the 5G connectivity and with snap as a great product development, product design organization, coming up with some ways to use their products and augmented reality to enhance the onsite experience. So really on the onsite piece, this is all about how do you make a better and better fan experience? And we've got great brands, partners that we work with that are looking to do more and more to make that possible and then as we continue to work on the Ticketmaster marketplace, tie that in with the increased data that we have from the digital ticketing that we were just talking about, how do we create more tailored ad units and make more opportunities for more sponsors to connect with those fans as well. Sure. Brandon, This is Joe. Oh, go ahead. Yeah. And just to build on that first is we now have a level of information that is very -- we didn't have even 10 years ago and almost no industry has called the secondary market. So to Michael's point on pricing flexibility, we have the benefit of knowing real time, what is market pricing and so on one level, you can think that billion dollars plus of price arbitrage that exists on our tickets, that's the first wall of defense in any recessionary environment that pricing comes out first before our pricing's even impacted. And we have a great read on what is the supply that dynamic to be adjusting as we go along. And then along with that, again, you have, again, the macros of the shift of spend from experience -- from goods to experiences, which is continuing. You have the wealth built up and the biggest gains in terms of the income with a lower quartile. So you've got good revenue there. Still, you've got affordable entry prices that we've talked about on the tickets. So we continue to think that as long as we stay focused on what is the value perceived by the fan, stay aligned with that. We'll be able to bring the acts out and sell the tickets. Yeah, we called out the theatres and clubs in the festivals this quarter because we knew that all you guys were going to want some data on what's going on with the fans on site. It being the first quarter, we don't really have amphitheatre data yet. So we were trying to use what data we could have on our other buildings, the theatres and clubs and festivals and then also to tie that back to any questions on costs. So that was the purpose of doing that was to give everybody comfort that we had still a very strong onsite consumer behavior. We don't have the date on amputates yet for the summer, but again, taking that as the leading indicator, we feel good about it. And we think there's a long runway. We talked in February about how we still think that there's 30%, 40%, 50% increase in our onsite spend, as we do a better job on some of the VIP and premium offers and do a better job of how it is we're marketing and selling upsell opportunities on site. So I guess, let me break into a couple of pieces there. So this year we expect both Mexico and Latin America broadly to do well. I think that it would be a very strong Latin America year relative to '19, even without OCESA, having OCESA only makes it all that much stronger. Your numbers aren't terribly far off. You have to kind of triangulate. They're within the general ballpark of what our numbers would be for '19 and therefore for '22. I don't think we're ready to start declaring the specifics of what OCESA is going to be in '23 or '24 yet. Give us a little time to get there with them and we'll keep you updated on it. But we do see Mexico and Latin America more broadly, certainly as one of our great growth drivers over the next few years. In terms of Rock and Rio, I think we've got that again this year. So I think it would be consistent with '19 in that regard and in terms of Ticketmaster you're right. It's continuing to do great. The margins are flowing through it is benefiting from the US waiting if you will right now, but with the cost taken out, we think it, this year probably be a high thirties margin when all is said and done, and you get some rebalancing with some of the international, which is a lower margin business. No, absolutely. The over the overall double-digit increase is driven by the high end across our major stadiums arenas. Amphitheatres, I think we've probably about doubled the number of tickets to go into what we call the platinum or market based pricing. So more than anything else is probably more of the tickets are getting market priced or closer to market priced, and then depending on the artist than the show, yes, it's also flexing upward from where it would've been historically, as we try to get closer to the true market price. Even as doing this, you can tell by our commentary about the size, growth of the secondary we've helped move $500 million to the artist this year, but I think the secondary has grown more on our tickets. So it's not that we're out there capturing every penny even while getting these increases this year, but we're continuing to try to move in that direction. Well, I think one of the things that gives us a lot of comfort is that over 85% of our debt is fixed rate. So we're sitting at 4.3% in a pretty fixed debt structure with short-term increases having a fairly limited impact on us. So I think we're feeling fine about our about our total debt level. Our total coverage based on our AOI, I think continues to be very robust and we don't have any concerns about being able to grow in from an AOI standpoint and into our debt. Yeah. I think the 7 million story is the same as the 17 million story. When you're at this scale, it's everything. International has been very strong, which has been driven by the dramatic improvements in the international product that we've had as we move to a single integrated platform. And that has further differentiated us, particularly internationally, relative to where we've been. At the same time, we've had continued success in the US and many of the discussions are product driven. The confidence that working with Ticketmaster, you're only going to have the best enterprise products in the best marketplace today, but the level of investment that we're making and the scale of the dollars being spent to build new product is unparalleled in its commitment to continuing to enhance for the teams and the artists and the fans, what their experience is gonna be. You always have price pressure, you have price competition and everything. There's no new news there. That's what you always have. It's always your job as a company to figure out how do I continue to create my product so that it's differentiated so that it reduces the price. And then how do I continue to get more efficient and make money in other ways off my flywheel so that overall my aggregate economics continue to improve, nothing new there. We're not seeing any signs of softening. Michael gave you some of the numbers on these -- on the large relationships that we have, the million dollar plus relationships that have been our focus on growing the number of those relationships, the breadth of assets that we provide to them, and just how much of our sponsorship base they represent. So they're coming at it from multiyear, multi-asset saying we want to be present at the festival at the amphitheatre. We also are going to have an online presence. It's a much higher level of integration than just a simple ad by with some of the other players out there. So we're not seeing that impact at all. Yeah, I you're right. It's helped a little bit. I still think we end the year probably around 80% globally. A lot of this has to do with not just the infrastructure on our end, but rolling out the access control new systems that have to get deployed for each of these Venues and doing that on a global basis, just with some of the supply chain in terms of getting those pieces in place. It'll take a little bit of time, but we're making great progress and we're already acting on the data. Just saw some of the information yesterday, looking at how we're using it for more effectively targeting the marketing. So when you, your email from live nation on what concerts, it's much more tailored to you than it was in 2019 as a result, the click through rates and the buy rates are up substantially. And then as we get into the summer, and we have people going to our operated amphitheater as our operated festivals, we expect that we'll be able to use that digital connection to more effectively market upsell connect sponsors with fans. So we'll see all of that activity beginning in much more earnest in the in this year. Great. Hear, thank you. I'm Sorry. On the hyperly thing. No, I got it. I got it. Yeah. So on the hyper local strategy that we've been talking about absolutely applies in throughout Europe, throughout Mexico, Latin America, all of the markets in we're going into each country, we're establishing a beachhead, getting to some scale, leveraging that scale to then say, what are each of the specific markets that we can go to and expand the operation. So that's a core part. Somebody was talking earlier how we, when we make the acquisition, we grow it substantially. Well, our, our, with Germany, when we grew in, they were operating in two cities and then selling off the con the concert in all the other cities that there are 10, 12 cities in Germany where you could easily have the population to route your chore through. So that became the focus and that's how we grew that business. So we'll be following that playbook globally. It is a large part of when you look at the Tam and why the Tam is so large, it's because all of that demand exists through so many different markets, not just the ones where we're historically bringing shows to. Great. Thank you. Yeah, it was a lagging indicator. It didn't hit till 2010. We had it for one summer. And I think we had a lot less data on the market then, than we have now, I talked about the secondary market and how that provides such great transparency today into the specific supply demand dynamics, the pricing, not just in the front of the house, but through the whole building. We didn't have that back then. So we were making a lot of decisions, a lot more blindly. So we have better information. We're set up to be much more nimble in terms of how we respond to that information. And again, that was the one year out of not just the last recession, but if you look over the past 30 years at a handful of different recessions, it was the one year when there was any"

            "name": "Michael Rapino",
            "content": "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Momentum has picked up for all of our businesses over the course of the first quarter. And as a result, we have delivered financial performance that greatly surpassed our previous expectations with AOI of $209 million. Artists are back on the road and fan demand has never been stronger. The reflection of live events remain a clear priority for consumers as our social lives restart. Ticket buying serves as a leading indicator to our overall business. Ticketmaster's strong first quarter performance drove the company's overall profitability and shows how well our concert and sponsorship businesses are positioned to deliver record results this year. Despite some markets taking longer to reopen, the quarter was our second highest ever we transacted GTV, excluding refunds, trailing only Q4 2021 with March being our highest transacted GTV month ever. In primary ticketing, we're now benefiting from the 17 million new fee-bearing tickets we gained in 2021, which helped us drive transacted GTV for the quarter up 33% relative to 2019. This quarter was also added 7 million new additional tickets through new contracts with Venues as well as content creators, setting us up for ongoing growth this year and into 2023. Our secondary ticketing GTV growth was even higher up 106% relative to 2019 driven largely by average retail ticket price up 20% relative to 2019 and a tremendous fan demand pushed up the market pricing, Ticketmaster, gaining additional market share by effectively leveraging its team and league partnerships across NFL, NBA and other sporting events. And the market continued growing at double-digit pace, demonstrating high demand for live events, as well as how much runway there is for continued pricing, efficiently. Fan demand and signing of new contracts accelerated even faster than expected this quarter, reinforcing the Ticketmaster as the enterprise platform for choice of teams, artists and content creators, and continuing to be the most effective fan marketplace. Our sponsorship activity fully returned in Q1, delivering financial results that well exceeded 2019. We're seeing growth across a number of dimensions, expansion of existing relationships, new categories expanding our breadth to partners and new ad units being created both onsite and online. The number of strategic sponsors that generated over $1 million of revenue per year has risen by almost 30% since 2019. With our committed span up 70% and accounting for 80% of our total sponsorship revenue, about 60% of this growth has come from three categories of particular priority over the past two years; technology, telecom and purchase path integration, which has collectively more than doubled their sponsorships since 2019. Much of our focus with brand partners is how we collectively elevate the fan experience. We've had great success with this in recent years. And so far this year through our partnership with Verizon, we started powering our Venues with cutting edge 5G connectivity and are launching initiative with Snap to give artists augmented reality capabilities at shows and festivals. At this point, sponsorship sales are up double digits relative to 2019, and we have a solid 90% of our planned sponsored for the year, positioning us for continued strong financial performance. The concert division, all leading indicators, point to double-digit growth and fan attendance at our concerts relative to 2019. Approximately 11 million fans attended our shows in the first quarter compared to 15 million fans in 2019. This was expected as we planned for limited concert activity in the early months of the year to allow for markets to open. But more importantly, we continue to build our flywheel with over 70 million tickets now sold for shows in 2022, up to 36 million, compared to 2019 and committed show count is up 44% through the end of April, relative to 19%, setting us up for continued ticket sales over the year. We continue to see the fans are showing up for the concerts they have tickets for, with attendance rates in the US across all venue types at 2019 levels with no shows generally in the low mid-single digits. The industry continues to embrace market-based pricing, particularly on the best tickets, shifting $500 million to artists for shows this year, resulting from a double-digit increase in ticket pricing and reducing the price arbitrage in the secondary market. At the same time in the US, the average entry level price to get in and enjoy the show remains under $35, approachable for almost all fans. Early reads on consumer spending on our shows across the US and UK also indicate fans continue their spending when they get to the show. We had two million fans at 10 shows at our theaters and clubs in the first quarter with average per fan revenue up 30% relative to 2019. And we've had four festivals over the past few months to lean over 300,000 fans with average per fan revenue up 30% also. Looking ahead to the summer and the rest of the year, we remain optimistic that we are just getting going as all leading indicators reinforce record activity levels and financial results. Ticket sales were at record levels in Q1 with momentum building over February and March. We sold almost 20 million more tickets to our concerts this year in this point in time in 2019, with large number of tours still to go on sale and concert fans are showing no sign of slowing down. They're paying for the best tickets, attending the shows and spending more on site as they create lifetime memories. We're continuing to build Venue Nation, our platform of operated Venues with a pipeline of 20 Venues, including the recently open Moody Center in Austin, in addition to adding 38 more festivals this year. Sponsors are looking to spend more this year on live entertainment than ever and Live Nation's scale and global platform is making us the partner of choice. While the US and UK have driven much of our activity over the past year, the rest of the world is now rapidly opening up. Assess this financial performance for the quarter, exceeded its 2019 results and both Latin America and Western Europe are expected to have record attendance for our concerts this year. I continue to expect this just to be the start of our run, the global addressable markets for concerts, ticketing and sponsorship, all provide a long runway for continued growth. We have over 60 tours already under discussion for 2023, our earliest indicators of next year in great positioning for ongoing growth. With that, I'll turn it over to Joe. Yeah, thank you. The '23 is really no backlog. '22 is the year where we would've flushed out any reschedule tours from 2019 '21, wherever. So 2023 is kind of if you want to call almost back to business and yes, it's a very vibrant pipe. I think we said at the Investor Date, if you want to kind of scale back and look at the next five years, you can kind of look at what we did going into '19, where we looked at the industry growing at almost 10% a year on a compounded basis. We think the industry is going to be doing that again. It's back to full growth, high quality growth sector industry and we think we tend to outperform the industry. So we look at '23 will be a, if you want to call it a record year coming off of '22, and we think we're in for multiple record years of growth. I was -- I'll start and then Joe and jump in. What we always think is one of the great advantages of our business is the pricing is variable, right? So there is no set cost of good. The cost of good is determined by the artist if they go on the road and they're variable. So that makes our product something that can move around on pricing, whether it's taking advantage of the front row pricing, that's under-priced or moving the total ticket price down in the back end of the house or reducing the overall price of the ticket to meet the market and the demand. So historically this is an industry that's been fairly recession proof. It's still, as we've seen, this is still one of the top three entertainment choices for consumer, but the most affordable. So you may not in a recession take that trip. You may not have a large out a purchase of a dishwasher, but you will still go down to amphitheatre or the club or the theater and have a great adventure and a night out for the value. So we have always seen historically over time, the consumer still looks at the concert as a high value item that even during the recession, if there was a pullback, this is something they still can afford to do. And it's actually a great alternative to a higher priced, maybe travel package. So one, we think it is a -- still a much a very affordable option for consumers and pricing will continue to be something that we can adjust. If we see any pullback, artists will always have one motive the same as ours, fill the house, get everyone in the house. So right up until the hour of the show, we always look at variable and dynamic pricing options to say, how do we get the house full. Joe? Both concerts -- both concerts and Ticketmaster, just to remind you, it's a huge upside in Mexico and ticketing and that we, we're only a 30% owner to Mexico. And now that we own it, we've already had the team down there. We're upgrading, they're still living on a green screen with not much feature functionality. So big upside secondary, etcetera, to add in Mexico and throughout Europe. So big growth opportunity, both in concerts and sponsorship and ticketing. And, Ben, just to jump in also on, I know you had brought it up also, our no-show rates I know that's always been some rumour go out there, but as we stated in our release, we're seeing no challenges at all. People are showing up to the shows. We are showing similar to 2018, '19, your regular low digit no-show rate of people that don't make it to the show. But back to normal, people come and drum to those shows no issues at all in terms of showing up. On the festival side, we, we have a, a few great festival companies in Europe and America. And part of the success of live nation has been about organic growth, continuing to grow the business finding you know, new market shares, new global entry points and festivals being a big part of regenerating our business. So we're always looking to add every year and let our festival companies launch new ideas. And this year we've had some great success. One of our young companies, C3, it's been in business with a strong festival promoter, Jeff Shoeman. We launched a, when we were, when we were young festival out of Vegas, we hoped to sell 40,000 tickets. We sold over 160,000 tickets in Vegas; so huge success in a brand new festival. So we love those stories. We encourage all of our festival entrepreneurs to take swings every year. We usually have a 50% success rate. Some of those go on to be great brands. Some you fail fast to move on. So 38 was a indicator. I'll let you know, we have a large, a hundred plus portfolio of festivals around the world, like amphitheater and Venues. There are high margin business because of sponsorship, food, and beverage. And not only do we look to acquire and bolt on when we can, but we are a big machine of organically creating new festivals that the majority of our growth and this year we're back to full speed on letting our entrepreneurs go swing and create some new revenue for us. Joe? Joe can jump in. It's a similar story. We're just starting, continuing, I mean, Venues would be one that we didn't really slow-down during COVID because they have a longer lead time. So if you, you look at our venue nation division that we highlighted in the investor day and kind of our continued focus around our 300 plus Venues that we operate around the world. I think we said we have probably 75 in the pipe and we annually open up probably about 20 new festivals around the world. So we're on plan, continuing to move on that aggressive front to continue expand on a global basis club theatre and a theatre. We just opened a beautiful arena in Austin last week to record sales, record results proud of that one and more to come. So continued opening and phasing throughout the years we've been doing historically. Yeah. On the NFT, I think I think we're deep into discussions and product development and testing. Like all of the leagues are doing, we have a, a dual a lens. If you want to call it on Ticketmaster side, we are working in hand in tandem with the NFL and NBA on minting, all of the tickets. We did all the super bowl tickets through Ticketmaster that were NFT souvenirs. We're doing it for the teams. We've been working with mark Cuban and others. So on the Ticketmaster side, we're getting to see all of the best versions of what some sports teams and brands are doing with NFTs. On the concert side, we've worked on our artist management division with our artists and seen some of the versions that they're looking at, whether it's in the metaverse, whether it's a fortnight or whether it's a song on an NFT. So we're looking and learning on that side and on the live nation side the NFC is really just an extension of what someone mentioned earlier, the digital ticket. I mean, the, the most important thing for us overall is to have identity tied to the ticket. So, so moving from a PDF ticket where we knew nobody, it had no contract, it had no rights, it had no carry on value, moving to a block-chain, digital NFT ticket in general that just opens up the doors to first having identity tied to the ticket. So we can have a better conversation with you. And we think NFT to that ticket, we can create a community of value and look at and ways to add value to you on an ongoing basis if you've opened up and been part of the live ticket stub NFT today. So we're we think it's great opportunity to add more value to the relationship with that purchaser. And we're going to, we're going to keep experiment ideas on that front. The second question, I, I didn't quite even I didn't hear it well enough. Yeah. Joe and jump in on you. I, I think I can give you generalities to make you feel good that '23 going to look good. I mean, that's obviously what you're, you're trying to get at. So I think in, if you look at '20 to your point of how many did we have booked, or how many would we be reviewing for, for, for a historic year at this time period, we would, we would be about double where, where a historic marker would be if you want to use that as a, as a basic line. So, 60 would be a, a fabulous number to be talking about this time of year for a, for a next year activity. So that's, that kind of gives you a kind of a robust feeling of what's what '23 will look to be. All right, everybody. Thank you. Have a great summer. We'll talk soon."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Live Nation's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Call. And I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Yong. Thank you. Ms. Yong, you may begin your conference.\nAmy Yong: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Live Nation fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. Joining us today is our President and CEO, Michael Rapino; and our President and CFO, Joe Berchtold. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements related to the company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters. Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the company's most recent filings on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results. Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with the SEC Regulation G, Live Nation has provided definitions of these measures and a full reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release. The release reconciliation can be found under the Financial Information section on Live Nation's website. And with that, let me open the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Laszczyk: Hey, great, thank you. Good afternoon. Maybe one on the mix shift in the slate and one on Sponsorship. A lot has been made on the mix shift shifting more towards the amphitheaters this year. Maybe for Joe, just from a modeling perspective, could you help us think through how the mix shift will impact the cadence of revenue growth and margin expansion across the Concerts and Ticketing segments in 2024? And maybe how we should expect the business to pace towards the double-digit AOI growth you called out in the release? And then, on Sponsorship, maybe for Michael, you had two notable tailwinds to the Sponsorship business this year: MasterCard is replacing Amex, and you have Rock in Rio, which is a bi-annual event coming in this year. Is there any way you can help us size the contribution from these two factors and perhaps where else you're seeing demand in the Sponsorship business this year? Thank you.\nJoe Berchtold: Sure, Stephen. This is Joe. I'll go first. In terms of the mix shift, there's several dimensions of this. Let's start with deferred revenue. Deferred revenue in the level to which it's up is impacted on a timing basis by what we've talked about in terms of stadium volume being lower this year, amp volume being higher. So, you have less Q4 far ahead on sales with the stadiums, so that's going to compress that deferred revenue line that you see as of the end of the year relative to what you'd see in a more normal year. Then, in terms of how that specifically flows through on the concert side, because it's going to be a shift to more outdoor with the amphitheaters, it's going to be more heavily weighted to Q2 and Q3. It's going to have a higher AOI per fan, because we're counting the beer money, the parking money, other revenue streams when we have the fans on site. It will mean, just on a top-line basis, a lower revenue per fan because the stadium tickets tend to be the highest price tickets, so you'll see a real divergence there between the AOI per fan and the revenue per fan. That, obviously, will translate into improved margin on the Concert segment this year, which should particularly come through in the second and third quarters. On Ticketmaster, the way it flows through is that it would have had fewer on sales in the fourth quarter because the amphitheater shows tend to go on sale closer in time to the shows. So, we still outperformed, grew Ticketmaster in the fourth quarter, increased our number of fee-bearing tickets by about 5 million. But that was against the headwind of that mix shift. So, we expect to be selling more of those tickets into Q1 and Q2 for the amphitheater. But because those tickets are deferred from a revenue recognition standpoint at Ticketmaster, you won't see the AOI on those tickets until the shows play off in Q2 and Q3. On the Sponsorship?\nMichael Rapino: Stephen, does that help?\nStephen Laszczyk: Yeah, that's helpful. And then, just on Sponsorship.\nMichael Rapino: Yeah. I just want to give Joe a macro level on the kind of concert supply just so we're aligned. This is going to be a great year. We're pacing ahead on our arena and our amphitheater business, which is the higher-margin business as we've talked about. So, we're going to have a fabulous year. We're going to be able to monetize that around the world. We actually look at '25, looks like it's going to be a monster stadium year again as that pipe kind of reloads itself. So, I wanted to just make sure on a macro level, we're seeing continual artist supply at record levels. And we made decisions this year, Usher could have been in stadiums. We wanted to get them in arenas this year and put a great show together. Justin Timberlake, Bad Bunny in arenas versus stadiums. So, you make those trade-offs in different years. But the good news for us is we're going to have a fabulous arena/amphitheater year, festival year around the world. That's going to drive our overall AOI margin cash flow. Probably bounce back with some bigger stadium activity in '25 and then the cycle will continue. But as we've stated over our Investor Day, we look at this as continual growth year-over-year industry for the next 10 years on a global basis. And we'll see that again this year. Sponsorship, to your macro point, the demand we're seeing, strong as ever. I just spent some time in New York with my team with some clients, Verizon, et cetera. Our demand in terms of clients that want to be part of this live experience surge right now is stronger than ever, as you can imagine. Most CMO's want to sit down with us and talk about how can they have some part of this live explosion on a global basis. So, we're seeing, as you've seen with Mastercard and updated deal with Verizon and others to be announced, our pipe is up year-over-year. We expect this to continue to be a double-digit growth business, as we've seen in the past. We've seen nothing slowing down there.\nStephen Laszczyk: Great. Thank you, both.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Ross: Hey, everyone. How are you doing? Joe, you talked about amps in the answer to the last question a lot in the mix shift this year. I was actually curious what -- I want to better understand the future upside in the amp business. Your portfolio has been fairly fixed for a long time. And you've done a pretty incredible job of increasing per caps over the last decade. Where does the real growth come from in the amphitheater business at this point? I have some follow-ups.\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah. Thanks, Brandon.\nMichael Rapino: I'll start, and then you can go in there, Joe.\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah.\nMichael Rapino: Just let me step on that. I think Brandon you've heard us talk about it at our Venue Nation Day. We think we're in this double win right now. We think we have global scale that will still continue because of international markets and more to come. But we also have an incredible amount of opportunity to monetize the scale we have. And for the first 10 years, we built scale. We just kind of ran the scale. The last couple of years since COVID, we launched our Venue Nation division and really focused hiring up and bringing in new skill sets around hospitality, best-in-class food and beverage, best-in-class VIP clubs, et cetera. We think our amphitheaters are run very well. As I say, they're run very well like Southwest Airlines. They're very efficient, and they've been great machines to-date. But we think we're seeing when we invest capital on site, we're getting 20%, 30% returns on capital when we turn that grassy area into a VIP club, a membership club. You're going to see Jones Beach this summer. When you walk up to Jones Beach this summer, at an amphitheater, you're going to call me and go, now I get it. Now I see what these -- the machines could double their AOI when you start to really treat them as arenas have been doing a much better job about how do we upscale on site, elevate the experience and take over. So, we think the 50 amphitheaters we have, the bones of them are amazing. They do incredible job. They're efficient. We think we can double the business as we start to actually look inside the hood and upgrade on site, whether it's our Liquid Death idea that has been a huge surge in our food and beverage, our shaker cup, our own custom-branded liquor that we launched on site to our new clubs, we're rolling out to our VIP boxes, to our elevated. If you look at our overall amphitheater business, about 9% of it is premium. We think that should be 30% to 35%, to give you kind of macro numbers. If you doubled that overnight, your business would double in the long run. So just take your current house, upgrade it, double your capacity on a VIP business, and your business would double. That's the simplest way to look at it.\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah. And then the other half of it, Brandon, is that's making more on the shows from the fans that attend. In terms of the volume of shows, right now, with our current portfolio, if you assume typical amp has about four months of activity on average, our utilization rate is running about 35%. So, we still have a fair bit of space that we can put more shows into our amphitheaters. And while we haven't been growing by leaps and bounds, we are continuing to add an amp here, an amp there, on our hyper-local strategy of continuing to look for more spots that we can put an amphitheater in.\nBrandon Ross: Great. Then over the past couple of years, I know Platinum has been a pretty big tailwind for probably both the Ticketmaster business and the Concert's business. And I was curious how far along you are in the rollout of Platinum ticketing, both in domestic and international? And then, how you expect Platinum to continue to contribute to the growth at both Concerts and Ticketmaster?\nMichael Rapino: I'll start and Joe can jump in. Just think of Platinum as it's dynamic pricing, right? It's just pricing smarter. And that's been a skill that we've been -- we have a great in-house team who wakes up every day working with artists, agents, managers on this. And it may be as simple as just figuring out how to reprice. Tuesday night in Phoenix is worth different than a Saturday night in LA. So, being a lot smarter the way you can price your inventory, price the front better so the back sells out, price, et cetera. We think if you look at -- I'll give it two kind of ways to look at it. Outside of the US, we're in the first inning. So, we're just rolling this out around the world. So that's the great growth opportunity obviously. We have it in Europe, but still in infancy stages. We're going to expand it down to South America, Australia, et cetera. So, first inning on the international business, well received when it gets there. Promoters are anxious for it. Artists are anxious for it, because they see when they sell an arena in Baltimore versus Milan, right now, they look at the grosses and say, \"Wow, we're leaving too much on the table for the scalpers. Let's price this better.\" So that's our best sales pitch. So, you're going to see that excel. And I would say on the US business, we're probably about in the fifth inning. The obvious stuff is done at the top end, some artists on kind of the P1 Platinum. But getting all the way through the business, amphitheaters, the B shows, the C, just dynamically pricing that better and smarter all along the way, we see it happen. It will increase your [take] (ph) flow and sell-through rate, all the way to the day -- time you open the gates up. So, we still think that's a multi-year opportunity to continue to grow our top-line/bottom-line.\nJoe Berchtold: The other way I think about it, Brandon, is that the typical secondary ticket is still almost twice the price of a primary ticket. So, as Michael said, just think of Platinum as being the market priced ticket, artists are going to be more and more saying I want that through the house. I want that to be closer to really take away that scalper margin.\nBrandon Ross: Yeah. And then, finally not to overstay my welcome here, but one thing I noticed, I've been, I think, covering your stock for many years now. And I've never seen you give the double-digit AOI expectation in Q4. It's always Q1 where you give that guidance. What gave you the confidence to give that type of guidance at this stage versus the usual Q1?\nJoe Berchtold: I'll start. I think, first of all, our show pipeline is up double digits, very strong for -- driven by the arenas and amphitheaters as we've talked about. Michael gave all the reasons why we're highly confident in our ability to execute at our amphitheaters now. So, the volume of fans that we're confident in having and our ability to drive the profitability off of those fans gives us the visibility and confidence that we're going to deliver double-digit growth this year.\nBrandon Ross: Great. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Karnovsky: Hey, thank you. I guess first, Joe, wanted to see if you could provide some additional detail on the CapEx guide. Where are you deploying the growth capital, and what's driving the incremental spend, including for maintenance versus '23? And I know you've discussed potentially buying venues abroad. So, I don't know if you could say anything on the pipeline for deals and how that could potentially look relative to past years? And then just secondly, in November, you had described a DOJ investigation as in mid stages. So, I wanted to see if you had any update here in terms of timing or where things stand overall with the probe. Thanks.\nJoe Berchtold: Sure, let me start with the CapEx. As we noted, we're projecting right now about $540 million CapEx, two-thirds rev gen, one-third maintenance. If you look at the rev gen, about $300 million of that is either new venues or major renovations of existing buildings. And about half of that, about $150 million, is our top-four projects, would include major revamp of Foro Sol, which is the top international stadium in the world down in Mexico City. Michael talked about Jones Beach. Those projects would collectively have a return in the 20%s. So, we're definitely seeing some chunkiness now in some projects that cost tens of millions of dollars, happen to have several -- four of them line up this year that drives a lot of that. The other rev gen would be a combination of tactical things in existing venues, a new VIP club, a new viewing deck, rock boxes, some new bar designs that are extremely high returns, generally 40%s, 50%s-plus, sort of tactical improvements and some things at Ticketmaster heavily tied in with the sponsorship group and the creation of new ad units. And then maintenance is a combination mainly of venues, some Ticketmaster. I think that's continuing to rise at a rate lower than our revenue, lower than our ticket sales. So, we're watching that pretty closely and making sure we have that limited. In terms of the...\nMichael Rapino: I think the venue pipeline...\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah.\nMichael Rapino: I'll just say, venue pipeline, I think we've been talking about it since our Investor Day. We're really happy about the Venue Nation team, our global development team. These were skills, really going into COVID, we didn't have in-house at any level. We're kind of best-in-class at this point. We've really scaled over the last three, four years, got incredible global teams working around the band. And we're just seeing, as we hope when we're walking into those RFPs that we weren't invited to, we're walking in and holding our own and winning right now some of the -- some key venues around the world that we'll be continuing to announce. So, we see it scaling over the next five years much, much higher than it was in the past just because we hadn't focused that much on international arenas before, and we see a great path forward on these.\nJoe Berchtold: And then finally on DOJ. I don't think we've got a lot to report. We continue to answer any questions they have. They control the timing, and we'll watch it play out, but we don't have any specific updates.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you.\nMichael Rapino: We're 100% cooperative.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Cameron Mansson-Perrone with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nCameron Mansson-Perrone: Thanks. Two, if I can. Michael, you've spoken in the past about kind of the current big shift in the promotion business being a move from kind of national booking and towards increasingly global booking. I'd love to hear just an update on where you think we are in that shift today? And then I thought it was interesting in the release that you're seeing all-in pricing lead to higher conversion. Is that something that you think can lead to adoption of third-party venues, or do you think that stays at your operated venue portfolio for now? Thanks, guys.\nMichael Rapino: I'll answer. I mean, all-in pricing, I'll start. Yeah, we're actually surprised and thrilled because we were always skeptical, if we would be the one led path, there was any conversion that would hurt us. But I think consumers are loving the idea, they can see upfront. Ultimately they're shopping multiple tabs anyway. So, they're probably figuring out the true costs are the same. So yeah, we think it's a great test. I would say most of all the congressional, senate, all the stuff Joe and I are talking to everybody about, this just seems to be the common torch that everyone's running with. So, I would assume this ends up being legislated somewhere over time, and I would assume others are going to start jumping on the all-in wagon as a good step forward for consumers, so we can worry about the other issues around scalping, et cetera. On the promoter shift, it is a -- it's always the -- it's a three-level shift, right? It's a local promoter or a national promoter and a global promoter. Still lots of great local promoters, why we have 100 offices in 40 countries. Contracts still have to be executed local. So, you have to make sure you have the best local staff in market that can execute at scale on an ongoing basis. Artists have absolutely evolved over the last 10 years, much like they probably have one global record label and one global agent and one global publishing company, as touring became their most important category and expensive. These artists are putting on -- I was at the Drake show last night. I mean, he's -- it's an incredible show, he's carrying to those fans at a huge cost to give back. So, the artists are -- over the last 10 years have started to look for a much more national or global partner, whether it's us, AEG, CTS in Europe, because their needs have changed. They needed upfront capital. They needed organizations that have a wider view on data, marketing, sponsorship, ways to help them think about their global business. Do they go to Japan or not? Do they do Hong Kong before or after? Do we do Pacific Rim? What's the shipping costs? How do we get it all there? So, artists have become globalized brands and artist -- with the consumers, we've talked about. So, absolutely every artist -- the younger the manager and the younger the artist, the more global they're looking for. So, if you're kind of the new manager managing a superstar that's popped on a global basis, you absolutely want to sit down with someone and talk about your global touring plans and when do you go where before -- with one common agenda in mind. So, we're seeing that continual shift and I think you'll just see that continue to move over the next five years.\nCameron Mansson-Perrone: Interesting. Thanks.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citibank. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Bazinet: I just had a quick question on CapEx. You guys have been so consistent with this sort of 2%, 2.5% of revenues on CapEx. Given what's happening in your business and the high returns on invested capital we can see from the outside, why doesn't it make sense to sort of open up the envelope and spend a bit more?\nMichael Rapino: Love this question. I think, as Joe and I talked about, coming out of COVID, the prior to last three years was obviously build back up that cash bank. We drained a lot during COVID, so we wanted to get the balance sheet strong again, get our staff, get everyone back in place, hire the skills we needed and plot through our real kind of five to 10-year strategy here. So, we think the way we're producing our AOI to cash flow return now, it's given us all the tools we need to deliver this ambitious growth plan that we laid out at our Investor Day. So, you'll see us move up and down depending if there is a big opportunity, but we've been pretty consistent that we can deliver our growth that we've outlined for you with that current number.\nJoe Berchtold: And I think the market just accepts it more if we demonstrate it and then do it a bit more. As you said, we've been demonstrating that return on the invested capital. As we continue, we spend a bit more. We demonstrate those returns. The market will let us spend a bit more. The market doesn't tend to want you to take big leaps and big turns. So, we're not doing that. We're just steadily building a pipeline. And as the market sees the demonstrated returns, then you earn the right to continue to do more of it.\nJason Bazinet: Looking forward to the number being 3% or 3.5% of risk. Thanks.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Ashton Welles with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nAshton Welles: Thank you for the question. It would be great to get an update on the real-time indicators you guys are seeing on the consumer front, whether that's the performance of on-sales or how shows are closing or on-site spending.\nMichael Rapino: I'll start and then Joe can jump in. I mean, I see the ticket sale on my daily ticket sale counts. We just went on sale, jeez, within the last week on Usher, Justin Timberlake, Jennifer Lopez, just announced Jelly Roll this morning. These shows are flying out the door from top to bottom. So yeah, we're seeing no slowdown on the consumer from -- I was in Columbus, Ohio for a sold-out Drake show last night. We had two nights in a row sold out, incredible high-merch numbers. They were buying all the sweatshirts and onsite the GM told me they were -- we're doing really strong numbers. So, we're seeing at our current business, they're buying and showing up across the country and across the globe right now.\nJoe Berchtold: And we're seeing most of these on-sales still selling front-to-back, meaning most expensive tickets to least. So, we're seeing strong demand at all price points. We just went on sale with our lawn passes for our amphitheaters, up double digits in sale on that for the price-conscious fan. So that's going well. Shows are closing. We really have the best per-cap on-site spending right now at our theaters and clubs, just given that its Q1, those numbers continue to be strong and show year-on-year growth. So, all fronts are showing strong consumer demand globally.\nAshton Welles: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Katz: Hello, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. When we think about the different business lines, how would we think about the trajectory or arc of growth in Sponsorship relative to Concerts? And what I am essentially getting at is whether there is an acceleration of growth in sponsorship and advertising that is begotten from this outperformance and this -- this acceleration that you're seeing in -- on the concert side of things later on?\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah, David, this is Joe. I think absolutely there are increasing benefits to scale on the Sponsorship business. One of the things that the brands are telling us they're looking for is they want to reach customers at a time when they are open to the brands, which we have, but they want to make sure that it's at scale. That at-scale really matters. So, they're not trying to do a lot of different little programs. And so, we're seeing a lot more demand. We're over $1 billion in revenue on the Sponsorship side. We're 100 -- closing in on 150 million fans. So, we -- over 600 million tickets on Ticketmaster. So, we've now got a scale and that scale continues to beget more scale. So absolutely, we see a very strong continued growth in that business.\nDavid Katz: So just to follow it up, and I'm not fishing for any kind of guidance or anything like that. But the growth rate in Sponsorship obviously could outgrow and grow more than potentially that of Concerts at some future day, right, if we're sort of plotting those lines?\nJoe Berchtold: Well, I think if you look historically, look back since 2010, Concerts has consistently grown faster than our Sponsorship business, and we think it continues to be a strong double-digit growth business.\nDavid Katz: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Michael Rapino for any closing comments.\nMichael Rapino: Thank you. I appreciate all your support, and we'll talk to you at the end of Q1.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Joe Berchtold",
            "content": "Sure, Stephen. This is Joe. I'll go first. In terms of the mix shift, there's several dimensions of this. Let's start with deferred revenue. Deferred revenue in the level to which it's up is impacted on a timing basis by what we've talked about in terms of stadium volume being lower this year, amp volume being higher. So, you have less Q4 far ahead on sales with the stadiums, so that's going to compress that deferred revenue line that you see as of the end of the year relative to what you'd see in a more normal year. Then, in terms of how that specifically flows through on the concert side, because it's going to be a shift to more outdoor with the amphitheaters, it's going to be more heavily weighted to Q2 and Q3. It's going to have a higher AOI per fan, because we're counting the beer money, the parking money, other revenue streams when we have the fans on site. It will mean, just on a top-line basis, a lower revenue per fan because the stadium tickets tend to be the highest price tickets, so you'll see a real divergence there between the AOI per fan and the revenue per fan. That, obviously, will translate into improved margin on the Concert segment this year, which should particularly come through in the second and third quarters. On Ticketmaster, the way it flows through is that it would have had fewer on sales in the fourth quarter because the amphitheater shows tend to go on sale closer in time to the shows. So, we still outperformed, grew Ticketmaster in the fourth quarter, increased our number of fee-bearing tickets by about 5 million. But that was against the headwind of that mix shift. So, we expect to be selling more of those tickets into Q1 and Q2 for the amphitheater. But because those tickets are deferred from a revenue recognition standpoint at Ticketmaster, you won't see the AOI on those tickets until the shows play off in Q2 and Q3. On the Sponsorship? Yeah. Thanks, Brandon. Yeah. Yeah. And then the other half of it, Brandon, is that's making more on the shows from the fans that attend. In terms of the volume of shows, right now, with our current portfolio, if you assume typical amp has about four months of activity on average, our utilization rate is running about 35%. So, we still have a fair bit of space that we can put more shows into our amphitheaters.

And I think the market just accepts it more if we demonstrate it and then do it a bit more. As you said, we've been demonstrating that return on the invested capital.

            "name": "Michael Rapino",
            "content": "Stephen, does that help? Yeah. I just want to give Joe a macro level on the kind of concert supply just so we're aligned. This is going to be a great year. We're pacing ahead on our arena and our amphitheater business, which is the higher-margin business as we've talked about. So, we're going to have a fabulous year. We're going to be able to monetize that around the world. We actually look at '25, looks like it's going to be a monster stadium year again as that pipe kind of reloads itself. So, I wanted to just make sure on a macro level, we're seeing continual artist supply at record levels. And we made decisions this year, Usher could have been in stadiums. We wanted to get them in arenas this year and put a great show together. Justin Timberlake, Bad Bunny in arenas versus stadiums. So, you make those trade-offs in different years. But the good news for us is we're going to have a fabulous arena/amphitheater year, festival year around the world. That's going to drive our overall AOI margin cash flow. Probably bounce back with some bigger stadium activity in '25 and then the cycle will continue. But as we've stated over our Investor Day, we look at this as continual growth year-over-year industry for the next 10 years on a global basis. And we'll see that again this year. Sponsorship, to your macro point, the demand we're seeing, strong as ever. I just spent some time in New York with my team with some clients, Verizon, et cetera. Our demand in terms of clients that want to be part of this live experience surge right now is stronger than ever, as you can imagine. Most CMO's want to sit down with us and talk about how can they have some part of this live explosion on a global basis. So, we're seeing, as you've seen with Mastercard and updated deal with Verizon and others to be announced, our pipe is up year-over-year. We expect this to continue to be a double-digit growth business, as we've seen in the past. We've seen nothing slowing down there. I'll start, and then you can go in there, Joe. Just let me step on that. I think Brandon you've heard us talk about it at our Venue Nation Day. We think we're in this double win right now. We think we have global scale that will still continue because of international markets and more to come. But we also have an incredible amount of opportunity to monetize the scale we have. And for the first 10 years, we built scale. We just kind of ran the scale. The last couple of years since COVID, we launched our Venue Nation division and really focused hiring up and bringing in new skill sets around hospitality, best-in-class food and beverage, best-in-class VIP clubs, et cetera. We think our amphitheaters are run very well. As I say, they're run very well like Southwest Airlines. They're very efficient, and they've been great machines to-date. But we think we're seeing when we invest capital on site, we're getting 20%, 30% returns on capital when we turn that grassy area into a VIP club, a membership club. You're going to see Jones Beach this summer. When you walk up to Jones Beach this summer, at an amphitheater, you're going to call me and go, now I get it. Now I see what these -- the machines could double their AOI when you start to really treat them as arenas have been doing a much better job about how do we upscale on site, elevate the experience and take over. So, we think the 50 amphitheaters we have, the bones of them are amazing. They do incredible job. They're efficient. We think we can double the business as we start to actually look inside the hood and upgrade on site, whether it's our Liquid Death idea that has been a huge surge in our food and beverage, our shaker cup, our own custom-branded liquor that we launched on site to our new clubs, we're rolling out to our VIP boxes, to our elevated. If you look at our overall amphitheater business, about 9% of it is premium. We think that should be 30% to 35%, to give you kind of macro numbers. If you doubled that overnight, your business would double in the long run. So just take your current house, upgrade it, double your capacity on a VIP business, and your business would double. That's the simplest way to look at it. I'll start and Joe can jump in. Just think of Platinum as it's dynamic pricing, right? It's just pricing smarter. And that's been a skill that we've been -- we have a great in-house team who wakes up every day working with artists, agents, managers on this. And it may be as simple as just figuring out how to reprice. Tuesday night in Phoenix is worth different than a Saturday night in LA. So, being a lot smarter the way you can price your inventory, price the front better so the back sells out, price, et cetera. We think if you look at -- I'll give it two kind of ways to look at it. Outside of the US, we're in the first inning. So, we're just rolling this out around the world. So that's the great growth opportunity obviously. We have it in Europe, but still in infancy stages. We're going to expand it down to South America, Australia, et cetera. So, first inning on the international business, well received when it gets there. Promoters are anxious for it. Artists are anxious for it, because they see when they sell an arena in Baltimore versus Milan, right now, they look at the grosses and say, \"Wow, we're leaving too much on the table for the scalpers. Let's price this better.\" So that's our best sales pitch. So, you're going to see that excel. And I would say on the US business, we're probably about in the fifth inning. The obvious stuff is done at the top end, some artists on kind of the P1 Platinum. But getting all the way through the business, amphitheaters, the B shows, the C, just dynamically pricing that better and smarter all along the way, we see it happen. It will increase your [take] (ph) flow and sell-through rate, all the way to the day -- time you open the gates up. So, we still think that's a multi-year opportunity to continue to grow our top-line/bottom-line. I think the venue pipeline... I'll just say, venue pipeline, I think we've been talking about it since our Investor Day. We're really happy about the Venue Nation team, our global development team. These were skills, really going into COVID, we didn't have in-house at any level. We're kind of best-in-class at this point. We've really scaled over the last three, four years, got incredible global teams working around the band. And we're just seeing, as we hope when we're walking into those RFPs that we weren't invited to, we're walking in and holding our own and winning right now some of the -- some key venues around the world that we'll be continuing to announce. So, we see it scaling over the next five years much, much higher than it was in the past just because we hadn't focused that much on international arenas before, and we see a great path forward on these. We're 100% cooperative. I'll answer. I mean, all-in pricing, I'll start. Yeah, we're actually surprised and thrilled because we were always skeptical, if we would be the one led path, there was any conversion that would hurt us. But I think consumers are loving the idea, they can see upfront. Ultimately they're shopping multiple tabs anyway. So, they're probably figuring out the true costs are the same. So yeah, we think it's a great test. I would say most of all the congressional, senate, all the stuff Joe and I are talking to everybody about, this just seems to be the common torch that everyone's running with. So, I would assume this ends up being legislated somewhere over time, and I would assume others are going to start jumping on the all-in wagon as a good step forward for consumers, so we can worry about the other issues around scalping, et cetera. On the promoter shift, it is a -- it's always the -- it's a three-level shift, right? It's a local promoter or a national promoter and a global promoter. Still lots of great local promoters, why we have 100 offices in 40 countries. Contracts still have to be executed local.

They needed upfront capital. They needed organizations that have a wider view on data, marketing, sponsorship, ways to help them think about their global business. Do they go to Japan or not? Do they do Hong Kong before or after? Do we do Pacific Rim? What's the shipping costs? How do we get it all there? So, artists have become globalized brands and artist -- with the consumers, we've talked about. So, absolutely every artist -- the younger the manager and the younger the artist, the more global they're looking for. So, if you're kind of the new manager managing a superstar that's popped on a global basis, you absolutely want to sit down with someone and talk about your global touring plans and when do you go where before -- with one common agenda in mind. So, we're seeing that continual shift and I think you'll just see that continue to move over the next five years. Love this question. I think, as Joe and I talked about, coming out of COVID, the prior to last three years was obviously build back up that cash bank. We drained a lot during COVID, so we wanted to get the balance sheet strong again, get our staff, get everyone back in place, hire the skills we needed and plot through our real kind of five to 10-year strategy here. So, we think the way we're producing our AOI to cash flow return now, it's given us all the tools we need to deliver this ambitious growth plan that we laid out at our Investor Day. So, you'll see us move up and down depending if there is a big opportunity, but we've been pretty consistent that we can deliver our growth that we've outlined for you with that current number. I'll start and then Joe can jump in. I mean, I see the ticket sale on my daily ticket sale counts. We just went on sale, jeez, within the last week on Usher, Justin Timberlake, Jennifer Lopez, just announced Jelly Roll this morning. These shows are flying out the door from top to bottom. So yeah, we're seeing no slowdown on the consumer from -- I was in Columbus, Ohio for a sold-out Drake show last night. We had two nights in a row sold out, incredible high-merch numbers. They were buying all the sweatshirts and onsite the GM told me they were -- we're doing really strong numbers. So, we're seeing at our current business, they're buying and showing up across the country and across the globe right now. Thank you. I appreciate all your support, and we'll talk to you at the end of Q1."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Live Nation\u2019s Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. And I would now like to turn the call over to Amy Yong, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\nAmy Yong: Good afternoon. And welcome to the Live Nation third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining us today is our President and CEO, Michael Rapino; and our President and CFO, Joe Berchtold. We will start with prepared remarks from Michael and then we will take your questions. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that this afternoon\u2019s call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements related to the company\u2019s anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters. Please refer to Live Nation\u2019s SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in our most recent filings on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results. Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with the SEC Regulation G, Live Nation have provided definitions of these measures and a full reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures in the earnings release or website supplement, which also contains other financial or statistical information to be discussed on this call. The release reconciliation and website supplement can be found under the Financial Information section on Live Nation\u2019s website. And with that, I will now turn it over to our President and CEO, Michael Rapino.\nMichael Rapino: Thank you for joining us. As you can see from our results, the structural tailwinds behind our business are accelerating faster than ever and as a fan demand truly globalizes and artist were able throw more broadly than ever, this is still in an unprecedented global desire for concerts. This is happening at all levels with both casual and diehard fans and from small clubs to massive stadium events. We will start the conversation today in the next week a deeper into our results how these trends are setting up the industry for ongoing growth. Joe, anything to add.\nJoe Berchtold: Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Only thing for me to add is that given the investor presentations next week we\u2019ll keep today\u2019s call more brief than usual. So, with that, I will -- I think, we\u2019re ready to take questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Ross: Hey. Thanks. Just to start-off, since you guys last reported there\u2019s been at least two major articles on the DOJ investigation into your company, as well as some movements in both the legislative and executive branches and industry-wide regulation. Can you just give us an update on what you know about the Justice investigation and then separately, the potential impact of the proposed Congressional legislation? Then I have a follow-up.\nJoe Berchtold: Sure. Thanks, Brandon. I\u2019ll start first of all just on the legislative, which I think is pretty straightforward. Right now there is an all-in pricing bill by Senators Cantwell and Cruz under consideration. We are fully supportive of there\u2019s a BOTS Act that Senator Blackburn introduced, I mean, you call main, which we\u2019re also fully supportive of, and in general, everything we\u2019re hearing legislatively are things that I think are pretty consistent with what we outlined in the FAIR Ticketing Act and things that we would definitely be supportive of. On the DOJ and the article that came out yesterday. I think, not surprisingly, it\u2019s our impression that the DOJ is taking at least the first level look at almost everything that our competitors complain about and from there they look further at some issues and not others and if they tell us they have a problem with something we talked to them about it. But, let me emphasize this, as far as we can tell nobody thinks that the fundamentals that drive our promotions business are unlawful. We pay top dollar to artists and provide them with top-notch tour support and those are good things. I think the article also seems to reinforce that the investigations looking at specific business practices versus our overall business model, which as I\u2019ve said previously, is my impression-based on what I\u2019ve heard. On the specifics, I mean, recall on the agencies getting document retention letters. I think generally anyone the DOJ\u2019s six documents from gets the cover letter like this saying they should retain documents related to the investigation. So all this tells us is they think the agencies have relevant information, which seems pretty obvious given the topics that are being discussed and competitors complain about. Finally, we obviously find it interesting, as I think, you tweeted that the timing of this always seems to come up at earnings. We don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real news right now. Concerning the investigation, we\u2019re completing our document production that they\u2019ve asked for. We haven\u2019t even started depositions and our impression is that the investigation is kind of in its mid-stages at this point. And yeah, we have another new story on the day before earnings which we don\u2019t seem to think a coincidence.\nBrandon Ross: Okay. And getting to the business, your forward-looking metrics and especially the Q3 ticketing results point to real continued strength for your business. But there\u2019s a lot of trepidation now about consumer weakness, especially after some weak guidance from others in the experienced economy. I know Bookings just said, some negative things just now. Is there anything in real-time that you\u2019re seeing at all to suggest fall-off in trends at Ticketmaster. I know like the arenas of the world will continue to sell, but are the Tuesday\u2019s in Pittsburgh still holding up and like really especially for Ticketmaster, as you look forward?\nJoe Berchtold: Sure. We\u2019re seeing no issues. Let me give you that in the two piece. I think you asked about, first of all, Q3 and then call it October. So Q3 was very strong volume quarter. So it was really driven by ticket volume $90 million fee-bearing tickets that we sold in the quarter, which --and the growth came from both North America and internationally. So we\u2019re seeing that the demand consistent globally. 90% of the growth came from Concerts, which again tells you that the fans are looking to go to the Concerts. The one thing, I would note on Q3 is just a reminder, the last year, we had an unusual concentration of client renewal expenses, which are normally spread out over the second half, but largely came together last year. But really the quarter was about the tremendous volume and tremendous fan demand that flowed through Ticketmaster. Looking then more specifically at just October. If we looked at our Ticketmaster platform for the month of October, ticket sales were again up year-on year relative to last year. They were up double digits in North America. So we\u2019re seeing no sign of weaknesses. Another metric that we look at is as we look at just for our U.S. Concerts division we track every week, year-on year sales and again over the past five weeks since the end of the quarter, those sales continue to be up double digits. So we\u2019re seeing no weakness at all. We gave you the leading indicators for show commitments for next year and we\u2019ll get into a more, but feeling good about everything that we\u2019re putting on-sale.\nBrandon Ross: Thank you.\nMichael Rapino: And Brandon just for more color. Yes.\nBrandon Ross: Yeah.\nMichael Rapino: I have weekly booking calls with over the 40 Presidents around the world. When we talk both from clubs to stadiums and festivals. And we have not seen anything taper off in any sense or on-sales for next year, whether it\u2019s an early festival across the pond or was there, let\u2019s say, a festival -- a club tour playing in Pittsburgh on a Tuesday, as you say, or maybe the blink-182 who toured last year, now is back on tour again this year playing Pittsburgh just to Cleveland on Wednesday and any pullback in any way from a club to a stadium tour from Malan to Argentina right now. The consumer supply-demand seems to be consistent across the globe small to big.\nBrandon Ross: Thanks very much.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Laszczyk: Great. Thank you. Joe, there has been a lot of focus on how the Concert segment profitability would shake out this quarter and just given the mix shift towards stadium shows in the slate this year and maybe offsetting that some dynamics around having a more matched revenue and expense structure compared to last year. I was hoping you could help us unpack some of those dynamics and maybe size some of those factors. Just as we think about Concerts profitability this quarter, I think, it would be helpful to contextualize this year and then look forward to next year?\nJoe Berchtold: Sure. I think, let me start by just noting that, year-to-date our Concert margins are up year-on year and for the full year, I expect margin expansion of at least 50 basis points relative to last year, so making good progress verging on halfway back towards the 2019 levels and that\u2019s despite growth for the overall year that will be definitely skewed to third-party venues driven heavily by stadiums. If we look at the quarter. I think if we look at Q3, about 47% of our fans were in arenas or stadiums, which is pretty good proxy for third-party buildings. The comparable last year for that number was 42%. So we had a lot more fans mix in arenas or stadiums this year. Those two buildings accounted for about 75% of the 7.5 million fans that we added in the quarter. And that does two things, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past. It drives our AOI up, because we\u2019re making money on these fans and negatively impacts margins. So that\u2019s why you\u2019ll see the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. We don\u2019t worry a lot about, but I think, if you take the overall combination of high growth and third-party buildings shifts the mix towards more third-party buildings and make substantial progress in our margins for the full year, I think we\u2019re pretty happy as we look at the totality of that.\nStephen Laszczyk: Great. Thanks for that. And then maybe one for Michael. You\u2019re coming up on lapping the launch of two fairly significant tours in Taylor Swift and Beyonce. I think there\u2019s some concern that those tours will be hard to replicate as we look ahead to next year. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about how impactful these tours worry to your business this current year and maybe looking ahead how the slate for 2024 is shaping up and you sort of the opportunity to compensate for some of the notable tours year-over-year? Thank you.\nMichael Rapino: Yeah. Thank you. Well, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve seen this written, but we didn\u2019t promote the Taylor tour. So I don\u2019t have that comparable to worry about in 2024. Beyonce was our tour wildly successful. But when we look at any artist across Ticketmaster Live Nation, no artists is going to account for more than 1% of the tickets. So no one tour will ever hurt us year-over-year, it\u2019s about our macro portfolio of artists and tours. And we have a very good pipe as we\u2019ve been saying for next year. We think next year -- crazy to say, but sitting here looking at this year that we\u2019re looking at double-digit growth over this year, next year on ticket sales and our stadiums are gaining a lot of steam. So we\u2019re very confident. We\u2019re going to have big record-breaking tours on the road next year as Bad Bunny just went up again and more to come announced -- more to be announced. So we are very confident that well Ticketmaster Live Nation are going to have big strong years next year with a pipe full that we will overcome this year\u2019s numbers.\nStephen Laszczyk: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Karnovsky: Hey. Thank you. Maybe following-up on ticketing. It looks like your revenue growth well outpaced GTV growth, so interested to understand how non-service fee revenue might have helped in the quarter? And then, Michael, I don\u2019t know if you can say anything on the Mastercard agreement to today -- from today and I don\u2019t know, what other opportunities you see for sponsorship deals to kind of cover your international footprint?\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah. Sure. I\u2019ll start just on the ticketing. Absolutely, Ticketmaster continues to benefit from the non-service fee revenue sources it has. On the upsells and other services that itself to fans, as well as increasing array of services that it\u2019s providing to venues and promoters are all good sources that are helping us increase the profitability per ticket that we\u2019re selling.\nMichael Rapino: And Mastercard, we\u2019re thrilled to have him onboard. We\u2019ve been working over the last couple of years to have a great diversity across our partners on the payment side. Thankfully, we didn\u2019t take any of the easy crypto money at the time. We worked hard to make sure we had a stable of great partners. Today looking at Citibank, PayPal and now Mastercard for international rounds out our global portfolio in that category at an overall economics surpassing we historically had. So very, very happy to have them onboard, big part of our business and continue to show strong growth in our sponsorship side and sponsors lined-up to be part of this Live boom.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thanks.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Ashton Welles with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nAshton Welles: Thank you. I think you guys are on track to add 6 million fans or so this year at your owned and operated venues. Is this sort of the right run rate to think about going forward or could this step up in coming years?\nJoe Berchtold: This is an area that we\u2019re absolutely focused on continuing to add venues. So the hope is that we continue to build on that number. I think it will probably not be linear year-to-year as we add to our portfolio, but it\u2019s an area that we\u2019re very focused on building as that tends to be our highest profit, highest margin fan that we serve.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of David Joyce with Seaport Research. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Joyce: Thank you. A couple of related questions, the ticketing revenue particularly blew away our estimate. So I was wondering how much of that is for 2023 events and how much for 2024, and then similarly with deferred revenue being up 39%. I know that some of that is due to the function of when the shows go on sales. That\u2019s not an indicator of what the revenue growth would be. But how much of that would be due to venue mix or the tour type for 2023 shows versus 2024. In other words, how do we use these metrics on an apples-to-apples basis to help with our outlook for 2024? Thanks.\nJoe Berchtold: Sure. So, first of all, at this point, through Q3, we\u2019ve not sold a ton of tickets for 2024. That\u2019s why we focus more on what the show bookings are. So we have sold -- and we sold more tickets this year, which is part of what goes into the deferred revenue, I will come back to you. But we\u2019ve sold on the order of I think 18 million tickets for shows next year. So relatively small portion of what we\u2019re ultimately sell. So that\u2019s not the driver of our Ticketmaster results for Q3. To a very great extent, it\u2019s more of the other factors that I talked about. And then, deferred revenue is up, because, yes, we have sold more tickets for the shows next year. We\u2019ve also sold more tickets for the shows that are occurring in Q4 and it\u2019s our expectation that because of that pipeline and because as Michael noted, it\u2019s turned into a pretty solid period for stadiums, as well as arenas. We expect to see that deferred revenue number continuing to grow for the next seven months, eight months.\nDavid Joyce: Understood. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Michael for any closing comments.\nMichael Rapino: Thank you, everyone. We look forward to seeing you in New York next week, we\u2019re excited about where we are as an industry and we look-forward to taking you through details next Thursday. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

We've switched it up this time to get a little more comprehensive and data-driven in terms of numbers and the facts. So you see an earnings release that we reduced the narrative and increase, if I give you on a more structured basis all the key numbers and then also put a trending schedule that I think there was a link to you can get as a PDF or an Excel file, so you can track this quarter's numbers relative to history to make some of it easier.

We would like to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements related to the company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments and similar matters. Please refer to our SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in our most recent filings on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results.

Please proceed with your questions.\nBrandon Ross: I think investor concern now, if you were to pull the buy side is that with the past few years coming out of COVID being so strong, you're going to have trouble growing next year. And I think the Street is only at mid- to high single-digit growth. I guess, this is a good problem to have, but you said there are positive indications for '24, and wanted to see if you can kind of break that down into domestic and international. So on the domestic side, what are the positive indications that you're seeing besides this very early pipeline? Will supply match what we've seen in the past couple of years. And then on international, obviously, LatAm has been a huge tailwind post-acquisition. You've seen some other green shoots in Asia and parts of Europe. Should we expect continued growth in those markets or just more M&A on top?\nJoe Berchtold: So Brandon, thanks. This is Joe. For starters, as I think you probably noticed we put in the release that at this point, our confirmed shows and shows that we have offers in on our arenas, amphitheaters, stadium shows is up relative to where we are at this point last year coming into '23. So we're seeing continued growth in the show count, which should lead to continued growth in attendance. As you know, our formula is to drive that growth in attendance and from there, accelerate the AOI levels even higher with increasing per fan profitability on-site, increasing sponsorship, increasing our ticketing business. So I think we're set up for a very strong continued growth into 2024 across the board. And a lot of that activity, these are going to be the shows that have the longest lead time on. So a lot of these are going to be global in nature, cutting across both North America and international. As you noted and as I think much of the release lays out, this has been a tremendous quarter for growth in international markets up, I think it was 46% fan growth so far this year, which given that we were closed part of last year, we expected to see very strong growth. But we still think we're in the early innings. If you take Latin America, we're up about 35% this year so far year-to-date with roughly 10 million fans. But we think we're still in the early innings in South America. We launched the Town festival already sold 400,000 tickets on our way to probably 500,000 tickets, which is unheard of for a festival in its first year. So as we continue to layer on our promoting business bringing in our sponsorship business, bringing in our ticketing business throughout Latin America. That just continues to drive it forward. In North America, again, a very good year this year, and we're seeing the sort of growth that we think is possible ongoing year-to-date, up 8% in North America with the fan count expect that to be double-digit fan growth in Q3, probably verging on double-digit fan growth for the full year in North America as we're seeing top to bottom. We're seeing strong growth in theaters and clubs. Our amphitheaters are doing great, substantially up in number of fans attending per show and the high-end stadiums are doing very well. I've seen some things talking about is the middle, how is the low end demand across all of those continues to be very strong.\nMichael Rapino: And I'll just jump in. And Brandon, just to reiterate the pipe, right? The most important thing for us is just how does the pipe look for next year. As you know, a year ago, we sat here, and I think everyone thought '22 was the record year, and we were headed into an air pocket, and we've blown the doors off in '23. I would just step back. We believe for the next multiple years that this industry, in general, is going to have a growth surge on a global basis. We've talked to all these factors before, international, global artists, consumers. There's a whole bunch of great articles written on why there's a boom happened in a live business on a long-term basis. So we don't think this is just any COVID catch-up. We think that this is going to be the time we're live on a global basis is going to have an incredible growth run for years to come. We obviously benefit from that any time the market gets this level of growth because we'll capture that growth also. So we're looking next year, we're seeing top to bottom, as Joe said, incredible pipe of artists that will be filling all of the different venue types and markets across the world. So we think we're heading to a very, very strong 24, 25 onward, a combination of the market is going to grow, the consumer demand is growing and our ongoing bolt-on acquisitions, venues, new market entries compounded on top of our organic growth is going to give us this continual 1, 2 punch of growth for the next multiple years.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Laszczyk: Just maybe on the outlook for consumer spending. There's been a lot made over the last couple of months about the impact of student loan payments starting up in the fall. Maybe for Joe, if you could just remind us what percentage of the comps are going based you think might be skewed toward this cohort? And then maybe more broadly discuss how you're thinking about the risk that consumer spending pulls back maybe into the back half of the year or next year? Are there any parts of your business that you think are more or less exposed and perhaps festivals, and just would be curious if you could dive a little bit more deeply into the demands under the equation.\nJoe Berchtold: Sure, Stephen. Thanks. I think first, just for context, I think it's important to remember a relative scale. So if you look at consumer spend, discretionary spend on goods versus experiences. As we know, it was in the high 60s in experience. I mean this is a Goldman report that talks about this. pre-pandemic and then how that has dropped and it hasn't yet caught up. So our analysis shows that the tailwind impact from getting experiences back as a portion of discretionary spend is about 10x the impact of any potential headwind coming from the student loan payments needing to get made. So we think that the tailwinds on that specific macro factor as far outweighs any headwinds. As Michael talked on a global basis, we continue to see this as a tremendous tailwind business as you have further and further globalization of demand. As we look at all the different pockets, as I mentioned earlier that the amphitheaters is an example of a mid-level act. We're seeing high single-digit increases in attendance per show, which is really driven by more lawn tickets being sold. So the people that you might say are going to be the most price conscious are continuing to spend strongly per caps growing even as we're continuing to increase our number of fans per show, which again means that even the marginal fan is continuing to spend a lot when they show up. So we're not seeing any indicators that would give us any concern on any slowdowns.\nStephen Laszczyk: Great. Thanks for that. And maybe just one on Concert segment margins. It looks like ALM margins were up year-over-year in the second quarter. I think there might have been some assumptions that margins would be pressured year-over-year just given the mix of the slate towards stadium and arena this year. So I'm curious what drove margin expansion in the quarter? And if you think this is a trend that will be sustainable for the rest of the year? Thank you.\nJoe Berchtold: Yes. As we said in the last quarter, our expectation for the full year on concerts is that you will see margin expansion relative to last year. You're correct that any fan in third-party buildings is generally going to be a lower margin than fans in our building. But the countervailing factors is that we continue to increase the per-fan profitability across all of the different venue types. So as we increase that per fan profitability through all the different ways that we have to monetize, then we're going to see some margin expansion. That comes from increased per caps on our own building, it also comes from continuing to focus on the costs. I think in particular, in North America, we've been very effective. We look at our amphitheaters, if we look at our theaters and clubs globally, we've been able to actually drive down our average operating cost per fan this year relative to last year, which certainly helps with our margins.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Karnovsky: I'm curious with your voluntary all-in pricing initiative, I know you haven't implemented this yet. But curious what the reception has been so far from fans, clients, lawmakers. And then, can you discuss, have you thought about any potential demand impact as or for the shows that your venues as I think now optically at least you're raising prices relative to maybe competing locations? And then maybe for third-party venues that would opt-in, how you would think about the demand impact there? Thanks.\nJoe Berchtold: Sure. I think the general reaction has been overwhelmingly positive. People understand that getting the all-in price upfront is absolutely the best consumer experience. I think there is a lot of concern that there will be still confusion in the marketplace because there will be a mix of all-in pricing for shows on our sites and on the primary tickets on our sites and you go to secondary sites, you'll see a different approach. So that's why we continue to support legislation that drives a consistent fan experience. Because we are the primary ticketing provider in these events, I think it's our expectation in general that even that all-in primary price is generally going to still be lower than any secondary price even without service fees. So our experience thus far in New York or Louisiana that's recently implemented it, we haven't seen any impact on our primary ticket sales.\nDavid Karnovsky: Okay. And then, Joe, for the $300 million of growth CapEx, I wanted to see if you could provide any additional color around that? How would you bucket that between concerts and ticketing and then within concerts, new builds or other growth initiatives? And then your release noted international locations, specifically for the Venue Nation pipeline. I'm interested, you now kind of see international is the key area where you're going to be adding venues?\nJoe Berchtold: Sure. I think if you look at the overall $300 million of spend is vast majority of it would be concept-driven, 75%, 80% of it would be on the concert side. If you look then on the concert side, I would put it in 3 buckets. One is where we're doing a lot of tactical improvements across a broad set of our amphitheaters or theaters and clubs around revenue-generating opportunities, putting in new bar designs, putting in additional points of sale, things that are going to tactically help drive our APF levels. Second is, when we renew our amphitheaters or our theaters and clubs, we often go through a CapEx refresh cycle, that because we're going to have a long-term lease, we're going to be able to get a strong return off of that investment. And then, third would be the new builds where whatever level generally coming in and building out the shell and taking on that building would be the third bucket. And it's going to move around year-to-year within those 3, but those would be the 3 large buckets. And then in terms of the priorities, absolutely, international, Latin America, Asia and more in Europe is highest priority for the Venue Nation strategy. In the U.S., you benefit from having a strong arena infrastructure because NBA, NHL, their teams and their affiliate teams provide you with some of that infrastructure that you don't tend to have in the rest of the world. So this lets us both benefit from strongly attractive returns on those venues also, let's just put on more shows for more fans, because we're putting an infrastructure in place that didn't previously exist.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Glagola with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Glagola: Joe, you're on track for $300 million fee bearing tickets this year which is 7% growth over 22. IN the first half ticket growth on fee bearing is 22% year-over-year. So just maybe help us understand what's the slowdown in the second half in ticketing or is that just some conservatism in the numbers. And then I have one more follow-up. Thanks.\nJoe Berchtold: Yes. I think it's just -- you don't yet know what Q4 looks like in terms of timing with on sales for shows next year. So I think we're confident in the $300 million number at this point with the visibility we have. When we're sitting here talking next. I think we'll have better visibility into what Q4 is and we'll guide from there.\nStephen Glagola: Okay. Thank you. And then similarly on the ticketing margin side, you came in north of 40% again in Q2. You're reiterating high 30s in the back half -- for the full year, excuse me, implies sort of like a mid-30% margin in the back half. But just similar to the revenue line, what's going on there sequentially and the puts and takes. Thanks.\nJoe Berchtold: Yes. I think is a long talk. There's a lot of timing that happens with us in a given quarter. I think you saw last year a lot of the same questions. We had lower margins in the second half as we had a lot of costs associated with contract renewal cycles and other factors. So I think at this point, we're comfortable continuing to reiterate the high 30s for the margin, but not yet ready to get more specific than that.\nStephen Glagola: Okay. And should we expect contract renewals again for Q3, similar to last year?\nJoe Berchtold: I don't think we're looking to guide in a specific margin for a specific quarter as much as just give the overall year guidance.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Supino: Question on international with it growing so strongly, more major tourist -- artists touring globally. Has your strategy changed at all? Does this fact invite you to spend more money perhaps on international M&A? Are there other things that you can do now with higher visibility to international demand that you might not have done in the past? And a second shorter question just is on technology. There's all the controversy around bots and scalpers over the last year indicate that the company could productively spend materially more on technology and solve some of those problems? Thanks.\nMichael Rapino: On the global part, Joe -- I don't think the strategy has changed. I think if you've listened to us for the last 5 years, or longer. We've been talking about that live as a global business, the artist has been unlocked globally. Consumers, thanks to social media and others are driving global consumption with no gatekeepers. So we have 100 offices in over 40 countries. We have been on this march for a long time. And we think there's still lots of opportunity, obviously, as we talked about in Latin America, Pacific Rim, Eastern Europe. But kind of plan is following as we kind of predicted the artists would continue to go global -- more global artists and international markets would want to be just like New York and Boston would want to be hosting U2 and Beyonce\u2019s of the world, so we had an opportunity to build out those markets. So pedal down, we see lots of great growth opportunity for years to come on that front.\nJoe Berchtold: And on the bots, certainly, new technologies allow us to continue to get more sophisticated in trying to stop the bots. We're regularly working on both the technologies as well as just new processes to try to weed out humans versus bots. Problem is some of the same technologies is also being deployed by the bad actors trying to jump the line and get those they have a $5 billion a year incentive to cheat get those tickets, which is why we've been continuing to advocate and I think we've seen a lot more visibility on some of the behavior that we need or we'd like at least more legislative support in terms of real punishments for the bad actors or the platforms that enable the bad actors, ending practices like speculative ticketing that is clearly price manipulative and anti-consumer. So we're continuing to do our part to fight it, and we hope that we'll be able to get some help with some rules and with some real penalties for people that are trying to cheat.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Katz: I wanted to just get an update, if you don't mind, on the digital process, right, digital ticketing, et cetera, and then the second derivative of being able to harvest and drive better returns off of the information gathered from it. So where is that today and where can it go? And how do you see that opportunity?\nJoe Berchtold: Yes. At this point, digital ticketing is largely ubiquitous globally coming out of COVID. I haven't seen the latest numbers, but I expect it to be the 90s that are now digital tickets. It's a very informed shifting from barcodes to what we call safe ticks, which is rotating barcodes or NFC keep tickets from being counterfeited and sold over and over. So we have a number of initiatives that have launched them to use that data. We've talked extensively about some of the things we've done in marketing, bringing all of our data together to better understand the fan, how we market to that fan. How with the digital connection, we're able to market to them on behalf of our Digimaster clients, how we're able to market to them on behalf of sponsors, how we're able to send them messages for upsells when they go to shows in our buildings. So that all continues. And then in the background, we have Ticketmaster using the data that it gets for a range of, I'll call it, machine learning purposes and tools in terms of helping clients figure out how do they price their shows, how they market their shows, what are the tools that they should use can help our concert folks in terms of understanding likely demand for tours and shows in specific markets. So certainly, now it's the point where that data and now is used is permeated the business.\nDavid Katz: Got it. And if I can follow up, please. With respect to Platinum, right, we do have discussions about inflation and the cost of things, et cetera, et cetera, which doesn't seem to be at play here. But where is that? Where can it grow? And any pressure points with respect other than the artists themselves authorizing it, right? Any pressure points toward sort of growth in Platinum and how that mixes you higher?\nJoe Berchtold: Yes. I want to have characterized it as artists not allowing it. I mean the artists are the ones who are set the price of their tickets. It's our job to provide the information to them to help them understand the market value of their tickets, so they can figure out the balance that's right for them and their fan base in terms of pricing the tickets. So they're getting the value. Are they giving it to the fans, how do they keep it from going to the scalper. A lot of artists now I would say it's almost becoming the standard that they're understanding they should price the front of their house to capture most of the value. Otherwise, it's the scalper who's going to take it. And then they want to make sure the back of the house is priced so that every fan can afford to buy a ticket can get in. The trend we've seen coming out of COVID is, I think, a switch from it being partially used to being very ubiquitous here in North America. And then over the past year or so is becoming much more heavily adopted in international markets. I think we still have a long ways to go in international markets towards full adoption. And if you look at the pricing with platinum, there's still a substantial gap relative to average secondary pricing which would imply that artists are continuing or attempting to give a lot of the value to fans and we'll see how that evolves over time.\nMichael Rapino: Just to jump in on Platinum. The magic of Platinum isn't to increase the first rows. The magic of Platinum is it gives that artist the opportunity to look at the whole house. We have never, and historically jumped on an earnings call and told you we couldn't sell the first 10 rows out. Our job is always to sell the last 10 rows out in the upper nosebleeds as they call them. So what platinum has enabled the industry to do is as the artist has increased show cost and needs to get a certain gross for that night is we should figure out how to maximize some of the front of the house closer to market, but that's also let us bring the price down in the back end of the house. So the net gross can be more overall, but it's giving fans a better sell-through rate on the back end of the house. We used to be locked into kind of 3 ticket prices that didn't have that opportunity. So the biggest advantage to dynamic pricing and platinum price over the last few years was really just how do you help the whole house gets sold? How do you reduce the prices in the back end of the house? But are always the harder ones to sell so you truly get a full house on the proper gross for the artist and then all of us benefit when more people walk through those doors.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Bazinet: I just had a question on the secondary market. And my question is pretty simple. Is your philosophy or emphasis on this market changed? Because I think in your K, you talked about the GTV on secondary being something like almost $4.5 billion in 22 more than double 19 levels in this release, you're talking about secondary ticketing volumes up double digits. So is this just indicative of the overall strength that we're seeing in consumer interest and going to live events? Or is it something that you're doing as well or both?\nJoe Berchtold: Well, first off, again, just to keep it in context, we've long said that, first and foremost, our job is to sell the primary ticket. We're a primary ticketing company and its secondary is a kind of low to mid-teens portion of our GTV. So it's relevant, but it's also not the primary focus. We have long thought that we need to be in secondary because fans have a need to buy a ticket. And when a show is sold out if we're not giving them an option to buy a legitimate secondary ticket, then we're forcing them to go to other platforms to buy their tickets, and we think they're better off being served within the Ticketmaster ecosystem. I think as we continue to do a better job with our offer, reducing friction, understanding how to deliver on the fan needs as we've aligned with the NFL, the NBA and others on the sports side have a slightly different model for secondary. I think we've naturally grown our position in the market. But what really matters to us, first and foremost, is that we have a great primary sale, and that's managed in a way that is going to keep content happy.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Paul Golding with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.\nPaul Golding: Congrats on the quarter. I just quickly wanted to see if you had an update on a metric you've given before in terms of the average ticket price and how that's been trending? I think in the past, you've said it's been below $35. And then, secondly, as a follow-up, as we watch sort of the macro tightening in the backdrop and not so much for your business. But in general, in tracking sponsorship, any color you could give on cohorts that are more or less meaningful for that sponsorship growth that you've been seeing as we track forward into this tightening environment. Thank you.\nJoe Berchtold: So first of all, on the average ticket price, I think what we've talked in the past is that the average -- the entry ticket price, so the lowest price that a fan can find a ticket at for our amphitheaters, for theaters and clubs is generally average below $35. And for the reasons that Michael spoke to, it continues to be below $35 because the artists are wanting to make sure that almost all fans can get in to see their show. And then what you've seen is because their costs have gone up because they've seen what's going on in the secondary market, some of the closer in parts of the house or have increased ticket pricing. I mean, you can see from the overall Ticketmaster, GTV and number of tickets sold that pricing in total is up double digits still year-on-year while the entry prices remain low. On the sponsorship, I'm not sure I fully understood your question. I think we've seen no slowdown in terms of our sponsorship business. We have over 90% of our expected revenue for the year is booked being driven by a lot of the large multi-asset, multimillion dollar sponsors that we work with who have long-term agreements with us that continue to go very well and continue to sign more.\nPaul Golding: I guess my question around that was more around sector. So for example, if we were to think about sports and sports betting maybe being a predominant sponsor, boost this year or at the tail end of last year. Anything in that type of area of color around the mix.\nMichael Rapino: We have 900 different sponsor brands. Every category you can imagine is fairly distributed evenly. So we haven't seen any sector pullback that has affected any of the core business overall. We've always said, we believe that our business is a -- it is a much less of an investment than a lot of the other TV and big campaign investments that brands make, it's a much more targeted approach. So we've seen more brands shift some of their dollars from the other categories to the event space where they can kind of get that direct consumer interaction that they can't maybe get on digital and elsewhere. So we've seen most sectors increase their spend in our category. It's been growing, and we've been growing with it. We think that trend is going to stay because as they're all trying to figure out how to connect with consumers in a digital world, we in sports live, give them that one opportunity to hit consumers at scale on a Thursday in Pittsburgh. So we think we're going to see more growth in our category.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Cameron Mansoon-Perrone with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nCameron Mansson-Perrone: Two, if I can. The increase in accretion expectations for the year that you call in the release connected with OCESA, imply that the performance there is pacing pretty well above your expectations earlier in the year. Can you talk a little bit about what specifically has been outperforming with OCESA? And then more generally, in terms of Latin America, it's obviously been a focus for you guys. Do you feel like now with kind of touch points in Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, that you're in a position where you can kind of expand to the rest of that region organically? Or are there other kind of individual markets where it might make more sense to penetrate through M&A? Thanks.\nMichael Rapino: We think the -- kind of our global playbook has always been the same. We enter most of these markets, low cost, maybe a bolt-on promoter or festival. We end up having enough content that we can bring the tour to the market, and then we build up the flywheel once we get to that market. So in Brazil, we've got Rock In Rio, an incredible festival foundation. We now have a great touring business there, bringing artists to the ground. We've launched our sponsorship business there, and now we've just launched ticketing there. So I think it's a great combination. We'll see a continual growth in Latin America, Brazil, a big year and Argentina is crazy as the market is on ticket sales. We like the entire market down there. So you'll see us organically grow. We've always been a predominantly organic-driven business and then we'll use continual bolt-ons to keep powering and doubling up on our efforts there.\nCameron Mansson-Perrone: How about on OCESA and what's driven that outperformance?\nJoe Berchtold: I mean that spend across the board. I think on their concert side, we've done well in terms of starting to get shows on our dream platform down to Mexico. Latin artists are clearly on fire. So they've got very, very strong set of regional shows they've been doing. Their festival business is doing great. We've worked with them to get the ticketing platform enhanced and that's continuing to perform very well, and they've been bringing in sponsors. So it's really across all elements of their business, I would say, has well outperformed relative to what we thought when we acquired them or even when we thought 6 months ago, 9 months ago or now this year would be.\nMichael Rapino: Remember, we bought OCESA in COVID. We believe in the market, did we model out our IRR to think that the industry would bounce back as big as it has, no. So anything we're doing down there has been above and beyond what we expected for Latin market and industry in general overall. And we've got an incredible management team down their partnership with the CEO. They're very, very well-run organization. They've got venues, ticketing we've been able to take a really kind of archaic ticketing platform and continually reinvent it now that we're partners on the Ticketmaster side, sponsorship upgrades. So off their incredible base, our expertise and the market dynamics. It's been an incredible return.\nCameron Mansson-Perrone: If I can follow up quickly on one of those points. Is that generally a one-way bringing sponsors from elsewhere into those new markets? Or is there also kind of a reverse dynamic where you're taking local sponsors and also giving them exposure in North America, Europe that they may not have had previously?\nMichael Rapino: Yes. I don't want to say it's completely one way, but it's our global sponsorship partnership team. When you're sitting with any of these big brands you can imagine and you're trying to sell a global sponsorship that maybe they're only doing with the Olympics and F1 because there's not a lot of global properties, right, the NBA, most sports is regional. So when we can sit in that room, they know we have a big office and in a now market in Brazil, and we can get you to Rio, Sao Paulo and Mexico City and Milan. So the more major markets we can add to our pitch when we're sitting with that CEO, CMO on a global basis, it helps look at our spot ship business that we can now deliver kind of a global platform and bring bigger sponsors to some maybe local deals they had. So we'll always kind of look to replace a local deal with the global deal would be the return we look for. So adding Latin, adding Mexico City out in these markets, big markets for most big brands gives us more markets to sell our global story too.\nOperator: And our final question comes from the line of Matthew Harrigan with Benchmark Company. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Harrigan: Down to some fairly down in the [indiscernible]. You did an acquisition in March, Clockenflap in Hong Kong, a great name, by the way. Is that any sort of real expansion platform, and you did put out a release on it. Obviously, that market has -- it\u2019s still early to say the least, but is that a potential growth vector for you? And then, secondly, I guess off Peter's question earlier, some of the issues with [indiscernible] in November weren't so much that the pass could get through Verified Fan is that your network basically couldn't handle the amount of traffic that was generated. Do you feel like you've made sufficient upgrades at this point that if you have the same situation and not going to be another immediate areas too, but if there was, do you think you'd be able to scale appropriately so you didn't have the level of discount to customers? Thank you.\nJoe Berchtold: Let me take the second one first. This is Joe. Just to be very specific, what happened was there were two vectors of attack during that on-sale. One was a very large number of bots trying to crash into our verified fan system. That slowed down the fan experience, but that did not crash the system, or it could cause it to stop. At the same time, we had what was in effect the attempted cyber hack that was a brute force cyber-attack that had the fact of a dial service attack, not through our front door of our Verified Fan system, but through a specific surfer that we have. In order to fight off that cyber-attack, we had to stop the on-sale. Within 5 hours, we had figured it out how to fully reinforce the defenses to and in fact, move out the defense line so that stopping the cyber-attack. We know the attempted cyber-attack, we no longer have any load on our system for the verified fan experience, we started it back up. So the answer to your question is within 5 hours, we had solved that problem. It's not something that's taken us 6 months or 9 months to figure out how to solve. So we solved it quickly. We ultimately did sell 2 million tickets that day. And once those 5 hours were passed, while it was a long wait at times for fans because there were a lot of people trying to buy the tickets, there were not the system overload issues. I'll let Michael speak to it.\nMichael Rapino: Yes. You're deeper in the [indiscernible]. What the acquisition were you referring to? Which one?\nMatthew Harrigan: Clockenflap in Hong Kong, festival. I knew it was small, it got a little bit of a test in the trade meeting and you did put out the press release. I assume it obviously isn't that much of an expansion platform, but if you have any specifics on your ability to do anything on that market and expand more in Asia, outside of Australia and Japan, I thought that would be interesting. Thanks.\nJoe Berchtold: I would say it was part of a broad bolt-on strategy in Asia. As Michael said earlier, we'll go in and we'll look for local promoters, local festivals that we can bring on and then we can then tie in with our broader concerts platform, bring our sponsorship team into. So it was an example, I would say, of the type of activity or type of M&A that we're doing in the region.\nMichael Rapino: Just to jump on for others. I mean, we talked about Latin America, but Pacific Rim and others are equally important. It's a global business. So Japan, a real, real important market for us. Latin America, I mean, Pacific Rim in general, we're already in most of markets in some form have offices in Singapore. We've had a very successful operation in Korea, which has been kind of the foundation on why we ended up being the promoter for PTS and other [cape of] [ph] artists throughout the world. So we look at Pacific Rim equally as important is Latin America, you'll continually see us with a bolt-on promoter Venue festival as we're building up that business and driving content there also. Operator Thank you, everyone. This marks the end of the question-and-answer session, and this also concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a great day.",

            "name": "Joe Berchtold",
            "content": "Thanks, everyone, for joining us. As I think you noticed from our earnings release this time based on some feedback that we've gotten on our release and the materials in general. We've switched it up this time to get a little more comprehensive and data-driven in terms of numbers and the facts. So you see an earnings release that we reduced the narrative and increase, if I give you on a more structured basis all the key numbers and then also put a trending schedule that I think there was a link to you can get as a PDF or an Excel file, so you can track this quarter's numbers relative to history to make some of it easier. So I'll turn it over to Amy to give you a quick reminders, and then Michael and I will go straight into taking questions that folks have. Amy? So Brandon, thanks. This is Joe. For starters, as I think you probably noticed we put in the release that at this point, our confirmed shows and shows that we have offers in on our arenas, amphitheaters, stadium shows is up relative to where we are at this point last year coming into '23. So we're seeing continued growth in the show count, which should lead to continued growth in attendance. As you know, our formula is to drive that growth in attendance and from there, accelerate the AOI levels even higher with increasing per fan profitability on-site, increasing sponsorship, increasing our ticketing business. So I think we're set up for a very strong continued growth into 2024 across the board. And a lot of that activity, these are going to be the shows that have the longest lead time on. So a lot of these are going to be global in nature, cutting across both North America and international. As you noted and as I think much of the release lays out, this has been a tremendous quarter for growth in international markets up, I think it was 46% fan growth so far this year, which given that we were closed part of last year, we expected to see very strong growth. But we still think we're in the early innings. If you take Latin America, we're up about 35% this year so far year-to-date with roughly 10 million fans. But we think we're still in the early innings in South America. We launched the Town festival already sold 400,000 tickets on our way to probably 500,000 tickets, which is unheard of for a festival in its first year. So as we continue to layer on our promoting business bringing in our sponsorship business, bringing in our ticketing business throughout Latin America. That just continues to drive it forward. In North America, again, a very good year this year, and we're seeing the sort of growth that we think is possible ongoing year-to-date, up 8% in North America with the fan count expect that to be double-digit fan growth in Q3, probably verging on double-digit fan growth for the full year in North America as we're seeing top to bottom. We're seeing strong growth in theaters and clubs. Our amphitheaters are doing great, substantially up in number of fans attending per show and the high-end stadiums are doing very well. I've seen some things talking about is the middle, how is the low end demand across all of those continues to be very strong. Sure, Stephen. Thanks. I think first, just for context, I think it's important to remember a relative scale. So if you look at consumer spend, discretionary spend on goods versus experiences. As we know, it was in the high 60s in experience. I mean this is a Goldman report that talks about this. pre-pandemic and then how that has dropped and it hasn't yet caught up. So our analysis shows that the tailwind impact from getting experiences back as a portion of discretionary spend is about 10x the impact of any potential headwind coming from the student loan payments needing to get made. So we think that the tailwinds on that specific macro factor as far outweighs any headwinds. As Michael talked on a global basis, we continue to see this as a tremendous tailwind business as you have further and further globalization of demand. As we look at all the different pockets, as I mentioned earlier that the amphitheaters is an example of a mid-level act. We're seeing high single-digit increases in attendance per show, which is really driven by more lawn tickets being sold. So the people that you might say are going to be the most price conscious are continuing to spend strongly per caps growing even as we're continuing to increase our number of fans per show, which again means that even the marginal fan is continuing to spend a lot when they show up. So we're not seeing any indicators that would give us any concern on any slowdowns. Yes. As we said in the last quarter, our expectation for the full year on concerts is that you will see margin expansion relative to last year. You're correct that any fan in third-party buildings is generally going to be a lower margin than fans in our building. But the countervailing factors is that we continue to increase the per-fan profitability across all of the different venue types. So as we increase that per fan profitability through all the different ways that we have to monetize, then we're going to see some margin expansion. That comes from increased per caps on our own building, it also comes from continuing to focus on the costs. I think in particular, in North America, we've been very effective. We look at our amphitheaters, if we look at our theaters and clubs globally, we've been able to actually drive down our average operating cost per fan this year relative to last year, which certainly helps with our margins. Sure. I think the general reaction has been overwhelmingly positive. People understand that getting the all-in price upfront is absolutely the best consumer experience. I think there is a lot of concern that there will be still confusion in the marketplace because there will be a mix of all-in pricing for shows on our sites and on the primary tickets on our sites and you go to secondary sites, you'll see a different approach. So that's why we continue to support legislation that drives a consistent fan experience. Because we are the primary ticketing provider in these events, I think it's our expectation in general that even that all-in primary price is generally going to still be lower than any secondary price even without service fees. So our experience thus far in New York or Louisiana that's recently implemented it, we haven't seen any impact on our primary ticket sales. Sure. I think if you look at the overall $300 million of spend is vast majority of it would be concept-driven, 75%, 80% of it would be on the concert side. If you look then on the concert side, I would put it in 3 buckets. One is where we're doing a lot of tactical improvements across a broad set of our amphitheaters or theaters and clubs around revenue-generating opportunities, putting in new bar designs, putting in additional points of sale, things that are going to tactically help drive our APF levels. Second is, when we renew our amphitheaters or our theaters and clubs, we often go through a CapEx refresh cycle, that because we're going to have a long-term lease, we're going to be able to get a strong return off of that investment. And then, third would be the new builds where whatever level generally coming in and building out the shell and taking on that building would be the third bucket. And it's going to move around year-to-year within those 3, but those would be the 3 large buckets. And then in terms of the priorities, absolutely, international, Latin America, Asia and more in Europe is highest priority for the Venue Nation strategy. In the U.S., you benefit from having a strong arena infrastructure because NBA, NHL, their teams and their affiliate teams provide you with some of that infrastructure that you don't tend to have in the rest of the world. So this lets us both benefit from strongly attractive returns on those venues also, let's just put on more shows for more fans, because we're putting an infrastructure in place that didn't previously exist. Yes. I think it's just -- you don't yet know what Q4 looks like in terms of timing with on sales for shows next year. So I think we're confident in the $300 million number at this point with the visibility we have. When we're sitting here talking next. I think we'll have better visibility into what Q4 is and we'll guide from there. Yes. I think is a long talk. There's a lot of timing that happens with us in a given quarter. I think you saw last year a lot of the same questions. We had lower margins in the second half as we had a lot of costs associated with contract renewal cycles and other factors. So I think at this point, we're comfortable continuing to reiterate the high 30s for the margin, but not yet ready to get more specific than that. I don't think we're looking to guide in a specific margin for a specific quarter as much as just give the overall year guidance. And on the bots, certainly, new technologies allow us to continue to get more sophisticated in trying to stop the bots. We're regularly working on both the technologies as well as just new processes to try to weed out humans versus bots. Problem is some of the same technologies is also being deployed by the bad actors trying to jump the line and get those they have a $5 billion a year incentive to cheat get those tickets, which is why we've been continuing to advocate and I think we've seen a lot more visibility on some of the behavior that we need or we'd like at least more legislative support in terms of real punishments for the bad actors or the platforms that enable the bad actors, ending practices like speculative ticketing that is clearly price manipulative and anti-consumer. So we're continuing to do our part to fight it, and we hope that we'll be able to get some help with some rules and with some real penalties for people that are trying to cheat. Yes. At this point, digital ticketing is largely ubiquitous globally coming out of COVID. I haven't seen the latest numbers, but I expect it to be the 90s that are now digital tickets. It's a very informed shifting from barcodes to what we call safe ticks, which is rotating barcodes or NFC keep tickets from being counterfeited and sold over and over. So we have a number of initiatives that have launched them to use that data. We've talked extensively about some of the things we've done in marketing, bringing all of our data together to better understand the fan, how we market to that fan. How with the digital connection, we're able to market to them on behalf of our Digimaster clients, how we're able to market to them on behalf of sponsors, how we're able to send them messages for upsells when they go to shows in our buildings. So that all continues. And then in the background, we have Ticketmaster using the data that it gets for a range of, I'll call it, machine learning purposes and tools in terms of helping clients figure out how do they price their shows, how they market their shows, what are the tools that they should use can help our concert folks in terms of understanding likely demand for tours and shows in specific markets. So certainly, now it's the point where that data and now is used is permeated the business. Yes. I want to have characterized it as artists not allowing it. I mean the artists are the ones who are set the price of their tickets. It's our job to provide the information to them to help them understand the market value of their tickets, so they can figure out the balance that's right for them and their fan base in terms of pricing the tickets. So they're getting the value. Are they giving it to the fans, how do they keep it from going to the scalper. A lot of artists now I would say it's almost becoming the standard that they're understanding they should price the front of their house to capture most of the value. Otherwise, it's the scalper who's going to take it. And then they want to make sure the back of the house is priced so that every fan can afford to buy a ticket can get in. The trend we've seen coming out of COVID is, I think, a switch from it being partially used to being very ubiquitous here in North America. And then over the past year or so is becoming much more heavily adopted in international markets. I think we still have a long ways to go in international markets towards full adoption. And if you look at the pricing with platinum, there's still a substantial gap relative to average secondary pricing which would imply that artists are continuing or attempting to give a lot of the value to fans and we'll see how that evolves over time. Well, first off, again, just to keep it in context, we've long said that, first and foremost, our job is to sell the primary ticket. We're a primary ticketing company and its secondary is a kind of low to mid-teens portion of our GTV. So it's relevant, but it's also not the primary focus. We have long thought that we need to be in secondary because fans have a need to buy a ticket. And when a show is sold out if we're not giving them an option to buy a legitimate secondary ticket, then we're forcing them to go to other platforms to buy their tickets, and we think they're better off being served within the Ticketmaster ecosystem. I think as we continue to do a better job with our offer, reducing friction, understanding how to deliver on the fan needs as we've aligned with the NFL, the NBA and others on the sports side have a slightly different model for secondary. I think we've naturally grown our position in the market. But what really matters to us, first and foremost, is that we have a great primary sale, and that's managed in a way that is going to keep content happy. So first of all, on the average ticket price, I think what we've talked in the past is that the average -- the entry ticket price, so the lowest price that a fan can find a ticket at for our amphitheaters, for theaters and clubs is generally average below $35. And for the reasons that Michael spoke to, it continues to be below $35 because the artists are wanting to make sure that almost all fans can get in to see their show. And then what you've seen is because their costs have gone up because they've seen what's going on in the secondary market, some of the closer in parts of the house or have increased ticket pricing. I mean, you can see from the overall Ticketmaster, GTV and number of tickets sold that pricing in total is up double digits still year-on-year while the entry prices remain low. On the sponsorship, I'm not sure I fully understood your question. I think we've seen no slowdown in terms of our sponsorship business. We have over 90% of our expected revenue for the year is booked being driven by a lot of the large multi-asset, multimillion dollar sponsors that we work with who have long-term agreements with us that continue to go very well and continue to sign more. I mean that spend across the board. I think on their concert side, we've done well in terms of starting to get shows on our dream platform down to Mexico. Latin artists are clearly on fire. So they've got very, very strong set of regional shows they've been doing. Their festival business is doing great. We've worked with them to get the ticketing platform enhanced and that's continuing to perform very well, and they've been bringing in sponsors. So it's really across all elements of their business, I would say, has well outperformed relative to what we thought when we acquired them or even when we thought 6 months ago, 9 months ago or now this year would be. Let me take the second one first. This is Joe. Just to be very specific, what happened was there were two vectors of attack during that on-sale. One was a very large number of bots trying to crash into our verified fan system. That slowed down the fan experience, but that did not crash the system, or it could cause it to stop. At the same time, we had what was in effect the attempted cyber hack that was a brute force cyber-attack that had the fact of a dial service attack, not through our front door of our Verified Fan system, but through a specific surfer that we have. In order to fight off that cyber-attack, we had to stop the on-sale. Within 5 hours, we had figured it out how to fully reinforce the defenses to and in fact, move out the defense line so that stopping the cyber-attack. We know the attempted cyber-attack, we no longer have any load on our system for the verified fan experience, we started it back up. So the answer to your question is within 5 hours, we had solved that problem. It's not something that's taken us 6 months or 9 months to figure out how to solve. So we solved it quickly. We ultimately did sell 2 million tickets that day. And once those 5 hours were passed, while it was a long wait at times for fans because there were a lot of people trying to buy the tickets, there were not the system overload issues. I'll let Michael speak to it. I would say it was part of a broad bolt-on strategy in Asia. As Michael said earlier, we'll go in and we'll look for local promoters, local festivals that we can bring on and then we can then tie in with our broader concerts platform, bring our sponsorship team into. So it was an example, I would say, of the type of activity or type of M&A that we're doing in the region."

            "name": "Michael Rapino",
            "content": "And I'll just jump in. And Brandon, just to reiterate the pipe, right? The most important thing for us is just how does the pipe look for next year. As you know, a year ago, we sat here, and I think everyone thought '22 was the record year, and we were headed into an air pocket, and we've blown the doors off in '23. I would just step back. We believe for the next multiple years that this industry, in general, is going to have a growth surge on a global basis. We've talked to all these factors before, international, global artists, consumers. There's a whole bunch of great articles written on why there's a boom happened in a live business on a long-term basis. So we don't think this is just any COVID catch-up. We think that this is going to be the time we're live on a global basis is going to have an incredible growth run for years to come. We obviously benefit from that any time the market gets this level of growth because we'll capture that growth also. So we're looking next year, we're seeing top to bottom, as Joe said, incredible pipe of artists that will be filling all of the different venue types and markets across the world. So we think we're heading to a very, very strong 24, 25 onward, a combination of the market is going to grow, the consumer demand is growing and our ongoing bolt-on acquisitions, venues, new market entries compounded on top of our organic growth is going to give us this continual 1, 2 punch of growth for the next multiple years. On the global part, Joe -- I don't think the strategy has changed. I think if you've listened to us for the last 5 years, or longer. We've been talking about that live as a global business, the artist has been unlocked globally. Consumers, thanks to social media and others are driving global consumption with no gatekeepers. So we have 100 offices in over 40 countries. We have been on this march for a long time. And we think there's still lots of opportunity, obviously, as we talked about in Latin America, Pacific Rim, Eastern Europe. But kind of plan is following as we kind of predicted the artists would continue to go global -- more global artists and international markets would want to be just like New York and Boston would want to be hosting U2 and Beyonce's of the world, so we had an opportunity to build out those markets. So pedal down, we see lots of great growth opportunity for years to come on that front. Just to jump in on Platinum. The magic of Platinum isn't to increase the first rows. The magic of Platinum is it gives that artist the opportunity to look at the whole house. We have never, and historically jumped on an earnings call and told you we couldn't sell the first 10 rows out. Our job is always to sell the last 10 rows out in the upper nosebleeds as they call them. So what platinum has enabled the industry to do is as the artist has increased show cost and needs to get a certain gross for that night is we should figure out how to maximize some of the front of the house closer to market, but that's also let us bring the price down in the back end of the house. So the net gross can be more overall, but it's giving fans a better sell-through rate on the back end of the house. We used to be locked into kind of 3 ticket prices that didn't have that opportunity. So the biggest advantage to dynamic pricing and platinum price over the last few years was really just how do you help the whole house gets sold? How do you reduce the prices in the back end of the house? But are always the harder ones to sell so you truly get a full house on the proper gross for the artist and then all of us benefit when more people walk through those doors. We have 900 different sponsor brands. Every category you can imagine is fairly distributed evenly. So we haven't seen any sector pullback that has affected any of the core business overall. We've always said, we believe that our business is a -- it is a much less of an investment than a lot of the other TV and big campaign investments that brands make, it's a much more targeted approach. So we've seen more brands shift some of their dollars from the other categories to the event space where they can kind of get that direct consumer interaction that they can't maybe get on digital and elsewhere. So we've seen most sectors increase their spend in our category. It's been growing, and we've been growing with it. We think that trend is going to stay because as they're all trying to figure out how to connect with consumers in a digital world, we in sports live, give them that one opportunity to hit consumers at scale on a Thursday in Pittsburgh. So we think we're going to see more growth in our category. We think the -- kind of our global playbook has always been the same. We enter most of these markets, low cost, maybe a bolt-on promoter or festival. We end up having enough content that we can bring the tour to the market, and then we build up the flywheel once we get to that market. So in Brazil, we've got Rock In Rio, an incredible festival foundation. We now have a great touring business there, bringing artists to the ground. We've launched our sponsorship business there, and now we've just launched ticketing there. So I think it's a great combination. We'll see a continual growth in Latin America, Brazil, a big year and Argentina is crazy as the market is on ticket sales. We like the entire market down there. So you'll see us organically grow. We've always been a predominantly organic-driven business and then we'll use continual bolt-ons to keep powering and doubling up on our efforts there. Remember, we bought OCESA in COVID. We believe in the market, did we model out our IRR to think that the industry would bounce back as big as it has, no. So anything we're doing down there has been above and beyond what we expected for Latin market and industry in general overall. And we've got an incredible management team down their partnership with the CEO. They're very, very well-run organization. They've got venues, ticketing we've been able to take a really kind of archaic ticketing platform and continually reinvent it now that we're partners on the Ticketmaster side, sponsorship upgrades. So off their incredible base, our expertise and the market dynamics. It's been an incredible return. Yes. I don't want to say it's completely one way, but it's our global sponsorship partnership team. When you're sitting with any of these big brands you can imagine and you're trying to sell a global sponsorship that maybe they're only doing with the Olympics and F1 because there's not a lot of global properties, right, the NBA, most sports is regional. So when we can sit in that room, they know we have a big office and in a now market in Brazil, and we can get you to Rio, Sao Paulo and Mexico City and Milan. So the more major markets we can add to our pitch when we're sitting with that CEO, CMO on a global basis, it helps look at our spot ship business that we can now deliver kind of a global platform and bring bigger sponsors to some maybe local deals they had. So we'll always kind of look to replace a local deal with the global deal would be the return we look for. So adding Latin, adding Mexico City out in these markets, big markets for most big brands gives us more markets to sell our global story too. Yes. You're deeper in the [indiscernible]. What the acquisition were you referring to? Which one? Just to jump on for others. I mean, we talked about Latin America, but Pacific Rim and others are equally important. It's a global business. So Japan, a real, real important market for us. Latin America, I mean, Pacific Rim in general, we're already in most of markets in some form have offices in Singapore. We've had a very successful operation in Korea, which has been kind of the foundation on why we ended up being the promoter for PTS and other [cape of] [ph] artists throughout the world. So we look at Pacific Rim equally as important is Latin America, you'll continually see us with a bolt-on promoter Venue festival as we're building up that business and driving content there also. Operator Thank you, everyone. This marks the end of the question-and-answer session, and this also concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir.\nMichael Rapino : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. 2023 is off to a tremendous start. For the first time in 3 years, all of our markets are fully open. In the common theme, we are seeing around the world that live experiences are a high priority for fans. In Q1, we delivered record results across all divisions as well as record support for artists. Ticket sales to attendance and on-site spend, every sign points to incredible demand for live events. In the first quarter, were 19 million fans attended our shows across 45 countries and we sold over 145 million tickets with record levels of activity across all markets. We delivered revenue of $3.1 billion and AOI of $320 million, up 73% and 53%, respectively, relative to Q1 last year. In general, all my comments will be relative to Q1 last year. This performance is indicative of a continued long-term growth and set the stage for a record 2023 as we are more positive than ever about artists touring bands attending concerts to see their favorite artists and our role helping make this happen. But as clear as we look at our results and operating metrics is that global demand for live events continues to reach new heights. Demand has been growing for a long time and is showing no signs of letting up. Talking to fans, they say that live experiences are the #1 leisure activity where they expect to spend more in the future. Naturally, this is leading to record levels of activity in both our concerts and ticketing business. First in concerts, we sold nearly 90 million tickets for shows this year, tracking more than 20% ahead of this point last year. These are early sales and have been driven by a record number of stadium shows and continued strong growth in arena tours. With many major tours from Beyonce, Drake to Bruce Springsteen, demand has been so strong that even when artists add a number of additional shows, they still aren't able to meet all of the fan demand. As a further initiative to make ticket affordable to all fans, we launched today our Summer Concert Week, with $25 tickets available to nearly 4,000 shows. When fans attend shows they continue spending to enhance the experience. While our key outdoor season has not yet started, early reads from U.S. and European indoor venues that we operate demonstrate further growth in average per fan revenue. As we provide more elevated hospitality options for fans, we have launched Vibee which hosts destination events centered around live music and launched this week with the sale of the U2 Sphere VIP packages selling out. We've also continued building our Venue Nation portfolio with new venues expected to host nearly 3 million fans at 1,000 shows this year, driving long-term growth and profitability across all our businesses. Our ticketing business benefits from the same structural tailwind as concerts with further growth driven by our success in adding new clients, notably in international markets. As a result, we sold 73 million fee-bearing tickets in the first quarter, up 40% and delivered $7.7 billion in fee-bearing GTV, up 60%. We are seeing growth in both volume and pricing across our global markets. This holds true across all event types from sports to concerts and from biggest superstars to new artists. Our brand partners recognize the passion for live music has never been greater, and the Live Nation provides a unique on-site and online platform to connect with fans in meaningful ways on a global scale. And in the first quarter, we continued adding partners for 2023 and beyond, including Google Pixel, PayPal and Levi's. With this, we have commitments for over 80% of our planned sponsorship of the year.  Equally important, fans are embracing the value brands can provide to the concert experience, with around 70% of live music goers agreeing that brands can enhance their time at the show. Our team is the best in the industry at working with brands to develop programs that deliver value to fans, which in turn grows our brand relationships and attracts new ones.  Our results for the first quarter demonstrate the success of our strategy and sets us up for strong growth in 2023. We expect to host a record number of fans this year, even against a 2022 comparison which benefited from rescheduled shows attended by 20 million fans. Ticketmaster should also deliver record activity, with around 600 million tickets managed globally this year. Our sponsorship business, even after incredible growth last year, looks to be on track for double-digit AOI growth again this year. As we then look to 2024 and beyond, we have all the necessary levers to build our flywheel globally and continue to compound AOI by double-digits for the foreseeable future. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through more details.\nJoe Berchtold : Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Building on 2022, we started out this year with a record Q1, our highest first quarter revenue, AOI, fan count and ticket sales. All of our markets are fully open, selling tickets, hosting tours and connecting brands with fans. Our reported revenue of $3.1 billion for the quarter was $1.3 billion better than Q1 2022, an increase of 73%. On a constant currency basis, our revenue was $3.2 billion for the quarter. So there was roughly a 2% unfavorable impact due to the slight strengthening of the U.S. dollar, primarily against the Canadian and Australian dollars. Given the limited FX impact on our numbers, the rest of my comments will just be a reported currency. Our reported AOI of $320 million for the quarter, was $111 million better than 2022, up 53% with an improvement of $65 million in ticketing, $50 million in concerts and $26 million in sponsorship. Over half of our AOI growth came from our Asia Pacific and Latin America markets where we are expanding our global touring activity and diversifying our historical seasonality. We converted roughly 59% of this AOI to adjusted free cash flow of $190 million, which is significantly higher than our 43% conversion in Q1 2022. In our deferred revenue, a key leading indicator of growth ended this quarter at $4.4 billion, up 28% from this point last year.  Let me give a bit more color on each division. First, in concerts, we had the highest concert attendance ever for Q1 with 19.5 million fans attending our shows, up 79% compared to 2022 when we had approximately 11 million parents. Show count was 9,600 events, up 43% compared to 2022, with more fans per show due to a heavier mix of stadium and arena events and stronger than historical average attendance levels. As a result, our concerts revenue for the year grew by 89% to $2.3 billion, while we delivered $1 million in AOI, a $50 million improvement over Q1 2022. This is the beginning of what we see as a very solid year for our concert segment, including margin expansion relative to last year.  Looking a bit deeper at our fan metrics, we had strong growth across the board. Stadium attendance more than quadrupled to 3.3 million fans this quarter, up from 800,000 fans in 2022. This growth primarily came from our Asia Pacific and Latin American markets. Arena attendance was 6.7 million fans for the quarter, up $3 million or almost 80% from 2022, largely as a result of growth in Europe and Australia touring. Theater and fan club count was up 45%. And while it's not a large quarter for festivals, we did see festival fan count grow by 50% from our Mexico and Australia and New Zealand expansion. Overall, our international markets drove fan count growth, accounting for over 90% of our increase versus 2022. This was due in part to the closure still in effect in Q1 2022. That said, we expect continued strength across all global markets through 2023, along with some seasonal shift towards Q1 activity. Last year, we discussed the various cost headwinds at our operated venues and festivals. Thus far this year, cost pressures are declining and our operational cost per fan is down across our indoor buildings and we are forecasting that cost increases will remain below general inflation levels for our festivals and amphitheaters. As a result of these improved conditions, we expect overall profitability per fan will again increase this year as cost increases are more than mitigated by increasing average revenue per fan, pricing and on-site sponsorship. Next, in ticketing, where our numbers reflect growing fan demand for live experiences. In Q1 2023, we sold $72.6 million fee-bearing tickets, up 21 million tickets or 41% compared to 2022. Nearly 2/3 of the growth was driven by concert tickets as North America concert ticket sales increased by 35%, while international concert ticket sales increased even more by 65%. With this increased ticket volume GTV for the quarter was $7.7 billion, up 60% compared to 2022. At peak sales times during the quarter, Ticketmaster sold 15,000 tickets per minute in North America with more than 20 million fee-bearing tickets sold each month globally. And in Q1, over 99.9% of all TM transactions were processed without any issues. While secondary ticketing volume grew at a similar rate, ours continues to be largely a primary ticketing business with secondary ticketing accounting for only a mid-teens percent of our overall GTV. With these growing ticket sales, revenue for the quarter was $678 million and AOI was $271 million, delivering margin of 40%. It's hard to compare these margins to Q1 of last year, given the geographic mix shift and increased cost of ramping our staff back up over the course of last year. But these margins are ahead of our full year 2022 numbers, and we expect margins for the full year to continue being in the high 30s. On the pricing front, average ticket prices on primary tickets rose by 16% compared to Q1 of 2022, driven by fan demand for the best seats, particularly at concerts. Average secondary ticket prices remain close to double that of a primary ticket continuing to show the extent to which concerts and other live events remain price below market value. We also saw revenue from nonservice fees grow double digits as we further build ancillary revenue streams, including insurance, upgrades and other upsells. Lastly, so far this year, we have signed clients accounting for nearly 8 million net new tickets, up 15% compared to this point last year, positioning us for ongoing growth. Finally, in our sponsorship business, top line revenue improved by $54 million or 47% to $170 million in Q1. Our AOI for this high-margin business was $96 million, up 37%. Sponsorship's growth during the quarter was driven by the reopening of international markets that were closed in Q1 of last year, the increase in high-profile artists on sales that attract premium marketing partners and the expansion of our venue network. We had double-digit growth in both on-site and online sponsorship with on-site sponsorship representing most of our AOI growth year-over-year. From a geographic perspective, our international markets delivered 54% growth in the quarter while North America had 26% growth. Contributing to our sustained growth since last year has been our strategic sponsors to generate over $1 million of revenue in the year. Relative to Q1 of last year, our number of strategic sponsors grew by 15%, while the revenue from those partners rose by over 20%. These marketing partnerships now account for 85% of our total sponsorship revenues. Sponsorship margins were slightly lower than average during the quarter as we had higher variable expenses due to artist activation costs for A-list talent presales with tickets sold for these key sponsor programs 4x that of last year. As timing plays out, we anticipate that for the full year, variable expenses and margins will be in line with 2022.  A few other points on 2023. We continue to project that CapEx will be approximately $450 million this year, with 2/3 on revenue-generating projects, including new venue builds and renewals as well as other organic investments to support growth. The remaining 1/3 is on maintenance CapEx as we catch up on deferred 2020 and 2021 maintenance. We ended the quarter with $2.4 billion of available liquidity between free cash an untapped revolver capacity, giving us ample flexibility to continue investing in growth. We're comfortable with our leverage, particularly given the AOI growth ahead with approximately 87% of our debt at a fixed rate with an average cost of debt of roughly 4.7%. In addition, the majority of our debt is long dated and nothing is maturing within the next 18 months. The only notable change to our below-the-line guidance from Q1 is on accretion due largely to a set as impressive growth above previous projections, we estimate that accretion will be approximately 40% higher in 2022, and this should be factored into your EPS estimates. At this point, we don't expect any material FX impact on revenue or AOI for the year. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan.\nDavid Karnovsky : Michael, Joe, we've seen a couple of bills introduced in Congress to address ticketing practices and contracts. So wondering first, how you think some of these items might impact your business, assuming they were fully enforced. And then just based on meetings you've had do you think these bills largely meet the primary concerns of lawmakers as you've come to understand.\nMichael Rapino : Yes, we're kind of watching what's going on. And we believe that through all of the noise, most people are ending up in the industry and politics at exactly where we are and the principles of what the FAIR Act is, so whether it's all in pricing, cleaning up deceptive practices and the secondary, giving artists more tools, those seem to be all the common themes coming out in all of these different bills, which we're fully supportive of. And having our own build of FAIR Act. We know Senator Cantwell and Cruz introduced theirs. [Neil] has got a bill coming in a senator Klobuchar and Cornyn. These are all in the same vein and the same thematic around helping the artist control their ticket and get them in the hands of the fans and be away of some of the practices and the secondary and the spec selling deceptive sites hopefully, better protection on BOTS, and we've always supported all in pricing. So this is not LN versus any of these. We are aligned to all of these bills. We think all of these bills, we've said continually for a long time, is better for our business because it helps us deliver a better on sale and fan experience. So right now, it's the Wild West, we're doing our best, but any bills and these natures that start putting some better regulations and controls around the experience is going to help our overall business.\nDavid Karnovsky : Okay. Then I was hoping you can expand a bit more on Vibee. Maybe can you frame the opportunity -- is this something you plan to build primarily for your major festivals and residencies, or is this -- is there a wider opportunity across your promotional footprint? And then just interested what drove the decision to kind of build this out internally versus maybe putting that out to bid for an events partner.\nMichael Rapino : Yes, we look at this segment overall. If you look at what we've been talking about on our Investor Day for the last few years, the premium business is a huge opportunity for us. I think I've said any time this is an industry that has done a great job of being scaled GA, but not done a great job of doing a premium experience for customers. The sports and new arenas and stadiums are doing a great job on that. But as an industry, like nation and the music industry has not done that. And we think there's a great opportunity overall to launch more products and services that can provide a better premium experience for the customer. So this would just be an extension and a continual strategy towards what we call the premium experience. We've got a company called VIP Nation. We'll do about 1,000 of those events this year. Those are based around the concert and the tour and going to a sound check or early experience or a meet and greet. So we've been the leader in that space and expanding that Ticketmaster's launch, Ticketmaster travel, looking at ways we can put both the ticket and an airline or hotel together and take advantage of that scale, and we've been testing that in the UK with great success. And Vibee is another product where we looked at Poland and we looked at on location and CID and Clint and others that were doing it. The difference is we have the scale, but we already have been doing it. We have the expertise. So we looked at our Insomniac team and built up [Body] launched it with the U2 experience sold out or close to $20 million in ticket sales around a high-end premium experience. So we have the in-house expertise, and this is another product in our ongoing strategy, whether it's clubs, premium memberships, premium clubs, subscriptions, all the ways we're going to continue to look to say how do we from the GA into a premium experience product. I know there's also the challenge of some of these other companies have is the expensive part about doing this is the right, and we don't have that problem. So when you're chasing the Olympic rights you're chasing a business for premium, it's a little harder unless you're in-house. So I'm sure our location does fabulous with their UFC experiences files, we don't have to pay rights. These are our rights. So we can do it in-house. We don't have to outsource it and split any of that upside with anyone else but our own businesses.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. \nBrandon Ross : One on your fundamentals and then a follow-up to David's question on the sales and Congress. Actually, I'll start with that one. I think the Klobuchar bill very specifically attacks your venue exclusivity. Can you kind of just respond to that, Bill? And how important is the venue exclusivity model for you in North America? And then kind of on the fundamentals, last year was obviously a pretty depressed year in terms of constant margins. I know you take the word margins, Joe, but we'll go with it anyway. Is -- should we see a real bounce back in that and continuing type of from 2030 and beyond into future years.\nJoe Berchtold : First of all, on the exclusivity point, I think first point I should make is, congratulations on the birth of your daughter. Glad to hear, everybody is doing well. But to the exclusivity point, I always start with, these are the venues rights. And the venues have been figuring out over time, how do they best monetize certain rights they have. What they have determined is the best way to monetize those rights in the U.S. is by actioning them off for exclusivity. So I think it's, frankly, primarily were there to be any changes in exclusivity it's venues that would be hurt the most because they would lose the ability to fully maximize their rights. We're very confident with the quality of our systems, its ability to handle on sales in a way that no other system can do has been shown both by the clients that we've been adding as well as you've seen in the press issues that other systems have with very modest on sales. So we're very confident in our ability to deliver. I think it's uncertain any bill, in today's Congress, not just this one, but any bill that doesn't have bipartisan support out of the gate as its challenges. But more fundamentally, I think that you'd see the venues respond to that and probably push back because they would be hurt a lot more than we would. In terms of the performance of the business, I tried to give a lot of details in there. I think that, as you know, first of all, we look more at the cash profitability of the business, where that is, how that's operating on a basis, which, as I said, we expect to continue to grow this year. I also noted, I think, in the concert side, the last year was a bottom tick in terms of our margins. We expect it to be coming back this year. We don't assess over margins because, for instance, this year, we expect to be having a great stadium and arena year, as you could tell by the numbers we already gave for that's inherently going to be a lower-margin business than one of our amputate customers. We're still going to pursue that business, still a great business, but it impacts technically the margin, while generating cash profitability. So I think that we're on an upward trajectory. I think '23 is going to be great. And every very early sign we have for '24 is continued success.\nBrandon Ross : Just one quick follow-up to that comment. I think there's concern about lapping the supply side for next year. Do you feel good the supply side coming out of the '22 and '23. I know you get asked this question every year as things grow. But do you feel confident with what you're seeing so far? That\u2019s all.\nMichael Rapino : Yes. Yes. We -- as you know, yes, we live this in the -- I think the fall was all about the air pocket and would there be enough shows in '23. So hopefully, we put that to bed. We don't think this has anything to do with pent-up demand or COVID rescheduling. That stuff has long been clushed out in '22. This is all about regular business back to business. And I think we're thrilled that we're sitting here looking of a comparable last year but basically had almost 1.5 years combined into a year because of all those rescheduled shows at 20 million. To be sitting here today above and beyond last year's numbers, shows the global strength of the business, and it also shows the global strength of the business from the amphitheater and the stadium to the club to the festival. We're looking at all territories around the world. Firing on all cylinders. We're looking at the kind of talent you see on the road right now. This isn't just The Rolling Stones, right? The question we always have to fight off, six of the top 10 artists were younger artists. You look at Lollapalooza Coachella with Bad Bunny, Carol G, Rosalina, the BLACKPINK, the BTSs, Billie Eilish. I mean there's just a host of great new talent every year coming up, filling the pipe that we didn't know Luke Combs was going to be selling stadiums out this year, two years ago. We had no idea Bad Bunny was going to be the largest selling artists last year. So we just continue to see the supply/demand, we think, for the future, is really, really strong. There's more and more artists sitting in the studio right now on TikTok. The greater economy is alive and low and they all want to be the next bad money. And we said it before, we're also seeing this encouraging new supply strategy where for many years, it was all about a U.S. or UK-based artists that filled the charts and fill the stadium. And most other talent was domestic. It might have been big in Canada, it might have been big in area, but it didn't travel. This is the real breakout year where the world and the consumer are truly global. And now you can see artists coming from Latin America and Korea and becoming global superstars. That didn't happen for the last 30 years. It was a very top U.S. or UK controlled industry. So we think that alone gives the next kick to the supply chain for the next 10 years of young talent from -- it will be from India, South Africa, it's going to be everywhere overnight finding their way to TikTok and Spotify and other places to become these global stars that are still in arenas and stadiums out in their markets.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs.\nStephen Laszczyk : Maybe for Michael, on underlying contract demand, setting aside the stadium and arena tours for the moment. Can you maybe talk about how demand for the average or even smaller amphitheater or club show is trending compared to what we saw for those types of shows last year? I think there's some concern that maybe the top shows are performing well this year, but it's perhaps coming at the expense of the smaller ones. So just love to hear your thoughts on how those smaller and average size shows are performing?\nJoe Berchtold : Yes, Stephen, Yes. Just to give you the feel on that, we don't have a lot of amphitheaters yet just in the first quarter. But if you look at our theaters and clubs, which tend to be pretty strong at this point of the year, they're tracking around 8% ahead in terms of average attendance per show. We're doing that with also increased pricing, lower cost structure on a per fan basis. So those shows are performing very well for us.\nMichael Rapino : And just to jump on Joe there. Unlike the movie theater kind of model, we're not a hit-driven industry, right, where we are a truly scaled business. And you're right, we looked at -- the Beyonces of the world are always going to do the great numbers. But when you're sitting here today, looking at even our festivals, the Lollapaloozas are the easy ones, but we have over 200 festivals, Bonnaroos to one-day festivals in smaller markets to our U.S. and international businesses. And all of it seems to be doing really, really well. So whether it's a middle of a road festival in a smaller market, whether it's a club act. At all levels, there seems to be incredible demand and on a global basis. So we haven't seen just the top stuff selling and they're not coming to the other stuff. The demand seems to be uniformed from clubs to stadiums from Pittsburgh to Milan. \nStephen Laszczyk : Great. And then maybe just one on the venues business. You called out in the press release, I think you expect to host 3 million incremental fans at new Live Nation venues this year. I'm curious, maybe for Joe, if you look at ambitions on the venue side, how many incremental fans or shows you think you can add to the flywheel over the next couple of years, maybe just given how the venue pipeline stands today? \nJoe Berchtold : Yes. I think this year would be typical in what we would hope to add in the low millions per year from our own venues with a mix of some new amphitheaters, new arenas at the larger end, while continuing to build out the club and theater portfolio. So it continues to be a meaningful part of it and more robust. As I said earlier, you can scale the stadiums and arenas faster. But over time, we've learned we can deliver a very accretive return for our shareholders by operating it and being able to count the beer money and the sponsorship money as well. \nMichael Rapino : And I think we laid that out in our November Investor Day, probably on a more macro level. We wanted to remind investors, we've been doing this for a long time. We have a large venue portfolio we don't see that strategy changing. It's not incrementally different than it's been year after year. We bolt on and continue to look around the world at opportunist markets where there's a great return, and we keep adding a venue club theater an arena, if we can find the right market like Austin, where it's a big return. So we'll continue that strategy over time. And I think we laid out in November cleaner in terms of how many and what numbers we look to subscribe to over time. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi.\nJason Bazinet : I just had a question about your cash balance, seems like used to run, I don't know, $0.5 billion or something and it's been 4x that or something over the last year. Do you just think that in the spirit of being cautious that it just makes sense to have more cash on hand? Or do you think there's some flexibility to deploy it in one way or another?\nJoe Berchtold : No, I think just to make sure you have the cash numbers right, I think those cash numbers included untapped revolver capacity, right? So from that metric, it's probably not quite that extreme, but we continue to see a very strong set of opportunities to continue growing the business. We just talked about the venue business, which we've been in, but we think on a global basis has a lot of great opportunities to continue to build out the portfolio. And we think even within our existing portfolio, there's a lot of things that we can do to enhance the fan experience as Michael was talking about. So at the moment, we're maybe being a little conservative coming out of COVID, but looking to continue to grow the business, and we'll continue to assess it and see what the right options are. \nJason Bazinet : Can I just ask one follow-up. One of the more interesting things to me, looking at your stock price is, it seems so depressed relative to the fundamentals you guys have been putting up for the last year or so part of the DOJ related part of it fears of sort of of pent-up demand. But I was just surprised that you guys didn't sort of take advantage of that seeming disconnect with share repurchases.\nJoe Berchtold : Yes. I think the flip side of -- share repurchases tactically is one thing. I think we've also seen a lot of companies out there that embark on share repurchases and the market takes that as a signal that they are out of growth ideas. And I think that we have such a robust set of growth ideas that we wouldn't want that to be misunderstood. Secondly, when you invest in growth, you deliver compounded returns over time, you can maybe get an attractive return from a stock if you think there's a dislocation but you lose out on the accretive compounding impact that you can have by investing in these growth opportunities. As I said, I think we'll continue to look at all the options as we move forward. But I think in the immediacy of coming out of it, that's been our thought process. .\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Stephen Glagola with TD Cowen. \nStephen Glagola : Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael and Joe. Just -- I had two specific questions around the proposed legislation and how that's going to potentially could potentially impact your business. So one on prohibition of ticket and exclusivity with venues. Can you just provide like, I guess, your color on the competitive position of Ticketmaster in international markets that you operate on an allocation or nonexclusive model, just to kind of glean insights on how the U.S. could be from that, like how renewals are trending there and new business there, one? And then two, on this Junk Fee Protection Act, I believe there's a provision that the FTC can determine if mandatory ticketing fees are excessive. So I just wanted to know how would fee caps impact your service fee revenue. Would that impact more than what the venue collects or what the primary ticketing service collects as well? \nMichael Rapino : I think you need to go to some of the [Bob Roux] interview. It will help you. The venue drivers, as Joe said, this is the venue business. I know everyone wants to subscribe at the end demand, most of the service fee and kind of do the auction for the ticket. So Again, we think that the venue that's built in the $1 billion arena or the multibillion dollar stadium in that market, I think he's going to continually be pretty strong and vocal about his rights and returns on what companies he can hire exclusively or not to service his business, so whether it's Microsoft or CRM or Salesforce or Ticketmaster. I think they're going to look at all their options for their best return for their business. So we look at that from that perspective.  We look at Europe just because we've always thrown out really lightly that international as an allocation in the U.S. is here. Just kind of for the trend, International is moving more towards an exclusive model than away from it as new buildings are being built over there and you're building your arena, which really had been underdeveloped. It was mostly a soccer business or football. But as the new buildings are getting built, they are looking over here and realizing that this is another revenue stream that they should be leveraging. So I look at international probably moving closer to the U.S. model in the U.S. model moving to the international model because I think they're now realizing that they've been under valuing their exclusive ticketing rights for their venues. Now we do really well over there because we always will do well in an open market with the best technology. We sell more tickets than the competitor. So if you're an open allocated market and you're going to allocate to us and others, we're going to do really, really well because we're going to be the 1 that probably sells the most tickets for you, so you'll end up allocating more to us. But we don't think that model probably ends up here, more driven by the venue agenda than the ticketing agenda.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. \nDavid Katz : Thanks for including covered a lot, but I was hoping you could just talk about the secondary ticketing market, which seems to be an area of growth for new smaller entities, other approaches, technologies, et cetera. And I know you've talked about in the past how what their impact is on the market. What's new with respect to that? What can you do about it to protect yourselves better? And I'd just love an update there, please, if you could.\nMichael Rapino : I'll jump and then Joe will -- I just want to remind what we said earlier, of all the legislative noise, we've been swirling around for 6 months. The common theme in all of this legislation that you're seeing come forward is around limiting and putting some handcuffs around the scalper and the business. So we do see a lot of this legislation moving forward is going to help the primary ticket, the content holder, do a better job on that front. And it will be harder for the scalper or the BOT, deceptive website, spec selling, a lot of practices, drip selling, et cetera. So we do think that overall, this market right now, legislatively, is moving against the secondary business in general, not going to ban it, not going to cap it, but some of the cleanup legislation does help primary hertz secondary. That's a big move that hasn't happened in the last 10, 15 years.\nJoe Berchtold : Yes. I think the other piece is you have to remember that secondary for sports is very different than secondary in concert. Secondary and sports is often used as a distribution platform where you sell the season and ticket to the scalpers, they disaggregate it and they're performing a function for the sports teams of guaranteeing them some upfront funding that has value to the teams, the value to the fans. You don't have that in concerts. The concerts, the issue is that they're using illegal and deceptive practices to get tickets with the sole objective of increasing the price and selling them to the fans. So I think what you're seeing is because the artists don't have the same sort of collective central power that a league does today, they can set up an NFL ticket exchange, you need to give the power back to the artists. So it's very clear that they can be the decision-maker. And then it becomes the onus of the secondary players to figure out how they're adding value. Like any other business today, you have to survive and adapt and grow because you're adding value to others in your ecosystem. That hasn't been what -- how the scalpers have done it in music over the past several years, and it's finally gotten another point where you're getting the put back now from the artists, and that's being fully understood by our politicians.\nDavid Katz : Thank you. And to say next quarter would be understating beating by $100 million. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Swinburne : Two questions. Michael, you also mentioned, I think, in your prepared remarks that the secondary prices are running about 2x primary. Last year, I think it was last year, sort of that Bruce Springsteen moment about market pricing expectations that more artists would embrace that. I was wondering if you could just sort of update us today on sort of the trend in market pricing on primary and sort of pricing back house, front of house the right way and where you feel the industry is and the business is today? And then secondly, you guys are always thinking pretty far ahead around technology. What are your thoughts on AI as an opportunity for Live Nation? Just broadly, it's obviously a huge topic these days. So would love to hear what you think.\nMichael Rapino : Perfect. On pricing, I think we've been saying it for the last few years, the great transparency and sunlight of secondary has really helped the artists and the management team look at their pricing models. Historically, it was a fairly static pricing, three different maybe price points, same price points all across the country. It matter if there was a Friday in New York or Tuesday in Pittsburgh. So the business has gotten really, really sophisticated with our PriceMaster or different dynamic models that artists can now use. So we see that there's still years away between where the artist markets, the price and what the market is willing to pay. The artist is one of the few products in the world that's worth more than it's sold, but they do that for their brand and accessibility. And I think that will continue. But I do think we've seen the artists looking at their ticket price and the whole manifest and how do we bring the prices down in the back, bring the prices up in the front, so we can sell out and make sure everyone gets a ticket at an affordable price, but let's not let secondary runway of the front row. So we think that we're still dramatically underpriced versus demand, and you see that every day on the secondary. And we think that's probably going to live for the next 5 to 10 years as the artist moves closer to market, probably never gets to market. But between here and where they feel comfortable, we think there's years of upside that they'll continue to look at. AI, Joe, you can talk about the TM. \nJoe Berchtold : Yes. Yes. I think on AI, just to be clear, I think it's all upside for us. There's no concern that somehow AI can never replace the live experience. For us, it's a -- I consider it an infrastructure tool for both efficiency and effectiveness. So if you think about using AI on recommendations, much better marketing much better individual recommendation in terms of making you aware of shows that you might want to go to. Clearly, we're using machine learning now to help inform models on suggesting pricing that we were just talking about. AI is just the same thing to the next level of data input through that machine learning process. It will help us automate a lot of tools, the event creation process that takes place at every venue being able to use much better data, machine learning, whatever what's going on elsewhere in the PM system will make that more efficient. All the chatbots that you have today, those will go to a whole another level of effectiveness, working with fans and be at a much lower cost than you have today. And then as we're fighting bots using AI to continue in our battles, to make sure we know who's a person or try to know who's a person, Brit, who's not. So it kind of runs throughout all of our infrastructure. It's a lot of places that we're using machine learning today AI is really that to the next level.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of John Healy with Northcoast Research.\nJohn Healy : I just wanted to ask a question on kind of the pace of growth. I mean when we look at deferred revenue, I think it's up almost 30%. You talked about the concert ticket sales at this point, up 20%. Any help to you could give us just on if you think that type of pace of growth can be sustained this year. I think the message is clear, it's going to be a strong year, but would just love to get a little color and flavor about kind of the speed of what you could grow this year.\nJoe Berchtold : Yes. I think that you generally start the year coming out of the gate fastest when you're led by stadiums and arenas. So that -- those are the shows that we've long talked about put on sale earliest relative to the show date. So you've got great scalability in the stadiums, which are seeing 4x the level of activity, good scalability in your arenas. So that's driving your huge increase in attendance, strong increase in ticket sales at $90 million in your deferred revenue. I think as you get into more of the shows that take place in our buildings, across the festivals, amphitheaters to some extent a you generally have a lower level of scalability. You still have very solid growth, but not the same level as you have with your stadiums and arenas. So I don't think we're ready to try to declare an exact number, but I think we recognize the level you have in Q1 is probably going to be the high point of the year. .\nMichael Rapino : And I think -- sorry, I just want to jump on there for one second, John. And just what's more important to us is just helping both sides realize what's the future in '24 on. So we went through -- obviously, COVID was down and last year was an extraordinary year. The Hut does '23 and '24 start to look. And we're very optimistic. We look at this year as being a very strong year coming off what people probably thought we couldn't be last year. We think '24 into forward, you kind of look at what we historically have delivered. We've been a high single industry growth business and a high single-digit revenue AOI business year after year for many years. And we look at going forward, we think we're back to being a great strong growth business year-over-year off this foundation of business. So we think the industry is back bigger than ever. And we think there's years of industry growth we've shown you when the industry grows, we tend to do a rise with that tide and capture as much as industry growth or we tend to do a couple of points better. So industry has been growing about 8% or 9% a year. We tend to beat it. We look at this as a long-term continual growth story again.\nJohn Healy : Great. And then just a big picture question I wanted to ask. I think you called out APAC and Latin America is fueling some growth at the start of the year. Just as you think about those businesses long term, is it safe to say that as they become a bigger piece of the pie, the margin level of the business should rise. Are those -- I always thought those businesses had potential to be maybe higher margin than the U.S. market, but was just kind of curious how thinking about those as they sit today.\nJoe Berchtold : Yes. I don't think we start with thinking about it as margin. We think about them as being massive growth potential markets, probably the least developed of our major markets. So having great growth opportunity to continue to drive more fans, and more obviously, highly profitable fans. As we establish more venues in those markets, I am sure that you can get some attractive margin operability as you operate, but I think more than starting with any margin focus we're looking at just what's the volume of fans and what's the overall concerts, ticketing, sponsorship, profitability, we can drive off that.\nOperator: At this time, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. Now I would like to turn the floor back over to Michael Rapino for any closing comments.\nMichael Rapino : Appreciate everyone. Thank you. We'll talk to you in the summer.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.",

            "name": "Joe Berchtold",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Building on 2022, we started out this year with a record Q1, our highest first quarter revenue, AOI, fan count and ticket sales. All of our markets are fully open, selling tickets, hosting tours and connecting brands with fans. Our reported revenue of $3.1 billion for the quarter was $1.3 billion better than Q1 2022, an increase of 73%. On a constant currency basis, our revenue was $3.2 billion for the quarter. So there was roughly a 2% unfavorable impact due to the slight strengthening of the U.S. dollar, primarily against the Canadian and Australian dollars. Given the limited FX impact on our numbers, the rest of my comments will just be a reported currency. Our reported AOI of $320 million for the quarter, was $111 million better than 2022, up 53% with an improvement of $65 million in ticketing, $50 million in concerts and $26 million in sponsorship. Over half of our AOI growth came from our Asia Pacific and Latin America markets where we are expanding our global touring activity and diversifying our historical seasonality. We converted roughly 59% of this AOI to adjusted free cash flow of $190 million, which is significantly higher than our 43% conversion in Q1 2022. In our deferred revenue, a key leading indicator of growth ended this quarter at $4.4 billion, up 28% from this point last year.  Let me give a bit more color on each division. First, in concerts, we had the highest concert attendance ever for Q1 with 19.5 million fans attending our shows, up 79% compared to 2022 when we had approximately 11 million parents. Show count was 9,600 events, up 43% compared to 2022, with more fans per show due to a heavier mix of stadium and arena events and stronger than historical average attendance levels. As a result, our concerts revenue for the year grew by 89% to $2.3 billion, while we delivered $1 million in AOI, a $50 million improvement over Q1 2022. This is the beginning of what we see as a very solid year for our concert segment, including margin expansion relative to last year.  Looking a bit deeper at our fan metrics, we had strong growth across the board. Stadium attendance more than quadrupled to 3.3 million fans this quarter, up from 800,000 fans in 2022. This growth primarily came from our Asia Pacific and Latin American markets. Arena attendance was 6.7 million fans for the quarter, up $3 million or almost 80% from 2022, largely as a result of growth in Europe and Australia touring. Theater and fan club count was up 45%. And while it's not a large quarter for festivals, we did see festival fan count grow by 50% from our Mexico and Australia and New Zealand expansion. Overall, our international markets drove fan count growth, accounting for over 90% of our increase versus 2022. This was due in part to the closure still in effect in Q1 2022. That said, we expect continued strength across all global markets through 2023, along with some seasonal shift towards Q1 activity. Last year, we discussed the various cost headwinds at our operated venues and festivals. Thus far this year, cost pressures are declining and our operational cost per fan is down across our indoor buildings and we are forecasting that cost increases will remain below general inflation levels for our festivals and amphitheaters. As a result of these improved conditions, we expect overall profitability per fan will again increase this year as cost increases are more than mitigated by increasing average revenue per fan, pricing and on-site sponsorship. Next, in ticketing, where our numbers reflect growing fan demand for live experiences. In Q1 2023, we sold $72.6 million fee-bearing tickets, up 21 million tickets or 41% compared to 2022. Nearly 2/3 of the growth was driven by concert tickets as North America concert ticket sales increased by 35%, while international concert ticket sales increased even more by 65%. With this increased ticket volume GTV for the quarter was $7.7 billion, up 60% compared to 2022. At peak sales times during the quarter, Ticketmaster sold 15,000 tickets per minute in North America with more than 20 million fee-bearing tickets sold each month globally. And in Q1, over 99.9% of all TM transactions were processed without any issues. While secondary ticketing volume grew at a similar rate, ours continues to be largely a primary ticketing business with secondary ticketing accounting for only a mid-teens percent of our overall GTV. With these growing ticket sales, revenue for the quarter was $678 million and AOI was $271 million, delivering margin of 40%. It's hard to compare these margins to Q1 of last year, given the geographic mix shift and increased cost of ramping our staff back up over the course of last year. But these margins are ahead of our full year 2022 numbers, and we expect margins for the full year to continue being in the high 30s. On the pricing front, average ticket prices on primary tickets rose by 16% compared to Q1 of 2022, driven by fan demand for the best seats, particularly at concerts. Average secondary ticket prices remain close to double that of a primary ticket continuing to show the extent to which concerts and other live events remain price below market value. We also saw revenue from nonservice fees grow double digits as we further build ancillary revenue streams, including insurance, upgrades and other upsells. Lastly, so far this year, we have signed clients accounting for nearly 8 million net new tickets, up 15% compared to this point last year, positioning us for ongoing growth. Finally, in our sponsorship business, top line revenue improved by $54 million or 47% to $170 million in Q1. Our AOI for this high-margin business was $96 million, up 37%. Sponsorship's growth during the quarter was driven by the reopening of international markets that were closed in Q1 of last year, the increase in high-profile artists on sales that attract premium marketing partners and the expansion of our venue network. We had double-digit growth in both on-site and online sponsorship with on-site sponsorship representing most of our AOI growth year-over-year. From a geographic perspective, our international markets delivered 54% growth in the quarter while North America had 26% growth. Contributing to our sustained growth since last year has been our strategic sponsors to generate over $1 million of revenue in the year. Relative to Q1 of last year, our number of strategic sponsors grew by 15%, while the revenue from those partners rose by over 20%. These marketing partnerships now account for 85% of our total sponsorship revenues. Sponsorship margins were slightly lower than average during the quarter as we had higher variable expenses due to artist activation costs for A-list talent presales with tickets sold for these key sponsor programs 4x that of last year. As timing plays out, we anticipate that for the full year, variable expenses and margins will be in line with 2022.  A few other points on 2023. We continue to project that CapEx will be approximately $450 million this year, with 2/3 on revenue-generating projects, including new venue builds and renewals as well as other organic investments to support growth. The remaining 1/3 is on maintenance CapEx as we catch up on deferred 2020 and 2021 maintenance. We ended the quarter with $2.4 billion of available liquidity between free cash an untapped revolver capacity, giving us ample flexibility to continue investing in growth. We're comfortable with our leverage, particularly given the AOI growth ahead with approximately 87% of our debt at a fixed rate with an average cost of debt of roughly 4.7%. In addition, the majority of our debt is long dated and nothing is maturing within the next 18 months. The only notable change to our below-the-line guidance from Q1 is on accretion due largely to a set as impressive growth above previous projections, we estimate that accretion will be approximately 40% higher in 2022, and this should be factored into your EPS estimates. At this point, we don't expect any material FX impact on revenue or AOI for the year. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator? First of all, on the exclusivity point, I think first point I should make is, congratulations on the birth of your daughter. Glad to hear, everybody is doing well. But to the exclusivity point, I always start with, these are the venues rights. And the venues have been figuring out over time, how do they best monetize certain rights they have. What they have determined is the best way to monetize those rights in the U.S. is by actioning them off for exclusivity. So I think it's, frankly, primarily were there to be any changes in exclusivity it's venues that would be hurt the most because they would lose the ability to fully maximize their rights. We're very confident with the quality of our systems, its ability to handle on sales in a way that no other system can do has been shown both by the clients that we've been adding as well as you've seen in the press issues that other systems have with very modest on sales. So we're very confident in our ability to deliver. I think it's uncertain any bill, in today's Congress, not just this one, but any bill that doesn't have bipartisan support out of the gate as its challenges. But more fundamentally, I think that you'd see the venues respond to that and probably push back because they would be hurt a lot more than we would. In terms of the performance of the business, I tried to give a lot of details in there. I think that, as you know, first of all, we look more at the cash profitability of the business, where that is, how that's operating on a basis, which, as I said, we expect to continue to grow this year. I also noted, I think, in the concert side, the last year was a bottom tick in terms of our margins. We expect it to be coming back this year. We don't assess over margins because, for instance, this year, we expect to be having a great stadium and arena year, as you could tell by the numbers we already gave for that's inherently going to be a lower-margin business than one of our amputate customers. We're still going to pursue that business, still a great business, but it impacts technically the margin, while generating cash profitability. So I think that we're on an upward trajectory. I think '23 is going to be great. And every very early sign we have for '24 is continued success. Yes, Stephen, Yes. Just to give you the feel on that, we don't have a lot of amphitheaters yet just in the first quarter. But if you look at our theaters and clubs, which tend to be pretty strong at this point of the year, they're tracking around 8% ahead in terms of average attendance per show. We're doing that with also increased pricing, lower cost structure on a per fan basis. So those shows are performing very well for us. Yes. I think this year would be typical in what we would hope to add in the low millions per year from our own venues with a mix of some new amphitheaters, new arenas at the larger end, while continuing to build out the club and theater portfolio. So it continues to be a meaningful part of it and more robust. As I said earlier, you can scale the stadiums and arenas faster. But over time, we've learned we can deliver a very accretive return for our shareholders by operating it and being able to count the beer money and the sponsorship money as well. No, I think just to make sure you have the cash numbers right, I think those cash numbers included untapped revolver capacity, right? So from that metric, it's probably not quite that extreme, but we continue to see a very strong set of opportunities to continue growing the business. We just talked about the venue business, which we've been in, but we think on a global basis has a lot of great opportunities to continue to build out the portfolio. And we think even within our existing portfolio, there's a lot of things that we can do to enhance the fan experience as Michael was talking about. So at the moment, we're maybe being a little conservative coming out of COVID, but looking to continue to grow the business, and we'll continue to assess it and see what the right options are. Yes. I think the flip side of -- share repurchases tactically is one thing. I think we've also seen a lot of companies out there that embark on share repurchases and the market takes that as a signal that they are out of growth ideas. And I think that we have such a robust set of growth ideas that we wouldn't want that to be misunderstood. Secondly, when you invest in growth, you deliver compounded returns over time, you can maybe get an attractive return from a stock if you think there's a dislocation but you lose out on the accretive compounding impact that you can have by investing in these growth opportunities. As I said, I think we'll continue to look at all the options as we move forward. But I think in the immediacy of coming out of it, that's been our thought process. . Yes. I think the other piece is you have to remember that secondary for sports is very different than secondary in concert. Secondary and sports is often used as a distribution platform where you sell the season and ticket to the scalpers, they disaggregate it and they're performing a function for the sports teams of guaranteeing them some upfront funding that has value to the teams, the value to the fans. You don't have that in concerts. The concerts, the issue is that they're using illegal and deceptive practices to get tickets with the sole objective of increasing the price and selling them to the fans. So I think what you're seeing is because the artists don't have the same sort of collective central power that a league does today, they can set up an NFL ticket exchange, you need to give the power back to the artists. So it's very clear that they can be the decision-maker. And then it becomes the onus of the secondary players to figure out how they're adding value. Like any other business today, you have to survive and adapt and grow because you're adding value to others in your ecosystem. That hasn't been what -- how the scalpers have done it in music over the past several years, and it's finally gotten another point where you're getting the put back now from the artists, and that's being fully understood by our politicians. Yes. Yes. I think on AI, just to be clear, I think it's all upside for us. There's no concern that somehow AI can never replace the live experience. For us, it's a -- I consider it an infrastructure tool for both efficiency and effectiveness. So if you think about using AI on recommendations, much better marketing much better individual recommendation in terms of making you aware of shows that you might want to go to. Clearly, we're using machine learning now to help inform models on suggesting pricing that we were just talking about. AI is just the same thing to the next level of data input through that machine learning process. It will help us automate a lot of tools, the event creation process that takes place at every venue being able to use much better data, machine learning, whatever what's going on elsewhere in the PM system will make that more efficient. All the chatbots that you have today, those will go to a whole another level of effectiveness, working with fans and be at a much lower cost than you have today. And then as we're fighting bots using AI to continue in our battles, to make sure we know who's a person or try to know who's a person, Brit, who's not. So it kind of runs throughout all of our infrastructure. It's a lot of places that we're using machine learning today AI is really that to the next level. Yes. I think that you generally start the year coming out of the gate fastest when you're led by stadiums and arenas. So that -- those are the shows that we've long talked about put on sale earliest relative to the show date. So you've got great scalability in the stadiums, which are seeing 4x the level of activity, good scalability in your arenas. So that's driving your huge increase in attendance, strong increase in ticket sales at $90 million in your deferred revenue. I think as you get into more of the shows that take place in our buildings, across the festivals, amphitheaters to some extent a you generally have a lower level of scalability. You still have very solid growth, but not the same level as you have with your stadiums and arenas. So I don't think we're ready to try to declare an exact number, but I think we recognize the level you have in Q1 is probably going to be the high point of the year. . Yes. I don't think we start with thinking about it as margin. We think about them as being massive growth potential markets, probably the least developed of our major markets. So having great growth opportunity to continue to drive more fans, and more obviously, highly profitable fans. As we establish more venues in those markets, I am sure that you can get some attractive margin operability as you operate, but I think more than starting with any margin focus we're looking at just what's the volume of fans and what's the overall concerts, ticketing, sponsorship, profitability, we can drive off that."

            "name": "Michael Rapino",
            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. 2023 is off to a tremendous start. For the first time in 3 years, all of our markets are fully open. In the common theme, we are seeing around the world that live experiences are a high priority for fans. In Q1, we delivered record results across all divisions as well as record support for artists. Ticket sales to attendance and on-site spend, every sign points to incredible demand for live events. In the first quarter, were 19 million fans attended our shows across 45 countries and we sold over 145 million tickets with record levels of activity across all markets. We delivered revenue of $3.1 billion and AOI of $320 million, up 73% and 53%, respectively, relative to Q1 last year. In general, all my comments will be relative to Q1 last year. This performance is indicative of a continued long-term growth and set the stage for a record 2023 as we are more positive than ever about artists touring bands attending concerts to see their favorite artists and our role helping make this happen. But as clear as we look at our results and operating metrics is that global demand for live events continues to reach new heights. Demand has been growing for a long time and is showing no signs of letting up. Talking to fans, they say that live experiences are the #1 leisure activity where they expect to spend more in the future. Naturally, this is leading to record levels of activity in both our concerts and ticketing business. First in concerts, we sold nearly 90 million tickets for shows this year, tracking more than 20% ahead of this point last year. These are early sales and have been driven by a record number of stadium shows and continued strong growth in arena tours. With many major tours from Beyonce, Drake to Bruce Springsteen, demand has been so strong that even when artists add a number of additional shows, they still aren't able to meet all of the fan demand. As a further initiative to make ticket affordable to all fans, we launched today our Summer Concert Week, with $25 tickets available to nearly 4,000 shows. When fans attend shows they continue spending to enhance the experience. While our key outdoor season has not yet started, early reads from U.S. and European indoor venues that we operate demonstrate further growth in average per fan revenue. As we provide more elevated hospitality options for fans, we have launched Vibee which hosts destination events centered around live music and launched this week with the sale of the U2 Sphere VIP packages selling out. We've also continued building our Venue Nation portfolio with new venues expected to host nearly 3 million fans at 1,000 shows this year, driving long-term growth and profitability across all our businesses. Our ticketing business benefits from the same structural tailwind as concerts with further growth driven by our success in adding new clients, notably in international markets. As a result, we sold 73 million fee-bearing tickets in the first quarter, up 40% and delivered $7.7 billion in fee-bearing GTV, up 60%. We are seeing growth in both volume and pricing across our global markets. This holds true across all event types from sports to concerts and from biggest superstars to new artists. Our brand partners recognize the passion for live music has never been greater, and the Live Nation provides a unique on-site and online platform to connect with fans in meaningful ways on a global scale. And in the first quarter, we continued adding partners for 2023 and beyond, including Google Pixel, PayPal and Levi's. With this, we have commitments for over 80% of our planned sponsorship of the year.  Equally important, fans are embracing the value brands can provide to the concert experience, with around 70% of live music goers agreeing that brands can enhance their time at the show. Our team is the best in the industry at working with brands to develop programs that deliver value to fans, which in turn grows our brand relationships and attracts new ones.  Our results for the first quarter demonstrate the success of our strategy and sets us up for strong growth in 2023. We expect to host a record number of fans this year, even against a 2022 comparison which benefited from rescheduled shows attended by 20 million fans. Ticketmaster should also deliver record activity, with around 600 million tickets managed globally this year. Our sponsorship business, even after incredible growth last year, looks to be on track for double-digit AOI growth again this year. As we then look to 2024 and beyond, we have all the necessary levers to build our flywheel globally and continue to compound AOI by double-digits for the foreseeable future. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through more details. Yes, we're kind of watching what's going on. And we believe that through all of the noise, most people are ending up in the industry and politics at exactly where we are and the principles of what the FAIR Act is, so whether it's all in pricing, cleaning up deceptive practices and the secondary, giving artists more tools, those seem to be all the common themes coming out in all of these different bills, which we're fully supportive of. And having our own build of FAIR Act. We know Senator Cantwell and Cruz introduced theirs. [Neil] has got a bill coming in a senator Klobuchar and Cornyn. These are all in the same vein and the same thematic around helping the artist control their ticket and get them in the hands of the fans and be away of some of the practices and the secondary and the spec selling deceptive sites hopefully, better protection on BOTS, and we've always supported all in pricing. So this is not LN versus any of these. We are aligned to all of these bills. We think all of these bills, we've said continually for a long time, is better for our business because it helps us deliver a better on sale and fan experience. So right now, it's the Wild West, we're doing our best, but any bills and these natures that start putting some better regulations and controls around the experience is going to help our overall business. Yes, we look at this segment overall. If you look at what we've been talking about on our Investor Day for the last few years, the premium business is a huge opportunity for us. I think I've said any time this is an industry that has done a great job of being scaled GA, but not done a great job of doing a premium experience for customers. The sports and new arenas and stadiums are doing a great job on that. But as an industry, like nation and the music industry has not done that. And we think there's a great opportunity overall to launch more products and services that can provide a better premium experience for the customer. So this would just be an extension and a continual strategy towards what we call the premium experience. We've got a company called VIP Nation. We'll do about 1,000 of those events this year. Those are based around the concert and the tour and going to a sound check or early experience or a meet and greet. So we've been the leader in that space and expanding that Ticketmaster's launch, Ticketmaster travel, looking at ways we can put both the ticket and an airline or hotel together and take advantage of that scale, and we've been testing that in the UK with great success. And Vibee is another product where we looked at Poland and we looked at on location and CID and Clint and others that were doing it. The difference is we have the scale, but we already have been doing it. We have the expertise. So we looked at our Insomniac team and built up [Body] launched it with the U2 experience sold out or close to $20 million in ticket sales around a high-end premium experience. So we have the in-house expertise, and this is another product in our ongoing strategy, whether it's clubs, premium memberships, premium clubs, subscriptions, all the ways we're going to continue to look to say how do we from the GA into a premium experience product. I know there's also the challenge of some of these other companies have is the expensive part about doing this is the right, and we don't have that problem. So when you're chasing the Olympic rights you're chasing a business for premium, it's a little harder unless you're in-house. So I'm sure our location does fabulous with their UFC experiences files, we don't have to pay rights. These are our rights. So we can do it in-house. We don't have to outsource it and split any of that upside with anyone else but our own businesses. Yes. Yes. We -- as you know, yes, we live this in the -- I think the fall was all about the air pocket and would there be enough shows in '23. So hopefully, we put that to bed. We don't think this has anything to do with pent-up demand or COVID rescheduling. That stuff has long been clushed out in '22. This is all about regular business back to business. And I think we're thrilled that we're sitting here looking of a comparable last year but basically had almost 1.5 years combined into a year because of all those rescheduled shows at 20 million. To be sitting here today above and beyond last year's numbers, shows the global strength of the business, and it also shows the global strength of the business from the amphitheater and the stadium to the club to the festival. We're looking at all territories around the world. Firing on all cylinders. We're looking at the kind of talent you see on the road right now. This isn't just The Rolling Stones, right? The question we always have to fight off, six of the top 10 artists were younger artists. You look at Lollapalooza Coachella with Bad Bunny, Carol G, Rosalina, the BLACKPINK, the BTSs, Billie Eilish. I mean there's just a host of great new talent every year coming up, filling the pipe that we didn't know Luke Combs was going to be selling stadiums out this year, two years ago. We had no idea Bad Bunny was going to be the largest selling artists last year. So we just continue to see the supply/demand, we think, for the future, is really, really strong. There's more and more artists sitting in the studio right now on TikTok. The greater economy is alive and low and they all want to be the next bad money. And we said it before, we're also seeing this encouraging new supply strategy where for many years, it was all about a U.S. or UK-based artists that filled the charts and fill the stadium. And most other talent was domestic. It might have been big in Canada, it might have been big in area, but it didn't travel. This is the real breakout year where the world and the consumer are truly global. And now you can see artists coming from Latin America and Korea and becoming global superstars. That didn't happen for the last 30 years. It was a very top U.S. or UK controlled industry. So we think that alone gives the next kick to the supply chain for the next 10 years of young talent from -- it will be from India, South Africa, it's going to be everywhere overnight finding their way to TikTok and Spotify and other places to become these global stars that are still in arenas and stadiums out in their markets. And just to jump on Joe there. Unlike the movie theater kind of model, we're not a hit-driven industry, right, where we are a truly scaled business. And you're right, we looked at -- the Beyonces of the world are always going to do the great numbers. But when you're sitting here today, looking at even our festivals, the Lollapaloozas are the easy ones, but we have over 200 festivals, Bonnaroos to one-day festivals in smaller markets to our U.S. and international businesses. And all of it seems to be doing really, really well. So whether it's a middle of a road festival in a smaller market, whether it's a club act. At all levels, there seems to be incredible demand and on a global basis. So we haven't seen just the top stuff selling and they're not coming to the other stuff. The demand seems to be uniformed from clubs to stadiums from Pittsburgh to Milan. And I think we laid that out in our November Investor Day, probably on a more macro level. We wanted to remind investors, we've been doing this for a long time. We have a large venue portfolio we don't see that strategy changing. It's not incrementally different than it's been year after year. We bolt on and continue to look around the world at opportunist markets where there's a great return, and we keep adding a venue club theater an arena, if we can find the right market like Austin, where it's a big return. So we'll continue that strategy over time. And I think we laid out in November cleaner in terms of how many and what numbers we look to subscribe to over time. I think you need to go to some of the [Bob Roux] interview. It will help you. The venue drivers, as Joe said, this is the venue business. I know everyone wants to subscribe at the end demand, most of the service fee and kind of do the auction for the ticket. So Again, we think that the venue that's built in the $1 billion arena or the multibillion dollar stadium in that market, I think he's going to continually be pretty strong and vocal about his rights and returns on what companies he can hire exclusively or not to service his business, so whether it's Microsoft or CRM or Salesforce or Ticketmaster. I think they're going to look at all their options for their best return for their business. So we look at that from that perspective.  We look at Europe just because we've always thrown out really lightly that international as an allocation in the U.S. is here. Just kind of for the trend, International is moving more towards an exclusive model than away from it as new buildings are being built over there and you're building your arena, which really had been underdeveloped. It was mostly a soccer business or football. But as the new buildings are getting built, they are looking over here and realizing that this is another revenue stream that they should be leveraging. So I look at international probably moving closer to the U.S. model in the U.S. model moving to the international model because I think they're now realizing that they've been under valuing their exclusive ticketing rights for their venues. Now we do really well over there because we always will do well in an open market with the best technology. We sell more tickets than the competitor. So if you're an open allocated market and you're going to allocate to us and others, we're going to do really, really well because we're going to be the 1 that probably sells the most tickets for you, so you'll end up allocating more to us. But we don't think that model probably ends up here, more driven by the venue agenda than the ticketing agenda. I'll jump and then Joe will -- I just want to remind what we said earlier, of all the legislative noise, we've been swirling around for 6 months. The common theme in all of this legislation that you're seeing come forward is around limiting and putting some handcuffs around the scalper and the business. So we do see a lot of this legislation moving forward is going to help the primary ticket, the content holder, do a better job on that front. And it will be harder for the scalper or the BOT, deceptive website, spec selling, a lot of practices, drip selling, et cetera. So we do think that overall, this market right now, legislatively, is moving against the secondary business in general, not going to ban it, not going to cap it, but some of the cleanup legislation does help primary hertz secondary. That's a big move that hasn't happened in the last 10, 15 years. Perfect. On pricing, I think we've been saying it for the last few years, the great transparency and sunlight of secondary has really helped the artists and the management team look at their pricing models. Historically, it was a fairly static pricing, three different maybe price points, same price points all across the country. It matter if there was a Friday in New York or Tuesday in Pittsburgh. So the business has gotten really, really sophisticated with our PriceMaster or different dynamic models that artists can now use. So we see that there's still years away between where the artist markets, the price and what the market is willing to pay. The artist is one of the few products in the world that's worth more than it's sold, but they do that for their brand and accessibility. And I think that will continue. But I do think we've seen the artists looking at their ticket price and the whole manifest and how do we bring the prices down in the back, bring the prices up in the front, so we can sell out and make sure everyone gets a ticket at an affordable price, but let's not let secondary runway of the front row. So we think that we're still dramatically underpriced versus demand, and you see that every day on the secondary. And we think that's probably going to live for the next 5 to 10 years as the artist moves closer to market, probably never gets to market. But between here and where they feel comfortable, we think there's years of upside that they'll continue to look at. AI, Joe, you can talk about the TM. And I think -- sorry, I just want to jump on there for one second, John. And just what's more important to us is just helping both sides realize what's the future in '24 on. So we went through -- obviously, COVID was down and last year was an extraordinary year. The Hut does '23 and '24 start to look. And we're very optimistic. We look at this year as being a very strong year coming off what people probably thought we couldn't be last year. We think '24 into forward, you kind of look at what we historically have delivered. We've been a high single industry growth business and a high single-digit revenue AOI business year after year for many years. And we look at going forward, we think we're back to being a great strong growth business year-over-year off this foundation of business. So we think the industry is back bigger than ever. And we think there's years of industry growth we've shown you when the industry grows, we tend to do a rise with that tide and capture as much as industry growth or we tend to do a couple of points better. So industry has been growing about 8% or 9% a year. We tend to beat it. We look at this as a long-term continual growth story again. Appreciate everyone. Thank you. We'll talk to you in the summer."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is John and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Live Nation's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Yong. Thank you, Ms. Yong. You may begin your conference.\nAmy Yong: Good afternoon and welcome to the Live Nation third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining us today is our President and CEO, Michael Rapino; and our President and CFO, Joe Berchtold. We would like to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements related to the company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new developments, and similar matters. Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the company's most recent filings on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results. Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with the SEC Regulation G, Live Nation has provided definitions of these measures and a full reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release. The release reconciliation can be found under the Financial Information section on Live Nation's website. With that I'll turn it over to Joe for brief remarks.\nJoe Berchtold: Thank you, everyone, for joining our quarterly conference call. I think we'll go right into questions on the release. And as everybody knows, we have our investor presentation coming up Wednesday and then again on Thursday.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] One moment while we poll for questions. And the first question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Ross: Hi. Thanks for the questions. First, you gave a lot of very positive forward-looking indicators in the release. I was hoping you could help us think about how that's eventually going to flow through the P&L. And I guess on the Ticketmaster side, it's been a tough year. Assume that outlook on stadiums is going to reverse that trend, but how will that look over Q4, Q1 and next year from a timing perspective? And then on Concerts, it was a big margin year. Can that continue next year in addition to the obvious topline growth that the indicators are showing?\nJoe Berchtold: Thanks, Brandon. This is Joe. I'll start and then Michael can add. Starting with Ticketmaster and starting with Q4, as we noted for October first quarter of the month, Ticketmaster sales were up 15% year-on-year. Concerts, they're up 23%. So, we're expecting that great stadium and arena pipeline to start to manifest itself in Q4 and deliver a very strong Q4 in Ticketmaster. Next week alone we have over 200 stadium and arena shows going on sale. So, we're, I think in a period of unprecedented level of activity for Ticketmaster in Q4. And then that will continue into Q1 and through next year. We expect next year's Ticketmaster to look more like a '23 where you've got that great volume of stadium activity that you get with the on sale, but then you also get as it plays off and some of the deferred events that you have in Europe that you recognize as the events play off. So, a strong Q4, strong next year for Ticketmaster. Concerts, obviously, next year, expectations strong for a continued AOI growth, having growth in arenas and amphitheaters from our baseline of this year. Added to that, the more like '23 or beyond in stadiums should be very strong revenue growth, very strong AOI growth. I think it's probably a bit early to know the exact mix of all those venues for margins, but overall, both strong revenue and AOI growth for the Concert business.\nBrandon Ross: Okay. And a lot of investors think that Trump is going to be a very good thing for you. I'm sure you've studied it very closely. Just wanted to hear what your thoughts on, are on how he's going to approach antitrust and the associated remedies. Do you think they will favor structural or behavioral? And then separately, from a timing perspective, when do you think you'll next have an opportunity to get to the table with the DOJ? Thanks.\nJoe Berchtold: Thanks. Yes, I think, it's still very early in the transition process. So, we're hesitant to say too much, but absolutely, we are hopeful that we'll see a return to the more traditional antitrust approach where the agencies have generally tried to find ways to solve problems they see with targeted remedies that minimize government intervention in the marketplace. And without getting into the specifics, at least some parts of the case, we think believe reflect a much more interventionist philosophy today than you'd expect of a Republican administration. Obviously, the request to break up Live Nation and Ticketmaster would be an example of that highly interventionist approach. So, we'll obviously be ready to engage as soon as they are. They need to get through the appointments and get things settled on their end, but we'd certainly be hopeful that we could start engaging with them early in next year.\nBrandon Ross: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Karnovsky: Hi. Thank you. Just two from me. First, on the revision to 2023 financials. Can you walk through what triggered that and what the notable changes are? And I didn't see it in the release, but you have an updated '23 AOI and free cash flow. And then second, you called out for Q4 a possible mid-teens FX impact to NOI due to LatAm. Can you just refresh us on the general mix of LatAm versus other regions in the fourth quarter? And then any early view on how to think about FX into '25? Thanks.\nJoe Berchtold: Sure. So, first on the revisions to the financials. So, for context, what we had is we had a non-cash non-operating tax adjustment that we had to make. This has to do with when we purchased Ocessa and a difference between statutory and US GAAP accounting on some non-consolidated investments. So, it was just on the US side. We missed -- we paid the taxes in Mexico. We missed it in the US. It was not material to our '20 or '23 numbers, but working through with the auditors, we made the decision, it made sense to restate those numbers. So, again, a one-time non-cash non-material to those numbers. In terms of the FX impact, we had previously talked about Q4 this year looking strong in Latin America, which it still does. All the operating metrics we've been talking about in terms of both the supply and the demand profile are looking good. We've also just seen a downturn in the FX on Latin American markets over the past several weeks. And because we had a disproportionate amount of growth in the numbers coming from those markets this fourth quarter, we just wanted to flag that, therefore that has a disproportionate impact on our AOI and NOI for the quarter. We don't look at it as being material when you step back and you look at the full year '25 and the magnitude of activity that we're going to have. It's more just a Q4 modeling point for people to be aware of and we'll see how some of the FX plays out over time and we'll update you. But I don't think it's a material '25 issue at this point. It's really just more a '24, which tends to be our lowest activity. So, when you have your lowest activity quarter and you have where your growth is coming from get impacted by FX, so that can just start to swing things around.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Laszczyk: Hi. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I could. Maybe first for Michael, you called out in Sponsorship the number of strategic partners increasing by 20% this year. I'm curious, looking out to '25, how you would encourage us to think about the Sponsorship business next year. Are there any verticals of the business where you see maybe outsized opportunities for execution where you could replicate this performance? And then second for Joe, on the Concert segment AOI in 4Q, you called out some of the on-sales coming in over the next couple of weeks here. I'd be curious if you could help us think about how much marketing spend could be associated with those on-sales and maybe any color on just how to think about 4Q Concert segment AOI. Thank you.\nMichael Rapino: Thank you, Stephen. On the Concert, on the Sponsorship side, again, we'll be giving more guidance this week as we get to our Investor Day. But Sponsorship has continually been our star for the last decade or so, multiple years of double-digit growth. We look at this business still very, very strong, very different than maybe some of the advertising challenges other companies have. We see overall companies spending more money on-site experiential and moving dollars into that segment. And anytime that happens, that's good for our business. We tend to rise with that. So, we look at '25 and onward as continual AOI growth that we've been able to deliver in the past in Sponsorship. One of the foundational drivers of that is our globalization. And every time we do more shows around the world, we provide ourselves more opportunity and more sponsors. So, when you're doing all these Latin American shows, when you're doing shows now in India, Middle East, Singapore, Asia, growing our Australian business, it just provides us more and more inventory to open new borders and new relationships. So, as our global pipe continues to grow, so will our Sponsorship and we'll see continued growth.\nJoe Berchtold: And Stephen, as it relates to Concert in Q4, obviously, Q4 in Concerts is a peculiar beast because in some regards, right, the more we're ramping up for a great next year, the more that impacts our AOI. So, I think, as we're standing here, we'd expect a double-digit increase in our advertising expenditure that we have to write off at the end of the year. We're certainly ramping up activity and personnel to be prepared to handle the tremendous volume of shows that we're doing next year. But I think even with all that, as we're looking at the numbers now as again as the broad context, we do expect our margins for the full year in the Concert business to land around where they were in 2019. I'm not going to worry three or four months from now, plus or minus 10, 15 basis points, but I think that in total, we expect it to come in around where we were in 2019.\nStephen Laszczyk: Great. Thank you both.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Cameron Mansson-Perrone from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nCameron Mansson-Perrone: Thank you. On the CapEx increase, I was wondering if you could provide some color on what the pipeline right now looks like for new venue opportunities. And then for the new AMP project, anything further on what changed to pull that forward? I'm assuming that was already in the pipeline as of July, and it's more of just a timing consideration, but any color there? And then to follow up on the Sponsorship question, Michael, growing the number of partners that are generating over 100, sorry, 1 million. Can you talk about, is that new sponsors or is it expanding current or existing relationships? And maybe what's allowing you to execute, if it's growing those relationships, what's allowing you to execute so well there? Thanks.\nMichael Rapino: Quickly on Sponsorship, see, for a few years, we've been saying anytime you can take that regional relationship or that started that relationship at a large brand, form that relationship, deliver for them, we tend to do good at then getting the next time around with the CMO talking broader programs. So, we continue to grow our current base of sponsors. We tend to have a very good renewal rate and we tend to be able to upgrade you once we've gotten you into the ecosystem and understand your brand needs. So, most of it is coming from current customer base of our 900 to 1,000 sponsors and growing our current base with them and then obviously expanding outside markets. On real estate, Joe will give you the updates. We continue to have a great pipeline. We'll take you more of details for you this week in terms of what venues are going to be kind of rolling out into '25 onward and the CapEx returns on that.\nJoe Berchtold: Yes. And on the specifics of the CapEx here for the quarter, as you know, we often build buildings in partnership with others. So, this is a situation where we have a partner we've been talking to for an extended period about doing an amphitheater together. That partner had already put a fair bit of capital into the ground and it was only recently that we then signed the formal agreement. By signing the formal agreement, which would give us controlling interest in the amphitheater, we then need to move all the CapEx onto our books. So, you saw the increase of $50 million of expected CapEx for the year, but you also saw a $30 million increase in the capital coming from other parties. So, most of the capital on this project is what a partner has already put into it. So, the net cash that we're putting out is somewhat less than that. In terms of the new venues, as we noted in the release, we expect to bring 14 more venues online, either with substantial refurbishment or new-build over the next year and change through the end of '25 accounting for about 8 million incremental fans. As Michael noted, we will get into more detail on sort of the mid-range planning on venues over the next couple of days.\nCameron Mansson-Perrone: Got it. That's all helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Peter Henderson with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Henderson: Can you provide some color on what initiatives are resonating most with fans and driving up the per-caps? And where do you think per-caps can go over time? And then just related to that, I mean, how much opportunity remains to implement tiered experiences and where are you monetizing on super or premium fans the most versus regular or casual fans? Thanks.\nMichael Rapino: Well, I'll give a quick shot again. We'll get into more detail this week because those are pretty strategic broad questions. On the premium fan or super fan, I know I hear other companies talk about it. We've been selling to the super fan for quite a while, we call that the premium fans that launched a VIP experience at the show. So, that's kind of been an ongoing skill-set we've had forever. Our job every year is, we see that pie still underserviced. We've used percentages in the past 2%, 4%, 6% of the show is premium. We think it can grow up to 20% and more. So, a lot of the refurbishments we're doing at venues is about taking regular seats and turning them into better experiences for premium experiences at night. So, we think premium experiences is a big underpin to our entire growth forward because it's using the same customer base, but we always sell out of the boxes, sell out of the premium inventory first, we never have a problem selling that. So, we think that is a big part of our CapEx and our refurbished as well as our new buildings. When we're building them, we're starting with this mandate that they must have a certain higher percentage of premium seats and lounges and experiences. So, those venues start with a much better return. First question, shoot again the first question.\nPeter Henderson: Just what where do you think -- what initiatives are sort of resonating most with the fans and driving up per-caps? And where do you think per-caps can go over time?\nMichael Rapino: Most of it is, I've said this before, sports, these new venues, the $1 billion arenas have done a fabulous job, the stadiums, the SoFi stadiums. They've all kind of -- we're all following the same playbook. We all probably started in a very traditional food and beverage offering, whether that was the old forum here in LA versus the new Intuit Dome, it's night and day and most of it is around having more POS, it's around having different high-end value offerings in the -- in your food and beverage bundle to both having mocktails, non-alcoholic options, higher-level food versus the traditional food. So, that's the ongoing path we see in our amphitheaters, our theaters, our arenas. We've been using this $2 per head growth over the last few years. We think that's something in the future we can continue on. So, it's all-around upgrading our current customer base, our apps. Our venues probably are the lower-end of good, great quality F&B from historic measures. So, every year, it's about upgrading that amount of POS offering, upgrading our selection, increasing our premium offering, and all of that combination, we think still has lots of runway left.\nPeter Henderson: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Katz: Hi, evening. Thanks for taking my questions. Number one, past week or so has brought quite a bit of change. I'm wondering if your thoughts have started to shift or philosophies started to shift around M&A given sort of the change over the past week? And then I have one quick follow-up please.\nMichael Rapino: No, we haven't, nothing's really changed in the last couple of years, the way we've been moving around the world and building our business. We don't have any sizable M&A targets that we would do with or without where the regulation stands in America. We like kind of what we're doing. You see us at an arena in Austin, at an amphitheater in some white space or a 5,000 seat, and similar around the world. We're always kind of looking in these 100 cities that are out there that want great entertainment and whether it's an amphitheater or a festival or promoter we like bolting those on and we have a big pipe of those around the world. Nothing has changed over the last two years and I don't think anything changes going forward.\nDavid Katz: Okay. Understood. And I just wanted to ask a more general question about the secondary ticketing market, which I recognize is a smaller part and in some sense a strategic portion of kind of what you do. But it seems as though every time we have something like a World Series and ticket prices get high, it just draws a tremendous amount of attention that sometimes is seems a bit misplaced toward you as the biggest. Are there any strategies or and maybe this is not the best forum to talk about them, but it's just something that comes to mind that we've written about a bit and I thought I would raise it and see if there's any answer that's appropriate here.\nJoe Berchtold: Yes. I think it's, go ahead.\nMichael Rapino: Much broader statement, but yes, we are always a little amused that sports is kind of a badge of honor how expensive those tickets go for, but music which is priced much lower than sports seems to get more of the emotional reaction. But America seems to be a market where secondary is free-to-run. We hope there's always been this hope between different legislators would get better regulation around secondary, hasn't really come to life yet around that minimum at least bots and spec selling and some of the other practices around secondary that we'd like to clean up. So, we hope over time seems to be more and more attention around the secondary market. So, we hope over time, better regulations get put in place to help the consumer.\nDavid Katz: Got it.\nOperator: And the final question comes from the line of Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Supino: Thanks. Hi, team. A question about Ticketmaster. With all the activism at the DOJ, a question that we've heard a lot in the last year has related to the defensibility of Ticketmaster's competitive position and one of the pillars of that is technology. And so I wondered if you could just comment on the investments that Ticketmaster is making in technology, whether it relates to bots or demand-generation or other initiatives that you think are the most important ways Ticketmaster is reinforcing and extending its competitive position technologically? Thanks.\nJoe Berchtold: Sure. Yes. And Peter, as you know, we spend tens of millions of dollars in capital on Ticketmaster. I think first and foremost, we need to continue to innovate the products that we offer to, on the enterprise side to our venues, to promoters, others who use the platform. Past recent years, that's included a lot around pricing technology to help everybody understand the market value of the content they're delivering. It certainly also is on the marketing side, developing great marketing science capabilities to help people market their shows. Big investments over the past couple of years on continuing to enhance our ability to handle that high-demand on-sale. We think Ticketmaster is the best in the world and we've seen a number of on-sales recently where Ticketmaster has been able to deliver a much better experience and sell tickets at a volume that others have been unable to handle. And then obviously also just on the ticket itself, all the things that we've done around digital tickets and as you said, trying to stop bots. So, range of consumer-facing technologies as well. We expect that's ongoing, right, Ticketmaster is a technology company. So, we're going to continue to be developing products on both an enterprise and a marketplace basis.\nOperator: And at this time there are no further questions. Now, I'd like to pass the call back over to the Live Nation management team for closing remarks.\nMichael Rapino: Thank you, everybody, and look forward to talking more about our business this week.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Joe Berchtold",
            "content": "Thank you, everyone, for joining our quarterly conference call. I think we'll go right into questions on the release. And as everybody knows, we have our investor presentation coming up Wednesday and then again on Thursday. Thanks, Brandon. This is Joe. I'll start and then Michael can add. Starting with Ticketmaster and starting with Q4, as we noted for October first quarter of the month, Ticketmaster sales were up 15% year-on-year. Concerts, they're up 23%. So, we're expecting that great stadium and arena pipeline to start to manifest itself in Q4 and deliver a very strong Q4 in Ticketmaster. Next week alone we have over 200 stadium and arena shows going on sale. So, we're, I think in a period of unprecedented level of activity for Ticketmaster in Q4. And then that will continue into Q1 and through next year. We expect next year's Ticketmaster to look more like a '23 where you've got that great volume of stadium activity that you get with the on sale, but then you also get as it plays off and some of the deferred events that you have in Europe that you recognize as the events play off. So, a strong Q4, strong next year for Ticketmaster. Concerts, obviously, next year, expectations strong for a continued AOI growth, having growth in arenas and amphitheaters from our baseline of this year. Added to that, the more like '23 or beyond in stadiums should be very strong revenue growth, very strong AOI growth. I think it's probably a bit early to know the exact mix of all those venues for margins, but overall, both strong revenue and AOI growth for the Concert business. Thanks. Yes, I think, it's still very early in the transition process. So, we're hesitant to say too much, but absolutely, we are hopeful that we'll see a return to the more traditional antitrust approach where the agencies have generally tried to find ways to solve problems they see with targeted remedies that minimize government intervention in the marketplace. And without getting into the specifics, at least some parts of the case, we think believe reflect a much more interventionist philosophy today than you'd expect of a Republican administration. Obviously, the request to break up Live Nation and Ticketmaster would be an example of that highly interventionist approach. So, we'll obviously be ready to engage as soon as they are. They need to get through the appointments and get things settled on their end, but we'd certainly be hopeful that we could start engaging with them early in next year. Sure. So, first on the revisions to the financials. So, for context, what we had is we had a non-cash non-operating tax adjustment that we had to make. This has to do with when we purchased Ocessa and a difference between statutory and US GAAP accounting on some non-consolidated investments. So, it was just on the US side. We missed -- we paid the taxes in Mexico. We missed it in the US. It was not material to our '20 or '23 numbers, but working through with the auditors, we made the decision, it made sense to restate those numbers. So, again, a one-time non-cash non-material to those numbers. In terms of the FX impact, we had previously talked about Q4 this year looking strong in Latin America, which it still does. All the operating metrics we've been talking about in terms of both the supply and the demand profile are looking good. We've also just seen a downturn in the FX on Latin American markets over the past several weeks. And because we had a disproportionate amount of growth in the numbers coming from those markets this fourth quarter, we just wanted to flag that, therefore that has a disproportionate impact on our AOI and NOI for the quarter. We don't look at it as being material when you step back and you look at the full year '25 and the magnitude of activity that we're going to have. It's more just a Q4 modeling point for people to be aware of and we'll see how some of the FX plays out over time and we'll update you. But I don't think it's a material '25 issue at this point. It's really just more a '24, which tends to be our lowest activity. So, when you have your lowest activity quarter and you have where your growth is coming from get impacted by FX, so that can just start to swing things around. And Stephen, as it relates to Concert in Q4, obviously, Q4 in Concerts is a peculiar beast because in some regards, right, the more we're ramping up for a great next year, the more that impacts our AOI. So, I think, as we're standing here, we'd expect a double-digit increase in our advertising expenditure that we have to write off at the end of the year. We're certainly ramping up activity and personnel to be prepared to handle the tremendous volume of shows that we're doing next year.

By signing the formal agreement, which would give us controlling interest in the amphitheater, we then need to move all the CapEx onto our books. So, you saw the increase of $50 million of expected CapEx for the year, but you also saw a $30 million increase in the capital coming from other parties. So, most of the capital on this project is what a partner has already put into it. So, the net cash that we're putting out is somewhat less than that. In terms of the new venues, as we noted in the release, we expect to bring 14 more venues online, either with substantial refurbishment or new-build over the next year and change through the end of '25 accounting for about 8 million incremental fans. As Michael noted, we will get into more detail on sort of the mid-range planning on venues over the next couple of days. Yes. I think it's, go ahead. Sure. Yes. And Peter, as you know, we spend tens of millions of dollars in capital on Ticketmaster. I think first and foremost, we need to continue to innovate the products that we offer to, on the enterprise side to our venues, to promoters, others who use the platform. Past recent years, that's included a lot around pricing technology to help everybody understand the market value of the content they're delivering. It certainly also is on the marketing side, developing great marketing science capabilities to help people market their shows. Big investments over the past couple of years on continuing to enhance our ability to handle that high-demand on-sale. We think Ticketmaster is the best in the world and we've seen a number of on-sales recently where Ticketmaster has been able to deliver a much better experience and sell tickets at a volume that others have been unable to handle. And then obviously also just on the ticket itself, all the things that we've done around digital tickets and as you said, trying to stop bots. So, range of consumer-facing technologies as well. We expect that's ongoing, right, Ticketmaster is a technology company. So, we're going to continue to be developing products on both an enterprise and a marketplace basis."

            "content": "Thank you, Stephen. On the Concert, on the Sponsorship side, again, we'll be giving more guidance this week as we get to our Investor Day. But Sponsorship has continually been our star for the last decade or so, multiple years of double-digit growth. We look at this business still very, very strong, very different than maybe some of the advertising challenges other companies have. We see overall companies spending more money on-site experiential and moving dollars into that segment. And anytime that happens, that's good for our business. We tend to rise with that. So, we look at '25 and onward as continual AOI growth that we've been able to deliver in the past in Sponsorship. One of the foundational drivers of that is our globalization. And every time we do more shows around the world, we provide ourselves more opportunity and more sponsors. So, when you're doing all these Latin American shows, when you're doing shows now in India, Middle East, Singapore, Asia, growing our Australian business, it just provides us more and more inventory to open new borders and new relationships. So, as our global pipe continues to grow, so will our Sponsorship and we'll see continued growth. Quickly on Sponsorship, see, for a few years, we've been saying anytime you can take that regional relationship or that started that relationship at a large brand, form that relationship, deliver for them, we tend to do good at then getting the next time around with the CMO talking broader programs. So, we continue to grow our current base of sponsors. We tend to have a very good renewal rate and we tend to be able to upgrade you once we've gotten you into the ecosystem and understand your brand needs. So, most of it is coming from current customer base of our 900 to 1,000 sponsors and growing our current base with them and then obviously expanding outside markets. On real estate, Joe will give you the updates. We continue to have a great pipeline. We'll take you more of details for you this week in terms of what venues are going to be kind of rolling out into '25 onward and the CapEx returns on that. Well, I'll give a quick shot again. We'll get into more detail this week because those are pretty strategic broad questions. On the premium fan or super fan, I know I hear other companies talk about it. We've been selling to the super fan for quite a while, we call that the premium fans that launched a VIP experience at the show. So, that's kind of been an ongoing skill-set we've had forever. Our job every year is, we see that pie still underserviced. We've used percentages in the past 2%, 4%, 6% of the show is premium. We think it can grow up to 20% and more. So, a lot of the refurbishments we're doing at venues is about taking regular seats and turning them into better experiences for premium experiences at night. So, we think premium experiences is a big underpin to our entire growth forward because it's using the same customer base, but we always sell out of the boxes, sell out of the premium inventory first, we never have a problem selling that. So, we think that is a big part of our CapEx and our refurbished as well as our new buildings. When we're building them, we're starting with this mandate that they must have a certain higher percentage of premium seats and lounges and experiences. So, those venues start with a much better return. First question, shoot again the first question. Most of it is, I've said this before, sports, these new venues, the $1 billion arenas have done a fabulous job, the stadiums, the SoFi stadiums. They've all kind of -- we're all following the same playbook. We all probably started in a very traditional food and beverage offering, whether that was the old forum here in LA versus the new Intuit Dome, it's night and day and most of it is around having more POS, it's around having different high-end value offerings in the -- in your food and beverage bundle to both having mocktails, non-alcoholic options, higher-level food versus the traditional food. So, that's the ongoing path we see in our amphitheaters, our theaters, our arenas. We've been using this $2 per head growth over the last few years. We think that's something in the future we can continue on. So, it's all-around upgrading our current customer base, our apps. Our venues probably are the lower-end of good, great quality F&B from historic measures. So, every year, it's about upgrading that amount of POS offering, upgrading our selection, increasing our premium offering, and all of that combination, we think still has lots of runway left. No, we haven't, nothing's really changed in the last couple of years, the way we've been moving around the world and building our business. We don't have any sizable M&A targets that we would do with or without where the regulation stands in America. We like kind of what we're doing. You see us at an arena in Austin, at an amphitheater in some white space or a 5,000 seat, and similar around the world. We're always kind of looking in these 100 cities that are out there that want great entertainment and whether it's an amphitheater or a festival or promoter we like bolting those on and we have a big pipe of those around the world. Nothing has changed over the last two years and I don't think anything changes going forward. Much broader statement, but yes, we are always a little amused that sports is kind of a badge of honor how expensive those tickets go for, but music which is priced much lower than sports seems to get more of the emotional reaction. But America seems to be a market where secondary is free-to-run. We hope there's always been this hope between different legislators would get better regulation around secondary, hasn't really come to life yet around that minimum at least bots and spec selling and some of the other practices around secondary that we'd like to clean up. So, we hope over time seems to be more and more attention around the secondary market. So, we hope over time, better regulations get put in place to help the consumer. Thank you, everybody, and look forward to talking more about our business this week."

We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question\nStephen Laszczyk: Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Joe, on fan count, it looks like it grew 5% in the second quarter with some diverging growth trends between North America up 26%, international down 16%. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the attendance trends you're seeing across region and then within that across venue type. And then maybe related to that, there's been a lot of attention just on tour cancellations and consumer demand over the last few months. Could you comment on what you're seeing on that front, then to what extent you think that demand extends into the back half of the year and what that means ultimately for attendance growth into the back half of '23? And then I have a follow-up for Michael. Thank you.\nJoe Berchtold: That's about a four part question. Let's start with some of the easier pieces. In terms of cancellation rates, our cancellation rates, we're seeing historical norms below last year. They historically run kind of 4% to 5% of shows, about 1.5% of fans, absolutely in line with historical trends. I think most of the reports that we've seen have been efforts to take one or two data points out of a very large number of tours and shows, and we're just not seeing anything unusual there. In terms of overall demand, continues to be extremely strong. We tried to highlight here a couple of casual fan metrics that we think are important where obviously, we've heard a lot of things from other companies over the past weeks or month or so. One is, just when we put on promotions or summer concert week back in May or more recently our four pack promotion, those tend to be focused on the casual fan, and we've seen increased interest of fans and their purchase behavior, so that's positive signal. The other signal that we look at is, how do shows close in the last couple of weeks before the amps play off, are people buying more of those lawn tickets as they're making the last minute decision on whether or not to go to the show, that number is up 16% year-to-date. So again, seeing very strong casual demand there. And finally, once they go to the show, what's their behavior, and again, we're seeing no issues that we continue to be on track for a couple of dollars' growth in our APF spend at our amphitheaters. So I think it's all consistent with our concerts being seen as very good value, two-thirds less than $100, a third of them less than $50. It's a much more memorable event than a lot of other experiences you can get at that price point. So we continue to feel very good about the strong level of consumer demand we're seeing. In terms of the specific fan count numbers that we've seen over the quarter and over the first half of the year, I think it really is venue type driven. It's not so much geographic driven. It's very consistent with what we've been saying for the past year. This was not going to be a big stadium year. You're seeing that play out in terms of lower stadium shows, lower fan count, that impacts our international number. North America, where we've had very strong performance, particularly on the amphitheater side. As you see here, we said amphitheater attendance up 40% for the second quarter. So it's really that amphitheaters are up very strongly year-to-date. Arenas, theaters and clubs, all up double-digits as well. So you're seeing in totality continued growth despite the -- not having the stadium shows this year. And just from a geographic standpoint, that happens to benefit the U.S. doesn't make any comment on any kind of macro longer-term trend. As we head into the back half of the year, again, no underlying issues on fan demand at all. We expect to see continued growth in the fan count over the course of the second half. I think most of that will come in Q4, Q3, you'll see the continued impact of the stadium show count. And I think we had -- if we just look at the summer season, Q2, Q3, probably about two-thirds of your amp growth in terms of shows and fans was in Q2 as we got started earlier in the year and the majority of arena shows as well. So -- but we expect still solid fan demand growth -- fan growth overall for the second half of the year, again, probably more in Q4 than Q3.\nStephen Laszczyk: Got it. Thanks for that. And then maybe just for Michael. As you look out into 2025, any early reads on how the auditorium pipeline is shaping up. I think, in the press release, you mentioned it was expected to be a busy year. Just any more color or commentary around that, particularly on the stadium front and arenas and amps as well.\nMichael Rapino: Yeah. As we said from day one, this is never going to be a big stadium year. We're thrilled that we can still grow the business coming off two years of extraordinary growth, given where we were in 2019. So it's still a strong year for us overall. Stadiums were always the challenge, international was always going to be a stadium issue given Paris Olympics. Most of France shut down for that month, and most of that affected a lot of the stadium business for the summer. So the good news is, as we predicted, '25 looks like to be a big banner year again. We're looking right now at our stadium pipeline for '25. It's bigger right now than it was two years ago for '23. Our amp and arena is bigger right now than it was last year at this time in terms of our pipeline. So we've always thought 2024 would be the year of AOI and amphitheaters and arenas and '25 will be back to a solid continual growth of stadiums. And as we've always predicted post-COVID, we'd be back to an 8%, 9% compounded annual growth as an industry on the top line, and we'll see that come back to life next year and probably more.\nStephen Laszczyk: Okay. Thank you, both.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question\nBrandon Ross: Thanks. I'll try and keep it tight. Just as a follow-up there on Stephen's seventh question, I think that was. Just in terms of the stadium activity and what does that look like for you in terms of ticketing performance the rest of this year? Should we expect a big Q4 this year, similar to the types of Q4s that you were putting up in larger stadium years? And where does that kind of bring ticketing overall for the year since there's relative weakness in Q2 and Q3 given the mix?\nJoe Berchtold: Sure, Brandon. Let me also just start that with a little bit of context. I think we look over a multiyear trends entering this year since 2019. Ticketmaster AOI was up around 130%, sponsorship around 85%, and concerts around 35%. So I think one of the things we're seeing this year is, as you'd expect, as the businesses grow, some normalization and those numbers start to come together more. So that said, we -- our views on Ticketmaster remain unchanged. We think it's going to be a mid-single digit growth this year. It's going to be Q4 driven by the on sales Michael was just talking about with the stadium activity. And I think in general, a lot of people have just under-modeled the stadium impact, good and bad. I think it's been under-modeled, the upside in Q4. As I've said in the past, from just purely a ticketing perspective narrowly to how they do their numbers, one stadium show is triple the fan count and triple the average ticket price of an amphitheater show. So while overall, those amphitheater fans are very valuable to us as a company and have helped drive our AOI growth this summer and this year overall, as you look specifically at the ticketing segment, you're going to see it impacted the other way.\nBrandon Ross: Great. And then just overall on the lawsuit, I don't want to ask about where you stand with the DOJ, but just wanted to ask how that whole situation overall is impacting your strategic decision making. When you look at M&A opportunities, both domestically and abroad, is that piece of it in the back of your mind and laying how you allocate capital now at all or are you just straight ahead as if there was nothing going on?\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah. We're able to isolate. So if you're -- in my legal department, you're working on the DOJ. If you're running any one of my divisions, it's business as usual. So we are -- we've always said for the last while, we've been focusing on ventilation, global venues around the world. I think we put in that press release, we've got 15 coming online over the next year. Still 75 or so in the pipe. I had a venue meeting this morning. We looked at 10 new venues that we're looking to build across the U.S. Latin America and Asia in the pipe, so business as usual. We think there's still a great, great white space on a global venue basis and ticket, I think you saw last week, we expanded ticketing in South Africa and have a few more of those on an international basis. So lots of opportunities still ahead of us and business as usual in the divisions.\nBrandon Ross: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Karnovsky: Hey. Thank you. Joe, Michael, we've heard from some other live entertainment companies recently kind of talked to a pull forward in demand post-COVID, and that's starting to normalize. I'm curious for your view on this, as it relates to comps or do you think there was any pull forward from kind of late '21 through '23? Is there anything in your kind of data to indicate that the frequency of concert going ramp to an unsustainable level and is now kind of moving back to trend line?\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah. I find the concept to pull forward for experiences like concerts to be a little bit of an odd one. I think that we have long said this is a supply driven business. The demand is there, notwithstanding the fact we have a lot fewer stadiums this year. We're actually still growing our show count. We're still growing our fan count, We've talked a lot about new artists. We talked a lot about global artists, Afrobeats, Latin, K-Pop, exporting country. So I think what we're seeing is an acceleration of the continued globalization on the demand side, the artist seeing that they can go everywhere in the world. We'll have some shifts in terms of venue types and exactly which markets have which level of activity. But there's nothing that would suggest that we're really deviating from historical trajectories on the ongoing growth of the business.\nMichael Rapino: [Multiple Speakers] We never predicted that the industry was going to grow at 30% a year going forward. We always wanted to restate that regardless of some of the COVID pent-up demand or some of the shows that got moved around this industry on a global basis, supply demand are the basics still sound, are they going to grow at a 9%, 10% a year growth rate. And we see all of those trends we've talked about over the last year. Globalization, consumers wanted to get to the show from Colombia to Pittsburgh, globalization of the artist, supply/demand, experience economy still make this industry overall, probably one of the best industries you're going to find out there, continued double-digit growth amongst many of the divisions as well as on a global basis and a 9%, 10% annual base.\nDavid Karnovsky: Okay. And then your amp show count and attendance growth were particularly strong in the quarter. Joe, I think you might have said before more of the show count growth slowing to Q2 this year due to an earlier season. And can you just frame what that should mean potentially on a relative basis for AOI growth for margin in Q3 relative to Q2?\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah. I think Q3 is pretty much always our high water mark on margin as we have the high volume of festivals in addition to the amphitheaters. I'd see no reason for that not to continue. We expect to continue to have AOI growth as a result of that margin expansion. I'm just trying to -- I was trying to give you guys a little bit of more specific context for the modeling, but we expect this to be a very strong AOI growth year for concerts. I gave some of the numbers earlier, where I talked about more normalization. So we do expect concerts to carry a lot of growth for the overall company this year. And we think that margins are moving back towards 2019 levels. I always hesitate to give exact margin forecast because a lot of it depends on our volume of on sales in Q4 that results in the expensing of marketing, but expect that we're moving back towards the 2019 margin levels on a full year basis.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Cameron Manson-Perrone with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nCameron Mansson-Perrone: Thanks. Two, if I can. Noticed that take rate has been up nicely at Ticketmaster this year, year-to-date. Is that success in some of the efforts that you've taken to kind of improve the ancillary monetization there or what's factoring into that? And then Joe, on the higher CapEx guidance, given the comment about pull forward in the release, does that mean lower growth in CapEx next year? How should we think about that? And on the note that you expect to generate free cash flow conversion consistent with last year despite how CapEx is ramping this year, just any context in terms of how you're achieving that given the CapEx ramp.\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah. I think in terms of the pull forward, what we spoke -- we're speaking to specifically is we're now expecting to have 14 major venues open between '24 and '25 as opposed to the 12 that we had last quarter. I think it's very early to start talking about '25 CapEx, as Michael talked about on an earlier question, we're regularly looking for all the venue opportunities we can find globally. He spends a lot of time with the teams in every market, looking at that. So I think that we'll continue to make those decisions on next year\u2019s CapEx based on the opportunities. And hopefully, there will continue to be a lot of great opportunities with kind of 20% plus return profile that we tend to look at. In terms of the free cash conversion, I think those numbers, the cash conversion that we use is after maintenance CapEx and before growth CapEx, so the growth CapEx numbers since the growth in the number in the forecast was in growth CapEx. I don't think that impacts how that number flows through. Back to your first question in terms of the Ticketmaster, Ticketmaster is continuing to perform well. Again, adding a lot of clients internationally, continuing to have strong renewal rates, both in North America and internationally. We're growing our upsells and ancillary spend with the ad units at Ticketmaster. So I think the underlying performance and the health of the business continues to be very strong. The fact that it's -- the AOI in Q2 was actually as high as last year given the volume of stadium shows that they lost in the second quarter, the fact that it's still one of the top five quarters that it's had are all indications of the great performance and strength of that business on a multiyear basis.\nCameron Mansson-Perrone: Got it. All really helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Supino: Hi. Thank you. I was -- I wanted to ask two questions, one on the concert segment with really high growth. I wondered if you could parse the contribution from Venue Nation versus the Promotion Function? And then a question on growth CapEx. Your press release talks about 30% returns on venue upgrades. And in prior discussions, you aspired the 30% returns on some greenfield venue builds. If Venue Nation generally does invest capital at a 30% incremental return, should we take the difference between total CapEx and maintenance CapEx and multiply that by 30% to forecast a return on your growth CapEx or would that be an oversimplification? Thanks.\nJoe Berchtold: So first, on the Venue Nation versus the concert promotion, really because that's transfer pricing, we don't spend a lot of time trying to separate the two. We don't have, I would say, fully distinct P&Ls that would give you at the AOI level, I think, what you're asking about. We do look at the returns that we generate, the returns that we generate from all aspects of the business to give you a feel that we're creating a lot of shareholder value as we're opening new venues and making other CapEx investments. I think that what we've said historically is, we strive for 20% north or higher on major renovations and new builds, and as we showed here, 30% plus on some more tactical improvements. This is also all the venue based CapEx. There's also Ticketmaster and other CapEx that we make. So I think it's probably a bit of an oversimplification, particularly if you're trying to apply it to a single time frame given that the CapEx is often ongoing for a couple of years on the major projects. So you have a little bit of timing complexity there. So it's probably just not quite as simple. Over time, you get those returns, but not if you're trying to do this on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\nPeter Supino: Thanks, Joe. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Barton Crockett with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nBarton Crockett: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask maybe a little bit more about what's happening with sponsorship. So the revenue was up 3% in the quarter, but AOI was up 10%, and you're guiding for the year. You're talking about double-digit bookings growth and stable margins. I was just wondering if you could explain what drives the acceleration in the top line but kind of the give back on the margin? And just talk generally about the health of what you're seeing in sponsorship at this point.\nJoe Berchtold: Yeah. I'll give you some specifics on the margins, and Michael can comment on overall. I think the business continues to be a 60% plus margin business, very strong. I think as I long said, when overanalyzed single quarters, I think over the course of the year, we'll continue to deliver similar margins as we have in past years. This is all apart to, as Michael talked about, when you have a high-single digit growth business that underlying in the industry level, and we're overdelivering that, part of that over delivery is if you look at sponsorship, it\u2019s been in the teens historically on an AOI growth basis. And as we continue to grow the fan count and grow the overall business, we expect we\u2019ll continue those sort of historical growth rates.\nMichael Rapino: Yeah. And I would just say, as an overall, given I work with the team a lot on our big clients, we\u2019re seeing discontinual upgrade moving from a regional deal to a global or a national deal. That has been our biggest strategy over the last five years, is upgrading from a local to a national deal with a larger relationship and a longer-term relationship more integrated. And the lineup continues to be strong on all major brands. All CMOs look at us kind of like the NFL and want to find ways to work on our digital, our on-site, our festivals, our tours, the artists, all the different ways they want to attach the live music. So we think continue to be a great business on an AOI growth basis for a long time.\nBarton Crockett: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the floor back over to Michael Rapino for any closing comments.\nMichael Rapino: Thank you, everybody. Have a great summer, and we'll talk in the fall.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

It's very consistent with what we've been saying for the past year. This was not going to be a big stadium year. You're seeing that play out in terms of lower stadium shows, lower fan count, that impacts our international number. North America, where we've had very strong performance, particularly on the amphitheater side. As you see here, we said amphitheater attendance up 40% for the second quarter. So it's really that amphitheaters are up very strongly year-to-date. Arenas, theaters and clubs, all up double-digits as well.

And just from a geographic standpoint, that happens to benefit the U.S. doesn't make any comment on any kind of macro longer-term trend. As we head into the back half of the year, again, no underlying issues on fan demand at all. We expect to see continued growth in the fan count over the course of the second half. I think most of that will come in Q4, Q3, you'll see the continued impact of the stadium show count. And I think we had -- if we just look at the summer season, Q2, Q3, probably about two-thirds of your amp growth in terms of shows and fans was in Q2 as we got started earlier in the year and the majority of arena shows as well. So -- but we expect still solid fan demand growth -- fan growth overall for the second half of the year, again, probably more in Q4 than Q3. Sure, Brandon. Let me also just start that with a little bit of context. I think we look over a multiyear trends entering this year since 2019. Ticketmaster AOI was up around 130%, sponsorship around 85%, and concerts around 35%. So I think one of the things we're seeing this year is, as you'd expect, as the businesses grow, some normalization and those numbers start to come together more. So that said, we -- our views on Ticketmaster remain unchanged. We think it's going to be a mid-single digit growth this year. It's going to be Q4 driven by the on sales Michael was just talking about with the stadium activity. And I think in general, a lot of people have just under-modeled the stadium impact, good and bad. I think it's been under-modeled, the upside in Q4. As I've said in the past, from just purely a ticketing perspective narrowly to how they do their numbers, one stadium show is triple the fan count and triple the average ticket price of an amphitheater show. So while overall, those amphitheater fans are very valuable to us as a company and have helped drive our AOI growth this summer and this year overall, as you look specifically at the ticketing segment, you're going to see it impacted the other way. Yeah. We're able to isolate. So if you're -- in my legal department, you're working on the DOJ. If you're running any one of my divisions, it's business as usual. So we are -- we've always said for the last while, we've been focusing on ventilation, global venues around the world. I think we put in that press release, we've got 15 coming online over the next year. Still 75 or so in the pipe. I had a venue meeting this morning. We looked at 10 new venues that we're looking to build across the U.S. Latin America and Asia in the pipe, so business as usual. We think there's still a great, great white space on a global venue basis and ticket, I think you saw last week, we expanded ticketing in South Africa and have a few more of those on an international basis. So lots of opportunities still ahead of us and business as usual in the divisions. Yeah. I find the concept to pull forward for experiences like concerts to be a little bit of an odd one. I think that we have long said this is a supply driven business. The demand is there, notwithstanding the fact we have a lot fewer stadiums this year. We're actually still growing our show count. We're still growing our fan count, We've talked a lot about new artists. We talked a lot about global artists, Afrobeats, Latin, K-Pop, exporting country. So I think what we're seeing is an acceleration of the continued globalization on the demand side, the artist seeing that they can go everywhere in the world. We'll have some shifts in terms of venue types and exactly which markets have which level of activity. But there's nothing that would suggest that we're really deviating from historical trajectories on the ongoing growth of the business. Yeah. I think Q3 is pretty much always our high water mark on margin as we have the high volume of festivals in addition to the amphitheaters. I'd see no reason for that not to continue. We expect to continue to have AOI growth as a result of that margin expansion. I'm just trying to -- I was trying to give you guys a little bit of more specific context for the modeling, but we expect this to be a very strong AOI growth year for concerts. I gave some of the numbers earlier, where I talked about more normalization. So we do expect concerts to carry a lot of growth for the overall company this year. And we think that margins are moving back towards 2019 levels. I always hesitate to give exact margin forecast because a lot of it depends on our volume of on sales in Q4 that results in the expensing of marketing, but expect that we're moving back towards the 2019 margin levels on a full year basis. Yeah. I think in terms of the pull forward, what we spoke -- we're speaking to specifically is we're now expecting to have 14 major venues open between '24 and '25 as opposed to the 12 that we had last quarter. I think it's very early to start talking about '25 CapEx, as Michael talked about on an earlier question, we're regularly looking for all the venue opportunities we can find globally. He spends a lot of time with the teams in every market, looking at that. So I think that we'll continue to make those decisions on next year's CapEx based on the opportunities. And hopefully, there will continue to be a lot of great opportunities with kind of 20% plus return profile that we tend to look at. In terms of the free cash conversion, I think those numbers, the cash conversion that we use is after maintenance CapEx and before growth CapEx, so the growth CapEx numbers since the growth in the number in the forecast was in growth CapEx. I don't think that impacts how that number flows through. Back to your first question in terms of the Ticketmaster, Ticketmaster is continuing to perform well. Again, adding a lot of clients internationally, continuing to have strong renewal rates, both in North America and internationally. We're growing our upsells and ancillary spend with the ad units at Ticketmaster. So I think the underlying performance and the health of the business continues to be very strong. The fact that it's -- the AOI in Q2 was actually as high as last year given the volume of stadium shows that they lost in the second quarter, the fact that it's still one of the top five quarters that it's had are all indications of the great performance and strength of that business on a multiyear basis. So first, on the Venue Nation versus the concert promotion, really because that's transfer pricing, we don't spend a lot of time trying to separate the two. We don't have, I would say, fully distinct P&Ls that would give you at the AOI level, I think, what you're asking about. We do look at the returns that we generate, the returns that we generate from all aspects of the business to give you a feel that we're creating a lot of shareholder value as we're opening new venues and making other CapEx investments. I think that what we've said historically is, we strive for 20% north or higher on major renovations and new builds, and as we showed here, 30% plus on some more tactical improvements. This is also all the venue based CapEx. There's also Ticketmaster and other CapEx that we make. So I think it's probably a bit of an oversimplification, particularly if you're trying to apply it to a single time frame given that the CapEx is often ongoing for a couple of years on the major projects. So you have a little bit of timing complexity there. So it's probably just not quite as simple. Over time, you get those returns, but not if you're trying to do this on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Yeah. I'll give you some specifics on the margins, and Michael can comment on overall. I think the business continues to be a 60% plus margin business, very strong. I think as I long said, when overanalyzed single quarters, I think over the course of the year, we'll continue to deliver similar margins as we have in past years. This is all apart to, as Michael talked about, when you have a high-single digit growth business that underlying in the industry level, and we're overdelivering that, part of that over delivery is if you look at sponsorship, it's been in the teens historically on an AOI growth basis. And as we continue to grow the fan count and grow the overall business, we expect we'll continue those sort of historical growth rates."

            "name": "Michael Rapino",
            "content": "Yeah. As we said from day one, this is never going to be a big stadium year. We're thrilled that we can still grow the business coming off two years of extraordinary growth, given where we were in 2019. So it's still a strong year for us overall. Stadiums were always the challenge, international was always going to be a stadium issue given Paris Olympics. Most of France shut down for that month, and most of that affected a lot of the stadium business for the summer. So the good news is, as we predicted, '25 looks like to be a big banner year again. We're looking right now at our stadium pipeline for '25. It's bigger right now than it was two years ago for '23. Our amp and arena is bigger right now than it was last year at this time in terms of our pipeline. So we've always thought 2024 would be the year of AOI and amphitheaters and arenas and '25 will be back to a solid continual growth of stadiums. And as we've always predicted post-COVID, we'd be back to an 8%, 9% compounded annual growth as an industry on the top line, and we'll see that come back to life next year and probably more. [Multiple Speakers] We never predicted that the industry was going to grow at 30% a year going forward. We always wanted to restate that regardless of some of the COVID pent-up demand or some of the shows that got moved around this industry on a global basis, supply demand are the basics still sound, are they going to grow at a 9%, 10% a year growth rate. And we see all of those trends we've talked about over the last year. Globalization, consumers wanted to get to the show from Colombia to Pittsburgh, globalization of the artist, supply/demand, experience economy still make this industry overall, probably one of the best industries you're going to find out there, continued double-digit growth amongst many of the divisions as well as on a global basis and a 9%, 10% annual base. Yeah. And I would just say, as an overall, given I work with the team a lot on our big clients, we're seeing discontinual upgrade moving from a regional deal to a global or a national deal. That has been our biggest strategy over the last five years, is upgrading from a local to a national deal with a larger relationship and a longer-term relationship more integrated. And the lineup continues to be strong on all major brands. All CMOs look at us kind of like the NFL and want to find ways to work on our digital, our on-site, our festivals, our tours, the artists, all the different ways they want to attach the live music. So we think continue to be a great business on an AOI growth basis for a long time. Thank you, everybody. Have a great summer, and we'll talk in the fall."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is John, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Live Nation's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call.\n I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Yong. Thank you, Ms. Yong. You may begin your conference. \nAmy Yong: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Live Nation first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining us today is our President and CEO, Michael Rapino, and our President and CFO, Joe Berchtold. \n We would like to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, including statements related to the company's anticipated financial performance, business prospects, regulatory and legal matters, new developments and similar matters. \n Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings, including the risk factors and cautionary statements included in the company's most recent filings on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results. \n Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with the SEC Regulation G, Live Nation has provided definitions of these measures and a full reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures in the earnings release. The release reconciliation can be found under the Financial Information section on Live Nation's website.\n With that, I will now turn it over to our President and CFO, Joe Berchtold. \nJoe Berchtold: Thanks, Amy. We appreciate there's a lot of interest in what's going on with the DOJ. So let me address that upfront. We obviously know about the press reports claiming DOJ Antitrust division has decided to file a lawsuit against Live Nation, potentially seeking a breakup of Live Nation and Ticketmaster. At this point, we're just about to begin discussions with senior division leadership about the issues their staff has been investigating, which is typically in the final phase of an investigation. \n Decisions about whether to see over what relief to seek ordinarily made at the end of that process. Of course, we know that some competitors and interest groups are urging the DOJ to sue us and sue us to break us up. Let me add that -- let me address directly. \n As we previously stated, the DOJ's investigation appears to be focused on specific business practices, not the legality of Live Nation Ticketmaster merger or our overall business structure. Very little of the conduct that DOJ has raised with us relates to the combination of ticketing and promotion resulting from the merger. And most of what does was anticipated and addressed by the consent decree allowing the merger to go forward. \n Based on the issues we know about, we don't believe a breakup of Live Nation and Ticketmaster would be a legally permissible remedy. \n Live Nation and Ticketmaster came together lawfully through a merger that the DOJ reviewed and approved subject to divestitures and other remedies. The DOJ has repeatedly stated in court filings that the merger and settlement were in the public interest. Furthermore, structural relief such as the divestiture is rarely granted. Legally, it's only available where there is a strong connection between the corporate structure and the company's ability to engage in the allegedly unlawful conduct. \n We believe that connection is lacking with regard to the bulk of the issues in this investigation since the conduct under scrutiny falls either within our ticketing segment or within our concert segment and not across those segments.\n We're looking forward to our upcoming meetings with the division leadership and remain hopeful that we can amicably resolve any remaining disputes. If not, we're prepared to defend ourselves in court. \n That's all we're going to say on the DOJ on this call.\n And operator, can we now open it for questions for me and Michael? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners. \nBrandon Ross: I think you probably hit the biggest investor questions with your statement on regulatory, but I think there is one big question that's remaining in investors' minds. And that's, how do you see the relative value of Ticketmaster inside Live Nation versus as a separate stand-alone company? \nMichael Rapino: Thanks, Brandon. I think we addressed this in our last call. At Live Nation, we run a very decentralized organization, and I'm very proud that we've built 3 incredible businesses sponsorship concerts and ticketing, and we're about to embark on our fourth venture around Venue Nation. So these businesses all run incredible core businesses on their own. Ticketmaster, as you know, was a stand-alone business for many years. \n We're proud that when we took it over, we were able to bring some leadership to it, upgrade its technology, open up its platform and elevate its consumer and marketplace much like most enterprise platforms like Airbnb and et cetera. So I've always said these are incredible portfolio of pieces around Live that we own. They are all part of what we think is a great portfolio. But I've also said these are incredible businesses on their own. So I think long term, together or separate these would all be very successful businesses. We happen to think that we like our portfolio today and plan on keeping it. \nBrandon Ross: Great. And then you're continuing to express confidence in double-digit AOI growth this year. Obviously, you exceeded that in the first quarter, but deferred is actually down. Can you just quickly reconcile that? I assume the makeup is the profitability per fan based on the venue mix, but any additional color you could give would be helpful. \nJoe Berchtold: Sure. I think there are sort of 2 questions within that question, Brandon. The first is what's going on with consumer demand and then technically what's going on with the numbers. So just to make sure we hit hard on the consumer demand. We are seeing no weakness. The things that we look at that give us an indication of how the shows are selling, how the fans are spending when they go to the site, all continue to be very strong. \n We alluded to some in release, but just to hit a few of the highlights. When we look at a number of artists that toured last year and they're touring again this year, so those are the best like-for-like examples of demand. We're consistently seeing the sell-through of shows are at or above where they were last year and that the overall grosses for the artists are consistently higher. So no issues at all on fan demand relative to last summer. \n And when you look at our overall arena volume, which is the largest volume at this point early on, despite a tremendous growth in terms of the number of arena shows, which you could be concerned would lead to some cannibalization. We're seeing no such cannibalization. We're continuing to see strong sell-through as strong as it was last year. \n And then when we look at on-site spending, theaters and clubs, where we have the bulk of our activity in our venues in Q1, we're seeing strong growth on fan spend. So just to make sure we hit that out of the gate. \n And then technically, what's going on. I think what's going on with deferred revenue and ticket sales is 100% consistent with what we've been saying for the past 6-plus months, we expected that this isn't going to be a big stadium year, stadium tickets sell earliest. They're also the highest-priced ticket, so they're going to lead historically to a very high deferred revenue number at this point of the year with a shift to more arenas and amphitheaters, you're going to see the sales cycle come in a bit later. And overall, the story for the year is going to be less of a revenue story, more of a shift in the portion of the fans that are in our venues, higher fan profitability, concert AOI growth through margin expansion. \n I'm still confident -- we still believe in the double-digit growth that we've been saying. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky from JPMorgan. \nDavid Karnovsky: We've seen some noise in the press recently around festival demand and that maybe some of the more established events in the U.S., Europe, are seeing challenge in moving tickets. Just wanted to see if you could dig in a bit on what you're observing for live or even the industry? \nMichael Rapino: Yes, I'll start. We've read some of it also. We haven't said it in our business. We have over 100 festivals around the world. I think currently, ticket sales are up double digits year-over-year. So we're seeing a strong start to our festival portfolio. We also remind you festivals are a huge business around sponsorship, similar to venues with our sponsorship is up over 20% year-over-year on festivals, so we're seeing a strong, strong start to them. \n We're a global company, so we do see that having a portfolio helps. We've launched some new festivals internationally. We launched about 10 new festivals a year. You're lucky if 50% of them make it to the next year. And I think this year, we started 10, we shut down 6. So you're always kind of cutting off the weak performers and restarting some new ideas. I think the only trend we see overall is, I think the 3-day massive festival that's going to appeal to everybody with a great unique headliner. The kind of with the original part of this business, that seems to be really hard to deliver year on, year out, whether it's Coachella or Bonnaroo, those are big missions to deliver and artists are making a lot of money in arenas and stadiums. So it's not as easy to get that special headliner. \n Where we're seeing great success, though it's 1- or 2-day festivals that are appealing to a more of a niche, and it's maybe 35,000 people, and it's exactly write down a certain genre of music or a lifestyle, and it's maybe a higher-end business like BottleRock does in Napa. And we've got a couple of great calling festivals out on the coast or Eddie Vedder festival on the [indiscernible] outside of San Diego. \n So we are seeing probably a shift to more niche 1- or 2-day festivals with higher per heads, higher sponsorship value and less big swings across, let's go after a 3-day 100,000 people. There's still, though, the Coachellas, the Lollapaloozas, the Austin City Limits, they're kind of passage of right, so they'll -- they seem to have a life and will live long. But definitely, if you're starting a new one, you're probably starting a more niche strategy and try to make sure it's a better experience versus just putting 75,000 people in the field. \n But to us, a big part of our business overall, it's a nice piece in our overall portfolio to drive our sponsorship business, and it's on a global basis, a nice piece of our overall portfolio. \nDavid Karnovsky: And then on your venue strategy, just as you look to deploy capital to locations around the world, Can you discuss kind of criteria where it's best for Live Nation to execute independently versus where we've seen you kind of partner with a third-party like an Oak View Group, for instance? \nMichael Rapino: Yes. We do it all. We've been partners with Legends and Spanaway Group in Boston, bunch of ones in the hopper right now across America on 5,000-seat venues with certain sports owners, everybody that has a sports arena is looking to build out their retail footprint around it. So we're in partnership with -- potential partnerships a bunch of different NBA, NHL or NFL owners who are building out their concourse retail area, and we'll partner with them in capital to help build that out. \n So we're opportunistic depending who the developer is, and sometimes if there's a partner that makes sense to partner with like we did with [ OBG ] in Austin, we'll do it. But around the world, I would say I was in a venue meeting this morning. We are very, very excited about this division. I called it the fourth leg this morning. \n The global pipeline of where we think we can take this business that's very unsophisticated outside of America around the AMP Arena large theater business. The lineup of -- the pipeline is long. We've got a lot that we're going to keep rolling out over the next few years. We can do them 100% of our own. Most of the time if the economics are there or if there's a developer, we always will look at that and see if that's a better return on capital also. \n I would say we are probably the -- we're the one that everyone wants to partner with. So we have great optionality. We are always kind of the first demand partner that a developer is looking to bring us in and be partners with. So we have great opportunities and more opportunities than execution of power right now, but we're building that muscle fast. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. \nStephen Laszczyk: Maybe one on sponsorship for Michael. Revenue was up I think, 24% year-over-year in the quarter. It sounds like a lot of that was driven by strengths internationally. Could you maybe just talk a little bit more about what's driving that growth in international? And is the step-up that we saw in 1Q, something we should expect to see throughout the year, or is the fact that it's more internationally driven? Does that suggest it could be more 1Q, 4Q aided as we move throughout '24? \nJoe Berchtold: Stephen, this is Joe. I'll get started and then Michael can hop in. A lot of what you're seeing in Q1 is, as you said, it's international. A lot of it is festivals, as Michael was just talking about the high performance of our festival business this year. And in particular, it's what's going on in South America and Asia. So one of the things we really like is that we're balancing out getting the sentiment the Southern Hemisphere growth that will help our Q1 and Q4 business. So I would expect we'll see a good chunk -- we'll see the highest growth rates in sponsorship Q1 and Q4 this year because we're getting real traction building those businesses. \nStephen Laszczyk: Got it. And then maybe another one for you Joe or unless Michael wants to jump in on sponsorship? \nMichael Rapino: No, I would just -- I want to remind you some like sponsorship or any of these numbers we're talking about. The growth is just -- we had an incredible comparable last year. I mean we had 2 record years of incredible growth. So the fact that we're sitting here again growing the business at these levels, I think it's just a testament and a mic drop to anyone debating how powerful the machine is, how hungry customers are to show up at the show and whether the pipe is full or not. So we're extatic to have a 20-plus percent sponsorship year-over-year after growing bigger numbers than that the last couple. \n I think the demand from brands is big, people -- brands, while they're struggling to figure how to reach customers, know that being on-site, live, touching consumers at festivals and venues and the spheres and all these great live experiences that are happening, it's a very, very hot space, and I think you're going to see this growth continue. \nStephen Laszczyk: Got it. And then maybe just one on concert margins for Joe. You called out in the release, full year concert segment margin is expected to be higher than last year. I think with the magnitude of that, depending on some factors, could you just talk a little bit more about the range of outcomes there? What would dictate coming in, I guess, meaningfully above last year versus maybe more in line? \nJoe Berchtold: Sure. I think probably 3 factors that we're still going to watch play out over a bit of time. One is FX. As we noted, for Q1, we, on a reported basis, were up 7 basis points year-on-year. At constant currency, were up 37 basis points. So clearly, that can have a material impact on how much we grow. \n Second is just what's the level of Q4 arena activity we have? Q4 is still in the process of being booked. And as you guys all know, the reason I don't love going too deep in the margins is because if we do a lot of arenas in Q4, that could bring down our margin while bringing up AOI and we'll do that all day long. So there's still some visibility to get into those numbers. \n And then finally, we've talked on the last call about how '25 is already shaping up to be a tremendous stadium year. A lot of the stadiums that they couldn't get access to this year because of the Olympics or Rugby World Cup or any of a -- variety of reasons, they're already stacking up very strong for a great stadium year next year. \n The only accounting impact of that is you put those shows on sale in Q4, you incur the marketing expense to launch those shows, particularly for stadiums, and then you have to write off all that marketing expense at the end of Q4. So again, irrelevant over the life cycle of the tour, but from a strict accounting standpoint and impact on margins, the more stadium tours that we put sale in Q4 globally, the bigger the expense we hit. So we'll work through all of those numbers as we get closer and provide more guidance. \n But right now, those are all big factors that are all really good things that have happened, but aren't yet at a point to declare exactly what the margin expansion is going to be. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Cameron Mansson-Perrone with Morgan Stanley. \nCameron Mansson-Perrone: So I want to follow up on 2 of the earlier questions on growth and then on the venue business. I guess, first, on the growth outlook for the year. I think you've spoken to potentially more muted growth in the first quarter given the venue mix considerations this year, which makes a 20% growth look even healthier. So maybe -- could you just help frame how we should think about growth this year in light of all that? And then on the higher CapEx outlook from new venue opportunities, Joe, you've talked in the past about generally wanting to prove out CapEx and then ramp it gradually over time. What should the higher outlook tell us about the opportunity you see from this incremental spend? \nJoe Berchtold: Sure. On the growth, I think Q1 should tell you that we are right to be positive and optimistic about our ability to continue to deliver double-digit growth this year. I gave a little bit in the context of Brandon's questions, but as I step back and say, how is our growth going to look at the end of the year? I think it's going to be driven by concerts AOI heavily concerts margin. It will second be driven by sponsorship as we're continuing to, in particular, build out the international side of that business. And just Ticketmaster because it's losing all those stadium high-ticket price shows is going to have lower growth. \n So I expect all of the pieces to continue to grow and all of them to be very happy coming off of what as Michael said, were tremendous growth rates over the last couple of years. So to have all 3 pieces of the business continuing to grow is great. I just think that will be the overall tenor of how it is we look back at this year. \n And in terms of the venues and the CapEx, I think what we should take is that all the buildings that we're opening are performing at or above our expectations that the volume of opportunities, as Michael said, every developer is coming to us as their first choice, whether you're a sports team owner who want to replicate what Fenway Group did around their park, whether you're an international player looking to renovate a building or to build something from the ground, the developers are coming to us because they think that we're effective operators and good partners in terms of helping them make the building successful. \n So I think it's just a continued build-out of the pipeline, and this is still incremental but continued strong performance and strong pipeline. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. \nPeter Supino: I wanted to ask first about -- more about the venue build-out project. I'm wondering if in your comments 3 months ago, about longer-term growth view that the company could compound AOI at a double-digit rate for many years to come. If you didn't build any big 15,000, 20,000 student arenas outside the United States, could you still achieve that goal? It's just a way to ask whether that capital project and the returns from it are built into your long-term outlook. It's a question we've heard a lot from clients. And then related to that, I wonder, when you talk about returns on capital, maybe as a company or specifically on these venues, how are you [indiscernible] those returns? Is that an EBITDA number? What are the numerator and denominator? \nJoe Berchtold: Yes. In terms of the venue build out, of course, that's part of our long-term plan. I mean we lay out every year, generally at Liberty, the 6 or 7 levers, and how it is we're going to continue to drive strong AOI growth over time. When we did that last year, venues were, I mean, the largest component of that. So it's absolutely part of our thesis and part of how it is we're going to get to that continued strong growth rate. In terms of the performance, I mean it's a standard return on invested capital. So we look at it on a cash-on-cash basis, cash out, cash back to the business. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet from Citibank. \nJason Bazinet: I just had 2 questions related to disclosures actually. I know you guys have been building venues for decades, but when you talk about standing up a fourth business with our destination, are you hinting that you might disclose that as a second segment or not? And then my second disclosure question is, I noticed in the Q, there was something, I guess, that FASB came out with in November about expense disclosures. I don't know if the Q says you're still sort of deliberating that? But any sort of color on what that FASB request is, and how you're thinking about it would be great. \nJoe Berchtold: In terms of venues of the [indiscernible] business, at this point, we're not thinking about them as separate segments. We still organizationally have concerts and venues under the same organizational structure. So it'd be premature to think about it in terms of the segments down the road, who knows. It's just -- we're trying to get everybody internally also focused on this as an important area to be growing. So that's why we use that term loosely. \n In terms of the -- any FASB, generally, what we're doing is any time there are new accounting regulations, we're going to be studying them until the day that we need to implement them. So I don't think anything here would be any different. We're just going to always use the time we have to make a full assessment of what lead way we have, and how we do things and make the selection and prepare whatever revisions we need to be ready. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Benjamin Soff with Deutsche Bank. \nBenjamin Soff: Just wanted to ask about concerts attendance. It looks like there was a bigger step up in North American attendance compared to international tenants this quarter. So can you unpack that a little bit and talk about how you think about growth in each region for the year? \nJoe Berchtold: Sure. I think that is largely a function or fully a function of the international stadiums we had, particularly Southern Hemisphere in Q1 of last year and just fewer stadiums as we've been talking about. So that meant that the primary growth in Q1 was in North America. Overall, this year kind of define the trend of where international is going, which is an increasing share because a lot of the growth will come out of our amphitheaters, I probably would expect disproportionate growth out of North America. \n Again, I think it's out of character in the sense that if you look at all of the business where we're adding capacity with our venues, where we're adding ticketing clients, where our sponsorship is growing, we've got a heavy structural trend towards international growth and international being a larger portion, I think that just from a cyclicality standpoint this year, there may be a bit of aberration in that, but no change in terms of the overall trend. \nOperator: And our final question comes from the line of David Joyce with Seaport Research Partners. \nDavid Joyce: Two questions, please. First, when you look at the metric of country attendance versus the population, the U.S. over index is the rest of the world. What would be your path to growing that concert attendance per capita going forward? And then secondly, on ticketing, what are the plans from here for upgrading the ticketing platforms around the globe, and what -- how much is in CapEx versus OpEx? \nJoe Berchtold: So in terms of driving the fan attendance, we've been talking in North America for past several years about a hyper-local focus and that has absolutely been helping us drive our penetration, if you want, on a per fan basis. That will continue, and our expectation is we'll continue to build our fan base in North America. \n The other thing that's just generally going on is, every year, you have the same artists who've been touring -- back out touring on whatever cycle, and we're adding in more hours. We added in K-pop. We added in Latin. Now we're adding in Afrobeats. So we're adding in more artists, which also draw more fans, and that will continue to help with the penetration. \n As we look at the international markets, it's all a function of how penetrated are they in the major cities where we have a presence. In a lot of markets, we think that there's the opportunity for driving that through additional venues, ties into our international venue strategy that Michael was talking about earlier. In other markets that may be more penetrated like the U.K., you're going to see more of a hyper local strategy, which is why we continue to focus on making sure we got a lot of activity going to Manchester, not just London. \n So every market is a bit different, but certainly a focus on how we continue to get more fan growth from the biggest to the largest. \n In terms of ticketing, I think we've talked a lot about the tremendous progress we think that we've made. We think we've got the leading enterprise software system in the world, and you continue to develop products for that. A lot of that cost is in CapEx, but it's been a pretty stable investment level over the past couple of years. We expect it to continue as we are delivering new products for both the enterprise customers in the marketplace, but nothing dramatic changed. \nOperator: I would now like to turn the floor back over to Michael for any closing comments. \nMichael Rapino: Thank you, everyone, and we'll look forward to talking to you in the summer. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Joe Berchtold",
            "content": "Thanks, Amy. We appreciate there's a lot of interest in what's going on with the DOJ. So let me address that upfront. We obviously know about the press reports claiming DOJ Antitrust division has decided to file a lawsuit against Live Nation, potentially seeking a breakup of Live Nation and Ticketmaster. At this point, we're just about to begin discussions with senior division leadership about the issues their staff has been investigating, which is typically in the final phase of an investigation. \n Decisions about whether to see over what relief to seek ordinarily made at the end of that process. Of course, we know that some competitors and interest groups are urging the DOJ to sue us and sue us to break us up. Let me add that -- let me address directly. \n As we previously stated, the DOJ's investigation appears to be focused on specific business practices, not the legality of Live Nation Ticketmaster merger or our overall business structure. Very little of the conduct that DOJ has raised with us relates to the combination of ticketing and promotion resulting from the merger. And most of what does was anticipated and addressed by the consent decree allowing the merger to go forward. \n Based on the issues we know about, we don't believe a breakup of Live Nation and Ticketmaster would be a legally permissible remedy. \n Live Nation and Ticketmaster came together lawfully through a merger that the DOJ reviewed and approved subject to divestitures and other remedies. The DOJ has repeatedly stated in court filings that the merger and settlement were in the public interest. Furthermore, structural relief such as the divestiture is rarely granted. Legally, it's only available where there is a strong connection between the corporate structure and the company's ability to engage in the allegedly unlawful conduct. \n We believe that connection is lacking with regard to the bulk of the issues in this investigation since the conduct under scrutiny falls either within our ticketing segment or within our concert segment and not across those segments.\n We're looking forward to our upcoming meetings with the division leadership and remain hopeful that we can amicably resolve any remaining disputes. If not, we're prepared to defend ourselves in court. \n That's all we're going to say on the DOJ on this call.\n And operator, can we now open it for questions for me and Michael? Sure. I think there are sort of 2 questions within that question, Brandon. The first is what's going on with consumer demand and then technically what's going on with the numbers. So just to make sure we hit hard on the consumer demand. We are seeing no weakness. The things that we look at that give us an indication of how the shows are selling, how the fans are spending when they go to the site, all continue to be very strong. \n We alluded to some in release, but just to hit a few of the highlights. When we look at a number of artists that toured last year and they're touring again this year, so those are the best like-for-like examples of demand. We're consistently seeing the sell-through of shows are at or above where they were last year and that the overall grosses for the artists are consistently higher. So no issues at all on fan demand relative to last summer. \n And when you look at our overall arena volume, which is the largest volume at this point early on, despite a tremendous growth in terms of the number of arena shows, which you could be concerned would lead to some cannibalization. We're seeing no such cannibalization. We're continuing to see strong sell-through as strong as it was last year. \n And then when we look at on-site spending, theaters and clubs, where we have the bulk of our activity in our venues in Q1, we're seeing strong growth on fan spend. So just to make sure we hit that out of the gate. \n And then technically, what's going on. I think what's going on with deferred revenue and ticket sales is 100% consistent with what we've been saying for the past 6-plus months, we expected that this isn't going to be a big stadium year, stadium tickets sell earliest. They're also the highest-priced ticket, so they're going to lead historically to a very high deferred revenue number at this point of the year with a shift to more arenas and amphitheaters, you're going to see the sales cycle come in a bit later. And overall, the story for the year is going to be less of a revenue story, more of a shift in the portion of the fans that are in our venues, higher fan profitability, concert AOI growth through margin expansion. \n I'm still confident -- we still believe in the double-digit growth that we've been saying. Stephen, this is Joe. I'll get started and then Michael can hop in. A lot of what you're seeing in Q1 is, as you said, it's international. A lot of it is festivals, as Michael was just talking about the high performance of our festival business this year. And in particular, it's what's going on in South America and Asia. So one of the things we really like is that we're balancing out getting the sentiment the Southern Hemisphere growth that will help our Q1 and Q4 business. So I would expect we'll see a good chunk -- we'll see the highest growth rates in sponsorship Q1 and Q4 this year because we're getting real traction building those businesses. Sure. I think probably 3 factors that we're still going to watch play out over a bit of time. One is FX. As we noted, for Q1, we, on a reported basis, were up 7 basis points year-on-year. At constant currency, were up 37 basis points. So clearly, that can have a material impact on how much we grow. \n Second is just what's the level of Q4 arena activity we have? Q4 is still in the process of being booked. And as you guys all know, the reason I don't love going too deep in the margins is because if we do a lot of arenas in Q4, that could bring down our margin while bringing up AOI and we'll do that all day long. So there's still some visibility to get into those numbers. \n And then finally, we've talked on the last call about how '25 is already shaping up to be a tremendous stadium year. A lot of the stadiums that they couldn't get access to this year because of the Olympics or Rugby World Cup or any of a -- variety of reasons, they're already stacking up very strong for a great stadium year next year. \n The only accounting impact of that is you put those shows on sale in Q4, you incur the marketing expense to launch those shows, particularly for stadiums, and then you have to write off all that marketing expense at the end of Q4. So again, irrelevant over the life cycle of the tour, but from a strict accounting standpoint and impact on margins, the more stadium tours that we put sale in Q4 globally, the bigger the expense we hit. So we'll work through all of those numbers as we get closer and provide more guidance. \n But right now, those are all big factors that are all really good things that have happened, but aren't yet at a point to declare exactly what the margin expansion is going to be. Sure. On the growth, I think Q1 should tell you that we are right to be positive and optimistic about our ability to continue to deliver double-digit growth this year. I gave a little bit in the context of Brandon's questions, but as I step back and say, how is our growth going to look at the end of the year? I think it's going to be driven by concerts AOI heavily concerts margin. It will second be driven by sponsorship as we're continuing to, in particular, build out the international side of that business. And just Ticketmaster because it's losing all those stadium high-ticket price shows is going to have lower growth. \n So I expect all of the pieces to continue to grow and all of them to be very happy coming off of what as Michael said, were tremendous growth rates over the last couple of years. So to have all 3 pieces of the business continuing to grow is great. I just think that will be the overall tenor of how it is we look back at this year. \n And in terms of the venues and the CapEx, I think what we should take is that all the buildings that we're opening are performing at or above our expectations that the volume of opportunities, as Michael said, every developer is coming to us as their first choice, whether you're a sports team owner who want to replicate what Fenway Group did around their park, whether you're an international player looking to renovate a building or to build something from the ground, the developers are coming to us because they think that we're effective operators and good partners in terms of helping them make the building successful. \n So I think it's just a continued build-out of the pipeline, and this is still incremental but continued strong performance and strong pipeline. Yes. In terms of the venue build out, of course, that's part of our long-term plan. I mean we lay out every year, generally at Liberty, the 6 or 7 levers, and how it is we're going to continue to drive strong AOI growth over time. When we did that last year, venues were, I mean, the largest component of that. So it's absolutely part of our thesis and part of how it is we're going to get to that continued strong growth rate. In terms of the performance, I mean it's a standard return on invested capital. So we look at it on a cash-on-cash basis, cash out, cash back to the business. In terms of venues of the [indiscernible] business, at this point, we're not thinking about them as separate segments. We still organizationally have concerts and venues under the same organizational structure. So it'd be premature to think about it in terms of the segments down the road, who knows. It's just -- we're trying to get everybody internally also focused on this as an important area to be growing. So that's why we use that term loosely. \n In terms of the -- any FASB, generally, what we're doing is any time there are new accounting regulations, we're going to be studying them until the day that we need to implement them.

In other markets that may be more penetrated like the U.K., you're going to see more of a hyper local strategy, which is why we continue to focus on making sure we got a lot of activity going to Manchester, not just London. \n So every market is a bit different, but certainly a focus on how we continue to get more fan growth from the biggest to the largest. \n In terms of ticketing, I think we've talked a lot about the tremendous progress we think that we've made.

            "name": "Michael Rapino",
            "content": "Thanks, Brandon. I think we addressed this in our last call. At Live Nation, we run a very decentralized organization, and I'm very proud that we've built 3 incredible businesses sponsorship concerts and ticketing, and we're about to embark on our fourth venture around Venue Nation. So these businesses all run incredible core businesses on their own. Ticketmaster, as you know, was a stand-alone business for many years. \n We're proud that when we took it over, we were able to bring some leadership to it, upgrade its technology, open up its platform and elevate its consumer and marketplace much like most enterprise platforms like Airbnb and et cetera. So I've always said these are incredible portfolio of pieces around Live that we own. They are all part of what we think is a great portfolio. But I've also said these are incredible businesses on their own. So I think long term, together or separate these would all be very successful businesses. We happen to think that we like our portfolio today and plan on keeping it. Yes, I'll start. We've read some of it also. We haven't said it in our business. We have over 100 festivals around the world. I think currently, ticket sales are up double digits year-over-year. So we're seeing a strong start to our festival portfolio. We also remind you festivals are a huge business around sponsorship, similar to venues with our sponsorship is up over 20% year-over-year on festivals, so we're seeing a strong, strong start to them. \n We're a global company, so we do see that having a portfolio helps. We've launched some new festivals internationally. We launched about 10 new festivals a year. You're lucky if 50% of them make it to the next year. And I think this year, we started 10, we shut down 6. So you're always kind of cutting off the weak performers and restarting some new ideas. I think the only trend we see overall is, I think the 3-day massive festival that's going to appeal to everybody with a great unique headliner. The kind of with the original part of this business, that seems to be really hard to deliver year on, year out, whether it's Coachella or Bonnaroo, those are big missions to deliver and artists are making a lot of money in arenas and stadiums. So it's not as easy to get that special headliner. \n Where we're seeing great success, though it's 1- or 2-day festivals that are appealing to a more of a niche, and it's maybe 35,000 people, and it's exactly write down a certain genre of music or a lifestyle, and it's maybe a higher-end business like BottleRock does in Napa. And we've got a couple of great calling festivals out on the coast or Eddie Vedder festival on the [indiscernible] outside of San Diego. \n So we are seeing probably a shift to more niche 1- or 2-day festivals with higher per heads, higher sponsorship value and less big swings across, let's go after a 3-day 100,000 people. There's still, though, the Coachellas, the Lollapaloozas, the Austin City Limits, they're kind of passage of right, so they'll -- they seem to have a life and will live long. But definitely, if you're starting a new one, you're probably starting a more niche strategy and try to make sure it's a better experience versus just putting 75,000 people in the field. \n But to us, a big part of our business overall, it's a nice piece in our overall portfolio to drive our sponsorship business, and it's on a global basis, a nice piece of our overall portfolio. Yes. We do it all. We've been partners with Legends and Spanaway Group in Boston, bunch of ones in the hopper right now across America on 5,000-seat venues with certain sports owners, everybody that has a sports arena is looking to build out their retail footprint around it. So we're in partnership with -- potential partnerships a bunch of different NBA, NHL or NFL owners who are building out their concourse retail area, and we'll partner with them in capital to help build that out. \n So we're opportunistic depending who the developer is, and sometimes if there's a partner that makes sense to partner with like we did with [ OBG ] in Austin, we'll do it. But around the world, I would say I was in a venue meeting this morning. We are very, very excited about this division. I called it the fourth leg this morning. \n The global pipeline of where we think we can take this business that's very unsophisticated outside of America around the AMP Arena large theater business. The lineup of -- the pipeline is long. We've got a lot that we're going to keep rolling out over the next few years. We can do them 100% of our own. Most of the time if the economics are there or if there's a developer, we always will look at that and see if that's a better return on capital also. \n I would say we are probably the -- we're the one that everyone wants to partner with. So we have great optionality. We are always kind of the first demand partner that a developer is looking to bring us in and be partners with. So we have great opportunities and more opportunities than execution of power right now, but we're building that muscle fast. No, I would just -- I want to remind you some like sponsorship or any of these numbers we're talking about. The growth is just -- we had an incredible comparable last year. I mean we had 2 record years of incredible growth. So the fact that we're sitting here again growing the business at these levels, I think it's just a testament and a mic drop to anyone debating how powerful the machine is, how hungry customers are to show up at the show and whether the pipe is full or not. So we're extatic to have a 20-plus percent sponsorship year-over-year after growing bigger numbers than that the last couple. \n I think the demand from brands is big, people -- brands, while they're struggling to figure how to reach customers, know that being on-site, live, touching consumers at festivals and venues and the spheres and all these great live experiences that are happening, it's a very, very hot space, and I think you're going to see this growth continue. Thank you, everyone, and we'll look forward to talking to you in the summer."
