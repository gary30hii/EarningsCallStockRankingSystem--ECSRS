At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note, that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Miss Ryvicker.\nMarci Ryvicker : Thank you, operator and welcome everyone. Joining me on this morning's call, are Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh, Dave Watson, Jeff Shell, and Jeremy Darroch. Brian and Mike will make formal remarks, and Dave, Jeff and Jeremy will also be available for Q&A. Let me now refer you to slide 2, which contains our Safe Harbor Disclaimer, and remind you that this conference call may include forward-looking statements, subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our 8-K and trending schedules for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. With that, let me turn the call over to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?\nBrian Roberts : Thanks Marci and good morning everyone. Really proud of our fourth quarter results and look forward to giving you a glimpse of what we\u2019re focused on and excited about once we come out of this pandemic. Our most recent performance was highlighted by Cable which grew EBITDA by over 12% and net cash flow by 26%. These are the best results of the year and that of any fourth quarter in over a decade.  We also have good news to share on our Park segment which reached breakeven excluding Beijing, even with Hollywood being closed. Our premium ad-supported streaming service Peacock now has 33 million sign-ups within just six months of its nationwide launch. And encouragingly [indiscernible] customer and revenue base essentially return to pre-COVID levels this past quarter.  Clearly, our company has strong testament to the tough decisions made by our leadership team and the excellent execution and coordination by our dedicated employees. Looking back over the whole year, 2020 was one of the most uncertain and challenging periods that any of us can remember.  But we rose to the occasion, ensuring the safety and protection of our employees, providing customers with unparalleled service and innovative products that they relied on more than ever, strengthening our investment grade balance sheet and continuing to invest for long-term growth and success.  This year's Cable results were nothing short of exceptional, hitting a number of company records. We generated 2 million net broadband additions for the year, and 538,000 for the fourth quarter, reaching record low churn. High speed internet drove our highest ever full year net customer relationship additions of 1.6 million, bringing us to 33 million total customer relationships. Yet with just only 50% penetration of our footprint, there remains plenty of opportunity for future growth.  We also delivered outstanding EBITDA growth of nearly 9% and cash flow growth of 16% all of 2020. Broadband is the cornerstone of what we do, powered by our robust, flexible and reliable network. And many years of investments we've made have been on full display.  We've continued to enhance our market leading competitive position, while keeping people connected, protected, informed and entertained by proactively managing our network, increasing broadband speeds, expanding our internet essentials program for low-income households, providing payment plans for customers struggling the most, and offering Peacock and Flex for free.  This pandemic has forced us to rethink the way we operate and service our customers. Immediately, we moved all of our care reps to work remotely from home, which has gone so well that we're leaning towards embracing this model permanently. In addition, we promoted further adoption of our digital self-help tools such as Xfinity Assistant, which are available 24x7.  We also expanded our self-installation eligibility. And now over two thirds of our customers are connecting to our services this way. We are working hard with our communications and marketing efforts to enhance awareness, all we have to offer, which enables us to take costs out of the business, while delivering a better experience for our customers.  In fact, in the past 12 months, we've reduced agent handled calls by over 16 million, and truck rolls by 1.6 million, all while adding more than 1.5 million net new customer relationships. Our efforts to reduce costs have been extremely successful. But what's even more exciting are the investments we're making to grow the overall business. The great example is Flex, which is offered to all of our broadband only customers for free, so that they can connect seamlessly to the streaming services they love.  Within the first half of this year, Flex along with X1, will be carrying all of the top streaming apps in United States. We just added HBO Max, we'll be adding Disney Plus in the near future and we have many more on the roadmap. Flex has been a major win for us and we continue to have really high hopes.  Xfinity Mobile just came off a strong fourth quarter with nice sequential improvement in customer additions, resulting from a number of significant changes as we fully integrate mobile into our core Cable operations and reprioritized our sales channels. We're really excited for 2021 as we've recently expanded parts of our MVNO agreement with Verizon that will enable us to improve our range of offerings and acquire more customers more profitably. As we said from the beginning, an MVNO led capital-light wireless model is the right one for us and has even more strategic opportunity in the years ahead. Business services came back faster than we expected. This quarter, we added 26,000 net new customers and generated revenue growth of 4.8%, the highest we've seen since the pandemic began. With less than 20% share of an approximately $50 billion total addressable commercial market in our footprint, we saw plenty of runway. All-in-all, Cable had a fantastic 2020 and we look forward to a very strong 2021 and beyond. While the global pandemic has had a more significant impact on NBCUniversal, we took advantage of this moment to make a number of changes in both management and operations which sets us up for success.  The most notable example, is the reorganization of our Cable Networks and Broadcast Television businesses, which are now combined along with Peacock in a structure meant to drive long-term cost efficiencies and revenue opportunities. We finished the year having renewed a number of carriage agreements with many of our valuable distribution partners, putting us in a position of strength, as we enter 2021.  Peacock has had an exceptional start, exceeding all of our internal targets. This premium hybrid AVOD service, which has a light ad load and is unlike any other, offers a breath of content that appeals to just about every demographic, at an unbeatable consumer value, much of it for free. Momentum has further accelerated with the addition of the Office, which we own and began streaming exclusively on Peacock as of January 1.  Not only is the Office driving incremental users, but these viewers are naturally finding and watching other programs on this platform like Parks and Rec, Yellowstone, our latest original Saved by the Bell, mega hit movies from Universal and other studios, and sporting events such as the Premier League, Golf and even an NFL Wild Card game. And earlier this week, we announced that Modern Family will be coming to Peacock next month, followed by the WWE in March.  In Film, our decision to release our titles direct-to-consumer via premium video on demand when theaters were forced to close has proven to be profitable and the right move for us. While we look forward to when we can enjoy the theatrical release of many franchise films such as Fast 9 and the next Minions and Jurassic World, we will lean into what has become a successful hybrid distribution model.  COVID had the most direct impact on our theme parks, which were either closed or running at limited capacity for the bulk of 2020. But I'm pleased with how quickly we were able to reopen Orlando and Osaka while ensuring the safety of our staff and guests. We continue to provide an amazing entertainment experience. Our guests are responding as confirmed by our steadily increased attendance and our most recent financial results.  What we saw this fourth quarter, especially in Orlando, gives us even more conviction in the momentum that our theme parks will experience when we reach a sustainable recovery. We may experience some near-term setbacks with the most recent pick up in COVID cases, but I'm optimistic as ever about the long-term trajectory of this very special business.  Sky had a strong and encouraging fourth quarter. We added net new customers in every market, bringing our customer base essentially back to pre-COVID levels. The same can be said for revenue, which was essentially flat from what we generated in the fourth quarter of 2019. While we continue to make meaningful progress on our strategic initiatives, Sky Q which integrates streaming, has surpassed 60% penetration in the UK, and is poised to continue with recent additions of Disney Plus, Discovery Plus and Amazon Prime video.  We're really pleased with the success of Sky Originals, which contributed to the 20% increase in viewership on our Sky Entertainment channels during the fourth quarter and all of 2020 reaffirming our commitment to creating Sky Studios and expanding original programming.  While the recent wave of COVID infections and related lockdowns across Europe are once again creating disruption, we're implementing the same protocols and procedures that work the first time around. We've confidence of a similar pattern as this latest lockdown recedes.  We really look forward to the second half of this year when we will also start to see the benefits from the reset of major sports rights contracts and cost savings that should result from a new, leaner operating model. And we're still on plan to double 2020 EBITDA over the next several years, as Jeremy recently laid out.  Speaking of Jeremy, I want to thank him for his exceptional leadership of Sky and for his partnership since the acquisition. He and the team have established a unique world-class brand and a strong, well-run business that's now fully integrated. I'm thrilled for Dana Strong, who has now taken over as CEO of Sky.  Many of you on this call have met with Dana since she joined our Cable business as Head of Consumer Services back in 2018. She is an accomplished executive with a wonderful ability to transform, inspire and drive positive change. On top of all that, she also has over 20 years of international experience with near half of it\u2019s been in Europe.  2021 offers a lot of promise for Comcast and hopefully for the entire world. While the first half will be more challenged than the second due to the most recent strain of COVID, we\u2019re really encouraged by the promise of the vaccine which is the first step in putting the parts of our business that have been most impacted back on the path toward growth.  This optimism is shared by our Board of Directors which this morning announced an increase in our dividend of our 13th consecutive year. I'm also pleased it is now our expectation that we will return to repurchasing shares in the back half of this year.  While 2020 was not what any of us had imagined a year ago with this time, our execution, cooperation and fast decision making enabled all parts of Comcast, NBCUniversal and Sky to respond and manage through a difficult environment remarkably well. I'm truly proud of what we have accomplished and our fourth quarter shows just how well this company is positioned to succeed.  Mike, over to you. \nMike Cavanagh: Thanks Brian and good morning everyone. Now I\u2019ll review our fourth quarter 2020 results and make some comments on current conditions and where possible on the year ahead. Let\u2019s begin on slides four and five with our consolidated results.  Revenue declined 2.4% to $27.7 billion for the fourth quarter, and 4.9% to $103.6 billion for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA declined 15% to $7.2 billion for the fourth quarter and 10% to $30.8 billion for the full year. COVID related severance and restructuring charges were $590 million in the fourth quarter and $828 million for the full year as we took actions to position our businesses for success in a post COVID world.  The corporate and other segment includes these charges and also includes Peacock for its launch year. For 2020, Peacock generated revenue of over $100 million while EBITDA losses approached $700 million. We continue to expect that EBITDA losses for 2020 and 2021 combined for Peacock will total roughly $2 billion.  Adjusted earnings per share declined 29% to $0.56 for the quarter and 17% to $2.61 for the year. Finally, free cash flow was $1.7 billion in the quarter and $13.3 billion for the full year reflecting the decline in EBITDA and the benefit from the reduction in working capital and capital expenditures in part due to the pandemic.  Now to review our business segments, starting with Cable Communications on slide 6. For the fourth quarter, Cable Communications revenue increased 6.3% while EBITDA increased 12% and adjusted EBITDA led capital grew 26%. For the full year we grew customer relationships by 1.6 million a 41% increase year-over-year with 455,000 net additions in the fourth quarter, driven by high-speed internet where we added 2 million net new residential and business customers this year and 538,000 in the fourth quarter.  These record customer additions were the primary driver of our high-speed internet revenue growth of 13% for the quarter and 10% for the full year. Other revenue highlights include acceleration in both business services and wireless. Business services posted 4.8% revenue growth and 26,000 net new customer additions primarily driven by improvement in small businesses. Wireless revenue grew 36% with 246,000 net new lines in the quarter bringing up to 2.8 million total lines at year end.  Wireless is a strategic priority for us and should accelerate on the back of several actions we have taken. First, we\u2019ve expanded our Verizon MVNO agreement. Second, we fully integrated mobile into our core operations and third, we\u2019ve refined our marketing and activated all of our sales channels and we\u2019re seeing a nice lift in our retail stores which are now fully opened.  For Video, revenue declined 0.7% with higher rates implemented in the beginning of 2020 more than offset by subscriber declines including a 248,000 net loss in customers this quarter. And advertising revenue increased 34% year-over-year or 2.2%, excluding political, which almost doubled what we generated in the last presidential election cycle in 2016.  Turning to expenses, Cable Communications fourth quarter expenses increased 2.4%. Programming expenses were up 7.2%, primarily due to the number of contract renewals that started to cycle through in 2020 combined with annual escalators in existing agreements.  Non-programming expenses declined slightly reflecting lower technical and product support and customer service costs, which were partially offset by higher advertising, marketing and promotion spend to drive top-line growth and higher expenses associated with the increased political advertising activity this quarter. Non-programming expenses per customer relationship decreased 5.1% despite our record customer growth. Cable Communications EBITDA grew by 12% in the quarter and 8.6% for the full year, with margins reaching 42.1% and improvement of 170 basis points excluding the RSN adjustments that impacted results earlier in the year.  Cable capital expenditures decreased 1.1%, resulting in CapEx intensity of 13.5%. For the full year, capital expenditures declined 4.4% resulting in CapEx intensity of 11%, our lowest full year on record and an improvement of 100 basis points year-over-year exclusive of RSN adjustments, driven by lower spending on customer premise equipment and support capital partially offset by higher spending on scalable infrastructure, which was driven by our ongoing investment to enhance the capacity of our network to support increased data usage.  Turning to the current environment, high speed internet customer additions remain healthy and we have all the pieces in place for 2021 to be a very strong year. We also have to remember that 2020 was exceptional on many accounts. And because of that, we view 2019, which was also very strong for us as a more appropriate year against which to benchmark our performance.  Turning to video, we expect the higher video rates we implemented at the beginning of this year, resulting from our current programming renewal cycle to drive video sub losses back to the levels we\u2019d experienced in the first half of 2020. Our video strategy is centered on profitability. We do not chase unprofitable video subscribers, as we can now offer Flex for free to those who prefer a streaming only entertainment option.  Looking to the full year, we expect Cable Communications revenue growth to exceed the 3.4% we just reported for 2020, as we remain focused on driving our connectivity businesses with better year-over-year comparisons in the first half. We expect programming expense growth to increase at high-single digit levels similar to the fourth quarter, as programming carriage renewals roll through in 2021. The program expense growth is expected to moderate in 2022 and thereafter.  Non-programming operating expense growth should normalize at a low-single digit increase to 2019 levels, as we support the higher level of customer relationships and accelerate growth in our wireless business, which we expect to achieve standalone profitability in 2021.  With our consistent discipline on expenses and capital investment, coupled with the trends at work as we remain focused on connectivity, we are confident in our ability to increase profitability, expand margins and improve CapEx intensity, both in 2021 and thereafter.  Now let's turn to Slide 7 for NBCUniversal. For the fourth quarter, NBCUniversal revenue decreased 18% to $7.5 billion and EBITDA decreased 21% to $1.6 billion. Cable Networks revenue was down 6.4% in the fourth quarter, driven by a 38% decline in content licensing and other revenue, while distribution revenue was flat compared to a year ago, reflecting the absence of carriage renewals, combined with modest sequential improvement in subscriber losses.  The delay to the start of the NBA and NHL seasons had a negative impact on our advertising revenue, which declined 4.2% while the related shift of sports rights amortization out of the quarter was a benefit to the EBITDA which grew 22% year-over-year. For the full year, Cable Networks EBITDA increased 4%, primarily driven by the sports related impacts of COVID.  Fewer sporting events in 2020 contributed to lower distribution and advertising revenue, as well as lower programming and production expenses of $655 million year-over-year. Seasons were shortened earlier in the year, and current seasons were delayed, pushing a number of events and the related rights amortization costs to 2021.  So, looking to 2021, we expect healthy distribution revenue growth as a result of recent successful carriage renewals. We also currently expect significantly more sporting events compared to 2020, which would result in higher advertising revenue, but also a significant increase in sports related programming and production costs, equating to a low double-digit decline in Cable Networks EBITDA this year.  Turning to Broadcast, revenue decreased 12% in the fourth quarter, due to a 39% decline in content licensing, and a 9.6% decline in advertising revenue, partially offset by another quarter of double-digit increases in retransmission consent fees. The content licensing revenue declines at both Broadcast and Cable Networks were timing related, as sales to streaming platforms including Peacock were more heavily concentrated in the first nine months of the year.  We also had a difficult comparison to a significant library deal in last year's fourth quarter. The decline in advertising revenue was driven by lower ratings, partly due to the delayed launch of our ball season. This was somewhat offset by record levels of political advertising at our local stations. The lower revenues were partially offset by a decline in operating costs, reflecting lower content licensing, and the delay in production due to COVID-19 resulting in a decline of 24% to $356 million in Broadcast EBITDA.  Filmed Entertainment revenue declined 8.3% and EBITDA increased 65% to $151 million for the fourth quarter. Theatrical revenue declined 70% due to theaters being either closed or operating at limited capacity. While content licensing increased 23%, driven by PVOD. Expenses were significantly lower due to fewer releases as a result of COVID-19. In 2021, we hope to debut a number of our franchise films in theaters, such as Fast9 and Minions 2, but the situation remains fluid and we're still adjusting our 2021 place to maximize value, as evidenced by our recent decision to push back the release of Boss Baby 2 from March to September. Theme Parks revenue was $579 million in the quarter with an EBITDA loss of $15 million. These results reflect Universal Orlando Resort and Universal Studios Japan, operating at limited capacity, while Hollywood remains closed. Results also include $45 million of Universal Beijing pre-opening costs.  For 2021, keep in mind that the first quarter tends to be seasonally light in terms of attendance. And we also expect an increased COVID impact given new restrictions in Japan, which have also caused us to delay the opening of Super Nintendo World. We are pleased that University Beijing remains set to open this summer, with pre-opening costs ramping to $300 million in the first half of this year.  One last item I'd like to highlight, we will be changing the way we report for NBCUniversal starting in the first quarter of 2021 with a largest impact being to our television businesses, as we combine Cable Networks and Broadcast into one segment along with Peacock. Now let's turn to slide 8 for Sky, which I'll speak to on a constant currency basis. Sky revenue for the fourth quarter declined 0.9% to $5.2 billion, reflecting a 2.8% decline in direct-to-consumer revenue, driven mostly by our hospitality or pubs and clubs segment, which was challenged by additional COVID related lockdowns during the quarter. Excluding hospitality, direct-to-consumer revenue was essentially flat year-over-year with solid low-single-digit growth in the UK. Somewhat offsetting the decline in direct-to-consumer revenue with a 10% increase in content revenue as we monetize our original programming. While advertising revenue grew 3.9% as Sky outperformed a challenge advertising market helped by a strong performance in the U.K.  Sky added 244,000 net new customers in the quarter, bringing us essentially back to pre-COVID levels of total customer relationships with additions in all markets, driven by a very healthy streaming business. We've also seen strong uptake in our broadband and mobile products in the UK.  Sky EBITDA was $139 million as the fourth quarter was impacted by a number of expense items, such as incremental sports rights amortization related to the shift of sporting events that have been delayed as a result of COVID-19, higher investments in entertainment programming, costs related to the launch of our new Sky channels last May, as well as higher marketing spend to promote strategic initiatives such as Sky Q, growth in our mobile product in the U.K. and broadband in Italy.  Looking ahead, we would characterize 2021 as a tale of two halves, the first half is under pressure due to the recent increase in COVID related restrictions to the extreme levels we experienced at the beginning of the pandemic. With the government mandating the closure of pubs and clubs, as well as many retail outlets, we are experiencing weakness in hospitality and advertising, and we now expect Sky\u2019s first quarter revenue to decline slightly year-over-year.  We also expect first half expenses to be elevated when compared to 2020 as higher sports right amortization resulting from sporting events being postponed from 2020 to 2021 will be with us through the second quarter. In non-sports related costs, we\u2019ll see an increase as we grow broadband and mobile in the UK, broadband in Italy and launch the SMB business in the U.K. later this quarter.  In the second half of 2021, we expect a quick recovery in hospitality and advertising revenue once these latest restrictions are lifted and an acceleration in EBITDA growth from the tailwinds related to our major sports rights\u2019 resets and more efficient operating structure.  I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on slide 9. We generated $13.3 billion in free cash flow and paid $4.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders in 2020. Consolidated total capital, which includes CapEx as well as software and intangibles, decreased 6.4% for the year to $11.6 billion, while working capital improved by $2.2 billion to a decline of $178 million for the full year, both reflecting an impact from COVID.  Looking to 2021, we anticipate total capital will remain relatively flat to 2020 levels, while the working capital drag will increase relative to the levels we saw in 2019, which is the more appropriate comparison, due to an increase in content investment, our broadcast of the Olympics and the reversal of COVID related one-time tax deferrals.  Turning to capital allocation, our strategy has always been a balance of several important priorities, maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing in profitable organic growth and returning capital to shareholders. First, on our balance sheet, we've made great progress reducing net debt from a $108 billion post the Sky acquisition at the end of 2018 to $90 billion at the end of 2020.  Second, we remain focused on organic investment in our businesses to grow the long-term earnings power of the company, including our CapEx investment in Broadband and Parks and continued investment behind other growth initiatives where we see strong return on investments such as Xfinity Mobile, Peacock, Flex, Sky Q and Broadband in Italy.  Third, we are committed to returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, and we have a proven track record. We have increased our dividend 13 years in a row at a 17% CAGR significantly in excess of the S&P over that same time period. In addition, we have a demonstrated history of buying back stock, having reduced our share count by nearly 20% between the NBCUniversal and Sky acquisitions.  In 2021, we believe we will be able to return to our historical practice of returning ample capital to our shareholders. We are again raising the dividend by $0.08 a share to a $1 per share, and we are planning to return to buying back our stock. As Brian mentioned, our hope is to start in the back half of this year, gradually ramping up to historical levels while we continue to pace towards hitting our intended target leverage levels, which we currently expect to reach by year end 2022.  The specific timing and magnitude of our buyback activity will be subject to improvement in our businesses most impacted by the pandemic and the implications related to potential changes in tax policy. So, thanks for joining us on the call this morning.  And I'll now hand it back to Marci to handle Q&A. \nMarci Ryvicker : Thanks, Mike. Regina, let's open the call for questions please. \nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you. Good morning. One for I guess, Brian, and Dave on Cable, and then one for Jeff on NBC. So obviously, really strong customer metrics in 2020, particularly on the broadband side. And I was curious, when you look at what transpired last year in terms of the increased demand for the product, and also how you guys operate in the business. What are the things that you think are COVID-specific versus durable?  I mean, I know you talked about 2019 as the benchmark year. But as we think about the longer term, how do you look at last year's performance and some of the specific drivers in terms of their durability beyond the pandemic? And then for Jeff, you guys laid out, I realized this is prior to your elevation as CEO, I think 30 million to 35 million active accounts on Peacock by \u201924.  I know signups inactive accounts are different metrics. But it seems like you're nicely ahead of that trajectory. Can you just sort of reframe the opportunity with Peacock for us today versus kind of the initial outlook and when might revenues become kind of material to NBC for that business? Thanks, everyone.\nDave Watson: Well, Ben, this is Dave. I'll kick off on the Cable side. I think it starts with the main point that we've had great momentum in Broadband for many quarters now well before COVID. There's been real strength in the category for us, and I think if we point towards the fundamentals of Broadband, and the fundamentals have been very consistent for us.  And it starts with the market, the market is growing we're taking share. And the sources are geographic all over the country where we serve and across the board competitively, with DSL sources, telco wired, wireless, and other competitors. So, I think, while they're in '20 truly an exceptional year from performance.  And as Brian said, I think the right way of looking at '20 you got to look at the full year results. And when you do that the 2 million net customer additions, it really is extraordinary. Fundamentals that we see going forward, low churn. We compete well on the front end, because we've consistently invested in the best network in the marketplace. And I think that is ubiquitous.  We deliver the best overall service, redefine the category in speed, coverage, control, and now streaming. And so, you add up all those things, I think it points towards strong organic growth. But as you look to next year, as Mike said, we do have a healthy start to the year. We're really encouraged what we're seeing right out of the gates.  But I do think 2020 as everybody went home and there is just a lot more in a short period of time, folks that were working from home, schooling from home, I think there's -- that's a unique moment. But I think the fundamentals continue. We have penetration upside. There's growth opportunities that we believe strongly. I think '19 was a very strong year, too by the way. I think that is the right one to look at as the best benchmark on a go-forward basis.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America. \nDave Watson: Hey Ben. So, Peacock obviously is primarily an AVOD service. And we have a number of metrics, the one that we that Brian and Mike talked about today is signups with loops every quarter which we reached 33 million this week. People sign up then they use it actively and then the usage per user that drive the amount of hours we saw on advertising.  And we are up significantly over all of our metrics versus what we anticipated going into the business. We are only, we launched this on Comcast just over nine months ago and nationally just over six months ago, so we\u2019re at the very beginning of this business. But we are very confident based on the small amount of time that the business model has adapted the right business model, people are signing up, they are using what we have expected. And advertisers are very interested in buying it.  So, this steady growth is very promising for us and we don\u2019t have anything to reframe at this point, but I think that the performance that is much better than we expected, give us a lot of optionality going forward. But we're just going to continue to drive this business model now and focus on the advertising revenue. \nBen Swinburne: Thank you. \nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Ben. Regina, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America. Please go ahead. \nJessica Ehrlich : Thank you. I also have two questions. First, on NBCU. Can you talk about the kind of the timeframe and where you'll see the benefits of the restructuring? And within that, like, what is the long-term view of Cable Networks, will it be at all eventually be in Peacock? And on the Cable side, several of you mentioned I think Brian, I think all of you mentioned the benefits of the new Verizon MVNO deal. Where will that show up, will it be in revenue, additional services? What's the timeframe for that as well? Thank you.\nBrian Roberts : Jeff, you want to start? \nJeff Shell : Yes, thanks, Brian. Hi, Jessica. So, we view, obviously, our television business as a whole. As Mike says, we're going to redo how we report starting next quarter. And we view the whole television business as a whole. And while our restructuring definitely took a lot of cost out of the business, which you're starting to see in the numbers. The real purpose of it was to allow us to grow in the future and really run it as one business.  So, Cable Networks obviously are a big part of the business, they're still the biggest EBITDA driver. And I don't expect that to change anytime in the near future. But we're looking at the two revenue streams of the business, its subscription and advertising as one business, Broadcast, Cable and Peacock. And we're programming it as such, we're selling it to advertisers as one platform as such.  And so, I think over time it'll be harder and harder to distinguish between the profitability of Cable Networks and the rest of our television business because we're looking at it as one business. But the restructuring allows us to run it like that and we think that that's going to allow us to really grow the business over time.  Dave, you want to take on wireless?\nDave Watson: Yeah. Hi, Jessica. So, we've been really pleased with the relationship of Verizon, we had a great partnership and glad that one important aspect of things is that improved MVNO. Brian mentioned, the capital light approach is working for us, we think is going to work in the future.  So, I think as a starting point certainly will enable us to amplify what we're already doing, really push towards a range of offers that keep us very competitive. We continue to grab switching share and the mobile space. But you back up for a second and we're just overall, we have been pleased and we're very optimistic about the mobile business and what it will do.  In particular, continues to perform very well for broadband retention. And so, we're committed to accelerating growth in mobile. And we mentioned this last time. And while the MVNO enhancement will be a nice step forward, there are a lot of other things that we're doing like, really going after every single sales channel that we have. We reopen retail in a safe mode, new safety protocols and every single sales channel, whether it's digital, all centers, you name it, we're really focusing on mobile.  So, we're also leaning into 5G. We'll participate very much in 5G and we're featuring mobile in packaging, with broadband, leading in some cases when there's a new product, NPI, whether it's Apple, Samsung, we use that moment to literally lead with mobile. So, I think overall, we're real pleased. And I think we feel good about the runway.  I would also point towards our overarching plan that one, we have access to I think just the country's best network, with Verizon. And so, we talked about that. I think we also are leveraging -- continue to leverage Wi-Fi. And we're -- we've always uniquely provided a great experience, not just in the home, we're improving things outside in the public area.  And then over time, I think the key thing too is being able to add a third layer, which could be our own targeted wireless infrastructure which we might use to supplement the Verizon network and really go after the high dense usage areas, spectrum that we've already acquired. So, I think all these factors point towards particularly a unique opportunity for us. \nJessica Ehrlich: Thank you. \nMarci Ryvicker: Thank you, Jessica. Regina, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. \nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. If I can just follow-up on wireless, when you said that you can improve the range of offerings to more customers as part of the new MVNO, can you address business customers now with your wireless service? And perhaps you could before but any clarification on that? And what are the new offerings and where the new customers that you can address as a result of the changes to the MVNO?  And then, Brian, not to put you on the spot, but any thoughts on the Olympics and its likelihood and potential benefit to Peacock or the rest of the operations? Thank you. \nBrian Roberts : Well, I think on the wireless question, I think this is the beginning of the year. So, I think we'll have more to report as the year goes on. We're going to follow-up on what Dave just said, but we think including some offerings to businesses. But it's early in the year, so stay tuned.  But I think what we wanted to convey today is that the piece parts are in place, and that we have momentum, and it's a strategic part of our bundle, as Dave just said, in terms of reducing churn and also driving us toward breakeven and profitability. And if this was -- these were important elements to get right. So, I would say more to follow. And the question about Olympics is what, will it happen? Or be a bit more specific, if you don't mind, Doug?\nDoug Mitchelson: Yes, sorry, Brian. I guess there's some concern out there as whether or not the Olympics will happen. And I know, it\u2019s sort of important for driving your businesses and it was something you were excited about in terms of marketing Peacock last year. And as you've taken a step forward in Peacock and had some initial success, how do you think about using Olympics as a vehicle to drive usage and awareness of Peacock?\nBrian Roberts: Yeah. Understood. Well, first of all, I want to echo what Jeff said, really pleased with how fast Peacock has exceeded this year, even without the Olympics that we had hoped for and that was going to be the big launch moment. So, I think the team is doing an outstanding job and giving us the best start that that I think everyone would want to have an even better than that, perhaps. So that gives us just great expectations for the future. So, sitting here today, I believe there will be in Olympics. I hope it'll be in Olympics and I think that's our best intelligence at this time. And we're excited about that. I think it can be done in a variety of ways, as we've seen sporting events all over the world take place from Premier League to the NFL, and many others with limited spectators, no spectators or wherever the world may be in Japan in July. That'll be up to the host country and host committee.  If in the event, it doesn't happen, we have another Olympics coming in Beijing, seven months later or so. So, I don't know Jeff, do you want to add anything to that but we're very hopeful and believe that they'll find a way to safely and successfully have the Olympics, which for us is a television event and would be an amazing moment for the world to come back together post what we've all globally been through, which is so unprecedented. So, we're super hopeful and optimistic.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thank you.\nJeff Shell: Yeah, I guess\u2026\nMarci Ryvicker: Yeah, go ahead, Jeff.\nBrian Roberts: Go ahead.\nJeff Shell: No, I was just going to add to what Brian said. I think advertisers also are optimistic that the Olympics are coming and continue to pace. I think last earnings call I said, we were up over where we were a year ago when we thought the Olympics would be a year ago, that gap has grown even further as advertisers kind of jumped in to buy.  So, anything can happen in this COVID world. We don't know what's going to happen, but we're pretty confident that Olympics is going to happen, and advertisers are kind of jumping in and agreeing with Brian\u2019s sentiments.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thank you. \nMarci Ryvicker: Regina, we're now ready for the next question. Thanks. \nOperator: Your next question comes from a line of Phil Cusick with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nPhil Cusick: Hi, guys. Thank you. Thanks for the buyback commentary. Should we still look at 2.5 times trailing 12 months EBITDA for test for buybacks? And can you remind us what the year-end '22 target is? And then Mike to confirm your comments on margins and capital intensity, I think you're guiding to Cable margins, capital intensity improvements versus 2020 but not giving a level.  I assume that's against reported numbers, despite all the moving pieces. Can you give us any sort of direction on that level and why not guide this year versus previous years? Thanks.\nMike Cavanagh : Sure Phil, it's Mike and, Dave -- I'll do the second one first. I think Dave gave plenty of color in terms of as well as I think in the earlier comments about the activities of the Cable division in terms of focus on expenses, locking in programming renewals, which and just driving the business towards connectivity, and wireless towards profitability.  And all those factors, come together and when you look at the long-term [Indiscernible] a business including our comments is that, we are confident in our ability to increase profitability, expand margins and improve capital intensity not just in 2021 and that is versus reported 2020 numbers to your question.  But really thereafter, I mean, I think the business is set up for that, for the long-term horizon beyond just the year ahead. So, calling out specific numbers, I think is of less utility frankly than giving you the broad backdrop that gives you the long-term lens through which you can judge all those pieces. But we're quite confident that all those things coming together expenses plan and efficiency on the capital side, combined with innovation and focus on connectivity allows us to give that outlook that of improving margins and capital intensity looking out ahead.  In terms of -- Dave, I don't know if you have anything to add there? \nDave Watson: Yes, I think the focus of us really going after margin capital intensity improvements, that's not going to stop, starts with connectivity, and building customer relationships in a profitable way managing this video transition, like we're doing. And extreme focus around expenses that we in a healthy way, Mike talked about, Brian's talked about just taking a lot of transactions out.  Our digital focus and self-install kits, these are things that I think are very durable, that'll go beyond what we're dealing with in this environment. I think we learned a ton. And we'll continue to operate the business in a unique way. So, I think you look towards those kinds of activities the amount of SIK, today two-thirds of the transactions that connects or that way, and then three quarters of our digital capable transactions are being completed through our digital tools.  We're going to continue to focus on all those things that just drive non-programming cost. And so, we'll stay focused on all of that.\nMike Cavanagh : And then, just elaborating I think earlier comments really covered it all on buybacks, but I'll just expand a bit. I mean, obviously, we've been talking Brian and I and the team for a while about our desire to get back into the historical balance on capital allocation, which as you know is even the balance sheet strong, making healthy investments in the organic growth across our businesses which I think from listening to the call today.  Anyone would, I hope gather that we continue to be very lean -- very much leaning into doing that where we see returns and opportunity to make investments in these businesses for growth. And then get back to our balance with complete capital return. You know, it's the 13th year we've increased the dividend, but we turned off buybacks for a while and want to return to being in that portion of the return element as well.  So, as I said, we're pleased with where the balance sheet is. We've gotten net debt down to $90 billion from $108 billion after Sky. Just the evidence that we're seeing in Parks in the fourth quarter, we were breaking as the Beijing pre operating cost, even with Hollywood closed and even with capacity constraints, just gives us a high degree of confidence that when people can return to travel on the other side of vaccinations, outpacing the virus, that we're going to see the COVID impacted EBITDA businesses snap back to historical levels.  To your point, it's going to take 12 months for it to run through and get it fully back, hence our point that, in the second half of this year, we'd expect to see the beginnings of that and rather than wait for a full 12 months. We'll start -- we hope and plan to begin our buyback at that moment.  We'll keep it at the historical level, call it as much as $5 billion ramp up to that and probably stay there until we actually get to the definition that you called out on a 12 month trailing basis to get to around or just inside 2.5 times. And I expect that to happen by the end of 2022.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thank you, Phil. Regina, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with Moffettnathanson. Please go ahead.\nCraig Moffett : Yes, hi, two questions, if I could. First, Brian, you talked a little bit about how pleased you are with Flex. We certainly get more questions about it from our clients now than had been the case with a lot of enthusiasm for what Flex could become. So, wonder if you could just expand on Flex a little bit and talk about what your hopes and expectations are for Flex? And could you grow that into a national product that is widely distributed or even a global product that's widely distributed as an aggregator platform?  And then with respect to wireless, I wonder if you could just update us on your thinking about the CBRS spectrum now that we're out of the CBRS quiet period and what you might do now with the amount of small cells for traffic offload, whether you're testing that in any markets or how much traffic you expect you might be able to offload from the MVNO agreement?\nBrian Roberts : Dave, why don't you take the second one first about wireless and CBRS. I don't know if there's anything to add at this moment, but and if you want to feel free to talk about that? \nDave Watson: Well, Craig, we have\u2026\nBrian Roberts :  And if you want to start on Flex, that's fine and I can follow you so, we can do both.\nDave Watson: Okay, yes, well, let me touch on the first one then and go into CBRS. But going Flex, starting Craig with their current strategy just a little bit, that we package it with broadband, another great way of surrounding broadband with products that drive better retention outcomes. And that it's working, it's working very well. So, we target it to the streaming segment and give the customer great experience with excellent voice and all the apps, so tons of apps will have just about everything.  Pleased with the Peacock performance for sure. All the other apps that we've launched, including HBO Max and soon to be later on this quarter, Disney. I think today it is more targeted. But as you mentioned, I really do think the next phase that we're working on and developing for and turning our innovation focus is that this is a long-term platform opportunity for us.  And aspect of the company that we have called XUMO, that I think you all know that's one piece of being able to drive, helped drive advertising. We can participate and revenue in the app split's that we get. And so, we think of this with scale. And as you build a common software stack that includes Sky, do it together, which we're already working on, and then you have opportunities which we've talked about going to smart TVs, but really leveraging unique scale internationally that we can have, whether it's a device or whether it's a software solution.  But I think these are the things that we'll look at. Right now, it's working great within footprint, but we're building our plans beyond that. \nBrian Roberts : Hang on for sec, let me just add to that then that the whole articulation of the company's strategy with broadband and aggregation and streaming, I think is embodied inside flex. So, Peacock's success very much partially due to the early success to what Flex can do for Broadband customers. And we're seeing other programmers are approaching us with their content and seeing with both the X1 platform and the Peacock platform and this Flex platform can do for them.  So, that's led us to looking at what Dave was just talking about, what are other opportunities that are in -- that can be taken advantage of this scale and this platform and the ability to bundle things that way? And I think we'll have more to talk about throughout the year. Same sort of answer on the wireless question.  I think what we're set up for future opportunities with some of the investments we've made and some of our early success. So, I share your client\u2019s enthusiasm, I think the product is going to continue to improve. We'll have some more updates on that as we go along. But I'm very encouraged as well. And I think the team that created Flex has done a great service for the company. Keep going, Dave. \nDave Watson: I think the only other point on wireless and Brian and Craig would be, we are looking at and working on development plans around the targeted use of the CBRS spectrum in dense high usage areas and how we could offload traffic, how the experience be terrific in doing so? So, nothing more really to comment at this point. This is a multiyear effort, but a lot of focus is on it right now.\nCraig Moffett : Thank you both. \nMarci Ryvicker: Thank you, Craig. Regina, next question please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nBrett Feldman: Thanks. And if you don't mind, I'm actually just going to follow up on Phil's question. So Mike, when you were responding to his question on the buybacks, you talked about ramping back up towards the historical level of $5 billion a year until you get back to sort of that long-term leverage target of about 2.5 turns.  But if I think longer term, if you were to sort of remain at your historical buyback pace, you would probably continue to de-lever and I think actually quite rapidly. Historically, you've tended to redeploy that excess liquidity into your strategic M&A program. And so, the question is, how do you think about the medium to long-term importance of preserving dry powder of that type of flexibility, versus whether your current asset portfolio is sufficiently well suited to meet your long-term operating targets? Thank you.\nMike Cavanagh : Sure, Brian can obviously chime in. But I think we feel very good about the collection of businesses that we have, how they fit together, how Sky is enabled together with Cable and NBC, things that are advances in the three pillars that Brian described, broadband, streaming and aggregation. So, I won't repeat too many of those proof points of what we are as a company.  But, we'll always look at M&A, but I don't think there's any doubt that we are very pleased and don't see any strategic gaps in the portfolio that we have. So, we'll talk about it when we get to the 2.5 times. But I wouldn't suggest that beyond that stage, we would just deliver. I mean, we get inside that number and from there, we'll have options and we'll discuss it with folks as we get there. But that's where we stand today. Brian, anything else you want to add? \nBrian Roberts : Yeah, I would just add two other things. I think it's an important moment for us today in getting to a point that we feel the businesses are healthy that we can see, we believe and we hope obviously things can change with progress, with the vaccinations and the impaired businesses really having a roadmap to full recovery and beyond.  And so, getting back in balance with as Mike described earlier, I think is really important something that I certainly really have wanted us to get to. Second, we've also said that we'd like to mix up businesses. Hopefully 70% of the company being broadband-centric is proved to be a really successful model.  And we've had 10 wonderful years of growth with NBCUniversal and last year was the only exception to that. So, we expect great growth in all our businesses but having a mix with the businesses can work together. But having majority of the company being broadband centric has worked really well for us.  So, I think it's a -- we are very pleased with the company we've got, we got a great scale, we've got momentum. That's where our focus at and the main priority was today to get to this announcement of our expectations, and then go ahead and hopefully, see the world go in the right direction here and continue on the path we're on and get to the execution of that later in this year. So important step today. \nBrett Feldman: Thank you. \nMarci Ryvicker: Thank you, Brett. Regina, we have time for one last question. \nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead. \nJohn Hodulik: Great, thanks. Two quick ones, I think. Maybe first as follow-up for Jeff on Peacock. Can you give us a sense of what content is resonating and any color you have on engagement or ARPU or pay subs? And should we expect more spending on sports rights for the platform following up on the WWE deal? And then maybe for Brian, just thoughts upon how the regulatory backdrop will evolve? And is there any concern that net neutrality will emerge as a new policy goal? Thanks.\nBrian Roberts : Jeff you want to go first?\nJeff Shell: Yeah, thanks Brian and John. So, it's obviously, let me start with the office. So the office, we have the office as of January 1st, we've had it now for almost a month, very pleased with how it's doing. Our usage among our customers are actually higher than we think the usage was amongst Netflix customers.  And more importantly what's happening is, we're seeing that people who are watching The Office on Peacock are watching lots of other comedies. So it\u2019s really driving Parks Rec, and really driving Brooklyn 99 amongst others. So, there's kind of an ecosystem of that.  We've talked in previous quarters about how EPL has really worked for us, it was Premier League and how those viewers also came in and to our surprise a much greater percentage of them, then turn them watching other things like Yellowstone and or comedy. So, we believe, there's kind of an ecosystem here, like the whole world of broadcast where people will, we can cross promote people into different things. And that certainly seems to be working and The Office has really worked. WWE is kind of a perfect property for us, because it allows us to number one, thousands of hours of programming that were behind a paywall that will now put on the free service of Peacock, which will not only enhance the brand of WWE, but we can monetize an advertising. We get the events that were behind a paywall that used to be pay per view, can drive our 499 Premium version of Peacock. And then remember, we have a big investment in WWE at USA on our linear networks. And so, this kind of perfectly fits into our model of operating the business as a whole and cross promoting and selling advertising clients one platform, one solution, as Linda calls it. So, I think the model that we've constructed here to really kind of leverage our existing linear businesses and drive advertising is working, and I think comedy, sports, two of the success stories certainly so far.\nBrian Roberts : Okay. And I know, we'll be having this conversation about the new administration government. So, let me just quickly say, I don't think there's anything new. We've managed successfully to work with different administrations, with different regulatory perspectives around the broadband business.  And -- but our view is obviously strongly felt that the long-standing light touch regulation has worked since President Clinton created that classification and reduces regulatory risk for investors and allowed the company to invest more and have paid dividends unbelievably well during COVID. And we were never asked to down raise any services. And content providers and consumers really benefited. And that wasn't universally the case around the globe, with different broadband regimes. But we do believe in the neutrality and how we're not going to discriminate, block, throttle and some of the other principles that we've committed to. And so, if there's a way to find a way to codify that and perhaps with this issue and a permanent more consistent place that's certainly a possibility.  I would like to just end the call by introducing Dana Strong just for a moment, who's taken over Sky just last couple weeks. Starting next call, Dana will be available to talk about Sky in great detail, but Dana didn't want this moment to pass without congratulating you, with this introducing you to the group here to say just a few words.\nDana Strong : Thanks so much, Brian. It's great to have the opportunity to say quick hello to everyone. Looking forward to talk again in future quarters as Brian mentioned. Maybe for now, let me just briefly say that having spent the past few weeks in the UK, I'm extremely confident about the exciting opportunities ahead for Sky.  When Brian called me, I knew this was an opportunity I couldn't pass up. Because I've always had great admiration for Sky having worked in Europe, as long as I have, Brian mentioned that before. Sometimes competing and partnering with Sky across those many years, I think I'm in the position to truly appreciate the unique market position that Sky holds in its iconic brands.  And I just have to say that Jeremy has built an incredible organization, an amazing breadth of assets and a fantastic team. And I couldn't be more excited about leading Sky in this next chapter. So Brian, look forward to talking more about it in future calls and back to you.\nBrian Roberts : Thank you and Jeremy, thank you as well. And I know you'll be guiding us here through the rest of this year as well. But both of you are going to be a great team. That wraps it up for me, Marci, do you have anything else? \nMarci Ryvicker: I just like to thank everyone for joining us on our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. We hope you stay healthy and safe. \nBrian Roberts : Thanks everybody.\nOperator: There will be a replay available of today's call starting at 12 o'clock PM Eastern Time. It will run through Thursday, February 4 at midnight Eastern Time. The dial in number is 855-859-2056 and the conference ID number is 7964167. A recording of the conference call will also be available on the company's website beginning at 12:30 PM Eastern time today. This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for participating.

            "name": "Dave Watson",
            "content": "Well, Ben, this is Dave. I'll kick off on the Cable side. I think it starts with the main point that we've had great momentum in Broadband for many quarters now well before COVID. There's been real strength in the category for us, and I think if we point towards the fundamentals of Broadband, and the fundamentals have been very consistent for us.  And it starts with the market, the market is growing we're taking share. And the sources are geographic all over the country where we serve and across the board competitively, with DSL sources, telco wired, wireless, and other competitors. So, I think, while they're in '20 truly an exceptional year from performance.  And as Brian said, I think the right way of looking at '20 you got to look at the full year results. And when you do that the 2 million net customer additions, it really is extraordinary. Fundamentals that we see going forward, low churn. We compete well on the front end, because we've consistently invested in the best network in the marketplace. And I think that is ubiquitous.  We deliver the best overall service, redefine the category in speed, coverage, control, and now streaming. And so, you add up all those things, I think it points towards strong organic growth. But as you look to next year, as Mike said, we do have a healthy start to the year. We're really encouraged what we're seeing right out of the gates.  But I do think 2020 as everybody went home and there is just a lot more in a short period of time, folks that were working from home, schooling from home, I think there's -- that's a unique moment. But I think the fundamentals continue. We have penetration upside. There's growth opportunities that we believe strongly. I think '19 was a very strong year, too by the way. I think that is the right one to look at as the best benchmark on a go-forward basis. Hey Ben. So, Peacock obviously is primarily an AVOD service. And we have a number of metrics, the one that we that Brian and Mike talked about today is signups with loops every quarter which we reached 33 million this week. People sign up then they use it actively and then the usage per user that drive the amount of hours we saw on advertising.  And we are up significantly over all of our metrics versus what we anticipated going into the business. We are only, we launched this on Comcast just over nine months ago and nationally just over six months ago, so we're at the very beginning of this business. But we are very confident based on the small amount of time that the business model has adapted the right business model, people are signing up, they are using what we have expected. And advertisers are very interested in buying it.  So, this steady growth is very promising for us and we don't have anything to reframe at this point, but I think that the performance that is much better than we expected, give us a lot of optionality going forward. But we're just going to continue to drive this business model now and focus on the advertising revenue. Yeah. Hi, Jessica. So, we've been really pleased with the relationship of Verizon, we had a great partnership and glad that one important aspect of things is that improved MVNO. Brian mentioned, the capital light approach is working for us, we think is going to work in the future.  So, I think as a starting point certainly will enable us to amplify what we're already doing, really push towards a range of offers that keep us very competitive. We continue to grab switching share and the mobile space. But you back up for a second and we're just overall, we have been pleased and we're very optimistic about the mobile business and what it will do.  In particular, continues to perform very well for broadband retention. And so, we're committed to accelerating growth in mobile. And we mentioned this last time. And while the MVNO enhancement will be a nice step forward, there are a lot of other things that we're doing like, really going after every single sales channel that we have. We reopen retail in a safe mode, new safety protocols and every single sales channel, whether it's digital, all centers, you name it, we're really focusing on mobile.  So, we're also leaning into 5G. We'll participate very much in 5G and we're featuring mobile in packaging, with broadband, leading in some cases when there's a new product, NPI, whether it's Apple, Samsung, we use that moment to literally lead with mobile. So, I think overall, we're real pleased. And I think we feel good about the runway.  I would also point towards our overarching plan that one, we have access to I think just the country's best network, with Verizon. And so, we talked about that. I think we also are leveraging -- continue to leverage Wi-Fi. And we're -- we've always uniquely provided a great experience, not just in the home, we're improving things outside in the public area.  And then over time, I think the key thing too is being able to add a third layer, which could be our own targeted wireless infrastructure which we might use to supplement the Verizon network and really go after the high dense usage areas, spectrum that we've already acquired. So, I think all these factors point towards particularly a unique opportunity for us. Yes, I think the focus of us really going after margin capital intensity improvements, that's not going to stop, starts with connectivity, and building customer relationships in a profitable way managing this video transition, like we're doing. And extreme focus around expenses that we in a healthy way, Mike talked about, Brian's talked about just taking a lot of transactions out.  Our digital focus and self-install kits, these are things that I think are very durable, that'll go beyond what we're dealing with in this environment. I think we learned a ton. And we'll continue to operate the business in a unique way. So, I think you look towards those kinds of activities the amount of SIK, today two-thirds of the transactions that connects or that way, and then three quarters of our digital capable transactions are being completed through our digital tools.  We're going to continue to focus on all those things that just drive non-programming cost. And so, we'll stay focused on all of that. Well, Craig, we have... Okay, yes, well, let me touch on the first one then and go into CBRS. But going Flex, starting Craig with their current strategy just a little bit, that we package it with broadband, another great way of surrounding broadband with products that drive better retention outcomes. And that it's working, it's working very well.

            "name": "Jeff Shell",
            "content": "Yes, thanks, Brian. Hi, Jessica. So, we view, obviously, our television business as a whole. As Mike says, we're going to redo how we report starting next quarter. And we view the whole television business as a whole. And while our restructuring definitely took a lot of cost out of the business, which you're starting to see in the numbers. The real purpose of it was to allow us to grow in the future and really run it as one business.  So, Cable Networks obviously are a big part of the business, they're still the biggest EBITDA driver. And I don't expect that to change anytime in the near future. But we're looking at the two revenue streams of the business, its subscription and advertising as one business, Broadcast, Cable and Peacock. And we're programming it as such, we're selling it to advertisers as one platform as such.  And so, I think over time it'll be harder and harder to distinguish between the profitability of Cable Networks and the rest of our television business because we're looking at it as one business. But the restructuring allows us to run it like that and we think that that's going to allow us to really grow the business over time.  Dave, you want to take on wireless? Yeah, I guess... No, I was just going to add to what Brian said. I think advertisers also are optimistic that the Olympics are coming and continue to pace. I think last earnings call I said, we were up over where we were a year ago when we thought the Olympics would be a year ago, that gap has grown even further as advertisers kind of jumped in to buy.  So, anything can happen in this COVID world. We don't know what's going to happen, but we're pretty confident that Olympics is going to happen, and advertisers are kind of jumping in and agreeing with Brian's sentiments. Yeah, thanks Brian and John. So, it's obviously, let me start with the office. So the office, we have the office as of January 1st, we've had it now for almost a month, very pleased with how it's doing. Our usage among our customers are actually higher than we think the usage was amongst Netflix customers.  And more importantly what's happening is, we're seeing that people who are watching The Office on Peacock are watching lots of other comedies. So it's really driving Parks Rec, and really driving Brooklyn 99 amongst others. So, there's kind of an ecosystem of that.  We've talked in previous quarters about how EPL has really worked for us, it was Premier League and how those viewers also came in and to our surprise a much greater percentage of them, then turn them watching other things like Yellowstone and or comedy. So, we believe, there's kind of an ecosystem here, like the whole world of broadcast where people will, we can cross promote people into different things. And that certainly seems to be working and The Office has really worked. WWE is kind of a perfect property for us, because it allows us to number one, thousands of hours of programming that were behind a paywall that will now put on the free service of Peacock, which will not only enhance the brand of WWE, but we can monetize an advertising. We get the events that were behind a paywall that used to be pay per view, can drive our 499 Premium version of Peacock. And then remember, we have a big investment in WWE at USA on our linear networks. And so, this kind of perfectly fits into our model of operating the business as a whole and cross promoting and selling advertising clients one platform, one solution, as Linda calls it. So, I think the model that we've constructed here to really kind of leverage our existing linear businesses and drive advertising is working, and I think comedy, sports, two of the success stories certainly so far."

            "name": "Brian Roberts",
            "content": "Thanks Marci and good morning everyone. Really proud of our fourth quarter results and look forward to giving you a glimpse of what we're focused on and excited about once we come out of this pandemic. Our most recent performance was highlighted by Cable which grew EBITDA by over 12% and net cash flow by 26%. These are the best results of the year and that of any fourth quarter in over a decade.  We also have good news to share on our Park segment which reached breakeven excluding Beijing, even with Hollywood being closed. Our premium ad-supported streaming service Peacock now has 33 million sign-ups within just six months of its nationwide launch. And encouragingly [indiscernible] customer and revenue base essentially return to pre-COVID levels this past quarter.  Clearly, our company has strong testament to the tough decisions made by our leadership team and the excellent execution and coordination by our dedicated employees. Looking back over the whole year, 2020 was one of the most uncertain and challenging periods that any of us can remember.  But we rose to the occasion, ensuring the safety and protection of our employees, providing customers with unparalleled service and innovative products that they relied on more than ever, strengthening our investment grade balance sheet and continuing to invest for long-term growth and success.  This year's Cable results were nothing short of exceptional, hitting a number of company records. We generated 2 million net broadband additions for the year, and 538,000 for the fourth quarter, reaching record low churn. High speed internet drove our highest ever full year net customer relationship additions of 1.6 million, bringing us to 33 million total customer relationships. Yet with just only 50% penetration of our footprint, there remains plenty of opportunity for future growth.  We also delivered outstanding EBITDA growth of nearly 9% and cash flow growth of 16% all of 2020. Broadband is the cornerstone of what we do, powered by our robust, flexible and reliable network. And many years of investments we've made have been on full display.  We've continued to enhance our market leading competitive position, while keeping people connected, protected, informed and entertained by proactively managing our network, increasing broadband speeds, expanding our internet essentials program for low-income households, providing payment plans for customers struggling the most, and offering Peacock and Flex for free.  This pandemic has forced us to rethink the way we operate and service our customers. Immediately, we moved all of our care reps to work remotely from home, which has gone so well that we're leaning towards embracing this model permanently. In addition, we promoted further adoption of our digital self-help tools such as Xfinity Assistant, which are available 24x7.  We also expanded our self-installation eligibility. And now over two thirds of our customers are connecting to our services this way. We are working hard with our communications and marketing efforts to enhance awareness, all we have to offer, which enables us to take costs out of the business, while delivering a better experience for our customers.  In fact, in the past 12 months, we've reduced agent handled calls by over 16 million, and truck rolls by 1.6 million, all while adding more than 1.5 million net new customer relationships. Our efforts to reduce costs have been extremely successful. But what's even more exciting are the investments we're making to grow the overall business. The great example is Flex, which is offered to all of our broadband only customers for free, so that they can connect seamlessly to the streaming services they love.  Within the first half of this year, Flex along with X1, will be carrying all of the top streaming apps in United States. We just added HBO Max, we'll be adding Disney Plus in the near future and we have many more on the roadmap. Flex has been a major win for us and we continue to have really high hopes.  Xfinity Mobile just came off a strong fourth quarter with nice sequential improvement in customer additions, resulting from a number of significant changes as we fully integrate mobile into our core Cable operations and reprioritized our sales channels. We're really excited for 2021 as we've recently expanded parts of our MVNO agreement with Verizon that will enable us to improve our range of offerings and acquire more customers more profitably. As we said from the beginning, an MVNO led capital-light wireless model is the right one for us and has even more strategic opportunity in the years ahead. Business services came back faster than we expected. This quarter, we added 26,000 net new customers and generated revenue growth of 4.8%, the highest we've seen since the pandemic began. With less than 20% share of an approximately $50 billion total addressable commercial market in our footprint, we saw plenty of runway. All-in-all, Cable had a fantastic 2020 and we look forward to a very strong 2021 and beyond. While the global pandemic has had a more significant impact on NBCUniversal, we took advantage of this moment to make a number of changes in both management and operations which sets us up for success.  The most notable example, is the reorganization of our Cable Networks and Broadcast Television businesses, which are now combined along with Peacock in a structure meant to drive long-term cost efficiencies and revenue opportunities. We finished the year having renewed a number of carriage agreements with many of our valuable distribution partners, putting us in a position of strength, as we enter 2021.  Peacock has had an exceptional start, exceeding all of our internal targets. This premium hybrid AVOD service, which has a light ad load and is unlike any other, offers a breath of content that appeals to just about every demographic, at an unbeatable consumer value, much of it for free. Momentum has further accelerated with the addition of the Office, which we own and began streaming exclusively on Peacock as of January 1.  Not only is the Office driving incremental users, but these viewers are naturally finding and watching other programs on this platform like Parks and Rec, Yellowstone, our latest original Saved by the Bell, mega hit movies from Universal and other studios, and sporting events such as the Premier League, Golf and even an NFL Wild Card game. And earlier this week, we announced that Modern Family will be coming to Peacock next month, followed by the WWE in March.  In Film, our decision to release our titles direct-to-consumer via premium video on demand when theaters were forced to close has proven to be profitable and the right move for us. While we look forward to when we can enjoy the theatrical release of many franchise films such as Fast 9 and the next Minions and Jurassic World, we will lean into what has become a successful hybrid distribution model.  COVID had the most direct impact on our theme parks, which were either closed or running at limited capacity for the bulk of 2020. But I'm pleased with how quickly we were able to reopen Orlando and Osaka while ensuring the safety of our staff and guests. We continue to provide an amazing entertainment experience. Our guests are responding as confirmed by our steadily increased attendance and our most recent financial results.  What we saw this fourth quarter, especially in Orlando, gives us even more conviction in the momentum that our theme parks will experience when we reach a sustainable recovery. We may experience some near-term setbacks with the most recent pick up in COVID cases, but I'm optimistic as ever about the long-term trajectory of this very special business.  Sky had a strong and encouraging fourth quarter. We added net new customers in every market, bringing our customer base essentially back to pre-COVID levels. The same can be said for revenue, which was essentially flat from what we generated in the fourth quarter of 2019. While we continue to make meaningful progress on our strategic initiatives, Sky Q which integrates streaming, has surpassed 60% penetration in the UK, and is poised to continue with recent additions of Disney Plus, Discovery Plus and Amazon Prime video.  We're really pleased with the success of Sky Originals, which contributed to the 20% increase in viewership on our Sky Entertainment channels during the fourth quarter and all of 2020 reaffirming our commitment to creating Sky Studios and expanding original programming.  While the recent wave of COVID infections and related lockdowns across Europe are once again creating disruption, we're implementing the same protocols and procedures that work the first time around. We've confidence of a similar pattern as this latest lockdown recedes.  We really look forward to the second half of this year when we will also start to see the benefits from the reset of major sports rights contracts and cost savings that should result from a new, leaner operating model. And we're still on plan to double 2020 EBITDA over the next several years, as Jeremy recently laid out.  Speaking of Jeremy, I want to thank him for his exceptional leadership of Sky and for his partnership since the acquisition. He and the team have established a unique world-class brand and a strong, well-run business that's now fully integrated. I'm thrilled for Dana Strong, who has now taken over as CEO of Sky.  Many of you on this call have met with Dana since she joined our Cable business as Head of Consumer Services back in 2018. She is an accomplished executive with a wonderful ability to transform, inspire and drive positive change. On top of all that, she also has over 20 years of international experience with near half of it's been in Europe.  2021 offers a lot of promise for Comcast and hopefully for the entire world. While the first half will be more challenged than the second due to the most recent strain of COVID, we're really encouraged by the promise of the vaccine which is the first step in putting the parts of our business that have been most impacted back on the path toward growth.  This optimism is shared by our Board of Directors which this morning announced an increase in our dividend of our 13th consecutive year. I'm also pleased it is now our expectation that we will return to repurchasing shares in the back half of this year.  While 2020 was not what any of us had imagined a year ago with this time, our execution, cooperation and fast decision making enabled all parts of Comcast, NBCUniversal and Sky to respond and manage through a difficult environment remarkably well. I'm truly proud of what we have accomplished and our fourth quarter shows just how well this company is positioned to succeed.  Mike, over to you. Jeff, you want to start? Well, I think on the wireless question, I think this is the beginning of the year. So, I think we'll have more to report as the year goes on. We're going to follow-up on what Dave just said, but we think including some offerings to businesses. But it's early in the year, so stay tuned.  But I think what we wanted to convey today is that the piece parts are in place, and that we have momentum, and it's a strategic part of our bundle, as Dave just said, in terms of reducing churn and also driving us toward breakeven and profitability. And if this was -- these were important elements to get right. So, I would say more to follow. And the question about Olympics is what, will it happen? Or be a bit more specific, if you don't mind, Doug? Yeah. Understood. Well, first of all, I want to echo what Jeff said, really pleased with how fast Peacock has exceeded this year, even without the Olympics that we had hoped for and that was going to be the big launch moment. So, I think the team is doing an outstanding job and giving us the best start that that I think everyone would want to have an even better than that, perhaps. So that gives us just great expectations for the future. So, sitting here today, I believe there will be in Olympics. I hope it'll be in Olympics and I think that's our best intelligence at this time. And we're excited about that. I think it can be done in a variety of ways, as we've seen sporting events all over the world take place from Premier League to the NFL, and many others with limited spectators, no spectators or wherever the world may be in Japan in July. That'll be up to the host country and host committee.  If in the event, it doesn't happen, we have another Olympics coming in Beijing, seven months later or so. So, I don't know Jeff, do you want to add anything to that but we're very hopeful and believe that they'll find a way to safely and successfully have the Olympics, which for us is a television event and would be an amazing moment for the world to come back together post what we've all globally been through, which is so unprecedented. So, we're super hopeful and optimistic. Go ahead. Dave, why don't you take the second one first about wireless and CBRS. I don't know if there's anything to add at this moment, but and if you want to feel free to talk about that? And if you want to start on Flex, that's fine and I can follow you so, we can do both. Hang on for sec, let me just add to that then that the whole articulation of the company's strategy with broadband and aggregation and streaming, I think is embodied inside flex. So, Peacock's success very much partially due to the early success to what Flex can do for Broadband customers. And we're seeing other programmers are approaching us with their content and seeing with both the X1 platform and the Peacock platform and this Flex platform can do for them.  So, that's led us to looking at what Dave was just talking about, what are other opportunities that are in -- that can be taken advantage of this scale and this platform and the ability to bundle things that way? And I think we'll have more to talk about throughout the year. Same sort of answer on the wireless question.  I think what we're set up for future opportunities with some of the investments we've made and some of our early success. So, I share your client's enthusiasm, I think the product is going to continue to improve. We'll have some more updates on that as we go along. But I'm very encouraged as well. And I think the team that created Flex has done a great service for the company. Keep going, Dave. Yeah, I would just add two other things. I think it's an important moment for us today in getting to a point that we feel the businesses are healthy that we can see, we believe and we hope obviously things can change with progress, with the vaccinations and the impaired businesses really having a roadmap to full recovery and beyond.  And so, getting back in balance with as Mike described earlier, I think is really important something that I certainly really have wanted us to get to. Second, we've also said that we'd like to mix up businesses. Hopefully 70% of the company being broadband-centric is proved to be a really successful model.  And we've had 10 wonderful years of growth with NBCUniversal and last year was the only exception to that. So, we expect great growth in all our businesses but having a mix with the businesses can work together. But having majority of the company being broadband centric has worked really well for us.  So, I think it's a -- we are very pleased with the company we've got, we got a great scale, we've got momentum. That's where our focus at and the main priority was today to get to this announcement of our expectations, and then go ahead and hopefully, see the world go in the right direction here and continue on the path we're on and get to the execution of that later in this year. So important step today. Jeff you want to go first? Okay. And I know, we'll be having this conversation about the new administration government. So, let me just quickly say, I don't think there's anything new. We've managed successfully to work with different administrations, with different regulatory perspectives around the broadband business.  And -- but our view is obviously strongly felt that the long-standing light touch regulation has worked since President Clinton created that classification and reduces regulatory risk for investors and allowed the company to invest more and have paid dividends unbelievably well during COVID. And we were never asked to down raise any services. And content providers and consumers really benefited. And that wasn't universally the case around the globe, with different broadband regimes. But we do believe in the neutrality and how we're not going to discriminate, block, throttle and some of the other principles that we've committed to. And so, if there's a way to find a way to codify that and perhaps with this issue and a permanent more consistent place that's certainly a possibility.  I would like to just end the call by introducing Dana Strong just for a moment, who's taken over Sky just last couple weeks. Starting next call, Dana will be available to talk about Sky in great detail, but Dana didn't want this moment to pass without congratulating you, with this introducing you to the group here to say just a few words. Thank you and Jeremy, thank you as well. And I know you'll be guiding us here through the rest of this year as well. But both of you are going to be a great team. That wraps it up for me, Marci, do you have anything else? Thanks everybody."

            "name": "Mike Cavanagh",
            "content": "Thanks Brian and good morning everyone. Now I'll review our fourth quarter 2020 results and make some comments on current conditions and where possible on the year ahead. Let's begin on slides four and five with our consolidated results.  Revenue declined 2.4% to $27.7 billion for the fourth quarter, and 4.9% to $103.6 billion for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA declined 15% to $7.2 billion for the fourth quarter and 10% to $30.8 billion for the full year. COVID related severance and restructuring charges were $590 million in the fourth quarter and $828 million for the full year as we took actions to position our businesses for success in a post COVID world.  The corporate and other segment includes these charges and also includes Peacock for its launch year. For 2020, Peacock generated revenue of over $100 million while EBITDA losses approached $700 million. We continue to expect that EBITDA losses for 2020 and 2021 combined for Peacock will total roughly $2 billion.  Adjusted earnings per share declined 29% to $0.56 for the quarter and 17% to $2.61 for the year. Finally, free cash flow was $1.7 billion in the quarter and $13.3 billion for the full year reflecting the decline in EBITDA and the benefit from the reduction in working capital and capital expenditures in part due to the pandemic.  Now to review our business segments, starting with Cable Communications on slide 6. For the fourth quarter, Cable Communications revenue increased 6.3% while EBITDA increased 12% and adjusted EBITDA led capital grew 26%. For the full year we grew customer relationships by 1.6 million a 41% increase year-over-year with 455,000 net additions in the fourth quarter, driven by high-speed internet where we added 2 million net new residential and business customers this year and 538,000 in the fourth quarter.  These record customer additions were the primary driver of our high-speed internet revenue growth of 13% for the quarter and 10% for the full year. Other revenue highlights include acceleration in both business services and wireless. Business services posted 4.8% revenue growth and 26,000 net new customer additions primarily driven by improvement in small businesses. Wireless revenue grew 36% with 246,000 net new lines in the quarter bringing up to 2.8 million total lines at year end.  Wireless is a strategic priority for us and should accelerate on the back of several actions we have taken. First, we've expanded our Verizon MVNO agreement. Second, we fully integrated mobile into our core operations and third, we've refined our marketing and activated all of our sales channels and we're seeing a nice lift in our retail stores which are now fully opened.  For Video, revenue declined 0.7% with higher rates implemented in the beginning of 2020 more than offset by subscriber declines including a 248,000 net loss in customers this quarter. And advertising revenue increased 34% year-over-year or 2.2%, excluding political, which almost doubled what we generated in the last presidential election cycle in 2016.  Turning to expenses, Cable Communications fourth quarter expenses increased 2.4%. Programming expenses were up 7.2%, primarily due to the number of contract renewals that started to cycle through in 2020 combined with annual escalators in existing agreements.  Non-programming expenses declined slightly reflecting lower technical and product support and customer service costs, which were partially offset by higher advertising, marketing and promotion spend to drive top-line growth and higher expenses associated with the increased political advertising activity this quarter. Non-programming expenses per customer relationship decreased 5.1% despite our record customer growth. Cable Communications EBITDA grew by 12% in the quarter and 8.6% for the full year, with margins reaching 42.1% and improvement of 170 basis points excluding the RSN adjustments that impacted results earlier in the year.  Cable capital expenditures decreased 1.1%, resulting in CapEx intensity of 13.5%. For the full year, capital expenditures declined 4.4% resulting in CapEx intensity of 11%, our lowest full year on record and an improvement of 100 basis points year-over-year exclusive of RSN adjustments, driven by lower spending on customer premise equipment and support capital partially offset by higher spending on scalable infrastructure, which was driven by our ongoing investment to enhance the capacity of our network to support increased data usage.  Turning to the current environment, high speed internet customer additions remain healthy and we have all the pieces in place for 2021 to be a very strong year. We also have to remember that 2020 was exceptional on many accounts. And because of that, we view 2019, which was also very strong for us as a more appropriate year against which to benchmark our performance.  Turning to video, we expect the higher video rates we implemented at the beginning of this year, resulting from our current programming renewal cycle to drive video sub losses back to the levels we'd experienced in the first half of 2020. Our video strategy is centered on profitability. We do not chase unprofitable video subscribers, as we can now offer Flex for free to those who prefer a streaming only entertainment option.  Looking to the full year, we expect Cable Communications revenue growth to exceed the 3.4% we just reported for 2020, as we remain focused on driving our connectivity businesses with better year-over-year comparisons in the first half. We expect programming expense growth to increase at high-single digit levels similar to the fourth quarter, as programming carriage renewals roll through in 2021. The program expense growth is expected to moderate in 2022 and thereafter.  Non-programming operating expense growth should normalize at a low-single digit increase to 2019 levels, as we support the higher level of customer relationships and accelerate growth in our wireless business, which we expect to achieve standalone profitability in 2021.  With our consistent discipline on expenses and capital investment, coupled with the trends at work as we remain focused on connectivity, we are confident in our ability to increase profitability, expand margins and improve CapEx intensity, both in 2021 and thereafter.  Now let's turn to Slide 7 for NBCUniversal. For the fourth quarter, NBCUniversal revenue decreased 18% to $7.5 billion and EBITDA decreased 21% to $1.6 billion. Cable Networks revenue was down 6.4% in the fourth quarter, driven by a 38% decline in content licensing and other revenue, while distribution revenue was flat compared to a year ago, reflecting the absence of carriage renewals, combined with modest sequential improvement in subscriber losses.  The delay to the start of the NBA and NHL seasons had a negative impact on our advertising revenue, which declined 4.2% while the related shift of sports rights amortization out of the quarter was a benefit to the EBITDA which grew 22% year-over-year. For the full year, Cable Networks EBITDA increased 4%, primarily driven by the sports related impacts of COVID.  Fewer sporting events in 2020 contributed to lower distribution and advertising revenue, as well as lower programming and production expenses of $655 million year-over-year. Seasons were shortened earlier in the year, and current seasons were delayed, pushing a number of events and the related rights amortization costs to 2021.  So, looking to 2021, we expect healthy distribution revenue growth as a result of recent successful carriage renewals. We also currently expect significantly more sporting events compared to 2020, which would result in higher advertising revenue, but also a significant increase in sports related programming and production costs, equating to a low double-digit decline in Cable Networks EBITDA this year.  Turning to Broadcast, revenue decreased 12% in the fourth quarter, due to a 39% decline in content licensing, and a 9.6% decline in advertising revenue, partially offset by another quarter of double-digit increases in retransmission consent fees. The content licensing revenue declines at both Broadcast and Cable Networks were timing related, as sales to streaming platforms including Peacock were more heavily concentrated in the first nine months of the year.  We also had a difficult comparison to a significant library deal in last year's fourth quarter. The decline in advertising revenue was driven by lower ratings, partly due to the delayed launch of our ball season. This was somewhat offset by record levels of political advertising at our local stations. The lower revenues were partially offset by a decline in operating costs, reflecting lower content licensing, and the delay in production due to COVID-19 resulting in a decline of 24% to $356 million in Broadcast EBITDA.  Filmed Entertainment revenue declined 8.3% and EBITDA increased 65% to $151 million for the fourth quarter. Theatrical revenue declined 70% due to theaters being either closed or operating at limited capacity. While content licensing increased 23%, driven by PVOD. Expenses were significantly lower due to fewer releases as a result of COVID-19. In 2021, we hope to debut a number of our franchise films in theaters, such as Fast9 and Minions 2, but the situation remains fluid and we're still adjusting our 2021 place to maximize value, as evidenced by our recent decision to push back the release of Boss Baby 2 from March to September. Theme Parks revenue was $579 million in the quarter with an EBITDA loss of $15 million. These results reflect Universal Orlando Resort and Universal Studios Japan, operating at limited capacity, while Hollywood remains closed. Results also include $45 million of Universal Beijing pre-opening costs.  For 2021, keep in mind that the first quarter tends to be seasonally light in terms of attendance. And we also expect an increased COVID impact given new restrictions in Japan, which have also caused us to delay the opening of Super Nintendo World. We are pleased that University Beijing remains set to open this summer, with pre-opening costs ramping to $300 million in the first half of this year.  One last item I'd like to highlight, we will be changing the way we report for NBCUniversal starting in the first quarter of 2021 with a largest impact being to our television businesses, as we combine Cable Networks and Broadcast into one segment along with Peacock. Now let's turn to slide 8 for Sky, which I'll speak to on a constant currency basis. Sky revenue for the fourth quarter declined 0.9% to $5.2 billion, reflecting a 2.8% decline in direct-to-consumer revenue, driven mostly by our hospitality or pubs and clubs segment, which was challenged by additional COVID related lockdowns during the quarter. Excluding hospitality, direct-to-consumer revenue was essentially flat year-over-year with solid low-single-digit growth in the UK. Somewhat offsetting the decline in direct-to-consumer revenue with a 10% increase in content revenue as we monetize our original programming. While advertising revenue grew 3.9% as Sky outperformed a challenge advertising market helped by a strong performance in the U.K.  Sky added 244,000 net new customers in the quarter, bringing us essentially back to pre-COVID levels of total customer relationships with additions in all markets, driven by a very healthy streaming business. We've also seen strong uptake in our broadband and mobile products in the UK.  Sky EBITDA was $139 million as the fourth quarter was impacted by a number of expense items, such as incremental sports rights amortization related to the shift of sporting events that have been delayed as a result of COVID-19, higher investments in entertainment programming, costs related to the launch of our new Sky channels last May, as well as higher marketing spend to promote strategic initiatives such as Sky Q, growth in our mobile product in the U.K. and broadband in Italy.  Looking ahead, we would characterize 2021 as a tale of two halves, the first half is under pressure due to the recent increase in COVID related restrictions to the extreme levels we experienced at the beginning of the pandemic. With the government mandating the closure of pubs and clubs, as well as many retail outlets, we are experiencing weakness in hospitality and advertising, and we now expect Sky's first quarter revenue to decline slightly year-over-year.  We also expect first half expenses to be elevated when compared to 2020 as higher sports right amortization resulting from sporting events being postponed from 2020 to 2021 will be with us through the second quarter. In non-sports related costs, we'll see an increase as we grow broadband and mobile in the UK, broadband in Italy and launch the SMB business in the U.K. later this quarter.  In the second half of 2021, we expect a quick recovery in hospitality and advertising revenue once these latest restrictions are lifted and an acceleration in EBITDA growth from the tailwinds related to our major sports rights' resets and more efficient operating structure.  I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on slide 9. We generated $13.3 billion in free cash flow and paid $4.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders in 2020. Consolidated total capital, which includes CapEx as well as software and intangibles, decreased 6.4% for the year to $11.6 billion, while working capital improved by $2.2 billion to a decline of $178 million for the full year, both reflecting an impact from COVID.  Looking to 2021, we anticipate total capital will remain relatively flat to 2020 levels, while the working capital drag will increase relative to the levels we saw in 2019, which is the more appropriate comparison, due to an increase in content investment, our broadcast of the Olympics and the reversal of COVID related one-time tax deferrals.  Turning to capital allocation, our strategy has always been a balance of several important priorities, maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing in profitable organic growth and returning capital to shareholders. First, on our balance sheet, we've made great progress reducing net debt from a $108 billion post the Sky acquisition at the end of 2018 to $90 billion at the end of 2020.  Second, we remain focused on organic investment in our businesses to grow the long-term earnings power of the company, including our CapEx investment in Broadband and Parks and continued investment behind other growth initiatives where we see strong return on investments such as Xfinity Mobile, Peacock, Flex, Sky Q and Broadband in Italy.  Third, we are committed to returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, and we have a proven track record. We have increased our dividend 13 years in a row at a 17% CAGR significantly in excess of the S&P over that same time period. In addition, we have a demonstrated history of buying back stock, having reduced our share count by nearly 20% between the NBCUniversal and Sky acquisitions.  In 2021, we believe we will be able to return to our historical practice of returning ample capital to our shareholders. We are again raising the dividend by $0.08 a share to a $1 per share, and we are planning to return to buying back our stock. As Brian mentioned, our hope is to start in the back half of this year, gradually ramping up to historical levels while we continue to pace towards hitting our intended target leverage levels, which we currently expect to reach by year end 2022.  The specific timing and magnitude of our buyback activity will be subject to improvement in our businesses most impacted by the pandemic and the implications related to potential changes in tax policy. So, thanks for joining us on the call this morning.  And I'll now hand it back to Marci to handle Q&A. Sure Phil, it's Mike and, Dave -- I'll do the second one first. I think Dave gave plenty of color in terms of as well as I think in the earlier comments about the activities of the Cable division in terms of focus on expenses, locking in programming renewals, which and just driving the business towards connectivity, and wireless towards profitability.  And all those factors, come together and when you look at the long-term [Indiscernible] a business including our comments is that, we are confident in our ability to increase profitability, expand margins and improve capital intensity not just in 2021 and that is versus reported 2020 numbers to your question.  But really thereafter, I mean, I think the business is set up for that, for the long-term horizon beyond just the year ahead. So, calling out specific numbers, I think is of less utility frankly than giving you the broad backdrop that gives you the long-term lens through which you can judge all those pieces. But we're quite confident that all those things coming together expenses plan and efficiency on the capital side, combined with innovation and focus on connectivity allows us to give that outlook that of improving margins and capital intensity looking out ahead.  In terms of -- Dave, I don't know if you have anything to add there? And then, just elaborating I think earlier comments really covered it all on buybacks, but I'll just expand a bit. I mean, obviously, we've been talking Brian and I and the team for a while about our desire to get back into the historical balance on capital allocation, which as you know is even the balance sheet strong, making healthy investments in the organic growth across our businesses which I think from listening to the call today.  Anyone would, I hope gather that we continue to be very lean -- very much leaning into doing that where we see returns and opportunity to make investments in these businesses for growth. And then get back to our balance with complete capital return. You know, it's the 13th year we've increased the dividend, but we turned off buybacks for a while and want to return to being in that portion of the return element as well.  So, as I said, we're pleased with where the balance sheet is. We've gotten net debt down to $90 billion from $108 billion after Sky. Just the evidence that we're seeing in Parks in the fourth quarter, we were breaking as the Beijing pre operating cost, even with Hollywood closed and even with capacity constraints, just gives us a high degree of confidence that when people can return to travel on the other side of vaccinations, outpacing the virus, that we're going to see the COVID impacted EBITDA businesses snap back to historical levels.  To your point, it's going to take 12 months for it to run through and get it fully back, hence our point that, in the second half of this year, we'd expect to see the beginnings of that and rather than wait for a full 12 months. We'll start -- we hope and plan to begin our buyback at that moment.  We'll keep it at the historical level, call it as much as $5 billion ramp up to that and probably stay there until we actually get to the definition that you called out on a 12 month trailing basis to get to around or just inside 2.5 times. And I expect that to happen by the end of 2022. Sure, Brian can obviously chime in. But I think we feel very good about the collection of businesses that we have, how they fit together, how Sky is enabled together with Cable and NBC, things that are advances in the three pillars that Brian described, broadband, streaming and aggregation. So, I won't repeat too many of those proof points of what we are as a company.  But, we'll always look at M&A, but I don't think there's any doubt that we are very pleased and don't see any strategic gaps in the portfolio that we have. So, we'll talk about it when we get to the 2.5 times. But I wouldn't suggest that beyond that stage, we would just deliver. I mean, we get inside that number and from there, we'll have options and we'll discuss it with folks as we get there. But that's where we stand today. Brian, anything else you want to add?"

Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thank you, operator and welcome everyone. Joining me on this morning\u2019s call are Brian Roberts; Mike Cavanagh, Dave Watson, Jeff Shell and Jeremy Darroch. Brian and Mike will make formal remarks, and Dave, Jeff and Jeremy also will be available for Q&A. Let me now refer you to Slide 2, which contains our Safe Harbor disclaimer. I remind you that this conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our 8-K and trending schedules for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. With that, let me turn the call over to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?\nBrian Roberts: Thanks, Marci and good morning, everyone. We\u2019re nearly eight months into this pandemic. And despite many harsh realities, I could not be more pleased and proud of how our team has worked together across the company to find safe, creative solutions to successfully operate in this environment. We\u2019re executing at the highest level and perhaps most importantly, accelerating innovation to drive long-term future growth. We remain intensely focused on our top three strategic priorities of expanding and leading with broadband, aggregation and streaming, all of which are underpinned by strong content creation, distribution and technology. Each business is increasingly complementing, reinforcing and driving value for the others, while enabling us to offer seamless and bundled experiences to all our customers. For example, this quarter, we added a record number of new customer relationships and high-speed internet subscribers and signups for Peacock have grown to nearly 22 million as of today. It is clear that Peacock\u2019s results are enhanced by the placement and distribution it gets through our broadband service. And adding Peacock to broadband is resulting in a significant improvement in both churn and gross ads. As Peacock is continuously cited as a differentiating factor at the point of sale for Xfinity broadband products; none of this could have been achieved without the technology stack that we have through Sky. Focusing now on our top strategic priority broadband, the success we\u2019ve experienced to-date has been driven by years of investment combined with our leading scale. We engage with 56 million high value households and businesses globally. These subscribers give us a stronger starting point in direct-to-consumer relationships, particularly with broadband. Our connections at the point-of-sale provide us with a distinct advantage as this is the moment when customers really contemplate their aggregation and streaming options. We have the best broadband network in the U.S., perhaps in the world, lead by a completely integrated consumer experience with the widest array of products that go beyond just speed. We offer coverage, control in an unprecedented level of flexibility. With our broadband service, you get your choice of entertainment over your preferred distribution method whether it\u2019s the industry leading video bundle with X1, or the highest quality streaming product with Flex, both powered by the same platform and technology, the same award winning voice remote, and the same cloud-based software. With Xfinity Internet, you can opt for Xfinity mobile, the great value wireless service hosted by Verizon, now inclusive of nationwide 5G and augmented by our own WiFi network, the largest in the U.S. And we have the ability to evolve this offering over time to we choose to include our own wireless network or cellular infrastructure to generate even greater profitability in the most highly-trafficked mobile areas as this unique combination of broadband products and services that led to this quarter\u2019s 556,000 net new customer relationships and 633,000 net new high-speed internet subscribers, both the best quarterly record in our company\u2019s history. In the UK, customer relationships now stand at over 13 million, a figure that\u2019s been steadily growing, driven by our exclusive content and experience that cements our video relationship with customers, a differentiated broadband service as the number two provider and increasing wireless penetration. It\u2019s a winning formula for other markets that we will look to replicate. Moving to our second strategic priority, aggregation, whether it\u2019s a Pay TV video bundle or a streaming solution for the home, entertainment remains an important consideration for new and existing broadband customers. X1 and Sky Q are the world\u2019s leading platforms for aggregating broadcast, sports, and streaming services. Flex provides that same experience to those customers, who prefer streaming only video included for free with Xfinity Internet. We\u2019ve developed the best operating system for your entertainment experience, controlled by one global voice remote, enabling 15 billion commands, five languages annually. Our expertise or technology, and a tremendous amount of R&D continue to push us forward with opportunities to generate new revenue streams and areas of monetization, which sets us on an even stronger path towards long-term growth. The goal of our common Tech Stack is to build once and deploy as many times and as many markets and as many ways as possible on our network or through wholesale distribution. We\u2019ve already experienced great success with our current X1 syndication model, white-labeling our software and technology gives us a significant revenue stream that boasts healthy margins and even more important, more scale for our platform. We look forward to expanding this expertise to other distributors, and believe that even larger nationwide and potentially international syndication model will create new opportunities in this rapidly-changing ecosystem that will create value for our company and our shareholders. Our third strategic priority is streaming, which not only provides us with another increasingly important way to reach our viewers and monetize our content, but it also drives demand for higher speeds and more reliable broadband and differentiates and improves the economics of aggregation. Peacock, our premium ad supported video on demand service is the right streaming strategy at the right time. After launching nationwide, just this past July, we are excited to already have nearly 22 million Peacock signups to date, and have exceeded all of our internal engagement metrics, even without having the benefit of the 2020 Olympics. Going out with free allowed us to grow quickly with a very low cost per acquisition and significantly less marketing spend and other new streaming services. We\u2019ve also been able to effectively leverage our expansive high-quality library and over $20 billion of annual content spend that supports our existing media businesses for Peacock, and enhance it with targeted incremental investment in additional streaming IP. Xfinity has been a significant contributor to Peacock success, driving awareness and usage through bundling with X1 and Flex. In fact, Peacock was the number one app on Flex and the number three app on X1 for the month of September when measured by reach. We\u2019re also leaning into Flex, which increases the lifetime value of our broadband customers as we see churn improved by 15% to 20% for new customers that engage with the platform. Since adding Flex as a video option, we\u2019ve seen our entertainment relationships increase. In fact, the growth in the Flex monthly active user base, which now sits at over one million, more than offset the decline in the number of our traditional Pay TV video subscribers for the past two quarters. Reaching these three strategic objectives takes focus and discipline, and we have both. We are realigning our cost structure across our company and making the appropriate level investment in the right initiatives, so as to fuel long-term growth and enable us to effectively compete in an evolving global marketplace. Turning from our long-term strategy, I\u2019d like to highlight our third quarter results, which I\u2019m quite proud of in light of the challenges we have faced with COVID. In Cable, our revenue growth accelerated and we generated an impressive 10.5% increase in EBITDA. We have been incredibly successful in identifying long-term cost efficiencies. In fact, with our self-installed offerings and digital tools, customers can do virtually everything they want or need to without picking up the phone or requiring a truck roll. But we\u2019re also investing for growth, with the goal of increasing awareness of our ever improving Xfinity brand, promoting an advancing or leading broadband position and accelerating our mobile and business segments. At NBCUniversal, the team has done a really creative and impressive job of navigating through an incredible amount of uncertainty. I am pleased to report that some businesses are steadily recovering, given the resumption of both sports and content production. Where we continue to see the most pressure from COVID is in our Theme Parks, which were the single biggest drag in the quarter. In fact excluding this segment, NBCUniversal EBITDA would have grown by 9% year-over-year. While it will take some time for the parks to return to historical levels, we\u2019ve made substantial progress. Universal Orlando and Osaka are operating at limited but growing attendance. While we don\u2019t know when Hollywood might reopen, we remain very bullish on the parks long-term. I am very excited for next year\u2019s launch of our frankly incredible new theme park in Beijing. Early in the third quarter, we announced a completely new structure for our television businesses, enabling us to realign how we invest in the creation, production and distribution of world class content. In essence, we\u2019ve done away with the concept of creating a piece of work for a specific network. Our priority is to invest in and create the absolute best content, and ensure that we maximize monetization by choosing the most effective method of distribution, whether it\u2019s broadcast, cable networks, Peacock, sales to a third party, or some combination of all four. Last, we\u2019re closing in on two years since we bought Sky. So, I thought I would spend a moment providing some context on the progress we see to-date. The UK, which is by far the largest component of Sky EBITDA has proven to be a strong business that has generated high single-digit EBITDA growth over the two-year span when adjusting for the momentary impacts of COVID, anchored by growth in both our customer base and revenue per customer relationship. Our UK customers continue to do more with us as evidenced by our higher penetration of broadband, and wireless and in the QBox, all of which solidify us as the home of aggregation and streaming and which sets us up nicely for continued growth. What we see in the UK guide to our thinking on the prospects for what Germany and Italy could each become. In both markets, we have a leading brand name and customer proposition in video supported by significant scale. While it may take time, we\u2019re on a path to replicate the UK playbook, and took an important step toward this in Italy with our recent launch of broadband. We also have fairly immediate opportunities to improve our cost structure as we move to centralize our organizational efforts across our markets. And as we\u2019ve begun to reset many of our largest sports rights in Continental Europe, which should provide hundreds of millions of dollars in annual savings. As Jeremy highlighted recently, we are confident in our ability to double EBITDA at Sky over the next several years. And importantly, Sky fits right in with our broader company priorities playing a big role in strengthening our Tech Stack for aggregation and in content solutions across all of NBCU and Cable. When you put it all together and look at the first nine months of the year, but certainly, not the year, we all would have expected. We\u2019ve executed extremely well. We\u2019ve taken advantage of the favorable interest rate environment to enhance our balance sheet and liquidity, and we remain committed to getting leverage, where it needs to be, so that we can return to buying back stock. All in all, this was a really strong quarter. And Mike will now take you through our results in greater detail.\nMike Cavanagh: Thanks, Brian and good morning, everyone. Now, I\u2019ll review our third quarter 2020 results and offer some commentary on the current conditions in our businesses caveating that circumstances around us remain fluid, and therefore, our outlook is subject to change. Beginning on Slide 6 with our consolidated third quarter results, consolidated revenue declined 4.8% year-over-year to $25.5 billion while adjusted EBITDA was down 11% to $7.6 billion and adjusted EPS fell 18% to $0.65 per share, all a result of the lingering effects of COVID-19. Free cash flow of $2.3 billion was up 10.5% benefiting from the positive year-over-year change in net working capital due to COVID at both NBCU and Sky, half of which resulted from the timing of when sports rights payments were made, versus when sports actually aired, and half of which resulted from a slower ramp and content production. We expect this trend to reverse starting in the fourth quarter and continue into next year as our businesses continue to recover from COVID. Before moving to segment results, I remind you that corporate and other losses have continued to increase as a result of our focus on the successful positioning of Peacock. We have also incurred COVID-related severance and restructuring charges totaling $239 million year-to-date. We expect to incur an additional charge that is approximately double this amount in this year\u2019s fourth quarter as we continue to align the cost structure across all of our businesses. Now, let\u2019s turn to our business segment results starting with Cable Communications on Slide 7. For the third quarter, Cable Communications\u2019 revenue increased 2.9% while EBITDA increased 10.5%. Revenue this quarter was once again impacted by adjustments for customer RSN fees. Excluding these adjustments, overall cable revenue would have risen by 3.9% with no corresponding impact to EBITDA. As Brian mentioned, we generated 556,000 customer relationship net additions, the best quarterly results on record driven by high-speed internet, where we added 633,000 net new residential and business customers also, the best quarterly results on record. Underlying net additions were similar to last year\u2019s third quarter and we were able to successfully convert some customers to paid status that continued to receive our service, but were not included in our second quarter results. Roughly, one third of those customers converted to paid status or free internet essentials customers while the remaining two thirds were high-risk customers have begun paying their balances and returned their full service after being on our assistance plan. Going forward, we do not expect the impact of converting free internet essentials and high-risk customers\u2019 paid status to be as significant. high-speed internet revenue grew 10% including RSN fee adjustments and grew just over 11% excluding those adjustments. Remember, RSN fee adjustments are allocated to those customers taking bundled services according to their standalone market prices. The strength in high-speed internet is coming from a number of areas. One, we continue to take share of an expanding market as evidenced by an increase in our broadband penetration. 51% of homes and businesses in our footprint are now taking our HSD product, up 240 basis points versus a year ago. Two, our investment in our network and product differentiation is resonating in the market whether it\u2019s our best-in-class gateway, or controlling security through xFi, it\u2019s not just about speed. Three, we are seeing higher take rates of our entertainment product with the addition of Flex, which continues to have a significant positive impact on churn and therefore, customer lifetime value. And four, we also continue to drive connects by expanding our network through line extensions. Business Services revenue grew 4% as we return to a net gain of 17,000 customer relationships this quarter and turning to video, revenue declines 2.1% with accrued RSN fee adjustments adding an adverse impact of 130 basis points. We lost 273,000 net video customers this quarter, which reflects modest improvement in our underlying video losses compared to the second quarter, and a benefit of converting some of the previously high-risk customers to paid status. Wireless revenue increased 23% driven by 187,000 additional lines, resulting in 2.6 million total lines at quarter-end. Our wireless business continued to be impacted by our decision to keep some of our retail stores closed for most of the quarter, especially in areas, where COVID cases remained high. That said, the vast majority of our retail stores are now open and we have put a number of plans in place to accelerate the growth in this business. advertising revenue increased 12% year-over-year due to strong political advertising, which was up 70% over what we had generated in the last presidential election in 2016. Core advertising excluding political was down 6.8% year-over-year, a significant improvement relative to last quarter with better trends across most categories. We also saw some benefits from the clustering of sports programming that began to air in the third quarter. Turning to expenses. Cable Communications third quarter expenses decreased 2.2% with programming expenses down 0.6%, primarily as a result of the accrued RSN fee adjustment. Without this adjustment, programming expense would have increased by 4%. Non-programming expenses declined 3.2%, primarily as a result of curtailed advertising; marketing and promotion spend, as well as lower technical and product support, primarily due to a COVID-related slowdown in business activities. We are also continuing to find better and more efficient ways to do business, particularly through our digital tools and interactions. Cable communications EBITDA grew by 10.5% and margin reached 42.7%, reflecting 290 basis points of year-over-year improvement. While accrued RSN fee adjustments had no impact on EBITDA, they did have a positive contribution margin of roughly 40 basis points. Cable capital expenditures decreased 2.5%, resulting in CapEx intensity of 11.8% and improvement of 60 basis points year-over-year driven by lower spending on customer premise equipment and support capital, partially offset by higher spending on scalable infrastructure, which continues to increase due to our ongoing investment in the network. I\u2019ll now touch a bit on what we\u2019re seeing so far and what we expect in the fourth quarter. For high-speed internet, underlying subscriber trends remain healthy. And we currently expect revenue growth to accelerate from the third quarter driven by this year\u2019s strong subscriber growth combined with higher ARPU, resulting from an increase in the uptake of some of our higher margin products, such as modems, and xFi pods. In addition to better expanding assistance program curates. While we are pleased to see a continuation of net new customers in our business segment, we do not expect revenue growth to accelerate in the near-term, given the COVID subscriber impact we saw earlier in the year, as well as the longer sales cycles associated with the recovery we\u2019re seeing with our midmarket and enterprise customers. That said, we remain optimistic on the long-term prospects across all of our business segments. We remain the challenger with the highest-quality offerings at lower price points than our competitors. On the video side, we expect fourth quarter video losses to be similar to the third quarter levels, reflecting modest improvements to our underlying trends. And just like with high-speed data, a less significant impact from converting customers to paid status. When it comes to our outlook for expenses and margins, commensurate with the sequential acceleration and underlying revenue growth that we anticipate for the fourth quarter, we expect non-programming OpEx to be flat to slightly up, reflecting our aggressive focus on maintaining strong connect activity by returning to home installs, increasing our marketing spend to defend our strong position and further accelerating our mobile and SMB businesses. That said, we continue to make significant inroads with implementation of the long-term cost efficiencies we identified earlier this year, which puts our overall expense base in a very good position as we enter 2021. We expect programming cost to be up mid-to-high single digits in the fourth quarter given scheduled programming renewals and we do not anticipate additional RSN fee adjustments, given what we have seen for the first nine months of the year, combined with our outlook for the fourth quarter, we now expect cable EBITDA margins to exceed our prior guidance of up to 100 basis points year-over-year improvement by a healthy amount, both with and without the RSN fee adjustments, while CapEx intensity is still expected to improve by up to 100 basis points year-over-year. Next, let\u2019s turn to Slide 8 for NBCUniversal. For the third quarter, NBCUniversal revenue decreased 19% to $6.7 billion, while EBITDA decreased 39% to $1.3 billion. The majority of the revenue and substantially all of the EBITDA declines came from our Theme Parks business, as Hollywood remains closed, and both Orlando and Osaka are open to limited attendance as a direct result of COVID-19. Starting with the TV business\u2019s, Cable Networks revenue was down 1.3%, driven by declines in distribution and advertising revenue, offset by an increase in content loss licensing and other. The distribution revenue decline of 3.8% resulted from a slight acceleration in subscribers\u2019 clients, less rate benefit due to the absence of programming renewals, and a nearly 200 basis point impact from accrued RSN fee adjustments. Advertising revenue was down 2.1%, a significant improvement compared to the second quarter as we benefited from the broadcast of rescheduled sporting events, which is not expected to recur in the fourth quarter. Cable networks EBITDA decreased 8.9% due to higher programming and production expenses driven by the shift of sports rights amortization costs into the third quarter. Turning to broadcast, revenue increased 8.3%, driven by 66% growth in content licensing sales, and continued growth and retransmission consent fees, partially offset by decline in advertising. While advertising improved significantly compared to the second quarter, broadcast did not benefit as much from the shift of sports as rescheduled sporting events were basically offset by canceled events, as well as fewer NFL games relative to last year. After recognizing a significant increase in content licensing revenue year-to-date at both broadcast and cable networks, we expect a double-digit decline in the fourth quarter due to the timing of our sales to streaming platforms, which were more heavily concentrated in the first nine months of the year, combined with a difficult comparison to a significant library deal in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Broadcast EBITDA increased 29% to the higher revenue, as well as lower programming and marketing costs associated with the delayed start of our new fall season, which were somewhat offset by higher program expenses related to content sales. Filmed Entertainment revenue declined 25% year-on-year with theatrical revenue down 95% reflecting theater closures as a result of COVID-19, partially offset by a 50% increase in content licensing revenue, as well as a 49% increase in home entertainment revenue due to Trolls World Tour. Filmed Entertainment EBITDA increased 53% as lower revenue was more than offset by lower operating costs related to less spending on current period releases as a result of COVID-19. While we have pushed the majority of our movie slate to 2021, we are looking forward to the release of The Croods: A New Age in theaters and a subsequent PVOD release later in the quarter. Theme Parks revenue was $311 million in the quarter with an EBITDA loss of $203 million due to Universal Orlando Resort and Universal Studios Japan operating at limited capacity while Universal Studios Hollywood remain closed as a result of COVID-19. This quarter\u2019s EBITDA included roughly $20 million of preopening costs related to our theme park in Beijing, which remains on schedule to open by the summer of 2021. We anticipate cumulative preopening costs be roughly $400 million, with approximately $100 million, pulling in 2020 and $300 million in the first half of 2021. We continue to see improvement in underlying trends and expect the theme park business to break-even at some point in 2021, independent of what occurs with Universal Studios Hollywood. Next, let\u2019s turn to slide 9 for sky, which I will speak to on a constant currency basis. Revenue for the third quarter was even with the prior year, as we were seeing the benefits of a very healthy underlying business in the UK, combined with the return of major sporting events, primarily European football that have been previously postponed. Content revenue was up 17.5% driven by higher wholesale revenue from sports programming, while direct-to-consumer and advertising revenue showed significant sequential improvement, each down 1% year-on-year. On the advertising side, we outperformed the European marketplace, which was down about 10% as we\u2019ve benefited from strong advanced advertising, and rescheduled sporting events that were previously postponed due to COVID-19. In addition to sports, overall sky entertainment viewing was up double digits, partly aided by the addition of our new branded channels, including sky comedy, which launched in January, and sky documentary, Sky history and sky nature, which launched in May. The significant sequential improvement in direct-to-consumer revenue resulted from the return of sports and a healthy underlying trend in the UK, which experienced a gain of 51,000 customer net relationships and low single-digit ARPU growth. The strong performance was driven by our strategy to be the best TV aggregation platform in the market, record low TV churn and continued growth in streaming broadband and mobile customers. Our large, resilient sky TV base continues to benefit from the deployment of our more advanced sky cube product. Overall, Sky Cube penetration is at 51% of households, while UK penetration has reached 58%, up 13 percentage points year-over-year. We are also pleased with the results at NOW TV, which is positioned for a different market segment. ARPU is increasing as this growing customer base continues to take more packs on average, underscored by a 60% increase in the uptake of our highest price sports pack. While revenue from our hospitality business, the pubs and clubs that receive our sky TV service remains pressured. We\u2019ve seen weekly revenue back 70% of historical levels versus 25% at the start of the quarter. Italy and Germany remain a bit more challenged. In Germany, we made changes to our pricing and packaging earlier in the quarter, while we were pleased with the positive customer response. This will pressure ARPU in the near-term as you focus on growing market share and reducing churn. In Italy, our results showed meaningful sequential improvement, but we continue to be impacted by a tough macro environment. We are encouraged by positive momentum and Italy broadband post its mid-June launch. Customer additions are beating our initial expectations with satisfaction scores at high levels. EBITDA for the third quarter was down roughly 45% as flat revenue was offset by an increase in programming and production costs primarily as a result of the postponement of European football events, which moved from the second quarter into the third as a result of COVID-19. Looking ahead, we continue to expect third quarter and fourth quarter EBITDA combined to be down roughly 60%. with the fourth quarter impacted by the later return of the currencies of European football, the shift of other sports programming to the fourth quarter, investments in original programming and higher costs associated with the launch of our new UK entertainment channels. Wrapping up on slide 10, with free cash flow and capital allocation. free cash flow was $2.3 billion in the quarter, an increase of 10.5% year-over-year. Consolidated total capital, which includes CapEx as well as software and intangibles decreased 5.8% in third quarter to $2.9 billion, primarily driven by declines at NBCU, particularly parks, as well as at Cable. During the quarter and year-to-date, we refinanced $5.9 billion and $15.8 billion of debt respectively, ending the third quarter with a weighted average cost of debt of 3.6%. Finally, we remain committed to our longstanding balanced approach to capital allocation. Maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing organically for profitable growth, and returning capital to shareholders through a strong commitment to our recurring dividends, and eventual return to share repurchases. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Marci, who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Mike. Regina, let\u2019s open the call for questions, please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: First, Brian, could you talk a little bit about how you \u2013 your vision of the how you best monetize being an aggregator across a variety of media, traditional TV, streaming video apps, et cetera, outside of just being the broadband provider, and what are other ways you\u2019re considering to help monetize your position as the center of the consumer in the living room? And then on NBCU, it is surprising actually that you had a good \u2013 that you mentioned in the press release that you\u2019ve had positive upfront given ratings weakness across the board for the whole industry, as well as lack of production. So, can you talk about some of the drivers there? Can streaming make up for the weakness in ratings? It\u2019s clear q4 will be weak. But what do you see beyond that? Thank you.\nBrian Roberts: Okay. there\u2019s a lot in there, Jessica. Let me start with the aggregation and broadband question. And then let Jeff and others talk about the upfront. Look, we think we have this three-pronged strategy that complement for each other, works together and basically ends up giving customers the best product, regardless of what segment they\u2019re in, and broadband is definitely a central element of that. But aggregation in this world, as we know, as consumers that you want to flip back and forth between one streaming service and other streaming service, live television, YouTube, whatever it may be, and finding a way to have our entertainment platform and our voice commands, whether it\u2019s in a smart TV, whether it\u2019s in a box, and whether that is in frankly, the U.S. or in rest of the world, and in other providers. And so we\u2019ve made great progress with aggregation in this quarter and in this year, named the service and you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s now either on the roadmap or very much being used, whether it\u2019s NBC-driven content with peacock, we\u2019ve now shown that we can market and make aware for our customers, we chose like a yellow stone that we may not have found on a different network that all of a sudden has zoomed to the top and that\u2019s before we get additional content like the office, and the Olympics and what have you. And so putting it all together, we see the tech companies and others with ambitions on having a relationship with our high-value customers, our 56 million high-value customers in aggregation, and who can do that the best with a voice and just say the words, I was literally watching last night Prime Show and switched to Netflix and then went back to NBC, all with just one click and with my voice. And so the innovation that our team has done, the seamless integration working with various content providers, we\u2019ve made tremendous strides. Jeff, you want to talk a little bit about and therefore, I\u2019m sorry \u2013 to close out on monetization of that. We\u2019ve seen a number of ways and leads right into advertising, because it\u2019s an ability to not only give you a good experience in charge, who are subscription fees, depending on what level of service it is. But in the case of Flex, whether its lower churn for our broadband, whether it\u2019s additional advertising, with Zumo and on smart television platforms and other things we have on our roadmap, which are very exciting that continue to take these tools and find new ways to give them to customers, and thereby create additional value for the shareholders. Jeff, do you want to talk about the upfront?\nJeff Shell: Thanks, Brian. Thanks, Jessica. So obviously, the upfront was a very unusual upfront this year, Jessica, I mean, we didn\u2019t think a couple of months ago, there was even going to be an upfront this year. And the fact that there was one and it ended up being relatively normal and much stronger than we expected, was really good news for the whole business. We ended up kind of slightly up on price, which was we expected to be way down on price, we ended up slightly up on price, slightly down on volume. And as you mentioned, the big impact on advertising really is the ratings and the ratings is not just us. But everybody, because we\u2019ve stopped production, who would normally have kind of our full schedule in high gear right now and we\u2019re just starting those shows and we don\u2019t have a lot of new content. So, that\u2019s what\u2019s driving kind of the advertising, choppiness and declines. The flip side of that is it creates scarcity in the market. So, the market actually has pretty strong, because we have less rating points, we have more demand and a couple of the moves that we\u2019ve made were kind of perfect timing. peacock, we talked about peacock\u2019s ad-driven platform, gives us an opportunity to sell where others don\u2019t really sell and we launched right into the strength of that scarcity. And then we also kind of consolidated all of our advertising under L'India a Torino [ph] one platform approach and we think that was also perfect timing, because it gives us the opportunity to kind of sell and address that scarcity across multiple platforms, so obviously, much \u2013 a much smaller upfront than the past, but much better than we expected.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse.\nBrian Roberts: Doug, you may be on mute.\nOperator: And I believe Doug\u2019s line has disconnected. our next question will come from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks. can you hear me?\nBrian Roberts: Yes.\nBen Swinburne: Okay, great. I guess two questions; on Cable or maybe just broadly, on entertainment for either Brian or Dave, I\u2019m wondering if you think about the video business, evolving from what you\u2019ve been selling for decades, a package of linear networks to a bundle of apps, where you\u2019re basically taking a distribution fee against what the consumer pays, rather than earning a margin on bundle? And if you do what does that mean for the business and sort of how you think about investing in products and capital allocation et cetera? It seemed like a possible future in the not-too-distant future across Comcast and sky. And then for Jeff, there\u2019s a lot going on at NBC, to put it mildly. I\u2019m just wondering, if you could talk high level about what you\u2019re trying to accomplish, organizationally, from a restructuring point of view? How we should measure your success? And in particular, you mentioned in the prepared remarks, or Mike, did you think the parks will break-even at some point next year? Just maybe, that\u2019s a pretty interesting comment in the context of all the uncertainty if you could just talk a little bit more about that would be helpful. Thank you.\nBrian Roberts: Why don\u2019t I help organize that this answer, because I think you touched on a little bit of everybody, and gives it some of the folks a chance to talk about the quarter. So, why don\u2019t we start with Dave to talk about video packaging, I would just add that I think we\u2019ve seen this shift coming. I think Dave and the team have done an outstanding job of having connectivity platform and thinking of it that way. So that we\u2019re ready for that shift, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be all or nothing. I think it\u2019s been highlighted here during COVID and people being at home as much. But fortunately, we were ready for that. I think Jeremy could talk a little about the kind of some of the different trends in Europe and how sky is preparing for that bundle of app world as you called it and you\u2019re right, the economics change, depending on what \u2013 we want to get ourselves to a position of indifference, where the consumer is driving, not the company and the consumer decides, where they want to rest and what package they want. The company finds itself in a \u2013 it has been the best product and a good set of economics. we may always have a preference over one versus the other naturally, but we want you to be satisfied as a consumer and make our long-term growth happen. And then obviously, Jeff can talk a little bit. And Mike, if you want on the \u2013 on all the definition of success, which I think is a great way to look at NBC. But Dave, why don\u2019t you take it up?\nDave Watson: Thanks, Brian. Hello, Ben. So, I think, clearly, the video marketplace is almost everyday evolving. From our perspective, we have invested in a video \u2013 broad video platform capability that, I think, gives us a lot of options and can give customers a lot of choice that we want to deliver to the customer what they want and a video experience. So, we segment the marketplace, we break it down. We\u2019ve been doing that for some time. And as Brian said, we anticipated a lot of these changes. So for customers that want the full experience, that want all the channels, that want the video on demand, DVR capability and apps, and as Brian talked about the ability to seamlessly connect all of that, we have that one. We also now, I think, are very uniquely positioned to go after the streaming segment with flex. And the best example, I think of our position in the marketplace with video, when you combine it with broadband; we\u2019re surrounding broadband with a lot of video capability, and we\u2019re streaming and peacock, we\u2019re giving them the best of aggregation, rate streaming options. So, we\u2019re going to break down the marketplace continue to compete, and deliver to customers what they want. So, I think that will continue word or we feel that this is a sustained competitive difference that we have, and we\u2019ll go to where the customer wants to go. And in terms of whether it\u2019s more profitable outcome for us, then we\u2019ll be in different if they want streaming capability with flex, we\u2019re going to be right there to deliver that.\nJeremy Darroch: And maybe Jeremy here, maybe I\u2019ll just chip in from sky. I think \u2013 I often think of it, I would split it to sort of supply side relationships, and then consumer side service. So, I think on supply side, when we see central step into our world, a good example would be for example, Disney, where we took a very high fixed cost long-term contract, and effectively turned it into an app. we\u2019ve taken that cost out of our P&L and they\u2019re getting a margin by selling Disney plus through sky. And then we could do something similar with Netflix, of course. And then we can take that money, and you will have a course through the P&L or invest some of it in an area like Sky Studios, where we can then scale about own originated content, which improves the customer experience and of course, it\u2019s \u2013 which will variable and differentiates as well. when you get to the consumer side, really, there\u2019s virtually no change the experience, there\u2019s consumers want to continue to get all that contract on time to the sky user interface, we can deep link into offspring customers back efficiently, the sky interface is very, very easy to move around, as Brian said, with the growth and development invoice that\u2019s just becoming easier every day. So actually, we think we can complement the user experience very much and actually, get a much more flexible and more valuable set of cost structures. And then we can think of NOW TV as an addendum to that in a way just to target an additional part of the market that uses many of those contrast relationships, and allows us just to get to more customers in a different way. So that\u2019s how we think about bringing all of that together.\nJeff Shell: Brian, do you want me to jump in? This is Jeff.\nBrian Roberts: Sure.\nJeff Shell: Okay. so Ben, thanks for the question, a lot in your questions. So, I\u2019ll try to just hit it really quickly. But first of all, just working backwards, definition of success, there is a lot going on in NBCUniversal. I really don\u2019t think the definition of success is any different than it\u2019s ever been. our job is to be profitable, generate cash flow and generate long-term value for the company and that\u2019s how we\u2019re kind of thinking about everything and it\u2019s obviously a very changing world. So, you have to be nimble in doing that. But the measures of that are the same measures, as they\u2019ve always been in our view. And organizationally, I really think, we\u2019re kind of through the execution of most of our restructuring, the costs will hit over the next kind of 12 months, there\u2019s about a third of them in this quarter. And then by the middle of next year, we\u2019re kind of through the majority of them. And they\u2019re designed for two things; one, we have an obligation as our revenue moves down to adjust our cost base, which I\u2019m proud of our team for doing across our whole company. But more importantly, we really realigned our TV organization under Mark Lazarus. It used to be in the TV world. you were very vertically oriented by network and you would say, oh, I need a show for this time period to go out and get a show for that time period. And every network kind of had their management team and staff, we realigned kind of dramatically, so that everything is one management group in the TV business under two great executives, Frances Berwick and Susan Rovner just joined us. And the idea now is to find great content and use our platform, which is in many ways better than anybody else\u2019s platform with all of our networks, not just linearly. but peacock, to take great platform and really maximize the value of it and I\u2019m very excited about it. It does result in a lot less cost. But I think more importantly, it sets us up to grow as the world changes. Turning the parks very quickly, parks are \u2013 obviously, it\u2019s a very \u2013 parks are a great business. By the way, when the world returns and people get sick of being in their house, I really feel that we\u2019re going to be a very strong business, nobody can tell the pace of how that\u2019s going to go, given what\u2019s happening. But so far, we\u2019re rebounding fairly nicely in Florida and Japan, where we\u2019re open. Our first priority always has been, always will be the safety of our guests and our employees. And I\u2019m proud of Tom Williams and the team there that they\u2019ve actually had a set of protocols that has resulted in us being open without any problem, whether its guests or employees and who knows how the future will bring. But the rebound is nice, is happening nicely. And if it continues in this way, we do expect, as Brian said, in the opening to hit breakeven, if not more at some time in 2021.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks, everybody.\nBrian Roberts: I mean, Ben, to Jeff\u2019s point, it is obviously a statement about breakeven subject to how COVID evolves. But if it stays on sort of the trend that we\u2019ve been seeing through this winter into next year, we would hope at some point to get there. And then you\u2019re circling back to your first question, Ben, I think there\u2019s no question that when you really look at the fact that and Brian said it earlier that with 56 million relationships around the globe, as we\u2019ve talked about in the highest wireless markets for subscription services, whether they be broadband, or OTT video entertainment of any sort, we\u2019re at the point-of-sale when people are choosing their broadband provider, where they\u2019re providing what we think are the options anyway for the best aggregation services, with or without our own video packages. And if you think about it, from the perspective of anybody trying to launch a video streaming platform, we represent 56 million homes, where you want to be on our platform, and it\u2019s worth it to share economics for us to promote and allow and I think, and that\u2019s what we already experienced today. So, there\u2019s no reason that wouldn\u2019t be A way of the future, not the only way, but A way of the future. And I think it just is even kind of more evident that the power of the platforms with the customers that we have, allows for the kind of launch the peacock had. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a mistake or that relates that 22 million signups does definitely relate at this stage to us having the relationship with the customer through both broadband and our aggregation products.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks, everybody.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Ben. I think we got them all. Regina, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse.\nDoug Mitchelson: Oh, thanks so much. You all have solved global voice activated video streaming, but I can\u2019t handle a phone mute button. one topic for Brian, one for Dave. Brian, one thing that seemed new to me this quarter, was your comment on licensing the Comcast Tech Stack internationally. And I think I\u2019ve heard some optimism regarding getting to nationwide in the U.S. Can you help us understand potential timing, or the impediments to new wholesale deals, particularly overseas? And you mentioned scale benefits beyond the healthy margins you get from licensee and I\u2019m curious how you\u2019d articulate those scale benefits of expanding that platform. And if I could for Dave, regarding wireless, Mike mentioned the company put in place a number of plans to accelerate growth in this business, if you wouldn\u2019t mind sharing some of those plans and why now, why leaning into that business at this point in time, and if that means anything about timing for breakeven for EBITDA and free cash flow for wireless. that would be helpful. Thank you, both.\nBrian Roberts: Great. I\u2019m glad you figured out your tech issues. I don\u2019t want to suggest that there\u2019s a new news regarding the U.S. in terms of X1 licensing. What I think we\u2019re referring to is or what I\u2019d like to refer to is just what it does when we do like than others and we\u2019re in conversations all the time with companies, and the success that that business has had, which we haven\u2019t talked about very much on these calls, it\u2019s gotten to a pretty good size and it has a very healthy margin, and there\u2019s a lot of Canadian companies, Cox in the U.S. and the area that we\u2019ve been focusing on is growing Sky and Xfinity closer together into one global Tech Stack, which then opens up the opportunity to do this now not just in North America, but also starting with Sky and we\u2019re on a number of common architectures. And I think you will see in the future products roll out as a result of our ability to do that, and conversations that are being had to be able to now take that conversation more broadly. I think the most significant benefit, it certainly is the money that it brings in, but what that allows us to do in terms of scale is. So, we talked a lot about video here, we pivoted a lot of our innovation to broadband, in the last two, three, four years, and we saw this transformation coming. We saw how important broadband was going to become an even further become, and reinvent itself over and over again to have the best broadband quarter in the company\u2019s history, sitting here in 2020. When it\u2019s a 20-year old product, give or take, it\u2019s a pretty dramatic and amazing statement in my opinion. And that\u2019s because we\u2019ve kept reinvesting what is broadband? What can it be, and going to WiFi that did not exist. We\u2019re now integrating that into your streaming, your aggregation, the things we\u2019ve been talking about this morning. So, having the scale and the quality of talent on a global basis, to be able to recruit the best engineers, when again, we see a number of other companies wanting to enter this space, and/or lead expanding, not shrinking is I think, the greatest achievement and I give credit that we are expanding our footprint synthetically, if you will, through some of these other relationships with companies, who want to take all of our products, whatever they can become and they\u2019ve done that. And I think we\u2019ve given them a great experience for their customers. And they\u2019ve been super supportive of our idea \u2013 of our technology team. Dave?\nDave Watson: Thanks, Brian. Hi, Doug. So, just one other comment on the Flex side of things with our partners. So, we have a really solid syndication business, great distribution partners. In the U.S., Canada, looking elsewhere and Flex most certainly is on the roadmap for all of our partners so. And it gives us the option of being able to work with device participants, smart TV folks, and others to be able to have it be a software solution. So, we\u2019ll look at all options going forward. In wireless, so we\u2019re \u2013 in general, we\u2019re pleased with where we are, in many quarters in a row, we\u2019re delivering material amount of the net ads in our footprint. And so we\u2019re on track, having said that with retail, we chose the shutdown to retail stores, and it could \u2013 chunk of the country that did have an impact. We\u2019ve reopened them, as Mike said, and we really feel that we\u2019re committed to accelerating the wireless business, it\u2019s a really important product for us going forward and it \u2013 we\u2019ll be focused not just on retail. We think digital still has great promise and we\u2019re already seeing as we put our shoulder to bringing things back some real early stage success in terms of what mobile can do. The results again, still relatively early, but we\u2019d really like the retention benefits to broadband as we package them with it, a lot of options. We do triple play with mobile now. We use it to package just with broadband, very focused across all of our sales channels. And it really comes down to that, I mean, the three things that we\u2019re focused on. One is that we have access to really great network with Verizon. We have the ability to cut across all technologies including 5F. So, we\u2019ll give the customers what they want there. We can leverage our own investment in the home with WiFi; outside the home with most of the broadband, the cell phone, smartphone traffic goes over our WiFi network. So, it\u2019s a great combination of the two. And then over time, I think we\u2019re going to be uniquely positioned to leverage the potential for building out in dense pockets wireless capability to give us a more efficient way of delivering mobile. So \u2013 but overall, we think that this is an important opportunity for us long-term, still feel that way, right on track with where we want to be. We want to be a little bit more aggressive and that\u2019s on the roadmap.\nDoug Mitchelson: All right. thanks so much.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Doug. Regina, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nCraig Moffett: Hi, two questions, if I could. Just I guess the most obvious impressing one is, where do you think all the broadband subscribers are coming from? I think as great as your results were, they\u2019re even more surprising in that AT&T and Verizon also, both posted better than expected results. So, we\u2019re obviously seeing enormous market expansion. I\u2019m just wondering what your sense is, of how much that is full of that is pull forward and where the subs are coming from? And then on the wireless side of the business, I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about what you see and expect to see in the iPhone cycle, given the promotionality that we\u2019ve seen from in particular AT&T, what does that look like for you in the fourth quarter in terms of your customer acquisition costs?\nDave Watson: Well, Craig, Dave here. So in broadband, yes, let me start with what we\u2019ve been seeing and we\u2019ve been seeing consistent momentum now for a while. Well, before COVID it\u2019s been rock solid in terms of this momentum is our focus. We, every day wake up to thinking about, how we, Brian mentioned, we innovate, go to market. So this is and we\u2019re talking about a marketplace and perhaps speaks to across the board as all boats rise, but the markets growing, continues to grow and you look at our position at 51% penetration. There\u2019s upside, a lot of upside. So, I look at where it comes from and the good news is, it\u2019s been relatively consistent, maybe, a few new opportunities enter the picture through the COVID period, but it\u2019s across the board in terms of where we\u2019re taking share on the frontend combining that with record churn results in the net ads, but we\u2019re taking share from Telco wired participants, DSL, MDU competitors, mobile providers, those kind of across the board in many different segments. So, a lot of opportunity in the formula, Craig is the \u2013 I think, the consistent one. We look to have a sustained competitive difference, delivering just a better product in the marketplace, better speed, better coverage, better feature capability. And now with streaming and then you combine that with Peacock, and other apps by the way, all the other apps that come connected by Flex. I think this is a really good long term competitive formula. So it\u2019s across the board. There\u2019s upside. Good runway for broadband, I believe going forward. Regards to wireless and Apple, we\u2019re excited about their product launches. We\u2019re well positioned with 5G. And so as that begins to take off, early feedback we\u2019re getting from prospects and customers existing customers, and it\u2019s very solid. So, we get prepared just like everyone else. All the other carriers in terms of these launches work very closely with Apple, but we have a full supply chain plan, go to market approach. And so we\u2019re we were optimistic about it. It\u2019s happening a little later in this year than last year. But that\u2019s okay, that\u2019ll just be a nice opportunity for later on the quarter into next year.\nCraig Moffett: Thanks.\nMarci Ryvicker: Regina, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nPhilip Cusick: Hey, guys. Thanks. Brian, real quick to follow-up on your wireless comment. You spent $400 million on an auction recently. And both you and Dave have mentioned options to build in wireless. Can you explain on your plans or maybe timing for building your own cellular network? And then Mike, can you give us an update on how the conversations are with rating agencies on leverage? It seems like if they look at things on a trailing basis, it could be some time before you get below the two and a half turn target. But if they consider in the LQA basis, we could get there in 2021 if parks are breakeven, what do you see there? Thank you.\nBrian Roberts: So, let me on wireless. Let me have Dave a comment a little further. But I don\u2019t think we have any new news day on that question. We are trying to build optionality from a cost basis. We really won\u2019t get the product to receive, we hope that it would be you would note a difference, but what network you\u2019re on. We just want to have the best value with the best service. And we now have 5G, right at the same time as everybody who is a network operator, and so that that\u2019s how we spot ahead, I guess is the best way for me to answer that question. When we did the original MNVO relationship, we thought about things like what new technologies might come in the future and in this opportunity to and we have to respect that some of the auctions rules require us not to comment on things. So, we just look at it as creating options for the future for the company, when they have a value net value add to all of all the shareholders. David, that sound right to you?\nDave Watson: Yes, absolutely. Brian, I think, Phil, the main point is, we really like our current position. We have a go to market, we\u2019re still unique in that and other cable partner target us the same thing, where you have by the gig, that unlimited options. So, we like our current position. And as you look to the future, as we look to the future, with the spectrum, then you have an opportunity to look at dense pockets of usage, and then just build a more efficient long-term delivery system. So, we\u2019ll \u2013 we don\u2019t have to rush to do that. We\u2019re going to \u2013 we\u2019re looking at it from an engineering perspective. And we\u2019ll be opportunistic down the road. But right now, we really like our current position.\nPhilip Cusick: Thanks, Dave.\nMike Cavanagh: Phil it\u2019s Mike. On the other question, I mean, I think obviously, as you said before, we\u2019re very committed to the commitments that we made to the rating agencies and, therefore to the bondholders who support the balance sheet. So it\u2019s our highest priority to get ourselves delevered, consistent with those commitments, and then get ourselves back to balance capital allocation, which we\u2019re eager to have that include buybacks, as we\u2019ve been talking about, no doubt. I think it\u2019s premature to talk about, where the topic you raised and other ways to think about, how to think about our ability to support the debt through the lens of a rating agency is stuff that we\u2019ll talk about with them, as we see, COVID make a turn and the businesses that are heard on EBITDA front, really make their turn until then it\u2019d be premature to make any further comments.\nPhilip Cusick: Okay. Thanks guys.\nMarci Ryvicker: Regina, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Your final question will come from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay, thanks, guys. Obviously, solid growth in Peacock, this quarter, is there anything you could tell us about usage or maybe daily average users? Or maybe the number of premium versus free subs? And then we know what content is resonated with viewers? Is it sports or entertainment or some of the originals or library anything you could tell that there would be great. And then more broadly, I guess it\u2019s for Jeff or Brian, do you guys believe that NBC has the scale to compete effectively in D2C centric world obviously with the likes of Netflix, Amazon and Disney? You guys talk about that that\u2019d be great. Thanks.\nJeff Shell: Hi, thanks, John, this is Jeff, I\u2019ll jump into that. So clearly, we \u2013 I think, we talked about the 22 million signups, which is great and way ahead of we thought we\u2019d be. If you look at, you just mentioned kind of a \u2013 we\u2019re generally the majority of our advertising, our revenue was advertising. And there\u2019s three metrics that really go into it. It\u2019s how many people sign up? It\u2019s, it\u2019s how many of them use it regularly we track kind of MAAs and monthly asked what counts, and then how often they use it, what the engagement is. And those 22 million obviously served as the top of the funnel, and we\u2019re way ahead on the other two of what we projected to be and that obviously then translates to revenue. So, couldn\u2019t be more pleased with where we are. And we\u2019re just seeing the effects of the Roku deals, by the way, just kicking in. So, we have lots of growth coming in amongst Roku customers going forward, because we\u2019re just seeing the very beginnings of that effect on us. So, couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the content that\u2019s resonating. It really is interesting. It\u2019s kind of across the board. I mean, obviously Premier League Soccer has been an interesting driver for us. Some of our topical stuff, some of our NBC News product has been resonating. Brian mentioned, some of the shows that we\u2019re able to get from other people, that they didn\u2019t necessarily discover on other platforms like Yellowstone, and recently Mr. Mercedes are resonating, but I think the \u2013 in general, if you look at the usage, the fact that we have such a deep library of familiar stuff, it\u2019s kind of the opposite equivalent. We have stuff people are you want to watch, they want to, rewatch 30 Rock, they want to watch Dick Wolf\u2019s library, it\u2019s really kind of across the board and very broad based, and with most of our programming strength coming in future quarters. We\u2019re really very optimistic. We don\u2019t even get the office, which is still amongst Netflix top shows until January exclusively. And then with the Olympics behind it, and back to Olympics behind it, to add to our sports strength, we\u2019re very, very, very optimistic on how the content is resonating. Just more broadly, on direct-to-consumer. We have a \u2013 I do think we have the scale as a company to more than compete, I think we have the best platform. We have a content machine that can anon across our company. And then when you think about direct-to-consumer across our broader company, it\u2019s not just Peacock, but Comcast and Sky both have, deep broad customer relationships. And that was, by the way, we took advantage of both when we launched Peacock, not just using Sky\u2019s expertise to have a product that looks good and works really well. But also using Comcast, strength on the X1, one platform and Flex to really drive Peacock we launched. But more broadly across the company, we have things like, Fandango and Rotten Tomatoes and lots of different ways that we reach customers directly. So, we think, I think we have, more than enough scale, both in our content, and across the broader company and the way that we reach consumers. So, I don\u2019t know, Brian, if you want to add anything?\nBrian Roberts: No, I think that\u2019s an excellent answer and a good way to end the call. I think going back to a question was asked earlier, what\u2019s your definition of success? I think you\u2019ve just laid out, it\u2019s looking across the whole company. And Peacock is a fantastic example of just in this \u2013 just from quarter-to-quarter, amazing progress. And it tells me all parts of the company and their roadmaps are ahead. So this one example, really good quarter, and we look forward to giving you more engagement stats, and everything else as we go. My \u2013 there\u2019s a race on. And we did really well in the last 90 days and the last 180 days in that race, my strategy that has been laid out here, which for a lot less money, and a lot less risk to our core company, changing the financial characteristics, and yet giving us that potential. Now have many customers having the Peacock app signed up. What can we do to get that engagement and usage up? That\u2019s a that\u2019s over the next 10 years and life over the long term of once you once you get that real estate. So we\u2019re going to continue that race. We\u2019ve got some great content ahead to get people have yet to try Peacock, play with it. And when you get there, it\u2019s got to work really well. And that\u2019s where that experience from Sky and X1 and doing user interfaces paid off. So, we\u2019ll keep focused on it. And thanks for all the questions and the conversation. Marci back to you.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks. Thanks, John. So that concludes our third quarter 2020 earnings call. Thank you for joining us.

            "content": "Thanks, Brian. Thanks, Jessica. So obviously, the upfront was a very unusual upfront this year, Jessica, I mean, we didn't think a couple of months ago, there was even going to be an upfront this year. And the fact that there was one and it ended up being relatively normal and much stronger than we expected, was really good news for the whole business. We ended up kind of slightly up on price, which was we expected to be way down on price, we ended up slightly up on price, slightly down on volume. And as you mentioned, the big impact on advertising really is the ratings and the ratings is not just us. But everybody, because we've stopped production, who would normally have kind of our full schedule in high gear right now and we're just starting those shows and we don't have a lot of new content. So, that's what's driving kind of the advertising, choppiness and declines. The flip side of that is it creates scarcity in the market. So, the market actually has pretty strong, because we have less rating points, we have more demand and a couple of the moves that we've made were kind of perfect timing. peacock, we talked about peacock's ad-driven platform, gives us an opportunity to sell where others don't really sell and we launched right into the strength of that scarcity. And then we also kind of consolidated all of our advertising under L'India a Torino [ph] one platform approach and we think that was also perfect timing, because it gives us the opportunity to kind of sell and address that scarcity across multiple platforms, so obviously, much \u2013 a much smaller upfront than the past, but much better than we expected. Brian, do you want me to jump in? This is Jeff. Okay. so Ben, thanks for the question, a lot in your questions. So, I'll try to just hit it really quickly. But first of all, just working backwards, definition of success, there is a lot going on in NBCUniversal. I really don't think the definition of success is any different than it's ever been. our job is to be profitable, generate cash flow and generate long-term value for the company and that's how we're kind of thinking about everything and it's obviously a very changing world. So, you have to be nimble in doing that. But the measures of that are the same measures, as they've always been in our view. And organizationally, I really think, we're kind of through the execution of most of our restructuring, the costs will hit over the next kind of 12 months, there's about a third of them in this quarter. And then by the middle of next year, we're kind of through the majority of them. And they're designed for two things; one, we have an obligation as our revenue moves down to adjust our cost base, which I'm proud of our team for doing across our whole company. But more importantly, we really realigned our TV organization under Mark Lazarus. It used to be in the TV world. you were very vertically oriented by network and you would say, oh, I need a show for this time period to go out and get a show for that time period. And every network kind of had their management team and staff, we realigned kind of dramatically, so that everything is one management group in the TV business under two great executives, Frances Berwick and Susan Rovner just joined us. And the idea now is to find great content and use our platform, which is in many ways better than anybody else's platform with all of our networks, not just linearly. but peacock, to take great platform and really maximize the value of it and I'm very excited about it. It does result in a lot less cost. But I think more importantly, it sets us up to grow as the world changes. Turning the parks very quickly, parks are \u2013 obviously, it's a very \u2013 parks are a great business. By the way, when the world returns and people get sick of being in their house, I really feel that we're going to be a very strong business, nobody can tell the pace of how that's going to go, given what's happening. But so far, we're rebounding fairly nicely in Florida and Japan, where we're open. Our first priority always has been, always will be the safety of our guests and our employees. And I'm proud of Tom Williams and the team there that they've actually had a set of protocols that has resulted in us being open without any problem, whether its guests or employees and who knows how the future will bring. But the rebound is nice, is happening nicely. And if it continues in this way, we do expect, as Brian said, in the opening to hit breakeven, if not more at some time in 2021. Hi, thanks, John, this is Jeff, I'll jump into that. So clearly, we \u2013 I think, we talked about the 22 million signups, which is great and way ahead of we thought we'd be. If you look at, you just mentioned kind of a \u2013 we're generally the majority of our advertising, our revenue was advertising. And there's three metrics that really go into it. It's how many people sign up? It's, it's how many of them use it regularly we track kind of MAAs and monthly asked what counts, and then how often they use it, what the engagement is. And those 22 million obviously served as the top of the funnel, and we're way ahead on the other two of what we projected to be and that obviously then translates to revenue. So, couldn't be more pleased with where we are. And we're just seeing the effects of the Roku deals, by the way, just kicking in. So, we have lots of growth coming in amongst Roku customers going forward, because we're just seeing the very beginnings of that effect on us. So, couldn't be more pleased with the content that's resonating. It really is interesting. It's kind of across the board. I mean, obviously Premier League Soccer has been an interesting driver for us. Some of our topical stuff, some of our NBC News product has been resonating. Brian mentioned, some of the shows that we're able to get from other people, that they didn't necessarily discover on other platforms like Yellowstone, and recently Mr. Mercedes are resonating, but I think the \u2013 in general, if you look at the usage, the fact that we have such a deep library of familiar stuff, it's kind of the opposite equivalent. We have stuff people are you want to watch, they want to, rewatch 30 Rock, they want to watch Dick Wolf's library, it's really kind of across the board and very broad based, and with most of our programming strength coming in future quarters. We're really very optimistic. We don't even get the office, which is still amongst Netflix top shows until January exclusively. And then with the Olympics behind it, and back to Olympics behind it, to add to our sports strength, we're very, very, very optimistic on how the content is resonating. Just more broadly, on direct-to-consumer. We have a \u2013 I do think we have the scale as a company to more than compete, I think we have the best platform.

So, we think, I think we have, more than enough scale, both in our content, and across the broader company and the way that we reach consumers. So, I don't know, Brian, if you want to add anything?"

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Brian Roberts",
            "content": "Thanks, Marci and good morning, everyone. We're nearly eight months into this pandemic. And despite many harsh realities, I could not be more pleased and proud of how our team has worked together across the company to find safe, creative solutions to successfully operate in this environment. We're executing at the highest level and perhaps most importantly, accelerating innovation to drive long-term future growth. We remain intensely focused on our top three strategic priorities of expanding and leading with broadband, aggregation and streaming, all of which are underpinned by strong content creation, distribution and technology. Each business is increasingly complementing, reinforcing and driving value for the others, while enabling us to offer seamless and bundled experiences to all our customers. For example, this quarter, we added a record number of new customer relationships and high-speed internet subscribers and signups for Peacock have grown to nearly 22 million as of today. It is clear that Peacock's results are enhanced by the placement and distribution it gets through our broadband service. And adding Peacock to broadband is resulting in a significant improvement in both churn and gross ads. As Peacock is continuously cited as a differentiating factor at the point of sale for Xfinity broadband products; none of this could have been achieved without the technology stack that we have through Sky. Focusing now on our top strategic priority broadband, the success we've experienced to-date has been driven by years of investment combined with our leading scale. We engage with 56 million high value households and businesses globally. These subscribers give us a stronger starting point in direct-to-consumer relationships, particularly with broadband. Our connections at the point-of-sale provide us with a distinct advantage as this is the moment when customers really contemplate their aggregation and streaming options. We have the best broadband network in the U.S., perhaps in the world, lead by a completely integrated consumer experience with the widest array of products that go beyond just speed. We offer coverage, control in an unprecedented level of flexibility. With our broadband service, you get your choice of entertainment over your preferred distribution method whether it's the industry leading video bundle with X1, or the highest quality streaming product with Flex, both powered by the same platform and technology, the same award winning voice remote, and the same cloud-based software. With Xfinity Internet, you can opt for Xfinity mobile, the great value wireless service hosted by Verizon, now inclusive of nationwide 5G and augmented by our own WiFi network, the largest in the U.S. And we have the ability to evolve this offering over time to we choose to include our own wireless network or cellular infrastructure to generate even greater profitability in the most highly-trafficked mobile areas as this unique combination of broadband products and services that led to this quarter's 556,000 net new customer relationships and 633,000 net new high-speed internet subscribers, both the best quarterly record in our company's history. In the UK, customer relationships now stand at over 13 million, a figure that's been steadily growing, driven by our exclusive content and experience that cements our video relationship with customers, a differentiated broadband service as the number two provider and increasing wireless penetration. It's a winning formula for other markets that we will look to replicate. Moving to our second strategic priority, aggregation, whether it's a Pay TV video bundle or a streaming solution for the home, entertainment remains an important consideration for new and existing broadband customers. X1 and Sky Q are the world's leading platforms for aggregating broadcast, sports, and streaming services. Flex provides that same experience to those customers, who prefer streaming only video included for free with Xfinity Internet. We've developed the best operating system for your entertainment experience, controlled by one global voice remote, enabling 15 billion commands, five languages annually. Our expertise or technology, and a tremendous amount of R&D continue to push us forward with opportunities to generate new revenue streams and areas of monetization, which sets us on an even stronger path towards long-term growth. The goal of our common Tech Stack is to build once and deploy as many times and as many markets and as many ways as possible on our network or through wholesale distribution. We've already experienced great success with our current X1 syndication model, white-labeling our software and technology gives us a significant revenue stream that boasts healthy margins and even more important, more scale for our platform. We look forward to expanding this expertise to other distributors, and believe that even larger nationwide and potentially international syndication model will create new opportunities in this rapidly-changing ecosystem that will create value for our company and our shareholders. Our third strategic priority is streaming, which not only provides us with another increasingly important way to reach our viewers and monetize our content, but it also drives demand for higher speeds and more reliable broadband and differentiates and improves the economics of aggregation. Peacock, our premium ad supported video on demand service is the right streaming strategy at the right time. After launching nationwide, just this past July, we are excited to already have nearly 22 million Peacock signups to date, and have exceeded all of our internal engagement metrics, even without having the benefit of the 2020 Olympics. Going out with free allowed us to grow quickly with a very low cost per acquisition and significantly less marketing spend and other new streaming services. We've also been able to effectively leverage our expansive high-quality library and over $20 billion of annual content spend that supports our existing media businesses for Peacock, and enhance it with targeted incremental investment in additional streaming IP. Xfinity has been a significant contributor to Peacock success, driving awareness and usage through bundling with X1 and Flex. In fact, Peacock was the number one app on Flex and the number three app on X1 for the month of September when measured by reach. We're also leaning into Flex, which increases the lifetime value of our broadband customers as we see churn improved by 15% to 20% for new customers that engage with the platform. Since adding Flex as a video option, we've seen our entertainment relationships increase. In fact, the growth in the Flex monthly active user base, which now sits at over one million, more than offset the decline in the number of our traditional Pay TV video subscribers for the past two quarters. Reaching these three strategic objectives takes focus and discipline, and we have both. We are realigning our cost structure across our company and making the appropriate level investment in the right initiatives, so as to fuel long-term growth and enable us to effectively compete in an evolving global marketplace. Turning from our long-term strategy, I'd like to highlight our third quarter results, which I'm quite proud of in light of the challenges we have faced with COVID. In Cable, our revenue growth accelerated and we generated an impressive 10.5% increase in EBITDA. We have been incredibly successful in identifying long-term cost efficiencies. In fact, with our self-installed offerings and digital tools, customers can do virtually everything they want or need to without picking up the phone or requiring a truck roll. But we're also investing for growth, with the goal of increasing awareness of our ever improving Xfinity brand, promoting an advancing or leading broadband position and accelerating our mobile and business segments. At NBCUniversal, the team has done a really creative and impressive job of navigating through an incredible amount of uncertainty. I am pleased to report that some businesses are steadily recovering, given the resumption of both sports and content production. Where we continue to see the most pressure from COVID is in our Theme Parks, which were the single biggest drag in the quarter. In fact excluding this segment, NBCUniversal EBITDA would have grown by 9% year-over-year. While it will take some time for the parks to return to historical levels, we've made substantial progress. Universal Orlando and Osaka are operating at limited but growing attendance. While we don't know when Hollywood might reopen, we remain very bullish on the parks long-term. I am very excited for next year's launch of our frankly incredible new theme park in Beijing. Early in the third quarter, we announced a completely new structure for our television businesses, enabling us to realign how we invest in the creation, production and distribution of world class content. In essence, we've done away with the concept of creating a piece of work for a specific network. Our priority is to invest in and create the absolute best content, and ensure that we maximize monetization by choosing the most effective method of distribution, whether it's broadcast, cable networks, Peacock, sales to a third party, or some combination of all four. Last, we're closing in on two years since we bought Sky. So, I thought I would spend a moment providing some context on the progress we see to-date. The UK, which is by far the largest component of Sky EBITDA has proven to be a strong business that has generated high single-digit EBITDA growth over the two-year span when adjusting for the momentary impacts of COVID, anchored by growth in both our customer base and revenue per customer relationship. Our UK customers continue to do more with us as evidenced by our higher penetration of broadband, and wireless and in the QBox, all of which solidify us as the home of aggregation and streaming and which sets us up nicely for continued growth. What we see in the UK guide to our thinking on the prospects for what Germany and Italy could each become. In both markets, we have a leading brand name and customer proposition in video supported by significant scale. While it may take time, we're on a path to replicate the UK playbook, and took an important step toward this in Italy with our recent launch of broadband. We also have fairly immediate opportunities to improve our cost structure as we move to centralize our organizational efforts across our markets. And as we've begun to reset many of our largest sports rights in Continental Europe, which should provide hundreds of millions of dollars in annual savings. As Jeremy highlighted recently, we are confident in our ability to double EBITDA at Sky over the next several years. And importantly, Sky fits right in with our broader company priorities playing a big role in strengthening our Tech Stack for aggregation and in content solutions across all of NBCU and Cable. When you put it all together and look at the first nine months of the year, but certainly, not the year, we all would have expected. We've executed extremely well. We've taken advantage of the favorable interest rate environment to enhance our balance sheet and liquidity, and we remain committed to getting leverage, where it needs to be, so that we can return to buying back stock. All in all, this was a really strong quarter. And Mike will now take you through our results in greater detail. Okay. there's a lot in there, Jessica. Let me start with the aggregation and broadband question. And then let Jeff and others talk about the upfront. Look, we think we have this three-pronged strategy that complement for each other, works together and basically ends up giving customers the best product, regardless of what segment they're in, and broadband is definitely a central element of that. But aggregation in this world, as we know, as consumers that you want to flip back and forth between one streaming service and other streaming service, live television, YouTube, whatever it may be, and finding a way to have our entertainment platform and our voice commands, whether it's in a smart TV, whether it's in a box, and whether that is in frankly, the U.S. or in rest of the world, and in other providers. And so we've made great progress with aggregation in this quarter and in this year, named the service and you'll see that it's now either on the roadmap or very much being used, whether it's NBC-driven content with peacock, we've now shown that we can market and make aware for our customers, we chose like a yellow stone that we may not have found on a different network that all of a sudden has zoomed to the top and that's before we get additional content like the office, and the Olympics and what have you. And so putting it all together, we see the tech companies and others with ambitions on having a relationship with our high-value customers, our 56 million high-value customers in aggregation, and who can do that the best with a voice and just say the words, I was literally watching last night Prime Show and switched to Netflix and then went back to NBC, all with just one click and with my voice. And so the innovation that our team has done, the seamless integration working with various content providers, we've made tremendous strides. Jeff, you want to talk a little bit about and therefore, I'm sorry \u2013 to close out on monetization of that. We've seen a number of ways and leads right into advertising, because it's an ability to not only give you a good experience in charge, who are subscription fees, depending on what level of service it is. But in the case of Flex, whether its lower churn for our broadband, whether it's additional advertising, with Zumo and on smart television platforms and other things we have on our roadmap, which are very exciting that continue to take these tools and find new ways to give them to customers, and thereby create additional value for the shareholders. Jeff, do you want to talk about the upfront? Doug, you may be on mute. Yes. Why don't I help organize that this answer, because I think you touched on a little bit of everybody, and gives it some of the folks a chance to talk about the quarter. So, why don't we start with Dave to talk about video packaging, I would just add that I think we've seen this shift coming. I think Dave and the team have done an outstanding job of having connectivity platform and thinking of it that way. So that we're ready for that shift, I don't think it'll be all or nothing. I think it's been highlighted here during COVID and people being at home as much. But fortunately, we were ready for that. I think Jeremy could talk a little about the kind of some of the different trends in Europe and how sky is preparing for that bundle of app world as you called it and you're right, the economics change, depending on what \u2013 we want to get ourselves to a position of indifference, where the consumer is driving, not the company and the consumer decides, where they want to rest and what package they want. The company finds itself in a \u2013 it has been the best product and a good set of economics. we may always have a preference over one versus the other naturally, but we want you to be satisfied as a consumer and make our long-term growth happen. And then obviously, Jeff can talk a little bit. And Mike, if you want on the \u2013 on all the definition of success, which I think is a great way to look at NBC. But Dave, why don't you take it up? Sure. I mean, Ben, to Jeff's point, it is obviously a statement about breakeven subject to how COVID evolves. But if it stays on sort of the trend that we've been seeing through this winter into next year, we would hope at some point to get there. And then you're circling back to your first question, Ben, I think there's no question that when you really look at the fact that and Brian said it earlier that with 56 million relationships around the globe, as we've talked about in the highest wireless markets for subscription services, whether they be broadband, or OTT video entertainment of any sort, we're at the point-of-sale when people are choosing their broadband provider, where they're providing what we think are the options anyway for the best aggregation services, with or without our own video packages. And if you think about it, from the perspective of anybody trying to launch a video streaming platform, we represent 56 million homes, where you want to be on our platform, and it's worth it to share economics for us to promote and allow and I think, and that's what we already experienced today. So, there's no reason that wouldn't be A way of the future, not the only way, but A way of the future. And I think it just is even kind of more evident that the power of the platforms with the customers that we have, allows for the kind of launch the peacock had. I don't think it's a mistake or that relates that 22 million signups does definitely relate at this stage to us having the relationship with the customer through both broadband and our aggregation products. Great. I'm glad you figured out your tech issues. I don't want to suggest that there's a new news regarding the U.S. in terms of X1 licensing. What I think we're referring to is or what I'd like to refer to is just what it does when we do like than others and we're in conversations all the time with companies, and the success that that business has had, which we haven't talked about very much on these calls, it's gotten to a pretty good size and it has a very healthy margin, and there's a lot of Canadian companies, Cox in the U.S. and the area that we've been focusing on is growing Sky and Xfinity closer together into one global Tech Stack, which then opens up the opportunity to do this now not just in North America, but also starting with Sky and we're on a number of common architectures. And I think you will see in the future products roll out as a result of our ability to do that, and conversations that are being had to be able to now take that conversation more broadly. I think the most significant benefit, it certainly is the money that it brings in, but what that allows us to do in terms of scale is. So, we talked a lot about video here, we pivoted a lot of our innovation to broadband, in the last two, three, four years, and we saw this transformation coming. We saw how important broadband was going to become an even further become, and reinvent itself over and over again to have the best broadband quarter in the company's history, sitting here in 2020. When it's a 20-year old product, give or take, it's a pretty dramatic and amazing statement in my opinion. And that's because we've kept reinvesting what is broadband? What can it be, and going to WiFi that did not exist. We're now integrating that into your streaming, your aggregation, the things we've been talking about this morning. So, having the scale and the quality of talent on a global basis, to be able to recruit the best engineers, when again, we see a number of other companies wanting to enter this space, and/or lead expanding, not shrinking is I think, the greatest achievement and I give credit that we are expanding our footprint synthetically, if you will, through some of these other relationships with companies, who want to take all of our products, whatever they can become and they've done that. And I think we've given them a great experience for their customers. And they've been super supportive of our idea \u2013 of our technology team. Dave? So, let me on wireless. Let me have Dave a comment a little further. But I don't think we have any new news day on that question. We are trying to build optionality from a cost basis. We really won't get the product to receive, we hope that it would be you would note a difference, but what network you're on. We just want to have the best value with the best service. And we now have 5G, right at the same time as everybody who is a network operator, and so that that's how we spot ahead, I guess is the best way for me to answer that question. When we did the original MNVO relationship, we thought about things like what new technologies might come in the future and in this opportunity to and we have to respect that some of the auctions rules require us not to comment on things. So, we just look at it as creating options for the future for the company, when they have a value net value add to all of all the shareholders. David, that sound right to you? No, I think that's an excellent answer and a good way to end the call. I think going back to a question was asked earlier, what's your definition of success? I think you've just laid out, it's looking across the whole company. And Peacock is a fantastic example of just in this \u2013 just from quarter-to-quarter, amazing progress. And it tells me all parts of the company and their roadmaps are ahead. So this one example, really good quarter, and we look forward to giving you more engagement stats, and everything else as we go. My \u2013 there's a race on. And we did really well in the last 90 days and the last 180 days in that race, my strategy that has been laid out here, which for a lot less money, and a lot less risk to our core company, changing the financial characteristics, and yet giving us that potential. Now have many customers having the Peacock app signed up. What can we do to get that engagement and usage up? That's a that's over the next 10 years and life over the long term of once you once you get that real estate. So we're going to continue that race. We've got some great content ahead to get people have yet to try Peacock, play with it. And when you get there, it's got to work really well. And that's where that experience from Sky and X1 and doing user interfaces paid off. So, we'll keep focused on it. And thanks for all the questions and the conversation. Marci back to you."

Now, I'll review our third quarter 2020 results and offer some commentary on the current conditions in our businesses caveating that circumstances around us remain fluid, and therefore, our outlook is subject to change. Beginning on Slide 6 with our consolidated third quarter results, consolidated revenue declined 4.8% year-over-year to $25.5 billion while adjusted EBITDA was down 11% to $7.6 billion and adjusted EPS fell 18% to $0.65 per share, all a result of the lingering effects of COVID-19. Free cash flow of $2.3 billion was up 10.5% benefiting from the positive year-over-year change in net working capital due to COVID at both NBCU and Sky, half of which resulted from the timing of when sports rights payments were made, versus when sports actually aired, and half of which resulted from a slower ramp and content production. We expect this trend to reverse starting in the fourth quarter and continue into next year as our businesses continue to recover from COVID. Before moving to segment results, I remind you that corporate and other losses have continued to increase as a result of our focus on the successful positioning of Peacock. We have also incurred COVID-related severance and restructuring charges totaling $239 million year-to-date. We expect to incur an additional charge that is approximately double this amount in this year's fourth quarter as we continue to align the cost structure across all of our businesses. Now, let's turn to our business segment results starting with Cable Communications on Slide 7. For the third quarter, Cable Communications' revenue increased 2.9% while EBITDA increased 10.5%. Revenue this quarter was once again impacted by adjustments for customer RSN fees. Excluding these adjustments, overall cable revenue would have risen by 3.9% with no corresponding impact to EBITDA. As Brian mentioned, we generated 556,000 customer relationship net additions, the best quarterly results on record driven by high-speed internet, where we added 633,000 net new residential and business customers also, the best quarterly results on record. Underlying net additions were similar to last year's third quarter and we were able to successfully convert some customers to paid status that continued to receive our service, but were not included in our second quarter results. Roughly, one third of those customers converted to paid status or free internet essentials customers while the remaining two thirds were high-risk customers have begun paying their balances and returned their full service after being on our assistance plan. Going forward, we do not expect the impact of converting free internet essentials and high-risk customers' paid status to be as significant. high-speed internet revenue grew 10% including RSN fee adjustments and grew just over 11% excluding those adjustments. Remember, RSN fee adjustments are allocated to those customers taking bundled services according to their standalone market prices. The strength in high-speed internet is coming from a number of areas. One, we continue to take share of an expanding market as evidenced by an increase in our broadband penetration. 51% of homes and businesses in our footprint are now taking our HSD product, up 240 basis points versus a year ago. Two, our investment in our network and product differentiation is resonating in the market whether it's our best-in-class gateway, or controlling security through xFi, it's not just about speed. Three, we are seeing higher take rates of our entertainment product with the addition of Flex, which continues to have a significant positive impact on churn and therefore, customer lifetime value. And four, we also continue to drive connects by expanding our network through line extensions. Business Services revenue grew 4% as we return to a net gain of 17,000 customer relationships this quarter and turning to video, revenue declines 2.1% with accrued RSN fee adjustments adding an adverse impact of 130 basis points. We lost 273,000 net video customers this quarter, which reflects modest improvement in our underlying video losses compared to the second quarter, and a benefit of converting some of the previously high-risk customers to paid status. Wireless revenue increased 23% driven by 187,000 additional lines, resulting in 2.6 million total lines at quarter-end. Our wireless business continued to be impacted by our decision to keep some of our retail stores closed for most of the quarter, especially in areas, where COVID cases remained high. That said, the vast majority of our retail stores are now open and we have put a number of plans in place to accelerate the growth in this business. advertising revenue increased 12% year-over-year due to strong political advertising, which was up 70% over what we had generated in the last presidential election in 2016. Core advertising excluding political was down 6.8% year-over-year, a significant improvement relative to last quarter with better trends across most categories. We also saw some benefits from the clustering of sports programming that began to air in the third quarter. Turning to expenses. Cable Communications third quarter expenses decreased 2.2% with programming expenses down 0.6%, primarily as a result of the accrued RSN fee adjustment. Without this adjustment, programming expense would have increased by 4%. Non-programming expenses declined 3.2%, primarily as a result of curtailed advertising; marketing and promotion spend, as well as lower technical and product support, primarily due to a COVID-related slowdown in business activities. We are also continuing to find better and more efficient ways to do business, particularly through our digital tools and interactions. Cable communications EBITDA grew by 10.5% and margin reached 42.7%, reflecting 290 basis points of year-over-year improvement. While accrued RSN fee adjustments had no impact on EBITDA, they did have a positive contribution margin of roughly 40 basis points. Cable capital expenditures decreased 2.5%, resulting in CapEx intensity of 11.8% and improvement of 60 basis points year-over-year driven by lower spending on customer premise equipment and support capital, partially offset by higher spending on scalable infrastructure, which continues to increase due to our ongoing investment in the network. I'll now touch a bit on what we're seeing so far and what we expect in the fourth quarter. For high-speed internet, underlying subscriber trends remain healthy. And we currently expect revenue growth to accelerate from the third quarter driven by this year's strong subscriber growth combined with higher ARPU, resulting from an increase in the uptake of some of our higher margin products, such as modems, and xFi pods. In addition to better expanding assistance program curates. While we are pleased to see a continuation of net new customers in our business segment, we do not expect revenue growth to accelerate in the near-term, given the COVID subscriber impact we saw earlier in the year, as well as the longer sales cycles associated with the recovery we're seeing with our midmarket and enterprise customers. That said, we remain optimistic on the long-term prospects across all of our business segments. We remain the challenger with the highest-quality offerings at lower price points than our competitors. On the video side, we expect fourth quarter video losses to be similar to the third quarter levels, reflecting modest improvements to our underlying trends. And just like with high-speed data, a less significant impact from converting customers to paid status. When it comes to our outlook for expenses and margins, commensurate with the sequential acceleration and underlying revenue growth that we anticipate for the fourth quarter, we expect non-programming OpEx to be flat to slightly up, reflecting our aggressive focus on maintaining strong connect activity by returning to home installs, increasing our marketing spend to defend our strong position and further accelerating our mobile and SMB businesses. That said, we continue to make significant inroads with implementation of the long-term cost efficiencies we identified earlier this year, which puts our overall expense base in a very good position as we enter 2021. We expect programming cost to be up mid-to-high single digits in the fourth quarter given scheduled programming renewals and we do not anticipate additional RSN fee adjustments, given what we have seen for the first nine months of the year, combined with our outlook for the fourth quarter, we now expect cable EBITDA margins to exceed our prior guidance of up to 100 basis points year-over-year improvement by a healthy amount, both with and without the RSN fee adjustments, while CapEx intensity is still expected to improve by up to 100 basis points year-over-year. Next, let's turn to Slide 8 for NBCUniversal. For the third quarter, NBCUniversal revenue decreased 19% to $6.7 billion, while EBITDA decreased 39% to $1.3 billion. The majority of the revenue and substantially all of the EBITDA declines came from our Theme Parks business, as Hollywood remains closed, and both Orlando and Osaka are open to limited attendance as a direct result of COVID-19. Starting with the TV business's, Cable Networks revenue was down 1.3%, driven by declines in distribution and advertising revenue, offset by an increase in content loss licensing and other. The distribution revenue decline of 3.8% resulted from a slight acceleration in subscribers' clients, less rate benefit due to the absence of programming renewals, and a nearly 200 basis point impact from accrued RSN fee adjustments. Advertising revenue was down 2.1%, a significant improvement compared to the second quarter as we benefited from the broadcast of rescheduled sporting events, which is not expected to recur in the fourth quarter. Cable networks EBITDA decreased 8.9% due to higher programming and production expenses driven by the shift of sports rights amortization costs into the third quarter. Turning to broadcast, revenue increased 8.3%, driven by 66% growth in content licensing sales, and continued growth and retransmission consent fees, partially offset by decline in advertising. While advertising improved significantly compared to the second quarter, broadcast did not benefit as much from the shift of sports as rescheduled sporting events were basically offset by canceled events, as well as fewer NFL games relative to last year. After recognizing a significant increase in content licensing revenue year-to-date at both broadcast and cable networks, we expect a double-digit decline in the fourth quarter due to the timing of our sales to streaming platforms, which were more heavily concentrated in the first nine months of the year, combined with a difficult comparison to a significant library deal in last year's fourth quarter. Broadcast EBITDA increased 29% to the higher revenue, as well as lower programming and marketing costs associated with the delayed start of our new fall season, which were somewhat offset by higher program expenses related to content sales. Filmed Entertainment revenue declined 25% year-on-year with theatrical revenue down 95% reflecting theater closures as a result of COVID-19, partially offset by a 50% increase in content licensing revenue, as well as a 49% increase in home entertainment revenue due to Trolls World Tour. Filmed Entertainment EBITDA increased 53% as lower revenue was more than offset by lower operating costs related to less spending on current period releases as a result of COVID-19. While we have pushed the majority of our movie slate to 2021, we are looking forward to the release of The Croods: A New Age in theaters and a subsequent PVOD release later in the quarter. Theme Parks revenue was $311 million in the quarter with an EBITDA loss of $203 million due to Universal Orlando Resort and Universal Studios Japan operating at limited capacity while Universal Studios Hollywood remain closed as a result of COVID-19. This quarter's EBITDA included roughly $20 million of preopening costs related to our theme park in Beijing, which remains on schedule to open by the summer of 2021. We anticipate cumulative preopening costs be roughly $400 million, with approximately $100 million, pulling in 2020 and $300 million in the first half of 2021. We continue to see improvement in underlying trends and expect the theme park business to break-even at some point in 2021, independent of what occurs with Universal Studios Hollywood. Next, let's turn to slide 9 for sky, which I will speak to on a constant currency basis. Revenue for the third quarter was even with the prior year, as we were seeing the benefits of a very healthy underlying business in the UK, combined with the return of major sporting events, primarily European football that have been previously postponed. Content revenue was up 17.5% driven by higher wholesale revenue from sports programming, while direct-to-consumer and advertising revenue showed significant sequential improvement, each down 1% year-on-year. On the advertising side, we outperformed the European marketplace, which was down about 10% as we've benefited from strong advanced advertising, and rescheduled sporting events that were previously postponed due to COVID-19. In addition to sports, overall sky entertainment viewing was up double digits, partly aided by the addition of our new branded channels, including sky comedy, which launched in January, and sky documentary, Sky history and sky nature, which launched in May. The significant sequential improvement in direct-to-consumer revenue resulted from the return of sports and a healthy underlying trend in the UK, which experienced a gain of 51,000 customer net relationships and low single-digit ARPU growth. The strong performance was driven by our strategy to be the best TV aggregation platform in the market, record low TV churn and continued growth in streaming broadband and mobile customers. Our large, resilient sky TV base continues to benefit from the deployment of our more advanced sky cube product. Overall, Sky Cube penetration is at 51% of households, while UK penetration has reached 58%, up 13 percentage points year-over-year. We are also pleased with the results at NOW TV, which is positioned for a different market segment. ARPU is increasing as this growing customer base continues to take more packs on average, underscored by a 60% increase in the uptake of our highest price sports pack. While revenue from our hospitality business, the pubs and clubs that receive our sky TV service remains pressured. We've seen weekly revenue back 70% of historical levels versus 25% at the start of the quarter. Italy and Germany remain a bit more challenged. In Germany, we made changes to our pricing and packaging earlier in the quarter, while we were pleased with the positive customer response. This will pressure ARPU in the near-term as you focus on growing market share and reducing churn. In Italy, our results showed meaningful sequential improvement, but we continue to be impacted by a tough macro environment. We are encouraged by positive momentum and Italy broadband post its mid-June launch. Customer additions are beating our initial expectations with satisfaction scores at high levels. EBITDA for the third quarter was down roughly 45% as flat revenue was offset by an increase in programming and production costs primarily as a result of the postponement of European football events, which moved from the second quarter into the third as a result of COVID-19. Looking ahead, we continue to expect third quarter and fourth quarter EBITDA combined to be down roughly 60%. with the fourth quarter impacted by the later return of the currencies of European football, the shift of other sports programming to the fourth quarter, investments in original programming and higher costs associated with the launch of our new UK entertainment channels. Wrapping up on slide 10, with free cash flow and capital allocation. free cash flow was $2.3 billion in the quarter, an increase of 10.5% year-over-year. Consolidated total capital, which includes CapEx as well as software and intangibles decreased 5.8% in third quarter to $2.9 billion, primarily driven by declines at NBCU, particularly parks, as well as at Cable. During the quarter and year-to-date, we refinanced $5.9 billion and $15.8 billion of debt respectively, ending the third quarter with a weighted average cost of debt of 3.6%. Finally, we remain committed to our longstanding balanced approach to capital allocation. Maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing organically for profitable growth, and returning capital to shareholders through a strong commitment to our recurring dividends, and eventual return to share repurchases. With that, I'll turn it back to Marci, who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call. Phil it's Mike. On the other question, I mean, I think obviously, as you said before, we're very committed to the commitments that we made to the rating agencies and, therefore to the bondholders who support the balance sheet. So it's our highest priority to get ourselves delevered, consistent with those commitments, and then get ourselves back to balance capital allocation, which we're eager to have that include buybacks, as we've been talking about, no doubt. I think it's premature to talk about, where the topic you raised and other ways to think about, how to think about our ability to support the debt through the lens of a rating agency is stuff that we'll talk about with them, as we see, COVID make a turn and the businesses that are heard on EBITDA front, really make their turn until then it'd be premature to make any further comments."

            "name": "Jeremy Darroch",
            "content": "And maybe Jeremy here, maybe I'll just chip in from sky. I think \u2013 I often think of it, I would split it to sort of supply side relationships, and then consumer side service. So, I think on supply side, when we see central step into our world, a good example would be for example, Disney, where we took a very high fixed cost long-term contract, and effectively turned it into an app. we've taken that cost out of our P&L and they're getting a margin by selling Disney plus through sky. And then we could do something similar with Netflix, of course. And then we can take that money, and you will have a course through the P&L or invest some of it in an area like Sky Studios, where we can then scale about own originated content, which improves the customer experience and of course, it's \u2013 which will variable and differentiates as well. when you get to the consumer side, really, there's virtually no change the experience, there's consumers want to continue to get all that contract on time to the sky user interface, we can deep link into offspring customers back efficiently, the sky interface is very, very easy to move around, as Brian said, with the growth and development invoice that's just becoming easier every day. So actually, we think we can complement the user experience very much and actually, get a much more flexible and more valuable set of cost structures. And then we can think of NOW TV as an addendum to that in a way just to target an additional part of the market that uses many of those contrast relationships, and allows us just to get to more customers in a different way. So that's how we think about bringing all of that together."

            "name": "Dave Watson",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. Hello, Ben. So, I think, clearly, the video marketplace is almost everyday evolving. From our perspective, we have invested in a video \u2013 broad video platform capability that, I think, gives us a lot of options and can give customers a lot of choice that we want to deliver to the customer what they want and a video experience. So, we segment the marketplace, we break it down. We've been doing that for some time. And as Brian said, we anticipated a lot of these changes. So for customers that want the full experience, that want all the channels, that want the video on demand, DVR capability and apps, and as Brian talked about the ability to seamlessly connect all of that, we have that one. We also now, I think, are very uniquely positioned to go after the streaming segment with flex. And the best example, I think of our position in the marketplace with video, when you combine it with broadband; we're surrounding broadband with a lot of video capability, and we're streaming and peacock, we're giving them the best of aggregation, rate streaming options. So, we're going to break down the marketplace continue to compete, and deliver to customers what they want. So, I think that will continue word or we feel that this is a sustained competitive difference that we have, and we'll go to where the customer wants to go. And in terms of whether it's more profitable outcome for us, then we'll be in different if they want streaming capability with flex, we're going to be right there to deliver that. Thanks, Brian. Hi, Doug. So, just one other comment on the Flex side of things with our partners. So, we have a really solid syndication business, great distribution partners. In the U.S., Canada, looking elsewhere and Flex most certainly is on the roadmap for all of our partners so. And it gives us the option of being able to work with device participants, smart TV folks, and others to be able to have it be a software solution. So, we'll look at all options going forward. In wireless, so we're \u2013 in general, we're pleased with where we are, in many quarters in a row, we're delivering material amount of the net ads in our footprint. And so we're on track, having said that with retail, we chose the shutdown to retail stores, and it could \u2013 chunk of the country that did have an impact. We've reopened them, as Mike said, and we really feel that we're committed to accelerating the wireless business, it's a really important product for us going forward and it \u2013 we'll be focused not just on retail. We think digital still has great promise and we're already seeing as we put our shoulder to bringing things back some real early stage success in terms of what mobile can do. The results again, still relatively early, but we'd really like the retention benefits to broadband as we package them with it, a lot of options. We do triple play with mobile now. We use it to package just with broadband, very focused across all of our sales channels. And it really comes down to that, I mean, the three things that we're focused on. One is that we have access to really great network with Verizon. We have the ability to cut across all technologies including 5F. So, we'll give the customers what they want there. We can leverage our own investment in the home with WiFi; outside the home with most of the broadband, the cell phone, smartphone traffic goes over our WiFi network. So, it's a great combination of the two. And then over time, I think we're going to be uniquely positioned to leverage the potential for building out in dense pockets wireless capability to give us a more efficient way of delivering mobile. So \u2013 but overall, we think that this is an important opportunity for us long-term, still feel that way, right on track with where we want to be. We want to be a little bit more aggressive and that's on the roadmap. Well, Craig, Dave here. So in broadband, yes, let me start with what we've been seeing and we've been seeing consistent momentum now for a while. Well, before COVID it's been rock solid in terms of this momentum is our focus. We, every day wake up to thinking about, how we, Brian mentioned, we innovate, go to market. So this is and we're talking about a marketplace and perhaps speaks to across the board as all boats rise, but the markets growing, continues to grow and you look at our position at 51% penetration. There's upside, a lot of upside. So, I look at where it comes from and the good news is, it's been relatively consistent, maybe, a few new opportunities enter the picture through the COVID period, but it's across the board in terms of where we're taking share on the frontend combining that with record churn results in the net ads, but we're taking share from Telco wired participants, DSL, MDU competitors, mobile providers, those kind of across the board in many different segments. So, a lot of opportunity in the formula, Craig is the \u2013 I think, the consistent one. We look to have a sustained competitive difference, delivering just a better product in the marketplace, better speed, better coverage, better feature capability. And now with streaming and then you combine that with Peacock, and other apps by the way, all the other apps that come connected by Flex. I think this is a really good long term competitive formula. So it's across the board. There's upside. Good runway for broadband, I believe going forward. Regards to wireless and Apple, we're excited about their product launches. We're well positioned with 5G. And so as that begins to take off, early feedback we're getting from prospects and customers existing customers, and it's very solid. So, we get prepared just like everyone else. All the other carriers in terms of these launches work very closely with Apple, but we have a full supply chain plan, go to market approach. And so we're we were optimistic about it. It's happening a little later in this year than last year. But that's okay, that'll just be a nice opportunity for later on the quarter into next year. Yes, absolutely. Brian, I think, Phil, the main point is, we really like our current position. We have a go to market, we're still unique in that and other cable partner target us the same thing, where you have by the gig, that unlimited options. So, we like our current position. And as you look to the future, as we look to the future, with the spectrum, then you have an opportunity to look at dense pockets of usage, and then just build a more efficient long-term delivery system. So, we'll \u2013 we don't have to rush to do that. We're going to \u2013 we're looking at it from an engineering perspective. And we'll be opportunistic down the road. But right now, we really like our current position."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Comcast Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note, that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone. Joining me on this morning's call to provide a detailed review of our results and answer analysts' questions are Brian Roberts and Mike Cavanagh, as well as Dave Watson, Jeff Shell and Jeremy Darroch. Let me first refer you to slide two, which contains our safe harbor disclaimer. I remind you that this conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our 8-K and trending schedules for the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian Roberts. Brian?\nBrian Roberts: Thanks, Marci. I'd like to start by wishing all of you well, and I hope that you are safe and settled in for what feels like a new normal, at least for the balance of this year. While none of us has a perfect crystal ball and we don't know the path this virus might take, I could really not be prouder of how our teams across Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal and Sky are together managing our business. The response has been extraordinarily fast and effective. Our products and brands continue to resonate strongly with our customers across all segments and all geographies. This, combined with the unwavering efforts of our employees, produce second quarter financials that highlight the strength and resilience of our company. It starts with Xfinity, the core of the company, whose fantastic results continue to be fueled by our best-in-class broadband business, which experienced record low churn for yet another quarter while connects remained healthy. The consistency of these results confirm that our strategy and corresponding investments are working. We offer differentiated products and services and a fantastic customer experience, all of which we are delivering even more efficiently. Considering that NBCU and Sky are facing certain pressures that are momentary and unique to some of their businesses, I think we are performing incredibly well. Despite theme park and theater closures and most sports having been paused, we continue to transact. And more importantly, we are innovating as we position these businesses for continued market leadership and the return to strong long-term growth. From a broader perspective, Comcast is truly in an enviable position. We have an amazing portfolio of companies that are each successfully taking advantage of the evolving ecosystem, and together, creating complementary capability, technology platform and a global footprint. All of this is led by our extremely flexible and robust broadband network, which is the foundation of our connectivity-centric relationship with residential/commercial customers and heavily supports our other services, including video aggregation and mobile. With NBCU and Sky, we have some of the most valuable global content, whether it's news, entertainment or sports. And we are leaning into streaming. This starts with what is now our valuable 1/3 ownership position in Hulu and is enhanced with Peacock, our own ad-supported service whose nationwide launch earlier this month exceeded our high expectations. In fact, as of today, we already have 10 million sign-ups. With these and many other drivers of growth, I am so excited about where we are headed. While our second quarter results were better than we previously forecasted, the reality is they only represent a 90-day snapshot. In the months ahead, there's going to be a lot of noise, if you will, in the quarterly numbers, which will not be unique to Comcast. As usual, we will continue to be transparent so as to help you navigate the near-term complexities of our business. But we also want to provide a deeper understanding into what I believe is the underlying strength of our company and how we're managing each business for the long term beyond the effects of COVID. For that reason, we have changed the format of this call and have asked Dave, Jeff and Jeremy to comment in more detail about their plans for the future, specifically how they intend to tackle both the different challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. They will then be followed by Mike, who will take you through our second quarter results. As you'll hear, we're playing offense, working together like never before and using our combined capabilities, our scale, our brands, our talent, our technology and our investment-grade balance sheet to ensure that we remain a leader in our markets and that we deliver superior long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I'd like to start with Dave.\nDave Watson: Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. First of all, I am extremely proud of the entire team and how we're working together to handle the pandemic. Our employees have been nothing short of remarkable, moving quickly and effectively to a new way of working, and we continue to execute at the highest level. The investments we made over the years, particularly in broadband, are proving themselves out, whether it's the network, which is performing extremely well when reliability is even more important; or our digital tools, which have been instrumental during this time of need. Our focus remains on broadband as we continue to keep people connected and informed, as evidenced by our 323,000 high-speed Internet customer additions this quarter. This was the best second quarter in 13 years. It does not even include over 600,000 additional high-risk or free Internet essentials customers that still receive our service but were not included in reported results. We'll only count these customers once they are in paid status. We are committed to finding new ways to help all of our customers, especially those hardest hit during these challenging times. We extended our 60-day free Internet essentials offer, and we are keeping our 1.5 million out-of-home, public WiFi hotspots available for free through the end of this year. In addition, our assistance programs allow us to work closely with those customers having trouble paying their bills. We're pleased with how all of this is going and believe our approach has been the right one for us and for our customers. COVID-19 is, of course, having a significant impact on small and medium businesses as well, but we've seen some modestly positive trends, especially in terms of new connects as markets open up across our footprint. Throughout it all, we kept our focus on how to position our businesses to win for the long term. We're excited for the future, and we will come out of this even stronger. Let me outline our top three areas of focus right now. Our number 1 priority remains broadband. With only 50% of the homes and businesses in our footprint taking our data products, there is plenty of room for growth as we continue to gain share of an expanding market. We are optimistic about the runway ahead, and we will continue to invest in our broadband network to ensure we have great reliability as well as product innovation. It's much more than speed. Our customers find value in our gateways, the management and control that xFi enables, coverage with our xFi pods and most recently, Flex. We took the creative energy that we focused on video and have applied it to broadband. We've got the best product and best innovation engine out there, and we're leaning in. We're also very focused on customer retention, and our churn remains at all-time lows. With new products like Mobile and Flex, we give our customers additional opportunities to find even more value in our data service and drive retention to record levels. Additionally, on the connectivity side, we feel very good about the future growth and business services. We're taking care of our existing customers and continue to take share. We're still the challenger. With a great product set, marketing and sales strategy and customer care, we are in a great position to win. Second, we will continue to lean into our digital applications and raise awareness with our customers. We had been on a great path, but with the current environment, this gave us an opportunity to accelerate that. We integrated our Xfinity Assistant into help and support online, build new capabilities and entry points across the unassisted ecosystem. And the result of our efforts is that consumer awareness and use of our digital applications are at all-time highs and are having a meaningful impact on the business, driving record achievements across many key operating metrics, including customer call-in rates, digital interactions and churn, to name a few. In fact, we've seen more than a 15% increase in the percentage of transactions that we can complete digitally. I'm also particularly pleased with the progress we've made in our NPS scores, which have seen a dramatic improvement over the last few months and well exceeded our own aggressive targets, hitting our highest scores in the company's history. The incredible acceleration we drove in the last few months has set us up very well for the future and put us far ahead of our plan. This transformation will allow us to continue to take unnecessary costs out of the business while delivering a better experience for our customers. Third, video is still a core product and component of our packaging, and its platform is strategically important to us. We will continue to evolve our strategy around video, but our goal is to always enhance the long-term value of the customer relationship. Some customer segments, that is done with a great video package at a great value with X1, voice remote and all of the innovation we put into making that a great product. But we're not subsidizing video for those that don't value it from us. We are very focused on maximizing the EBITDA per customer relationship and lifetime value of each customer. For others, that means offering them the best broadband service with the Flex platform so they have the brains and power behind X1 to navigate the streaming video they choose. In both cases, we're adding to the customer experience, helping reduce churn on the broadband product and cementing a deeper relationship. The launch of Peacock and Hulu on X1 and Flex as well as swing on Flex are all part of doing just that: enhancing the value through our technology and bringing choice to our customers. Mike will go through the more detailed financial results, but from what I see today, the trends at work as we remain focused on connectivity and not chasing unprofitable video, together with a consistent discipline on expenses, to be confident in our long-term ability to drive margins higher. Margins may ebb and flow depending on programming renewal cycles, but the factors at play are all moving in the right direction. At the same time, I don't see any changes in the CapEx intensity trajectory even as we continue to innovate and make the appropriate high-return investments in our network. We have proven once again how important that investment is. Our network rose to the challenge of the surge in traffic this spring. And we will continue to invest to stay ahead of demand and differentiate our services. With that, I turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Shell: Thanks, Dave. The effect of the pandemic have obviously influenced every single business at NBCUniversal, but given the circumstances, I'm pleased with our results for the second quarter. At the moment, NBCUniversal is really the tale of three cities, with parks, film and television all facing very different and unique challenges. Let me briefly comment on H1. Starting with theme parks, where the financial impact has been the most significant and immediate and the operational challenge is the most daunting. As you know, by March, we had shut down all of our theme parks along with the construction of our theme park in Beijing a month earlier. Our talented team, working with local government authorities, have been working hard to get us back open. We were able to resume construction in Beijing in April, and remarkably, we remain on budget and on track to open in mid-2021. In Florida, we opened in early June with industry-leading protocols in place at significantly reduced capacity. And in Japan, we opened with similar protocols and capacity a few days later. While attendance in both locations is much lower than our typical summer levels, we are still doing better financially than if we were closed. And even more importantly, our guest satisfaction scores are at record highs. Unfortunately, a park here in California remains closed with no time table at the moment to reopen. As is typical in past downturns, the road back will be gradual and bumpy, but I'm confident that this business will return to its historical levels of financial performance. In the meantime, we are continually adjusting our cost base and capital spend, including pausing development of our Epic Universe project in Florida, for example, until the future becomes more certain. Now let me turn to our film business. In some ways, the film business has been impacted as dramatically as our theme park business as we completely shut down production and stopped releasing films in March. Due to the timing of revenue and expenses in the film business, however, the financial effects are not as immediate. In fact, since we are not spending as much money on production or marketing and continue to enjoy revenues from past years' slates, the immediate financial impact is actually positive. But obviously, making and releasing films is our lifeblood, so it's anything but positive, and the negative financial effects will be felt in coming years, particularly 2021. Fortunately, our strong management team in film has been pioneers in getting our production up and running again. We started several films, including Jurassic World in the U.K. in the past few weeks and continue full steam ahead on our important animation slate. And of course, they've also been pioneers in pursuing new distribution models. Our release of Trolls World Tour and King of Staten Island and other titles on premium video-on-demand exceeded our expectations and had a significant positive impact in the quarter and led to our groundbreaking partnership that we signed with AMC earlier this week. We've always believed that PVOD can be a complement rather than a replacement for a robust theatrical release. And I commend Adam Aron at AMC for his vision that together, we can build a new, more attractive business model for us both. Finally, let me spend a few minutes on our television and streaming businesses. As you can see in our results, even though scripted television production ceased in March similar to film, our talented alternative and late night teams have continued to find ways of getting us fresh content. While the advertising market was hit hard, it is coming back more rapidly than we anticipated, and the upfront is now in full swing. We believe we can get our scripted production going again later this summer, and when combined with sports that are returning, we will have a full schedule of fresh and compelling programming on our various platforms in the fall. Our news group, now under the leadership of Cesar Conde, has been a real source of pride for us in the past few months. Our networks, not just NBC, MSNBC and CNBC but also Telemundo and our local stations, have not only generated strong ratings but have provided a critical lifeline to our viewers isolated at home. I want to thank our brave journalists who report from the office and out in the field. Finally, it is said that prices fees tend to accelerate and exacerbate trends that are already happening. And that is certainly true in the television business, where viewership is rapidly shifting from linear to nonlinear. A few months ago, we combined our television and streaming businesses under Mark Lazarus, which will allow us to more rapidly shift our resources and investment from linear to streaming. Mark is finalizing a new structure that will demonstrate the unique way we intend to manage this business going forward. We will announce the structure soon. The most important development for NBCUniversal in the second quarter was our launch of Peacock, and we could not be more pleased. We launched it in Comcast homes back in April and nationwide two weeks ago, and we have already surpassed 10 million sign-ups. Not only are more people signing up than we projected, but they are watching more frequently and engaging much longer than we projected. The technology has worked seamlessly, and the service is improving on a daily basis. With much of our strong programming coming in January, including the exclusive rights to The Office, we feel very encouraged. So I obviously didn't expect my first six months on the job to be anything like this, with basically the whole company working from home and large parts of our business not operating. But if there is a silver lining, it has been in the performance of our talented leadership team who, from the beginning, made the difficult and bold decisions required by this unprecedented time. As a result of their work, I'm confident we will come out the other side of this, positioned very strongly. Now let me turn it over to Jeremy.\nJeremy Darroch: Thank you, Jeff. Now at Sky, COVID-19 has certainly posed near-term challenges to our business with the delay of sports, pressure on D2C sales and a tough macro environment for advertising. But the strategies we've implemented to manage through the crisis have proved incredibly successful. We worked with our customers, pausing subscriptions where it made the most sense, especially for those on sports products that tend be sold separately. And this resulted in retention of 99% of our total customers and over 95% of our sports space as the loyalty throughout the quarter remained at record levels and viewership on Sky's own branded channels was significant. Sky Cinema, Sky basic channels and Sky News increased 29% year-on-year, and we're ahead of free-to-air and partner channels in Sky homes. And as sports returned to see, we've achieved some of the highest viewing levels we've seen in 10 years, especially in football. We're also reducing operating expenses while still maintaining good momentum in our key initiative, which is Sky Q, which is now in close to 50% of customers' homes or over 10 percentage points higher year-on-year, and the successful launch of Sky broadband in Italy, utilizing Comcast xFi technology. We closed the quarter much stronger than we started, with employees both in corporate and in the field returning to work safely and D2C sales starting to improve. Sports package upgrades are on track with our plan, and we are outperforming in nonlinear advertising. We continue to face near-term COVID-related challenges as the linear TV advertising market remains depressed. The pub and club sector is slow to recover. We are working closely with our customers, and we're encouraged by consistent month-to-month improvement in that segment. We're operating well throughout the period. And as we continue on this path to recovery, we've got one priority. That's to grow our revenue base to restart sustained growth. And to do that, we'll focus on building our trading momentum across both TV and communications. We'll continue to deliver our strategic plan to Sky Q, Sky Studio and broadband in Italy. We'll lower cost through restructuring of our operating model, and we'll close the remaining contract renewals due this year in line with or even ahead of our plan. We are also implementing a new leaner operating model for the business, which will be more centrally led. Now all of this will be anchored by our business in the U.K. that will come from a combination of growth in our existing direct-to-consumer brands as well as new market opportunities. In the U.K., our Sky TV business remains very healthy as we offer the strongest aggregation platform, the best range of content and the most innovative and flexible product experience in the market. In addition, our NOW TV streaming business is well set to continue to deliver strong growth by adding new Pay TV customers as well as increasingly upselling more content tiers to our existing base. Sky Broadband, which is already the number 2 ISP in the U.K., has significant opportunity for continued growth through our network partnerships and strong brand over the coming years. Our newest business, Sky Mobile, is now EBITDA positive only three years after launch, and we expect to increase profitability as we continue to scale. Later this year, we'll debut our broadband product to businesses in the U.K. ahead of a full launch in 2021. Now we have 0 share of this adjacent $15 billion addressable market, we already have got strong brand recognition, and we're fully leveraging the talent, experience and other capabilities of Comcast's successful Business Services division. In Continental Europe, our markets remain less developed but with strong growth potential. And while we have good market positions in both Germany and Italy, we will significantly broaden our offering of pay content by rolling out the channel portfolio that's been developed in the U.K. They're all out of broadband in Italy, benefiting from the xFi product ecosystem from Comcast will provide a strong stand-alone profit opportunity as well as leveraging our ability to cross-sell and bundle all of our TV services more effectively in this market, of course, underpinned by the trusted Sky brand. We've already achieved good success with this approach in the U.K. And across all of our markets, we're executing a range of opportunities to increase our efficiency and control costs while continuing to enhance our products and services, especially as part of the broader Comcast group. Our U.K. business will continue its disciplined cost strategy, We've held SG&A flat from the past five years and will advance further into automation, digital and advanced analytics. Alongside this, we are rightsizing what has proved to be too high a cost base in sport has not been supported by the growth we've seen in subscriber. We'll be more selective with the store we buy and don't buy. For example, adding exclusive Formula one in Germany, which will unlock a new segment of sports fans that we haven't previously served. Recently, we concluded important new agreements with Discovery and Sony at attractive terms, we renewed our Bundesliga contract at materially lower cost, we launched new Sky entertainment channels for strong customer approval, and we introduced simplified packaging and pricing in Germany. All of these will deliver important benefits to the business longer term. In total, the significant operational changes we have on board, combined with what is an already extremely strong brand and market position, should in 2020 put us on a path to more than double our EBITDA over the next several years. We don't expect to get that overnight, but our goals are all based on opportunities that are already either in market today or are already well advanced, whether that be in product development, content creation or organizational change. Sky is well positioned, and we're looking forward to executing on the opportunity we have before us. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Cavanagh: Thanks, Jeremy, and good morning, everyone. Now I'll review our second quarter 2020 results and offer some commentary on the current conditions in our businesses, with the caveat that circumstances around us remain fluid, and therefore, our outlook is subject to change at any time. Beginning on slide four with our consolidated results; revenue decreased 11.7% to $23.7 billion. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 9.1% to $7.9 billion. Free cash flow generated in the quarter was $6 billion, and adjusted earnings per share decreased 11.5% to $0.69. Second quarter financials reflected strong results in cable, which were more than offset by declines at NBCUniversal as well as an increase in corporate and other losses due to Peacock costs and severance and restructuring costs related to organizational changes at NBCUniversal and an increase in eliminations due to the licensing of content between NBCUniversal and Peacock. Excluding the severance and restructuring costs, consolidated adjusted EBITDA would have declined in the mid-single-digit range. Now let's turn to our business segment results, starting with Cable Communications on slide five. For the second quarter, cable revenue was relatively flat at $14.4 billion, while EBITDA increased 5.5% to $6.2 billion and EBITDA less capital increased 11% to $4.4 billion. Cable Communications revenue was impacted by adjustments accrued for customer RSN fees. Excluding the impact of accrued customer RSN fee adjustments, Cable Communications revenue would have risen by 1.4% with no corresponding impact to EBITDA. We generated 217,000 customer relationship net additions in the quarter, a 43% increase year-over-year and the best second quarter on record with strength driven by our high-margin connectivity businesses. Together, residential high-speed Internet and business services generated 323,000 broadband customer net additions, which excludes over 600,000 additional high-risk or free Internet essentials customers that still receive our services and marks the best second quarter result in 13 years. High-speed Internet revenue increased 7.2% to $5 billion. Excluding the impact of accrued RSN fee adjustments for the customers taking bundled services, high-speed Internet revenue would have been up close to 9%. Business services revenue grew 3.6% to $2 billion despite a 24,000 net loss in customer relationships this quarter, which was within our expectations of the impact from COVID-19. Turning to video; revenue declined 3.2% to $5.4 billion, with higher rates more than offset by a 477,000 loss in video subscribers. Excluding accrued RSN fee adjustments, video revenue would have declined by 1.2% and video ARPU would have grown by 4.1% year-over-year. Wireless revenue increased 33.9% to $326 million driven by 126,000 additional lines, resulting in 2.4 million total lines as of quarter end. These results reflect the significant impact of our decision to close the majority of our retail stores during the second quarter in the interest of keeping our customers and employees safe. Advertising revenue decreased 30% to $428 million, reflecting reduced advertiser spend due to COVID-19. Turning to expenses; Cable Communications second quarter expenses decreased 4%, with programming expenses down 5% primarily as a result of the accrued RSN fee adjustment. Without these adjustments, programming expenses would have increased by 1.5%. Non-programming expenses declined 3.4% due to a slowdown in business activity directly resulting from COVID in addition to the implementation of longer-term cost efficiencies. Cable Communications EBITDA grew by 5.5% and margin reached 42.8%, reflecting 230 basis points of year-over-year improvement. While accrued RSN fee adjustments had no impact on EBITDA, they did impact our margins. Excluding the impact of accrued RSN fee adjustments, margins would have expanded by 170 basis points year-over-year. Cable capital expenditures decreased 8.9%, resulting in CapEx intensity of 10.1%, an improvement of 90 basis points year-over-year driven by lower spending on customer premise equipment, partially offset by higher spending on scalable infrastructure, which continues to increase due to our ongoing investment in the network. I'll now touch a bit on what we're seeing so far in the third quarter. We are very pleased that residential high-speed data net adds are off to a solid start in July. We expect residential high-speed Internet revenue growth to accelerate from that of the second quarter as we benefit from the high subscriber contribution we experienced in the first half of the year, combined with a lesser impact from our proactive response to COVID-19. While we anticipate third quarter business services revenue growth will moderate as a result of the subscriber losses we experienced in the second quarter, we are already seeing sequential albeit modest improvement in net additions. On the video side, we expect subscriber net losses in the third quarter to be somewhat similar to what we saw in the second quarter resulting primarily from lower connects due to a combination of several factors, such as the lingering effects of the rate increases we took at the beginning of this year, the overall economic pressures resulting from COVID-19 and our limited ability to perform in-home installations. Turning to our outlook for expenses and margins; for programming costs, we continue to expect underlying increases in the second half of 2020 as a result of anticipated programming renewals, which will be somewhat offset by potential additional RSN fee adjustments in the third quarter. I remind you that accrued RSN fee adjustments should have no impact on our overall EBITDA results. For non-programming costs, we expect year-over-year declines to moderate in the second half of the year as business activity starts to pick up. Given our first half results, combined with our outlook for the back half of this year, we now expect full year cable EBITDA margins to improve by up to 100 basis points year-over-year versus our prior guidance of up to 50 basis points of year-over-year improvement. We also expect our full year CapEx intensity to improve by up to 100 basis points year-over-year versus our prior guidance of approximately 50 basis points of improvement. Now I'll turn to NBCUniversal's results on slide six. Revenue for the second quarter declined 25.4% to $6.1 billion, while EBITDA was down 29.5% to $1.6 billion. Cable Networks revenue was down 15% to $2.5 billion as a 15% decline in distribution revenue and a 27% decline in advertising revenue was somewhat offset by a 23% increase in content licensing and other, which includes transactions with Peacock. Distribution revenue was adversely impacted by accrued RSN fee adjustments. Without such adjustments, distribution revenue would have declined in the low-single-digit range. Second quarter Cable Networks EBITDA grew 3.5% primarily due to the shift of sports rights amortization costs into the third quarter. Turning to Broadcast; revenue declined 1.6% to $2.4 billion as the 28% decline in advertising revenue more than offset the 9.2% growth in distribution and other, which was driven by re-trans, and the 59% growth in content licensing, which again includes transactions with Peacock. Second quarter Broadcast EBITDA grew 20% as declines across the majority of our cost base related to the general slowdown in business activity and specific savings initiatives were able to fully offset the lower revenue. Film revenue in the second quarter declined 18% due to the closure of theaters and cinemas throughout the pandemic, which was partially offset by about 20% growth in content licensing due to the success of our PVOD titles. Film EBITDA for the quarter grew 25% primarily due to lower advertising, marketing and promotion expense. Theme parks generated revenue of $87 million and an EBITDA loss of $399 million. Late in the quarter, both Universal Orlando Resort and Universal Studios Japan reopened with the appropriate safety protocols and associated attendance restrictions, while Universal Studios Hollywood remains closed. Now let's move to Sky results on slide seven. As a reminder, I will be referring to Sky's growth rates on a constant currency basis, consistent with what's reflected in our earnings release. For the second quarter, Sky revenue decreased 12.9% to $4.1 billion, while EBITDA was relatively flat at $749 million. As expected, our results were impacted by the postponement of a significant number of sporting events. This postponement was the primary driver of the 6.7% decline in direct-to-consumer revenue and a 36% decline in content revenue. Additionally, the lack of sports on the air contributed to the 41% decline in advertising revenue, which was also impacted by a weak macro environment as well as the change in legislation relating to gambling advertisement in the U.K. and Italy, which we will begin to lap in the third quarter. Looking ahead, customer trends are improving as home installation activity has restarted and sports have returned. And as Jeremy mentioned, we were able to successfully retain the vast majority of our total customer base, including those who take sports. That said, we continue to monitor the overall linear TV advertising market in our pubs and club sector, which are likely to remain under pressure for the remainder of this year. We continue to experience a shifting of sporting events, both football and non-football, that it's likely to create near-term volatility in our quarterly results particularly on the cost side. While we expect revenue declines to moderate as we move through the year, sports rights amortization will be highest in quarters that air the most events. Given a slightly later return of European football than we originally expected and the shift of other sports programming later into the year, we now expect that the majority of the expense impact will occur over the next two quarters. Importantly, we were able to secure rebates related to this disruption to our sports programming, which we will benefit from over several years. We have also resumed the investment activity that had paused as a result of COVID-19, such as acceleration of Sky Q, the launch of broadband in Italy, and expansion of our Sky entertainment channels. Based on our current visibility, we now expect Sky EBITDA for the third and fourth quarters combined to decline roughly 60% year-over-year with a more significant decline in the fourth quarter. Wrapping up on slide eight with free cash flow and capital allocation; free cash flow was $6 billion in the quarter, an increase of 40.5% or $1.7 billion. The year-over-year comparison is affected by the COVID-19-related delay in tax payments from the second quarter to the third quarter of 2020. Consolidated total capital, which includes CapEx as well as software and intangibles, decreased 4.2% in the second quarter to $2.7 billion primarily driven by declines at cable as well as at NBCU. Finally, we continue to remain committed to our long-standing balanced capital allocation approach of maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing organically for profitable growth and returning capital to shareholders through a strong commitment to our recurring dividend and eventual return to share repurchases. With that, I'll turn it back to Marci, who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Mike. Dorothy, let's open up the call for Q&A, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Good morning, thanks for all the color this morning, very helpful. Two questions. Dave, you talked about more than just speed being a driver for the data success. So I wanted to ask particularly about Flex because it's sort of an interesting product that leverages both your investments in connectivity and video. What is that product doing in the market today? Anything you could share with us? What does that business look like to you over the course of time? What's sort of the road map to make that a more substantial driver of the overall business? And then, for Jeff. What are the implications of this premium video-on-demand agreement with AMC? And what I mean by that is, obviously, it's helpful during the COVID period to have this flexibility. But is this a big benefit to the film business in NBC long term? And do you need more than just the U.S. and AMC to make it to maximize the benefits?\nDave Watson: Ben, this is Dave. I'll start off and then hand it over to Jeff. So as you said, the broadband we think we've redefined what great broadband is, and it goes beyond speed. And it's helped our momentum, I think, quite a bit. For many quarters now, we've grown. And as everything has changed here the fundamentals, I think, of this repositioning of the category that hasn't changed. So we're the market is growing. We're taking share across the board. And in addition to speed, we're very focused on coverage, control, and as you said, now with streaming and Flex. So we made it simple, a very straightforward value proposition with Flex included with the broadband relationship. And we're using it, again, to remind everyone, in a targeted basis to go after the streaming segment. But we're not bashful about leading with it to this segment. So it is very much part of the broadband experience. And it's still early, but as I said in my earlier comments that it really does it's a result of the innovation around X1, with all the capability: the voice for remote, the metadata integration that takes all of these different apps and combines them and makes it easier for the consumer. So it's early, so we're not giving out the specifics in terms of the actual monthly users, but I would tell you, it's very encouraging. Customer feedback just in terms of the experience has been really strong. And so we look at this as a very broad platform that helps this particular segment as we segment the different base. So I think it's a catalyst for broadband. We designed it to, I think, help broadband retention. Early results point towards that. And we do think the way that we define success over time will be engaged Flex users, people that are just on it and using it. And for those customers that are very active, the consumption is very good on this platform and will act as a substantial offset to some of the video losses. So we're real pleased with the start of Flex. More to come over time.\nJeff Shell: Thanks, Dave. Let me jump in on the question on the AMC deal, Ben. So a couple of implications. I think long term, the we've always believed that there is a segment of the population out there going, and there's a segment of the population out there that just doesn't go to movie theaters. And this structure with AMC allows us to take advantage of people who do go to movie theaters, 17 days of exclusivity at minimum for theaters. But very soon after in the same marketing window, we can tap into that very large audience that doesn't go to movie theaters and right now is just going to SVOD to watch movies. So and that's within the kind of the marketing window of the giant marketing we spend traditionally on movies that go to theatrical. So we think the structure allows us to tap into that incremental revenue stream, allowing AMC to share in a little bit and other exhibitors, and at the same time, preserve that theatrical window, which is so critical to the film business. As you mentioned, it's U.S. only, although we have a deal with AMC to look into other international territories. And obviously, this is going to be a territory. We had territory type of look at this. We still need theatrical and need different business models in other markets. Shorter term, one of the implications of this, I'm hoping, is that we currently are stuck in a bit of a chicken-and-the-egg situation in the theatrical business, where movie studios like ours don't want to release movies into theaters when we will have only a smattering of theaters open. We need a pretty robust amount of theaters open to justify our spend. But the booth side exhibitors can't open a bunch of theaters that they don't have any new movies to put in. Old library movies are not going to drive people to movie theaters. So we think this model will actually allow movies to come back to theaters when it's safe a lot more quickly than they would have in the current environment. So those are just some implications.\nBrian Roberts: I just want to add one thing. This is Brian. But I think you were touching on, obviously, a critical set of subjects here. The company is really trying to lean into streaming. And we are, I think, somewhat uniquely positioned to do this in ways different. Obviously, we're a very EBITDA-focused company, and there are other ways to build new businesses and enhance our strong cash flows. And so if you look at what you just heard, Flex is all about helping broadband, but we've been able to put Peacock as a very important part of it. Now we're going to have more streaming of films. We use NOW TV, a technology from Sky and they're already streaming relationships. So we want to remain relevant to customers so that user interface, part of the answer on Flex, allows you to stream across many properties that aren't Comcast content or NBCUniversal or Sky content. It's, we think, the best interface around. And that same team is part of that team is helping build Peacock with Matt Strauss and other people. So I'm pretty excited that as the world is transitioning, broadband is the center of making a lot of that possible. And now we can bolt on a whole bunch of content and interfaces and hopefully do that in a way that customers really enjoy, and that's what's been happening so far.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thanks, Brian.\nMarci Ryvicker: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. A question for Dave and Jeff as well. Dave, on the 600,000 subscribers that were at risk or free Internet and essential customers. I'm trying to understand how much of that was 2Q activity versus that bucket at the end of March already having some customers in it, because it certainly looked like a strong 2Q quarter, and maybe it was even stronger if a lot of that 600,000 was potential 2Q activity. And then for Jeff, I wanted to follow up further on PVOD. Obviously, a hot topic today. Does a new, more attractive business model for Universal, if you're able to get the rest of the theater companies on board, mean you'll make more movies for theatrical release or just make more money on the same number of movies that you're releasing and sort of lock in your business model and your incentive to invest what you invest in movies? And any further thoughts on the 17-day window? I think that's what surprised a lot of folks. I think a lot of us were focused on a 30-day window. Are you confident that the theater business will be healthy enough to provide your movies, particularly your blockbusters, enough distribution in the future given the risk on a 17-day window pushing a lot of movie viewing to in-home?\nDave Watson: Doug, Dave. I'll start and hand it over to Jeff. So the 600,000 customers reflects a combination of free Internet essentials customers and a reserve that we set up for the high-risk customers that are in a non-pay status but are still receiving service. So there to answer your question, there was some of that happened in Q1. It rolled into Q2 and probably a bit more in Q2 than Q1 for sure. And to clarify what we said and Mike said earlier in the remarks, we're only going to count these customers when they convert to paying status. So we have a very good operational plan. We're going to constantly work with customers throughout, including these customers. So it's early to predict the conversion rate, but that's just a little bit more perspective on that base.\nMike Cavanagh: It's Mike. I'll just jump in, Doug. I think that number, the 600, was, call it roughly 1/3 the size at the beginning of the quarter.\nJeff Shell: Let me jump in. This is Jeff. Yes, let me jump in on PVOD, Doug. So what was happening to the movies, movies are obviously critical across our whole distribution channel. Movie consumption on Peacock, for example, has been higher than we thought it would be and really across all of our platforms. So as things transition, as Brian talked about, the streaming movies are life. But the problem is that over the last couple of years, it's been more increasingly difficult to generate the same returns over the first couple of windows, and that has put a lot of pressure on our model. So I we believe that this new model in the U.S. and hopefully other places will restore some of those economics for us to allow us to probably not make more movies but to keep our production levels the same as they've been in the past. While at the same time remember, AMC and hopefully other exhibitors will be sharing in the new revenue stream, which will hopefully keep their business a little healthier because they're under a lot of stress right now. And on the 17 days, that is 17 days is means the Monday after the third weekend is when movies will be available on PVOD at a minimum. It's important to remember that, that's a minimum. So I fully anticipate some movies will stay in theaters exclusively a lot longer than 17 days if we're having a good theatrical run. And some movies, for example, King of Staten Island with Judd Apatow is a perfect example of the kind of movie that can thrive in this kind of model because it would do well theatrically. But for most people, watching it at home is another option, and that would be a movie that 17 days, probably a normal time, would be the right period of time. So 17 days is just the minimum, and we can toggle that based on the type of movie.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Doug. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Securities.\nJessica Reif: Thank you. If I could, for Jeff, Jeremy and maybe Brian. So Jeff, with Peacock successfully launching without the Olympics, can you talk about how you guys will how you will use the Olympics next year to help Peacock? On the AMC deal, just one last question. How does that change the longer-term windowing for films? Like when will they come to Peacock? And do you have any change in the losses of $2 billion over the first two years? And then moving on to Jeremy. You mentioned TV production plans. There seems like there's been a lot of activity at Sky. Can you just talk about kind of your longer term goals? And do you need to buy, or can you just build it internally? And finally, Brian, sorry for some of the questions, but organizational changes were mentioned in two of your three divisions. Is there anything that you think you need from a corporate perspective? Any areas that you need to pivot in the business? COVID-19 seems to be a great time to just look strategically about where the business should go over the longer term and how you can change it.\nJeff Shell: Jessica, this is Jeff. I'll start and maybe hand it over. So the Olympics right now is a bit of a bummer because we would be in Tokyo right now under normal circumstances. So it's a total bummer for our company that we don't have the Olympics right now. But for Peacock, it's a bit of a silver lining for next year. And you got to remember, not only will we have the Olympics in the summer of 2021 in Tokyo, but then we'll have the Winter Olympics seven months later in Beijing. So we have two Olympics. And Mark Lazarus and the people back in their team are currently working on lots of different things that we can do to innovate on those Olympics and use the Peacock product, which by then will be even more distributed to do some really innovative and cool things on the Olympics, so in addition to promoting it, obviously. So, I actually am very excited. And I think with Peacock's successful launch this year without the Olympics, having the Olympics back-to-back next year and early '22 is really great for Peacock. Just on your other question on Peacock. We don't anticipate, whether Peacock or otherwise, windows changing down the line after this kind of theatrical PVOD window. And I think that the Peacock losses that I think Mike has outlined in the previous earnings call are were right exactly within that range. So we don't anticipate anything different in the next two years. Over to Dave or Jeremy now.\nJeremy Darroch: Yes, I'll keep in. So Jessica, yes, in terms of TV production, if you if you talk to a typical Sky customer, he will tell you three things. They'll say, \"I'll rely on Sky to make all the free content that's available in Europe just better than anywhere else and just make that whole experience better,\" which is what we do. \"the second thing I'll rely on Sky to do is to scour the world, get more than their fair share of the very best content internationally and bring that to me. And then thirdly, and this is becoming more and more important, \"I want Sky to create unique European content and stories that's unique to my market or to Europe and to make that exclusive to its own platform.\" That's what they get Sky for. And sometimes that can be local sport. But increasingly, it's now becoming our own produced local entertainment, which is why we think Sky Studios is so important. And of course, from a business model point of view, we can play tunes on that or we can decide relatively where we shift investment over time to optimize both the customer experience but also our financial returns. So I'm very confident we've got all the capabilities required to build that ourselves. I think being part of the group and being alongside NBCU and Jeff's team really caught the bottoms up, and we're starting to accelerate how we work together. But I think we've got all of the factors of production in place, and we'll just intend to do more. Over time, as we start to pivot away from other content, we'll invest more in our own originated content, but that will be financially enhancing as we do that.\nBrian Roberts: Okay. And finally on that question, I'm really pleased with, first of all, Mike's leadership during this and the team that reports to him and many others at corporate for how well we've handled all the uncertainties. And our balance sheet strength and liquidity are really, really speak for themselves, and I'm very satisfied there. I think the restructuring that you're hearing about is about the businesses, as Jeff and Jeremy both talked about. I think to reinforce how well our broadband business is performing and the cable company, we're always looking at can we reduce expenses and can we be more efficient in how we run the company. That's definitely always top of mind, but I think we have all the parts. I think we're taking advantage of this transition. Some parts of it are uncomfortable, for sure. But for the most part, our company is getting better. And I think, going to be one of the emerges one of the winners of the New Age. And a lot of that is giving customers more flexibility to do and see what they want. And as Jeremy just said, this is happening all over the world. And I'm really pleased with how well it's been put together. And we wanted everybody on this call to hear even more detail from the three operating businesses so you can see how well they're working together and how they're tackling the challenges ahead at corporate. We're helping create the environment for that to happen. I hope that answers your question.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Jessica. The next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Moffett from Moffett.\nCraig Moffett: All right, thank you. Two questions, if I could, both on the cable side. First, I'm sure you saw that Charter announced that they would participate in the RDOF auctions. I wonder if you could just talk about is there any appeal to you of participating in the either the RDOF auctions as a way to expand your rural footprint or simply just doing more edge out to grow your subscriber base or your footprint faster? And then second, I wonder, would you just drill in a bit to the Business Services segment and share with us some of what's going on with respect to volumes? And in particular, are the is the - what's going on with respect to customer bankruptcies versus fewer new share gains? And then what's going on with pricing? Just to get a sense of the Commercial segment and what we have to look forward to.\nDave Watson: Craig, Dave here. So I think as people know, we decided not to participate in this round of the rural digital opportunity fund. And the main reason was in this round, there are relatively few adjacent rural areas to offset the additional regulatory costs associated with the auction, including submitting to ETC status in any states where bids are successful. So however, at the same time, we continue to pursue, as you mentioned, the edge expansion to new areas. If you go back and you look at expansion, which includes edge extensions but also areas of pockets within our footprint, we've increased more than two million passings. And so that's resulted in it's helping us with customer relationship growth and a number of things. So we're very focused on the logical, efficient expansions. We'll continue to address opportunities in rural as they come up over time. So in Business Services, yes, switching gears there, we are seeing encouraging trends, as mentioned earlier, and small business, particularly in the states that have reopened. The customer losses that we incurred in Q2 were absolutely within our expectations. And the good news is that the level of losses has moderated and connects are rebounding. So it's a overall, we are encouraged with the current activity. And when you break it down a little bit further and you look at, well, what segments within SMB are impacted, you have bars and restaurants that were part of the mix, but they're not the majority, not close to the majority. We have a very Bill Stemper and his team have done a really nice job over the years, building a robust, diverse, small business customer base. So as people come back, I think we're really well positioned. We have local operations, the region level, that are ready to help our clients out. And so we'll cut across the board. So it's we're still the challenger. As I said before, we're going to help customers when they come back. And again, that connect level of activity is what we're focused on. And we do think, just to clarify, that the subscriber losses that we incurred during the second quarter will have a more meaningful impact on the financials as we move to the back half of the year. And as Mike mentioned earlier, revenue is likely to moderate a little bit from the growth we saw in Q2. But we're really pleased with the rebound in connects.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks. Craig. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nPhil Cusick: Hi guys. Thanks, Mike. Mike, can you talk more about how we should think about sports and RSN amortization in the third quarter across the business, including why the RSN holdbacks impacted broadband ARPU? We've had some questions here. And you mentioned 3Q as well. Why shouldn't all that flow back in the third quarter? And then for Peacock, can you put the 10 million subs into contacts? What does that mean for MAUs? And how should we think about licensing in broadcast and cable nets going forward as it relates to Peacock?\nMike Cavanagh: I'll start, then the others can just chime in. So I'll take the sports in two different pieces. Just on the RSN impact, so we expect that we'll be getting some monies back from some of the sports leagues based on games played or not played in the U.S. And when that does happen, we as we've said, we'll pass that back along to customers. So we've accrued for that on the revenue line, not billing people, and we'll get that back on the expense line. But I think the question that's coming in is why does that affect high-speed data revenue growth rates, which we said adjusted for that are up 9% versus the printed number. And that's simply accounting revenue recognition rules that when you have products sold in a bundle, there's a formula relative to sort of list price that has to flow through into revenue attribution. I don't love it, but it's the rules we live by consistently. So the fact that we have some RSN rebates coming is what's driving that. So hopefully, we can take that off-line for anybody that wants more details on that. But that's simply a revenue recognition item. And then on sports amortization. As we said in both NBC and Sky, both impacted by recognizing sports rights amortization expense when events or games are played. And so in the case of Sky, the start of the games and the proportion of games pushed a little bit back into the third and fourth quarter relative to what we expected 90 days ago, and some of the new season games will spill into 2021, against which, we have a little bit of rebate expense. But that's the reason for the combined down 60% for Sky EBITDA in the third and fourth quarter is really the movement of football. But then you think about golf and Formula one and all the other events. It's going to be a packed third and fourth quarter, so expense will follow that. And basically, the same is true for NBC. And then on Peacock, I'll let Jeff comment further. But as you said, we're encouraged by the number of people we have, in my language, giving Peacock a try or taste. I mean the way we'll measure users over the long term is monthly active users. So these are sign-ups. So in due course, we'll start giving you some color on the activation side. But I think pretty much against every measure that we look at, sign-ups, usage, etcetera, it's running ahead of what we had hoped for in early days.\nJeff Shell: Yes, Phil. Yes, yes. So thanks, Mike. I don't have anything to add on the RSN side. On the Peacock side, Phil, it's confusing because it's different in the ad-supported world obviously than the SVOD world. And there's really three different metrics: there's sign-ups, there's monthly active accounts, and there's monthly active users. I have seen people use all of them. Monthly active account is obviously household, whereas users, sometimes there's more than one user per household. The guidance we gave at the Investor Day was monthly active accounts, MAAs. And the 10 million we're talking about today is sign-ups. And the way sign-ups kind of convert to MAAs is how many people come back and how long do they use it? And since a lot of our users are in the last couple of weeks, as we've rolled out nationally, it's too early to actually convert that, but as Mike said, across the board were better than expectations. We didn't expect these many sign-ups. We didn't expect people to come back as frequently as they're coming back. And we didn't expect people to watch as long as they're watching once they come back. So we're very encouraged. It's early days, but we're very encouraged as we look forward on our Investor Day guidance.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks. Thanks Phil. Next question please.\nOperator: Our final question comes from John Hodulik from UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Great, thanks guys. Great. Maybe first for Dave on the cable margin side. Obviously, great leverage on the non-programming costs. It sounds like there's some cross currents there related to COVID. Should we expect some of the benefits that you've seen to continue and maybe even some acceleration as you get some of those efficiencies that you talked about? And then maybe over to Flex. You guys obviously talked about adding Sling TV to the package there. Do you still plan to add other virtual MVPDs? And given that's the cost or price differential versus the traditional product, do you expect over time that the availability of these services to add pressure to the traditional video product?\nDave Watson: John, so on the margin side, the non-programming OpEx, we're really the fundamentals have not shifted. There has been an acceleration, for sure, during the COVID period and where there's just a lot of different approaches towards digital and things like self-installed kit, the tools that we're using that are going to, I think, be long-lasting for us. We've learned it a lot. Our field teams have done an extraordinary job in terms of the deployment of the new protocols and the approaches. So I think what we're seeing an ongoing, we saw it before COVID, reduction and reduction in transactional activity as we started digital some time ago. And so this is an acceleration of all of that. So we're going to continue to prioritize the network and key innovation efforts around digital. So I think that in terms of how you look at margin, I think there's still upside. And so we see a moment in time where there's an acceleration. You can't comment completely on the future exactly where that will go. But I think the learnings will serve us well, and we're just going to keep at it. And as much noise that we could take out of the system and just taking out unnecessary transactions, I think that is one of the fundamental keys that are is toward margin. In regards to the second point on Flex and Sling, let me again remind you and everyone that Flex, in and of itself, again comes with broadband. We're going after the streaming segment. We use it in a targeted way to go after these customers. So I think there's a fair amount of activity that the streaming segment has, that they're looking at a bunch of options. We want to give customers more choice. And so our goal is to provide the best video experience. I think we are uniquely positioned to participate, as Brian said, in the streaming world. Great broadband with Peacock but others like Sling and that I think that this is the first one. We'll evaluate on a case-by-case basis the other virtual operators, and we'll see how that goes. But we're going to continue to be clear to we're going to invest in X1. We look at X1 and Flex as a very broad video platform that for today, I think, helps us compete, as I said, with certain video segments with X1, and most certainly, the streaming segment with broadband and Flex and partners like Sling and many others. We've added Hulu. We've added a whole bunch of people. We look forward to adding CBS All Access, HBO Max later that we talked about. So we're going to have a wide variety of partners that will be on Flex and X1. And for us, yes, we're going to break down the segments, and they'll be very focused on providing the best video and broadband platform experience in the market.\nBrian Roberts: I just want to just add that I hope you've enjoyed the format of this call, particularly at this time. We wanted to talk about not only the 90 days but really how we're running the company. I couldn't be more pleased with the team and the progress. And we're also things we didn't touch on were some of our social commitments. There's a lot of just quality to thought that has gone into how do you handle pandemics such as this and how do you position the company for the future and try to do the right thing in the moment. So thanks for your support and the questions, and we're available to do follow-up. Marci, back to you.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, everyone. That concludes our second quarter 2020 earnings call. Thank you for joining us, and we wish you all well.\nBrian Roberts: Thanks.\nOperator: There will be a replay of today's call starting at 12:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time. It will run through Thursday, August 6, at midnight Eastern Time. The dial-in number is (855) 859-2056, and the conference ID number is 5765399. A recording of the conference call will also be available on the company's website beginning at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Standard Time today. This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for participating. You may now all disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeff Shell",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave. The effect of the pandemic have obviously influenced every single business at NBCUniversal, but given the circumstances, I'm pleased with our results for the second quarter. At the moment, NBCUniversal is really the tale of three cities, with parks, film and television all facing very different and unique challenges. Let me briefly comment on H1. Starting with theme parks, where the financial impact has been the most significant and immediate and the operational challenge is the most daunting. As you know, by March, we had shut down all of our theme parks along with the construction of our theme park in Beijing a month earlier. Our talented team, working with local government authorities, have been working hard to get us back open. We were able to resume construction in Beijing in April, and remarkably, we remain on budget and on track to open in mid-2021. In Florida, we opened in early June with industry-leading protocols in place at significantly reduced capacity. And in Japan, we opened with similar protocols and capacity a few days later. While attendance in both locations is much lower than our typical summer levels, we are still doing better financially than if we were closed. And even more importantly, our guest satisfaction scores are at record highs. Unfortunately, a park here in California remains closed with no time table at the moment to reopen. As is typical in past downturns, the road back will be gradual and bumpy, but I'm confident that this business will return to its historical levels of financial performance. In the meantime, we are continually adjusting our cost base and capital spend, including pausing development of our Epic Universe project in Florida, for example, until the future becomes more certain. Now let me turn to our film business. In some ways, the film business has been impacted as dramatically as our theme park business as we completely shut down production and stopped releasing films in March. Due to the timing of revenue and expenses in the film business, however, the financial effects are not as immediate. In fact, since we are not spending as much money on production or marketing and continue to enjoy revenues from past years' slates, the immediate financial impact is actually positive. But obviously, making and releasing films is our lifeblood, so it's anything but positive, and the negative financial effects will be felt in coming years, particularly 2021. Fortunately, our strong management team in film has been pioneers in getting our production up and running again. We started several films, including Jurassic World in the U.K. in the past few weeks and continue full steam ahead on our important animation slate. And of course, they've also been pioneers in pursuing new distribution models. Our release of Trolls World Tour and King of Staten Island and other titles on premium video-on-demand exceeded our expectations and had a significant positive impact in the quarter and led to our groundbreaking partnership that we signed with AMC earlier this week. We've always believed that PVOD can be a complement rather than a replacement for a robust theatrical release. And I commend Adam Aron at AMC for his vision that together, we can build a new, more attractive business model for us both. Finally, let me spend a few minutes on our television and streaming businesses. As you can see in our results, even though scripted television production ceased in March similar to film, our talented alternative and late night teams have continued to find ways of getting us fresh content. While the advertising market was hit hard, it is coming back more rapidly than we anticipated, and the upfront is now in full swing. We believe we can get our scripted production going again later this summer, and when combined with sports that are returning, we will have a full schedule of fresh and compelling programming on our various platforms in the fall. Our news group, now under the leadership of Cesar Conde, has been a real source of pride for us in the past few months. Our networks, not just NBC, MSNBC and CNBC but also Telemundo and our local stations, have not only generated strong ratings but have provided a critical lifeline to our viewers isolated at home. I want to thank our brave journalists who report from the office and out in the field. Finally, it is said that prices fees tend to accelerate and exacerbate trends that are already happening. And that is certainly true in the television business, where viewership is rapidly shifting from linear to nonlinear. A few months ago, we combined our television and streaming businesses under Mark Lazarus, which will allow us to more rapidly shift our resources and investment from linear to streaming. Mark is finalizing a new structure that will demonstrate the unique way we intend to manage this business going forward. We will announce the structure soon. The most important development for NBCUniversal in the second quarter was our launch of Peacock, and we could not be more pleased. We launched it in Comcast homes back in April and nationwide two weeks ago, and we have already surpassed 10 million sign-ups. Not only are more people signing up than we projected, but they are watching more frequently and engaging much longer than we projected. The technology has worked seamlessly, and the service is improving on a daily basis. With much of our strong programming coming in January, including the exclusive rights to The Office, we feel very encouraged. So I obviously didn't expect my first six months on the job to be anything like this, with basically the whole company working from home and large parts of our business not operating. But if there is a silver lining, it has been in the performance of our talented leadership team who, from the beginning, made the difficult and bold decisions required by this unprecedented time. As a result of their work, I'm confident we will come out the other side of this, positioned very strongly. Now let me turn it over to Jeremy. Thanks, Dave. Let me jump in on the question on the AMC deal, Ben. So a couple of implications. I think long term, the we've always believed that there is a segment of the population out there going, and there's a segment of the population out there that just doesn't go to movie theaters. And this structure with AMC allows us to take advantage of people who do go to movie theaters, 17 days of exclusivity at minimum for theaters. But very soon after in the same marketing window, we can tap into that very large audience that doesn't go to movie theaters and right now is just going to SVOD to watch movies. So and that's within the kind of the marketing window of the giant marketing we spend traditionally on movies that go to theatrical. So we think the structure allows us to tap into that incremental revenue stream, allowing AMC to share in a little bit and other exhibitors, and at the same time, preserve that theatrical window, which is so critical to the film business. As you mentioned, it's U.S. only, although we have a deal with AMC to look into other international territories. And obviously, this is going to be a territory. We had territory type of look at this. We still need theatrical and need different business models in other markets. Shorter term, one of the implications of this, I'm hoping, is that we currently are stuck in a bit of a chicken-and-the-egg situation in the theatrical business, where movie studios like ours don't want to release movies into theaters when we will have only a smattering of theaters open. We need a pretty robust amount of theaters open to justify our spend. But the booth side exhibitors can't open a bunch of theaters that they don't have any new movies to put in. Old library movies are not going to drive people to movie theaters. So we think this model will actually allow movies to come back to theaters when it's safe a lot more quickly than they would have in the current environment. So those are just some implications. Let me jump in. This is Jeff. Yes, let me jump in on PVOD, Doug. So what was happening to the movies, movies are obviously critical across our whole distribution channel. Movie consumption on Peacock, for example, has been higher than we thought it would be and really across all of our platforms. So as things transition, as Brian talked about, the streaming movies are life. But the problem is that over the last couple of years, it's been more increasingly difficult to generate the same returns over the first couple of windows, and that has put a lot of pressure on our model. So I we believe that this new model in the U.S. and hopefully other places will restore some of those economics for us to allow us to probably not make more movies but to keep our production levels the same as they've been in the past. While at the same time remember, AMC and hopefully other exhibitors will be sharing in the new revenue stream, which will hopefully keep their business a little healthier because they're under a lot of stress right now. And on the 17 days, that is 17 days is means the Monday after the third weekend is when movies will be available on PVOD at a minimum. It's important to remember that, that's a minimum. So I fully anticipate some movies will stay in theaters exclusively a lot longer than 17 days if we're having a good theatrical run. And some movies, for example, King of Staten Island with Judd Apatow is a perfect example of the kind of movie that can thrive in this kind of model because it would do well theatrically. But for most people, watching it at home is another option, and that would be a movie that 17 days, probably a normal time, would be the right period of time. So 17 days is just the minimum, and we can toggle that based on the type of movie. Jessica, this is Jeff. I'll start and maybe hand it over. So the Olympics right now is a bit of a bummer because we would be in Tokyo right now under normal circumstances. So it's a total bummer for our company that we don't have the Olympics right now. But for Peacock, it's a bit of a silver lining for next year. And you got to remember, not only will we have the Olympics in the summer of 2021 in Tokyo, but then we'll have the Winter Olympics seven months later in Beijing. So we have two Olympics. And Mark Lazarus and the people back in their team are currently working on lots of different things that we can do to innovate on those Olympics and use the Peacock product, which by then will be even more distributed to do some really innovative and cool things on the Olympics, so in addition to promoting it, obviously. So, I actually am very excited. And I think with Peacock's successful launch this year without the Olympics, having the Olympics back-to-back next year and early '22 is really great for Peacock. Just on your other question on Peacock. We don't anticipate, whether Peacock or otherwise, windows changing down the line after this kind of theatrical PVOD window. And I think that the Peacock losses that I think Mike has outlined in the previous earnings call are were right exactly within that range. So we don't anticipate anything different in the next two years. Over to Dave or Jeremy now. Yes, Phil. Yes, yes. So thanks, Mike. I don't have anything to add on the RSN side. On the Peacock side, Phil, it's confusing because it's different in the ad-supported world obviously than the SVOD world. And there's really three different metrics: there's sign-ups, there's monthly active accounts, and there's monthly active users. I have seen people use all of them. Monthly active account is obviously household, whereas users, sometimes there's more than one user per household. The guidance we gave at the Investor Day was monthly active accounts, MAAs. And the 10 million we're talking about today is sign-ups. And the way sign-ups kind of convert to MAAs is how many people come back and how long do they use it? And since a lot of our users are in the last couple of weeks, as we've rolled out nationally, it's too early to actually convert that, but as Mike said, across the board were better than expectations. We didn't expect these many sign-ups. We didn't expect people to come back as frequently as they're coming back. And we didn't expect people to watch as long as they're watching once they come back. So we're very encouraged. It's early days, but we're very encouraged as we look forward on our Investor Day guidance."

            "name": "Brian Roberts",
            "content": "Thanks, Marci. I'd like to start by wishing all of you well, and I hope that you are safe and settled in for what feels like a new normal, at least for the balance of this year. While none of us has a perfect crystal ball and we don't know the path this virus might take, I could really not be prouder of how our teams across Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal and Sky are together managing our business. The response has been extraordinarily fast and effective. Our products and brands continue to resonate strongly with our customers across all segments and all geographies. This, combined with the unwavering efforts of our employees, produce second quarter financials that highlight the strength and resilience of our company. It starts with Xfinity, the core of the company, whose fantastic results continue to be fueled by our best-in-class broadband business, which experienced record low churn for yet another quarter while connects remained healthy. The consistency of these results confirm that our strategy and corresponding investments are working. We offer differentiated products and services and a fantastic customer experience, all of which we are delivering even more efficiently. Considering that NBCU and Sky are facing certain pressures that are momentary and unique to some of their businesses, I think we are performing incredibly well. Despite theme park and theater closures and most sports having been paused, we continue to transact. And more importantly, we are innovating as we position these businesses for continued market leadership and the return to strong long-term growth. From a broader perspective, Comcast is truly in an enviable position. We have an amazing portfolio of companies that are each successfully taking advantage of the evolving ecosystem, and together, creating complementary capability, technology platform and a global footprint. All of this is led by our extremely flexible and robust broadband network, which is the foundation of our connectivity-centric relationship with residential/commercial customers and heavily supports our other services, including video aggregation and mobile. With NBCU and Sky, we have some of the most valuable global content, whether it's news, entertainment or sports. And we are leaning into streaming. This starts with what is now our valuable 1/3 ownership position in Hulu and is enhanced with Peacock, our own ad-supported service whose nationwide launch earlier this month exceeded our high expectations. In fact, as of today, we already have 10 million sign-ups. With these and many other drivers of growth, I am so excited about where we are headed. While our second quarter results were better than we previously forecasted, the reality is they only represent a 90-day snapshot. In the months ahead, there's going to be a lot of noise, if you will, in the quarterly numbers, which will not be unique to Comcast. As usual, we will continue to be transparent so as to help you navigate the near-term complexities of our business. But we also want to provide a deeper understanding into what I believe is the underlying strength of our company and how we're managing each business for the long term beyond the effects of COVID. For that reason, we have changed the format of this call and have asked Dave, Jeff and Jeremy to comment in more detail about their plans for the future, specifically how they intend to tackle both the different challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. They will then be followed by Mike, who will take you through our second quarter results. As you'll hear, we're playing offense, working together like never before and using our combined capabilities, our scale, our brands, our talent, our technology and our investment-grade balance sheet to ensure that we remain a leader in our markets and that we deliver superior long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I'd like to start with Dave. I just want to add one thing. This is Brian. But I think you were touching on, obviously, a critical set of subjects here. The company is really trying to lean into streaming. And we are, I think, somewhat uniquely positioned to do this in ways different. Obviously, we're a very EBITDA-focused company, and there are other ways to build new businesses and enhance our strong cash flows. And so if you look at what you just heard, Flex is all about helping broadband, but we've been able to put Peacock as a very important part of it. Now we're going to have more streaming of films. We use NOW TV, a technology from Sky and they're already streaming relationships. So we want to remain relevant to customers so that user interface, part of the answer on Flex, allows you to stream across many properties that aren't Comcast content or NBCUniversal or Sky content. It's, we think, the best interface around. And that same team is part of that team is helping build Peacock with Matt Strauss and other people. So I'm pretty excited that as the world is transitioning, broadband is the center of making a lot of that possible. And now we can bolt on a whole bunch of content and interfaces and hopefully do that in a way that customers really enjoy, and that's what's been happening so far. Okay. And finally on that question, I'm really pleased with, first of all, Mike's leadership during this and the team that reports to him and many others at corporate for how well we've handled all the uncertainties. And our balance sheet strength and liquidity are really, really speak for themselves, and I'm very satisfied there. I think the restructuring that you're hearing about is about the businesses, as Jeff and Jeremy both talked about. I think to reinforce how well our broadband business is performing and the cable company, we're always looking at can we reduce expenses and can we be more efficient in how we run the company. That's definitely always top of mind, but I think we have all the parts. I think we're taking advantage of this transition. Some parts of it are uncomfortable, for sure. But for the most part, our company is getting better. And I think, going to be one of the emerges one of the winners of the New Age. And a lot of that is giving customers more flexibility to do and see what they want. And as Jeremy just said, this is happening all over the world. And I'm really pleased with how well it's been put together. And we wanted everybody on this call to hear even more detail from the three operating businesses so you can see how well they're working together and how they're tackling the challenges ahead at corporate. We're helping create the environment for that to happen. I hope that answers your question. I just want to just add that I hope you've enjoyed the format of this call, particularly at this time. We wanted to talk about not only the 90 days but really how we're running the company. I couldn't be more pleased with the team and the progress. And we're also things we didn't touch on were some of our social commitments. There's a lot of just quality to thought that has gone into how do you handle pandemics such as this and how do you position the company for the future and try to do the right thing in the moment. So thanks for your support and the questions, and we're available to do follow-up. Marci, back to you. Thanks."

            "name": "Mike Cavanagh",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeremy, and good morning, everyone. Now I'll review our second quarter 2020 results and offer some commentary on the current conditions in our businesses, with the caveat that circumstances around us remain fluid, and therefore, our outlook is subject to change at any time. Beginning on slide four with our consolidated results; revenue decreased 11.7% to $23.7 billion. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 9.1% to $7.9 billion. Free cash flow generated in the quarter was $6 billion, and adjusted earnings per share decreased 11.5% to $0.69. Second quarter financials reflected strong results in cable, which were more than offset by declines at NBCUniversal as well as an increase in corporate and other losses due to Peacock costs and severance and restructuring costs related to organizational changes at NBCUniversal and an increase in eliminations due to the licensing of content between NBCUniversal and Peacock. Excluding the severance and restructuring costs, consolidated adjusted EBITDA would have declined in the mid-single-digit range. Now let's turn to our business segment results, starting with Cable Communications on slide five. For the second quarter, cable revenue was relatively flat at $14.4 billion, while EBITDA increased 5.5% to $6.2 billion and EBITDA less capital increased 11% to $4.4 billion. Cable Communications revenue was impacted by adjustments accrued for customer RSN fees. Excluding the impact of accrued customer RSN fee adjustments, Cable Communications revenue would have risen by 1.4% with no corresponding impact to EBITDA. We generated 217,000 customer relationship net additions in the quarter, a 43% increase year-over-year and the best second quarter on record with strength driven by our high-margin connectivity businesses. Together, residential high-speed Internet and business services generated 323,000 broadband customer net additions, which excludes over 600,000 additional high-risk or free Internet essentials customers that still receive our services and marks the best second quarter result in 13 years. High-speed Internet revenue increased 7.2% to $5 billion. Excluding the impact of accrued RSN fee adjustments for the customers taking bundled services, high-speed Internet revenue would have been up close to 9%. Business services revenue grew 3.6% to $2 billion despite a 24,000 net loss in customer relationships this quarter, which was within our expectations of the impact from COVID-19. Turning to video; revenue declined 3.2% to $5.4 billion, with higher rates more than offset by a 477,000 loss in video subscribers. Excluding accrued RSN fee adjustments, video revenue would have declined by 1.2% and video ARPU would have grown by 4.1% year-over-year. Wireless revenue increased 33.9% to $326 million driven by 126,000 additional lines, resulting in 2.4 million total lines as of quarter end. These results reflect the significant impact of our decision to close the majority of our retail stores during the second quarter in the interest of keeping our customers and employees safe. Advertising revenue decreased 30% to $428 million, reflecting reduced advertiser spend due to COVID-19. Turning to expenses; Cable Communications second quarter expenses decreased 4%, with programming expenses down 5% primarily as a result of the accrued RSN fee adjustment. Without these adjustments, programming expenses would have increased by 1.5%. Non-programming expenses declined 3.4% due to a slowdown in business activity directly resulting from COVID in addition to the implementation of longer-term cost efficiencies. Cable Communications EBITDA grew by 5.5% and margin reached 42.8%, reflecting 230 basis points of year-over-year improvement. While accrued RSN fee adjustments had no impact on EBITDA, they did impact our margins. Excluding the impact of accrued RSN fee adjustments, margins would have expanded by 170 basis points year-over-year. Cable capital expenditures decreased 8.9%, resulting in CapEx intensity of 10.1%, an improvement of 90 basis points year-over-year driven by lower spending on customer premise equipment, partially offset by higher spending on scalable infrastructure, which continues to increase due to our ongoing investment in the network. I'll now touch a bit on what we're seeing so far in the third quarter. We are very pleased that residential high-speed data net adds are off to a solid start in July. We expect residential high-speed Internet revenue growth to accelerate from that of the second quarter as we benefit from the high subscriber contribution we experienced in the first half of the year, combined with a lesser impact from our proactive response to COVID-19. While we anticipate third quarter business services revenue growth will moderate as a result of the subscriber losses we experienced in the second quarter, we are already seeing sequential albeit modest improvement in net additions. On the video side, we expect subscriber net losses in the third quarter to be somewhat similar to what we saw in the second quarter resulting primarily from lower connects due to a combination of several factors, such as the lingering effects of the rate increases we took at the beginning of this year, the overall economic pressures resulting from COVID-19 and our limited ability to perform in-home installations. Turning to our outlook for expenses and margins; for programming costs, we continue to expect underlying increases in the second half of 2020 as a result of anticipated programming renewals, which will be somewhat offset by potential additional RSN fee adjustments in the third quarter. I remind you that accrued RSN fee adjustments should have no impact on our overall EBITDA results. For non-programming costs, we expect year-over-year declines to moderate in the second half of the year as business activity starts to pick up. Given our first half results, combined with our outlook for the back half of this year, we now expect full year cable EBITDA margins to improve by up to 100 basis points year-over-year versus our prior guidance of up to 50 basis points of year-over-year improvement. We also expect our full year CapEx intensity to improve by up to 100 basis points year-over-year versus our prior guidance of approximately 50 basis points of improvement. Now I'll turn to NBCUniversal's results on slide six. Revenue for the second quarter declined 25.4% to $6.1 billion, while EBITDA was down 29.5% to $1.6 billion. Cable Networks revenue was down 15% to $2.5 billion as a 15% decline in distribution revenue and a 27% decline in advertising revenue was somewhat offset by a 23% increase in content licensing and other, which includes transactions with Peacock. Distribution revenue was adversely impacted by accrued RSN fee adjustments. Without such adjustments, distribution revenue would have declined in the low-single-digit range. Second quarter Cable Networks EBITDA grew 3.5% primarily due to the shift of sports rights amortization costs into the third quarter. Turning to Broadcast; revenue declined 1.6% to $2.4 billion as the 28% decline in advertising revenue more than offset the 9.2% growth in distribution and other, which was driven by re-trans, and the 59% growth in content licensing, which again includes transactions with Peacock. Second quarter Broadcast EBITDA grew 20% as declines across the majority of our cost base related to the general slowdown in business activity and specific savings initiatives were able to fully offset the lower revenue. Film revenue in the second quarter declined 18% due to the closure of theaters and cinemas throughout the pandemic, which was partially offset by about 20% growth in content licensing due to the success of our PVOD titles. Film EBITDA for the quarter grew 25% primarily due to lower advertising, marketing and promotion expense. Theme parks generated revenue of $87 million and an EBITDA loss of $399 million. Late in the quarter, both Universal Orlando Resort and Universal Studios Japan reopened with the appropriate safety protocols and associated attendance restrictions, while Universal Studios Hollywood remains closed. Now let's move to Sky results on slide seven. As a reminder, I will be referring to Sky's growth rates on a constant currency basis, consistent with what's reflected in our earnings release. For the second quarter, Sky revenue decreased 12.9% to $4.1 billion, while EBITDA was relatively flat at $749 million. As expected, our results were impacted by the postponement of a significant number of sporting events. This postponement was the primary driver of the 6.7% decline in direct-to-consumer revenue and a 36% decline in content revenue. Additionally, the lack of sports on the air contributed to the 41% decline in advertising revenue, which was also impacted by a weak macro environment as well as the change in legislation relating to gambling advertisement in the U.K. and Italy, which we will begin to lap in the third quarter. Looking ahead, customer trends are improving as home installation activity has restarted and sports have returned. And as Jeremy mentioned, we were able to successfully retain the vast majority of our total customer base, including those who take sports. That said, we continue to monitor the overall linear TV advertising market in our pubs and club sector, which are likely to remain under pressure for the remainder of this year. We continue to experience a shifting of sporting events, both football and non-football, that it's likely to create near-term volatility in our quarterly results particularly on the cost side. While we expect revenue declines to moderate as we move through the year, sports rights amortization will be highest in quarters that air the most events. Given a slightly later return of European football than we originally expected and the shift of other sports programming later into the year, we now expect that the majority of the expense impact will occur over the next two quarters. Importantly, we were able to secure rebates related to this disruption to our sports programming, which we will benefit from over several years. We have also resumed the investment activity that had paused as a result of COVID-19, such as acceleration of Sky Q, the launch of broadband in Italy, and expansion of our Sky entertainment channels. Based on our current visibility, we now expect Sky EBITDA for the third and fourth quarters combined to decline roughly 60% year-over-year with a more significant decline in the fourth quarter. Wrapping up on slide eight with free cash flow and capital allocation; free cash flow was $6 billion in the quarter, an increase of 40.5% or $1.7 billion. The year-over-year comparison is affected by the COVID-19-related delay in tax payments from the second quarter to the third quarter of 2020. Consolidated total capital, which includes CapEx as well as software and intangibles, decreased 4.2% in the second quarter to $2.7 billion primarily driven by declines at cable as well as at NBCU. Finally, we continue to remain committed to our long-standing balanced capital allocation approach of maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing organically for profitable growth and returning capital to shareholders through a strong commitment to our recurring dividend and eventual return to share repurchases. With that, I'll turn it back to Marci, who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call. It's Mike. I'll just jump in, Doug. I think that number, the 600, was, call it roughly 1/3 the size at the beginning of the quarter. I'll start, then the others can just chime in. So I'll take the sports in two different pieces. Just on the RSN impact, so we expect that we'll be getting some monies back from some of the sports leagues based on games played or not played in the U.S. And when that does happen, we as we've said, we'll pass that back along to customers. So we've accrued for that on the revenue line, not billing people, and we'll get that back on the expense line. But I think the question that's coming in is why does that affect high-speed data revenue growth rates, which we said adjusted for that are up 9% versus the printed number. And that's simply accounting revenue recognition rules that when you have products sold in a bundle, there's a formula relative to sort of list price that has to flow through into revenue attribution. I don't love it, but it's the rules we live by consistently. So the fact that we have some RSN rebates coming is what's driving that. So hopefully, we can take that off-line for anybody that wants more details on that. But that's simply a revenue recognition item. And then on sports amortization. As we said in both NBC and Sky, both impacted by recognizing sports rights amortization expense when events or games are played. And so in the case of Sky, the start of the games and the proportion of games pushed a little bit back into the third and fourth quarter relative to what we expected 90 days ago, and some of the new season games will spill into 2021, against which, we have a little bit of rebate expense. But that's the reason for the combined down 60% for Sky EBITDA in the third and fourth quarter is really the movement of football. But then you think about golf and Formula one and all the other events. It's going to be a packed third and fourth quarter, so expense will follow that. And basically, the same is true for NBC. And then on Peacock, I'll let Jeff comment further. But as you said, we're encouraged by the number of people we have, in my language, giving Peacock a try or taste. I mean the way we'll measure users over the long term is monthly active users. So these are sign-ups. So in due course, we'll start giving you some color on the activation side. But I think pretty much against every measure that we look at, sign-ups, usage, etcetera, it's running ahead of what we had hoped for in early days."

            "content": "Thank you, Jeff. Now at Sky, COVID-19 has certainly posed near-term challenges to our business with the delay of sports, pressure on D2C sales and a tough macro environment for advertising. But the strategies we've implemented to manage through the crisis have proved incredibly successful. We worked with our customers, pausing subscriptions where it made the most sense, especially for those on sports products that tend be sold separately. And this resulted in retention of 99% of our total customers and over 95% of our sports space as the loyalty throughout the quarter remained at record levels and viewership on Sky's own branded channels was significant. Sky Cinema, Sky basic channels and Sky News increased 29% year-on-year, and we're ahead of free-to-air and partner channels in Sky homes. And as sports returned to see, we've achieved some of the highest viewing levels we've seen in 10 years, especially in football. We're also reducing operating expenses while still maintaining good momentum in our key initiative, which is Sky Q, which is now in close to 50% of customers' homes or over 10 percentage points higher year-on-year, and the successful launch of Sky broadband in Italy, utilizing Comcast xFi technology. We closed the quarter much stronger than we started, with employees both in corporate and in the field returning to work safely and D2C sales starting to improve. Sports package upgrades are on track with our plan, and we are outperforming in nonlinear advertising. We continue to face near-term COVID-related challenges as the linear TV advertising market remains depressed. The pub and club sector is slow to recover. We are working closely with our customers, and we're encouraged by consistent month-to-month improvement in that segment. We're operating well throughout the period. And as we continue on this path to recovery, we've got one priority. That's to grow our revenue base to restart sustained growth. And to do that, we'll focus on building our trading momentum across both TV and communications. We'll continue to deliver our strategic plan to Sky Q, Sky Studio and broadband in Italy. We'll lower cost through restructuring of our operating model, and we'll close the remaining contract renewals due this year in line with or even ahead of our plan. We are also implementing a new leaner operating model for the business, which will be more centrally led. Now all of this will be anchored by our business in the U.K. that will come from a combination of growth in our existing direct-to-consumer brands as well as new market opportunities. In the U.K., our Sky TV business remains very healthy as we offer the strongest aggregation platform, the best range of content and the most innovative and flexible product experience in the market. In addition, our NOW TV streaming business is well set to continue to deliver strong growth by adding new Pay TV customers as well as increasingly upselling more content tiers to our existing base. Sky Broadband, which is already the number 2 ISP in the U.K., has significant opportunity for continued growth through our network partnerships and strong brand over the coming years. Our newest business, Sky Mobile, is now EBITDA positive only three years after launch, and we expect to increase profitability as we continue to scale. Later this year, we'll debut our broadband product to businesses in the U.K. ahead of a full launch in 2021. Now we have 0 share of this adjacent $15 billion addressable market, we already have got strong brand recognition, and we're fully leveraging the talent, experience and other capabilities of Comcast's successful Business Services division. In Continental Europe, our markets remain less developed but with strong growth potential. And while we have good market positions in both Germany and Italy, we will significantly broaden our offering of pay content by rolling out the channel portfolio that's been developed in the U.K. They're all out of broadband in Italy, benefiting from the xFi product ecosystem from Comcast will provide a strong stand-alone profit opportunity as well as leveraging our ability to cross-sell and bundle all of our TV services more effectively in this market, of course, underpinned by the trusted Sky brand. We've already achieved good success with this approach in the U.K. And across all of our markets, we're executing a range of opportunities to increase our efficiency and control costs while continuing to enhance our products and services, especially as part of the broader Comcast group. Our U.K. business will continue its disciplined cost strategy, We've held SG&A flat from the past five years and will advance further into automation, digital and advanced analytics. Alongside this, we are rightsizing what has proved to be too high a cost base in sport has not been supported by the growth we've seen in subscriber. We'll be more selective with the store we buy and don't buy. For example, adding exclusive Formula one in Germany, which will unlock a new segment of sports fans that we haven't previously served. Recently, we concluded important new agreements with Discovery and Sony at attractive terms, we renewed our Bundesliga contract at materially lower cost, we launched new Sky entertainment channels for strong customer approval, and we introduced simplified packaging and pricing in Germany. All of these will deliver important benefits to the business longer term. In total, the significant operational changes we have on board, combined with what is an already extremely strong brand and market position, should in 2020 put us on a path to more than double our EBITDA over the next several years. We don't expect to get that overnight, but our goals are all based on opportunities that are already either in market today or are already well advanced, whether that be in product development, content creation or organizational change. Sky is well positioned, and we're looking forward to executing on the opportunity we have before us. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Yes, I'll keep in. So Jessica, yes, in terms of TV production, if you if you talk to a typical Sky customer, he will tell you three things. They'll say, \"I'll rely on Sky to make all the free content that's available in Europe just better than anywhere else and just make that whole experience better,\" which is what we do. \"the second thing I'll rely on Sky to do is to scour the world, get more than their fair share of the very best content internationally and bring that to me. And then thirdly, and this is becoming more and more important, \"I want Sky to create unique European content and stories that's unique to my market or to Europe and to make that exclusive to its own platform.\" That's what they get Sky for. And sometimes that can be local sport. But increasingly, it's now becoming our own produced local entertainment, which is why we think Sky Studios is so important. And of course, from a business model point of view, we can play tunes on that or we can decide relatively where we shift investment over time to optimize both the customer experience but also our financial returns. So I'm very confident we've got all the capabilities required to build that ourselves. I think being part of the group and being alongside NBCU and Jeff's team really caught the bottoms up, and we're starting to accelerate how we work together. But I think we've got all of the factors of production in place, and we'll just intend to do more. Over time, as we start to pivot away from other content, we'll invest more in our own originated content, but that will be financially enhancing as we do that."

        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Dave Watson",
            "content": "Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. First of all, I am extremely proud of the entire team and how we're working together to handle the pandemic. Our employees have been nothing short of remarkable, moving quickly and effectively to a new way of working, and we continue to execute at the highest level. The investments we made over the years, particularly in broadband, are proving themselves out, whether it's the network, which is performing extremely well when reliability is even more important; or our digital tools, which have been instrumental during this time of need. Our focus remains on broadband as we continue to keep people connected and informed, as evidenced by our 323,000 high-speed Internet customer additions this quarter. This was the best second quarter in 13 years. It does not even include over 600,000 additional high-risk or free Internet essentials customers that still receive our service but were not included in reported results. We'll only count these customers once they are in paid status. We are committed to finding new ways to help all of our customers, especially those hardest hit during these challenging times. We extended our 60-day free Internet essentials offer, and we are keeping our 1.5 million out-of-home, public WiFi hotspots available for free through the end of this year. In addition, our assistance programs allow us to work closely with those customers having trouble paying their bills. We're pleased with how all of this is going and believe our approach has been the right one for us and for our customers. COVID-19 is, of course, having a significant impact on small and medium businesses as well, but we've seen some modestly positive trends, especially in terms of new connects as markets open up across our footprint. Throughout it all, we kept our focus on how to position our businesses to win for the long term. We're excited for the future, and we will come out of this even stronger. Let me outline our top three areas of focus right now. Our number 1 priority remains broadband. With only 50% of the homes and businesses in our footprint taking our data products, there is plenty of room for growth as we continue to gain share of an expanding market. We are optimistic about the runway ahead, and we will continue to invest in our broadband network to ensure we have great reliability as well as product innovation. It's much more than speed. Our customers find value in our gateways, the management and control that xFi enables, coverage with our xFi pods and most recently, Flex. We took the creative energy that we focused on video and have applied it to broadband. We've got the best product and best innovation engine out there, and we're leaning in. We're also very focused on customer retention, and our churn remains at all-time lows. With new products like Mobile and Flex, we give our customers additional opportunities to find even more value in our data service and drive retention to record levels. Additionally, on the connectivity side, we feel very good about the future growth and business services. We're taking care of our existing customers and continue to take share. We're still the challenger. With a great product set, marketing and sales strategy and customer care, we are in a great position to win. Second, we will continue to lean into our digital applications and raise awareness with our customers. We had been on a great path, but with the current environment, this gave us an opportunity to accelerate that. We integrated our Xfinity Assistant into help and support online, build new capabilities and entry points across the unassisted ecosystem. And the result of our efforts is that consumer awareness and use of our digital applications are at all-time highs and are having a meaningful impact on the business, driving record achievements across many key operating metrics, including customer call-in rates, digital interactions and churn, to name a few. In fact, we've seen more than a 15% increase in the percentage of transactions that we can complete digitally. I'm also particularly pleased with the progress we've made in our NPS scores, which have seen a dramatic improvement over the last few months and well exceeded our own aggressive targets, hitting our highest scores in the company's history. The incredible acceleration we drove in the last few months has set us up very well for the future and put us far ahead of our plan. This transformation will allow us to continue to take unnecessary costs out of the business while delivering a better experience for our customers. Third, video is still a core product and component of our packaging, and its platform is strategically important to us. We will continue to evolve our strategy around video, but our goal is to always enhance the long-term value of the customer relationship. Some customer segments, that is done with a great video package at a great value with X1, voice remote and all of the innovation we put into making that a great product. But we're not subsidizing video for those that don't value it from us. We are very focused on maximizing the EBITDA per customer relationship and lifetime value of each customer. For others, that means offering them the best broadband service with the Flex platform so they have the brains and power behind X1 to navigate the streaming video they choose. In both cases, we're adding to the customer experience, helping reduce churn on the broadband product and cementing a deeper relationship. The launch of Peacock and Hulu on X1 and Flex as well as swing on Flex are all part of doing just that: enhancing the value through our technology and bringing choice to our customers. Mike will go through the more detailed financial results, but from what I see today, the trends at work as we remain focused on connectivity and not chasing unprofitable video, together with a consistent discipline on expenses, to be confident in our long-term ability to drive margins higher. Margins may ebb and flow depending on programming renewal cycles, but the factors at play are all moving in the right direction. At the same time, I don't see any changes in the CapEx intensity trajectory even as we continue to innovate and make the appropriate high-return investments in our network. We have proven once again how important that investment is. Our network rose to the challenge of the surge in traffic this spring. And we will continue to invest to stay ahead of demand and differentiate our services. With that, I turn the call over to Jeff. Ben, this is Dave. I'll start off and then hand it over to Jeff. So as you said, the broadband we think we've redefined what great broadband is, and it goes beyond speed. And it's helped our momentum, I think, quite a bit. For many quarters now, we've grown. And as everything has changed here the fundamentals, I think, of this repositioning of the category that hasn't changed. So we're the market is growing. We're taking share across the board. And in addition to speed, we're very focused on coverage, control, and as you said, now with streaming and Flex. So we made it simple, a very straightforward value proposition with Flex included with the broadband relationship. And we're using it, again, to remind everyone, in a targeted basis to go after the streaming segment. But we're not bashful about leading with it to this segment. So it is very much part of the broadband experience. And it's still early, but as I said in my earlier comments that it really does it's a result of the innovation around X1, with all the capability: the voice for remote, the metadata integration that takes all of these different apps and combines them and makes it easier for the consumer. So it's early, so we're not giving out the specifics in terms of the actual monthly users, but I would tell you, it's very encouraging. Customer feedback just in terms of the experience has been really strong. And so we look at this as a very broad platform that helps this particular segment as we segment the different base. So I think it's a catalyst for broadband. We designed it to, I think, help broadband retention. Early results point towards that. And we do think the way that we define success over time will be engaged Flex users, people that are just on it and using it. And for those customers that are very active, the consumption is very good on this platform and will act as a substantial offset to some of the video losses. So we're real pleased with the start of Flex. More to come over time. Doug, Dave. I'll start and hand it over to Jeff. So the 600,000 customers reflects a combination of free Internet essentials customers and a reserve that we set up for the high-risk customers that are in a non-pay status but are still receiving service. So there to answer your question, there was some of that happened in Q1. It rolled into Q2 and probably a bit more in Q2 than Q1 for sure. And to clarify what we said and Mike said earlier in the remarks, we're only going to count these customers when they convert to paying status. So we have a very good operational plan. We're going to constantly work with customers throughout, including these customers. So it's early to predict the conversion rate, but that's just a little bit more perspective on that base. Craig, Dave here. So I think as people know, we decided not to participate in this round of the rural digital opportunity fund. And the main reason was in this round, there are relatively few adjacent rural areas to offset the additional regulatory costs associated with the auction, including submitting to ETC status in any states where bids are successful. So however, at the same time, we continue to pursue, as you mentioned, the edge expansion to new areas. If you go back and you look at expansion, which includes edge extensions but also areas of pockets within our footprint, we've increased more than two million passings. And so that's resulted in it's helping us with customer relationship growth and a number of things. So we're very focused on the logical, efficient expansions. We'll continue to address opportunities in rural as they come up over time. So in Business Services, yes, switching gears there, we are seeing encouraging trends, as mentioned earlier, and small business, particularly in the states that have reopened. The customer losses that we incurred in Q2 were absolutely within our expectations. And the good news is that the level of losses has moderated and connects are rebounding. So it's a overall, we are encouraged with the current activity. And when you break it down a little bit further and you look at, well, what segments within SMB are impacted, you have bars and restaurants that were part of the mix, but they're not the majority, not close to the majority. We have a very Bill Stemper and his team have done a really nice job over the years, building a robust, diverse, small business customer base. So as people come back, I think we're really well positioned. We have local operations, the region level, that are ready to help our clients out. And so we'll cut across the board. So it's we're still the challenger. As I said before, we're going to help customers when they come back. And again, that connect level of activity is what we're focused on. And we do think, just to clarify, that the subscriber losses that we incurred during the second quarter will have a more meaningful impact on the financials as we move to the back half of the year. And as Mike mentioned earlier, revenue is likely to moderate a little bit from the growth we saw in Q2. But we're really pleased with the rebound in connects. John, so on the margin side, the non-programming OpEx, we're really the fundamentals have not shifted. There has been an acceleration, for sure, during the COVID period and where there's just a lot of different approaches towards digital and things like self-installed kit, the tools that we're using that are going to, I think, be long-lasting for us. We've learned it a lot. Our field teams have done an extraordinary job in terms of the deployment of the new protocols and the approaches. So I think what we're seeing an ongoing, we saw it before COVID, reduction and reduction in transactional activity as we started digital some time ago. And so this is an acceleration of all of that. So we're going to continue to prioritize the network and key innovation efforts around digital. So I think that in terms of how you look at margin, I think there's still upside. And so we see a moment in time where there's an acceleration. You can't comment completely on the future exactly where that will go. But I think the learnings will serve us well, and we're just going to keep at it. And as much noise that we could take out of the system and just taking out unnecessary transactions, I think that is one of the fundamental keys that are is toward margin. In regards to the second point on Flex and Sling, let me again remind you and everyone that Flex, in and of itself, again comes with broadband. We're going after the streaming segment. We use it in a targeted way to go after these customers. So I think there's a fair amount of activity that the streaming segment has, that they're looking at a bunch of options. We want to give customers more choice. And so our goal is to provide the best video experience. I think we are uniquely positioned to participate, as Brian said, in the streaming world. Great broadband with Peacock but others like Sling and that I think that this is the first one. We'll evaluate on a case-by-case basis the other virtual operators, and we'll see how that goes. But we're going to continue to be clear to we're going to invest in X1. We look at X1 and Flex as a very broad video platform that for today, I think, helps us compete, as I said, with certain video segments with X1, and most certainly, the streaming segment with broadband and Flex and partners like Sling and many others. We've added Hulu. We've added a whole bunch of people. We look forward to adding CBS All Access, HBO Max later that we talked about. So we're going to have a wide variety of partners that will be on Flex and X1. And for us, yes, we're going to break down the segments, and they'll be very focused on providing the best video and broadband platform experience in the market."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thank you, operator and welcome everyone to our first quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me are Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh, Dave Watson, Jeff Shell and Jeremy Darroch. Given these extraordinary times, we have slightly changed the format of this morning\u2019s call. Brian and Mike will spend a bit more time than usual in their prepared remarks to provide as much color and visibility as possible on all of our businesses as well as update you on how we are managing our customers and employees through COVID-19. We will then use the time remaining to answer as many analyst question as we can. Before we begin, I refer you to Slide 2 which contains our Safe Harbor disclaimer. I remind you that this conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our 8-K and trending schedules for the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. With that, I turn the call over to Brian Roberts. Brian?\nBrian Roberts: Thank you, Marci and good morning everyone. These are truly extraordinary times. And on behalf of all of us at Comcast, our hearts go out to everyone who has been impacted by this terrible disease. I would like to echo our thanks to the thousands of heroes on the front lines. Society today is being challenged like never before in our lifetime and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of our company, our employees and our leadership teams across Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal and Sky for making a lot of tough, fair, and I believe best decisions for our customers and our organization. I truly believe that when we look back at this unprecedented time we will be reminded of the strength of our employees, the resilience of our business and the important role our services played in our customers\u2019 lives. COVID-19 has created a tremendous amount of uncertainty and financial strain for people and businesses around the globe. Every company is different and few are immune to this dynamic. Comcast is no exception. We have businesses like broadband, which had the best first quarter net adds in 12 years and continued its sales momentum in April and then we have businesses like theme parks as well as television and film production, which will be under substantial duress, because we must shelter in place. On today\u2019s call, we will discuss our first quarter performance and provide as much information as we can about the future. But perhaps the most important thing we can do is give you a sense for the guiding principles we are using to run our business during this pandemic and share some of the important decisions we have made to help move our company forward. First, how are we supporting our most important asset, our people? We saw the virus in China and then in Italy and Europe, and it gave us a real sense of urgency as to how quickly decisions had to be made and required us to change procedures almost instantaneously across the globe to get ahead of this crisis. It is this global perspective that has helped us immensely as you will hear. The first thing we needed to do was protect our employees, especially on the frontlines. So, for those working in news, managing our network and ensuring that our customers maintain vital connectivity, we have taken many safety precautions to keep them and our customers safe. At the same time, we\u2019ve successfully moved tens of thousands of employees across Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal and Sky to a work-from-home environment. Most impressive has been our ability to shift thousands of call center representatives at Comcast and Sky to working remotely in a matter of days and weeks. In fact, over 95% of our U.S. call center employees are now serving customers from their homes, and I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s ever been achieved before. We have been doing this now for about 45 days since the second week of the crisis, an extraordinary feat. Our digital tools have been instrumental during this time of need. Usage of our xFi digital app is up 60% and we are seeing a 20 point increase in customer satisfaction when they use our digital tools to activate their Internet service. Use of our AI-powered Xfinity Assistant is also up 445%. It\u2019s clear that our multiyear investment in digital and AI has prepared us for this crisis, and I cannot be prouder of the work of our teams. For our employees who are not able to work because operations have been closed or severely impacted, we\u2019ve differentiated ourselves by committing $500 million in direct support to help bridge this moment. Our employees have shown us that they are among the most engaged in the country, and we want to do what we can to support them during this crisis. Our second guiding principle is to serve our customers and continue to innovate at a time when they need us most. This starts with Xfinity Internet. In the face of COVID-19, we quickly agreed to continue service for customers facing economic hardship. Committing to the FCC\u2019s Keep Americans Connected Pledge and going further to ensure that all our customers stay informed, engaged and in touch, we are not disconnecting Internet or voice services for failure to pay. We are also offering new Internet Essentials customers two free months of service, providing free Xfinity WiFi access by opening our public hotspots and giving all customers unlimited data for no extra charge and permanently increasing the speed of our low cost internet essentials service. Through all of this, the company is working overtime to ensure that our world-class network and services have the capacity they need to keep Americans productive, informed and entertained during this difficult time. At both NBCUniversal and Sky News, we seamlessly moved to production in home, working 24/7 to keep viewers informed. Sky\u2019s riveting documentary, Coronavirus: Inside the red zone, taped from inside the hospitals of Italy, is an example of an incredible investigative look at what\u2019s happening in one of the hardest hit regions and countries. It\u2019s prominently featured along with other virus-related content on our X1 and Flex boxes, which you can pull up by just saying coronavirus into your voice remote. In the U.S., we responded quickly as theaters shut down, bringing several of our movies, including Trolls World Tour, to customers\u2019 homes. And we swiftly redated Fast 9 and Minions to next year to give us a strong theatrical slate in\u2019 21. While this certainly wasn\u2019t our plan, there may not have been a better time to launch our free ad supported streaming product, Peacock, for Xfinity customers. Now it\u2019s only been 3 weeks, but what I can tell you is we\u2019re already pacing ahead of our internal forecast on monthly active users and in time spent viewing. And we\u2019re still on track to launch Peacock nationally in July. Moving to our third principle, our balanced efforts to successfully navigate through the crisis, while simultaneously thinking about how to emerge with an even stronger future, we don\u2019t know when we will be through the worst nor do we know the shape of the global economic recovery but we are not sitting still. Company-wide, we are using this moment to step back and are looking at our organizational structure and costs. To that end, I am grateful to have as my partner and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Cavanagh, who helped JPMorgan successfully endure the worst of the financial crisis and emerged stronger than ever in \u201808/09 as their CFO. Mike and I lead our global leadership calls where we meet virtually with our teams frequently, collectively sharing best practices, making real-time decisions across the entire organization. Our strategy has not changed but our pace and tactics are being reprioritized so that we can emerge quickly as industry leaders across each of our businesses. We have also enhanced our already strong balance sheet by accessing the debt market, and we currently sit with over $15 billion of liquidity, putting us in an even better position. At this point, I want to touch on some of the specific issues important to many of you on this call. First is broadband. Our network is operating incredibly well and we stress-tested with 700,000 diagnostic speed tests on most days. As you know, our cable business comprises roughly 70% of our consolidated EBITDA, driven primarily by our connectivity businesses. While we have limited access to people\u2019s homes as we shelter in place, we continue to connect customers with our newly implemented drop-and-go strategy and we have had tremendous success with our self-install kits, which are especially easy for broadband. In fact, we had our best first quarter high-speed data net additions in 12 years of 477,000, excluding any free Internet Essentials customers and that\u2019s up 27% year-over-year. Our engineers have done a wonderful job in creating and maintaining a network flexible enough to allow so many of us to learn and work at home. We have seen an unprecedented shift in network use with a 33% increase in upstream traffic. Yet, our network continues to perform exceedingly well. And if you are interested, you can go to our corporate website to read more about our network performance and some amazing stats. In fact, it is tough to fathom what would have happened if this virus struck just five years ago. The investments we have been making in our broadband products and network every single year are paying off better than almost anywhere in the world, and we will continue to innovate and invest in our network as we had always planned. Second, I want to touch on theme parks. As of today, our theme parks remain closed, resulting in substantial operating losses, which Mike will detail. We have also delayed construction of the fourth gate in Orlando, and Super Nintendo World Japan is likely to open a few months past our original expectation. But there is no doubt that our theme parks will reopen, and when they do, I believe we will benefit from strong pent-up demand. We love these businesses. They have been one of our fastest growing for the last 10 years. They are extremely profitable, historically resilient and enjoy high barriers to entry. Our talented parks team is taking the right near-term steps to control costs while remaining laser-focused on putting in place the appropriate protocols, technology and infrastructure so that when we do reopen, our parks are safe and feel that way to consumers. And while we don\u2019t know when that will be in the U.S., I am heartened by what we are seeing in China, where we have been building a magnificent park in Beijing. As we all know, the first case of COVID occurred in China right around the Chinese New Year. Going into that holiday, we had 12,000 construction workers going full bore. But as a result of the virus, that number soon went to zero. As of today, we now have over 15,000 construction workers back at our site, even more than before the virus started. I was part of a group that recently spoke with Mike Hightower, a 40-year parks veteran, who is the head of construction living in Beijing. And he reports we have a safe working environment with many protocols in place. I\u2019m pleased to announce we expect to be open amazingly on time and on budget in 2021. Beijing maybe different, but perhaps it shows the arc of this crisis. My third topic is sports, which have been postponed across the globe, creating significant timing impacts on financial results and forecasts. We absolutely believe that sports will come back, and when they do, there\u2019s bound to be so much excitement and enthusiasm which may resonate even more than before, regardless as to whether or not stadiums are filled with fans. Bringing these stories to the world is what our sports teams do best. Given how the sports programming business works in Europe, the postponement of so many games has been a material event, with many customers pausing their sports subscriptions. I have reason to be optimistic as many European teams are already back practicing, and we have hoped that they resume play as early as May. Perhaps this will be the playbook the rest of the world uses and allows us to have conversations with our partners as we constructively work together to find solutions to bring sports back. Fourth, this crisis has shined a bright light on just how much video consumption is evolving. And while such change is disruptive to parts of the company, it reminds us how well we are positioned overall given our strength in broadband, our innovation in streaming products such as Peacock and Flex and our diversification of world-class content across NBCUniversal and Sky. Great content is more valuable than ever even while technology disrupts. In both good times and bad, I think about my father, Ralph, who, 57 years ago, built this company to be vibrant, relevant and attract the best talent to work for us while creating long-term value for shareholders. Ralph was truly the most optimistic man I\u2019ve ever known, and at the same time, he lived through some of the worst events like the Great Depression and World War II, which instilled in him the need to be prepared for anything. And Ralph\u2019s views are deep in my DNA and throughout all of Comcast, and that means having a very healthy balance sheet, a strong portfolio of complementary best-in-class assets, good sense to always take care of your people and a belief that scale really matters, particularly in difficult times. Pulling all of this together requires an entrepreneurial, global leadership team able to pivot at a moment\u2019s notice. We are working really hard to find a safe path back while we continue to operate and serve our customers every day. Mike will now take you through our first quarter financial results, which under these circumstances, I feel were quite strong. Mike?\nMike Cavanagh: Thanks, Brian and good morning everyone. I first want to echo Brian\u2019s sentiments on the terrible impact COVID-19 is having on society, and I sincerely wish all of you well in these very difficult times. Now I\u2019ll review our first quarter 2020 results in which the effects of COVID-19 only impacted us toward the end of the quarter. As a result, I will try where possible to offer some commentary on the current conditions in our businesses, but please understand that circumstances are changing rapidly in this environment, making it impossible to offer anything but highly caveated commentary. That said I will do my best to be as informative as possible and get at the many questions I know you have for us. Beginning on Slide 5 with our consolidated results, revenue decreased 0.9% to $26.6 billion. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 4.9% to $8.1 billion. Free cash flow generated in the quarter was $3.3 billion and adjusted earnings per share decreased 6.6% to $0.71. First quarter financials generally reflected strong results in cable, which were more than offset by NBCUniversal and Sky. Now I will unpack the consolidated results at the business segment level, and let\u2019s begin with Cable Communications on Slide 6. For the first quarter, cable revenue increased 4.5% to $14.9 billion. EBITDA increased 6.1% to $6.1 billion and EBITDA less capital increased 10% to $4.5 billion. We generated 371,000 customer relationship net additions in the quarter, a 24% increase year-over-year and the best first quarter on record with strength driven by our high-margin connectivity businesses. Together, residential high-speed Internet and business services generated 477,000 broadband customer net additions excluding customers getting free Internet Essentials and high-risk customers who continue to receive services following nonpayment. The 477,000 net additions reflect a 27% year-over-year increase and marks the best quarterly net adds we have had in 12 years and the lowest quarterly churn on record. High-speed Internet revenue increased 9.3% to $5 billion, driven by these strong customer additions and ARPU growth of 3.6%. Business services revenue grew 8% to $2 billion, and revenue per business customer relationship increased 4.1%. Turning to video, revenue was flat in the quarter at $5.6 billion with very healthy ARPU growth of 4.1% offset by video subscriber losses which totaled 409,000. We believe our residential rate adjustment at the beginning of the year was a significant contributor to both the ARPU increase and the video subscriber loss in the quarter. Wireless revenue increased 52% to $343 million, driven by 216,000 additional lines bringing us to 2.3 million total lines. Advertising revenue in the quarter was flat at $557 million. Excluding political, core advertising was down 4.6%. Turning to expenses, Cable Communications first quarter expenses increased 3.4% driven primarily by non-programming expenses, which increased 4.5% in part due to COVID-19 customer-facing employee pay increases and bad debt expense, which increased about 40% to $156 million in the quarter, including an increase in the reserve due to COVID 19. For the quarter, Cable Communications EBITDA grew by 6.1% and margins reached 40.7%, reflecting 60 basis points of year-over-year improvement. Cable capital expenditures decreased 6.9%, resulting in CapEx intensity of 8.5%, down 100 basis points year-over-year. Declines in the quarter were across CPE, line extensions and support capital, partly offset by an 8.3% increase in scalable infrastructure. So now I will touch on what we are currently experiencing in Cable Communications in the second quarter with a reminder of the earlier caveat on the rapidly changing environment. Residential high-speed data net adds are off to a solid start in April. The residential high-speed data revenue growth rate is expected to ease off modestly due to our proactive response to COVID-19, specifically our Keep Americans Connected Pledge, which we recently extended to June 30. We expect to see business services revenue growth moderate to low single-digit year-over-year levels for the second quarter, resulting from the net effect of COVID-19 economic pressures affecting our business customer base with some customers having paused service during lockdowns while others are requesting higher-tiered Internet service as they remain open, often in a remote fashion, which makes their high-speed data service all the more important to them. On the video side, I mentioned earlier that our first quarter net losses were 409,000, which were 288,000 higher than our net losses during the same period last year. We don\u2019t see video trends changing as we begin the second quarter, and so we could see a similar year-over-year increase in the number of video customer net losses in the second quarter, likely still a reflection of our beginning-of-year rate increase as well as changing consumer preferences and economic stress. COVID-19 began to impact cable advertising at the end of the first quarter, and we expect advertising to be down significantly in the second quarter. Turning to our outlook for expenses and margins, for programming costs, we continue to expect increases in the second half of 2020 as a result of anticipated programming renewals. We continue to approach programming renewals with a high level of discipline, and we expect sports and other programming to eventually return, driving viewership and overall engagement. For non-programming costs, we expect to continue to bear for a period of time both COVID-related operating expenses, specifically wage increases for our frontline employees; and elevated levels of bad debt expense. Such expenses are expected to be more than offset by expense declines related to slowdown in activity in some aspects of our business and ongoing cost discipline. Taking all this together, we expect to meet our original full year cable EBITDA margin outlook of up to 50 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion. We also expect to meet our full year CapEx intensity outlook for approximately 50 basis points of year-over-year improvement, driven by an increase in network investment offset by declines in CPE, line extensions and support capital. Now I\u2019ll turn to NBCUniversal\u2019s results on Slide 7. Revenue declined 7% to $7.7 billion and EBITDA was down 25.3% to $1.7 billion, reflecting a challenging film comparison, which was expected, as well as the impact of theme park and theater closures directly resulting from COVID-19. Cable Networks revenue was flat at $2.9 billion and EBITDA was down 1.2% to $1.2 billion. While content licensing and other revenue was strong, up 13% due to the timing of certain SVOD deliverables in addition to a healthy contribution from our digital businesses, distribution revenue declined by 1.5%, resulting from the expected lack of programming renewals, combined with accelerated subscriber losses. Advertising revenue declined 2.2%. Turning to broadcast, revenue was up 8.8% in the first quarter to $2.7 billion as a result of strong content licensing and retrans while EBITDA was up 30% to $501 million driven by this strong revenue growth as well as the benefit of an industry accounting change related to how content is amortized. Advertising revenue was flat. Taking the television businesses together, advertising results at both cable networks and broadcast were impacted at the end of the first quarter due to the postponement of sports resulting from COVID-19. Looking ahead, we anticipate advertising revenue will materially weaken from the first quarter due to the continued postponement of sports as well as the shape of the economic recovery as it reopens from COVID-19 shutdowns. Somewhat offsetting the advertising declines in the second quarter will be lower sports rights amortization given we amortize those rights during the period in which games air. As already announced, the Summer Olympic Games have been moved to 2021, and we remind you that we expect no financial loss in 2020 for this delay. As a result of this change in Olympics timing, in addition to accelerated subscriber losses, we now expect distribution revenue in the Cable Network segment to decline low single-digit percentages for the full year. Film revenue in the first quarter declined by 22.5% to $1.4 billion, and EBITDA declined by 71% to $106 million partly due to challenging comparisons to How to Train Your Dragon and The Grinch, further aggravated by exhibitor closings. In response to these shutdowns, we immediately and proactively moved our theatrical films to a premium video on-demand service. While we\u2019re very pleased with the PVOD success, the particular circumstances of each film are unique and we will determine our future distribution approach on a title-by-title basis. Looking forward, we anticipate film revenue and EBITDA to decline substantially, particularly in the second and third quarters as a result of moving our two most highly anticipated feature films, the next installment of Fast and Furious as well as Minions two, to 2021. Theme parks revenue in the first quarter declined 32% to $869 million and EBITDA declined 85% to $76 million due in part to lingering softness in Japan prior to COVID-19, which was subsequently aggravated by the closures of Universal Studios Japan on February 29, Universal Studios Hollywood on March 14 and Universal Orlando Resort on March 16, all a direct result of COVID-19. At this point, all of our theme parks are closed, and we do not know when they will reopen. To help you understand the impact of park closures, were the parks to remain closed the entirety of the second quarter we would expect to incur an EBITDA loss at parks of roughly $500 million in the quarter. The parks team is balancing near-term financial discipline with maximizing the long-term value of this business, and this is a dynamic effort on their part as the situation continues to develop. We remain very confident that the parks business will generate healthy returns over the long term. Nonetheless, we have decided to pause construction of Orlando\u2019s fourth gate or Epic Universe at this early stage while we focus on the immediate challenges that COVID-19 presents, while the final stages of work continue in full force for Super Nintendo World Japan, which is expected to open later this year; and Universal Beijing, which remains on schedule to open in 2021. Now, let\u2019s move on to Sky results on Slide 8. As a reminder, I will be referring to Sky\u2019s growth rates on a constant-currency basis, consistent with what\u2019s reflected in our earnings release. For the first quarter 2020, Sky revenue decreased 3.7% to $4.5 billion and EBITDA declined 15% to $551 million. COVID-19 has resulted in the postponement of many sporting events throughout our Sky markets, which started to impact our results in the second half of the quarter. This postponement was the primary driver of the 1.9% decline in direct-to-consumer revenue and 10.5% decline in content revenue. Advertising revenue also decreased by 11.6% due to overall market weakness, which was exacerbated by COVID-19, as well as continuation of the unfavorable impact from a change in legislation related to gambling advertisements in the UK and Italy, which we expect to lap in the third quarter. Given the significant revenue associated with Sky Sports and the fact that sports packages are sold separately, the complete shutdown of sports presents a unique risk of customer attrition, if unaddressed. In light of that challenge, our approach has been to allow our customers to pause their sports-related subscription payments during this time, which mitigates the risk of customer disconnects and keeps us in control of turning this revenue stream back on when sports return. As we look to the rest of the year, we do anticipate, based on reports coming out of each country that most major sports will return to complete their current seasons, although at different times for different sports across the Sky markets. In terms of financial impact, due to the significant pause in sports revenue impacting our residential, commercial and wholesale revenue, the deferral of sports rights cost amortization into the quarter when games are played as well as the headwinds we face with advertising revenue due to the economic pressures of the current environment, we expect Sky EBITDA for the second and third quarters combined to decline roughly 60% year-over-year. Between the second and third quarters, the split in results is difficult to predict since it is very sensitive to the proportion of the remainder of season play between the two quarters in each market, hence the commentary on the second and third quarters combined. While the impact on Sky due to the shutdown of sports is significant and unfortunate, our approach to customer retention gives us confidence that when sports return for their new seasons later in the year, the Sky Sports business will snap back as well. In terms of Sky\u2019s 2020 investment agenda, which includes Sky Q acceleration and the launch of broadband in Italy, COVID-19 will cause some delays in execution but we still expect to complete them in due course given their very healthy returns. Fortunately, the impact of COVID-19 on global sports and, therefore, on Sky feels to us to be finite. Sky is a strong business with 24 million customers paying us over $50 per month. And we firmly believe the return to a normalized sports schedule and an end to shelter in place should enable Sky to capitalize on its leading products and brands so as to return to its trajectory of long-term growth. Wrapping up on Slide 9 with free cash flow and capital allocation. Free cash flow was $3.3 billion in the quarter, and we paid $977 million in dividends. Consolidated total capital, which includes CapEx as well as software and intangibles, decreased 5.3% in the first quarter to $2.5 billion driven by declines across all of our businesses, and we now anticipate a modest year-over-year decline for the full year. We anticipate working capital to be roughly in line with last year, with declines at NBCU and Sky resulting from delays in content production and sports programming, offset by an increase in cable. We expect the significant disruption from COVID-19 on EBITDA at NBCU and Sky to pressure our leverage ratio until the affected portions of those businesses have returned and ramped back up. As a result, we no longer expect to resume share repurchases in 2021. Finally, we remain committed to our long-standing balanced capital allocation approach of maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing organically for growth and returning capital to shareholders through a strong commitment to our recurring dividend and an eventual return to share repurchases. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Marci who I welcome to the Comcast team. She couldn\u2019t have joined at a more interesting time, and it\u2019s clear that we are very lucky to have her onboard.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks Mike. Carmen, let\u2019s open up the call for Q&A, please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thanks, good morning. Two questions. And thank you for all the color this morning. Realizing these are unprecedented times, I\u2019m curious if you could talk about some of the maybe longer-term structural changes you expect to come out of this across your businesses. Obviously, a lot of this stuff is temporary. But as you step back from the day-to-day managing of the company, what are you seeing in terms of opportunities or changes you make to how you invest in the business and sort of your priorities for the company? Be interested in your thoughts there. And then, second, along the lines of sort of structural changes and opportunities to test new models, without getting into the controversy around Trolls World Tour, I\u2019d love to just hear how you\u2019re thinking about the film business in a post-COVID world because the numbers out of that one film seem pretty interesting. Curious on your conclusions on sort of what you take from that experiment, so to speak, and how you address the theatrical business longer term? Thanks a lot.\nBrian Roberts: Okay. Well, this is Brian. Let me begin and pass off to some of my colleagues to help with those questions. I think that the long-term priorities of the company are we\u2019re looking at this whole pandemic in sort of phases. First phase is how do you stay operating and give customers great service, protect your employees, some of the things I said in my opening remarks. I think the second phase is where we\u2019re all hoping that we\u2019re getting into right now, and you\u2019re maybe a bit ahead of us, is getting back into some form of going to the office, some form of normalcy. And then the third is kind of probably where your question is headed, what you see on the \"other side.\" And a lot depends on how that second phase really pans out. I think for me, the priorities have sharpened our focus on taking advantage of the disruptions and where can we reexamine whether it\u2019s cost structures, revenue opportunities, innovation and in each of our businesses. Starting with broadband maybe we start with Dave. Why don\u2019t you take a crack at that answer? And then Jeff, why don\u2019t you talk about the film business?\nDave Watson: Thanks, Brian. So there I think there are a handful of things certainly broadband-related when you think about structural opportunities going forward. But even before that, I\u2019d start with the amazing work that the team did in taking 90% of our call center agents and getting them to work from home. So whether or not that stays at that level, we don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll figure out the right balance going forward. But there has to be a structural benefit in being able to figure that out very quickly and effectively. I think from a broadband standpoint, the process we had already been investing strong product road map around self-install capability, but we\u2019ve enhanced it with the drop-and-go capability. We leave the SIK kit, provide telephonic and chat support, and those are going to be benefits that I think we\u2019ll have going forward. And most certainly, as Brian talked about, our digital tools, a very strong road map there between xFi, My Account and the Xfinity Assistant, the chat capability, these things are game changers and provided, I think, a nice uptick during this period, but I think a lot of that will be sustainable.\nBrian Roberts: Before, Jeff, you pop in, I want to welcome you to this call, obviously, under tremendous unique circumstances. But you\u2019ve been with us forever, listened in on a lot of these calls. But come at it with both your maybe broader view of life and specifically, the film question.\nJeff Shell: Yes. So, thank you, Brian and hello everybody. I will just echo, Brian, what you just said. I\u2019ve been in the company for a long time and been in a lot of our businesses, and it\u2019s an honor to run this. And I think, longer term, as we come out of this, we couldn\u2019t be better positioned. So I\u2019m happy to be here and happy to be part of this team. So Ben, on the PVOD question, I spent a big chunk of the last decade in the film business, and there\u2019s no question that theatrical is someday again going to be the central element to our business and the film business, which is how people made their movies and how they expect their movies to be seen. But the flip side is the majority of movies, whether we like it or not, are being consumed at home, and it\u2019s not realistic to assume that we\u2019re not going to change that this part of the business isn\u2019t going to change like all parts of the business is going to change. So as you mentioned, we\u2019re in a current unprecedented environment. We had a number of films, including Trolls that were ready to go, that we had worked very hard on and invested a lot of money in, and we really had a choice. Do we delay those movies to a time when we think the theaters are going to be back open again? We did that with Fast and Minions. We sell them or move them to streaming. Some of our other competitors have done that. Or do we try something new to preserve kind of the premium nature of movies? And that\u2019s how we came up with the PVOD offering. And I couldn\u2019t be first of all, I would say I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with Donna Langley and her team, how they executed. The numbers, as you mentioned, are really interesting. It provided consumers with a product that they desperately needed at home, particularly if you have a bunch of seven-year-olds and five-year-olds running around. And it was good for our employees. We kept them working on something. And it gave us an ability to make some money on something that we\u2019re proud of. The question is when we come out of this, what is going to be the model? And I would expect that consumers are going to return to the theaters, and we will be a part of that. And I also would expect that PVOD is going to be part of that offering. In some way, it\u2019s not going to be replacement, but it\u2019s going to be a complementary element, and we\u2019re just going to have to see how long that takes and where that takes us.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Ben. Carmen, next question please.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jessica Reif with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. I\u2019m sorry, one moment. Not sure what happened with the queue, she just disappeared from the queue. Would you like to go to the next question?\nMarci Ryvicker: Yes, please.\nOperator: Your next question will be from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thank you so much. I guess first question would be on sports. Investors have a lot of questions on sports, in particular whether you have to pay the leagues and whether you have to pay the sports networks when they do not have sports on the air. And I think regional networks sports networks are well understood. So the investor focus is on national sports networks. I know these are a sensitive sort of subject area, but any commentary around that? Obviously, the Olympics are also already understood. And then I think I have a question on wireless actually, which is with T-Mo and Sprint getting approved and closing another viable MVNO partner, obviously very different from what your Sprint MVNO could have offered. To the extent you were trying to improve on your Verizon MVNO terms, DISH is starting early efforts to build out, CBRS and C-band auctions are coming up, it feels like the company has some important decisions to make on wireless strategy this year. I\u2019m wondering if this crisis has impacted those decisions at all, whether there\u2019s an increased bar for cost of capital internally or based on how you see customers using wireless during this crisis and its relative importance to Comcast? Thank you.\nBrian Roberts: Well, let me start, Doug. On sports, depending on which part of the ecosystem you\u2019re in, as you said, regional, national, U.S. or international, there\u2019s not a connection necessarily to all the contracts all synced in one way or the same. They\u2019re all very individual. And based on the nature of the season versus the playoffs, it obviously gets even more complicated. So our focus at the moment is trying to work with each of our various leagues, where, I think, ultimately, the answers to some of these questions reside. The leagues have to decide are they going to be playing, what happens to the future if they\u2019re just starting a season or the current one that got disrupted. And as I said, I think we\u2019re seeing encouraging movement all over the world, including in the U.S. And so I think it\u2019s very much top of mind. We if we are able to get clarification, then we can give that to our customers. It works differently in Europe than it does in the U.S. So I don\u2019t know that we have any more to add to the information that we gave in the remarks, but our main focus and hope is that there\u2019s an awful lot of effort being spent to get back quickly and safely, and I\u2019m hopeful that that\u2019s going to happen. But Dave, why don\u2019t you talk about anything else on sports but particularly maybe on wireless?\nDave Watson: I think you covered it well in sports. On wireless, Doug, we continue to like our current approach. Even in this moment, we see that all the major areas that we\u2019ve been focused on around broadband churn yes, there\u2019ll be a little bit of impact on retail through this period, but between Bring Your Own Device, new device launches, we continue to be real pleased with the trajectory of the wireless business. As to opportunities, spectrum and/or the relationship, we like our relationship, current one that we have. We\u2019re always going to be staring at ways of making improvements to it over time, but the fundamentals are very good. And in regards to spectrum, nothing new to report. We will be opportunistic if it makes sense to our business. Overall, the third objective is to be profitable at scale, and we feel very comfortable with where we\u2019re going.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Doug. Next question please.\nOperator: And we have Jessica Reif with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif: Hi. Sorry, I think the operator disconnected me. So I apologize if this question was asked. But on I know I came back on something with sports, but Sky and NBCU are still paying for sports. And obviously, there\u2019s nothing on. So I\u2019m just wondering how you are thinking about contracts as they come up, what will you get in return? How does this position you for the next round? On Peacock, you said it was a great start for the first three weeks. Can you give us color on what you are seeing? And why not change rollout plans? I mean all the elements seem to be in place for a direct-to-consumer service in this environment, everyone\u2019s home. And given the targeted advertising, it just seems like the perfect opportunity. And finally, I\u2019m not sure if maybe we missed this, but have you said I haven\u2019t seen much on costs going forward. Do you feel like your businesses are right-sized for the current environment and what\u2019s going on affects so many of NBCU businesses, theme parks, film, TV, etcetera? Thank you.\nBrian Roberts: So let me Jessica, welcome back to the call. We did talk about sports a little bit. So but let me ask Jeremy since Sky Sports is a separate subscription, for those that aren\u2019t familiar with it, it\u2019s a different business approach. And people have paused the subscription, which is, I think, a very intelligent approach. And what we\u2019re seeing there is let me ask Jeremy to talk about that. And then why don\u2019t we take your two questions on Peacock and costs in general, which I think are and ask Jeff to comment when Jeremy\u2019s finished.\nJeremy Darroch: Thanks, Brian. Yes. So we\u2019ve broadly stepped into sports customers, as Brian said, and have paused many of our sports customers\u2019 subscriptions. We unbundled sports. So we thought that was a very sensible way to manage in an environment where essentially the sports season\u2019s gone away for now. That, of course, means that the level of cancellations we\u2019ve had in sports is de minimis. So we think that positions us well to bring customers back when the sports season resumes. In terms of negotiations with sports rights holders, we are talking pretty much to everybody at the moment. That covers a range of things, but firstly, how do we get sports back, which I think is in everybody\u2019s interest. So we\u2019re working with rights holders, with governments around what we can do to create a safe environment so that sports can come back. The assumption is that sports does come start to come back over the summer, as Mike talked about. And then in terms of the future on sports renegotiations and new contracts, I mean, the principle is that our my approach doesn\u2019t need to change because we start with value, and the value that we see, we bid against that value in a disciplined way. One of the advantages I think about the way sports are sold in Europe is that, typically, we\u2019re on shorter cycles. The average cycle will be three, perhaps four years. So that does give us the opportunity. While we think there\u2019s some form of reset that\u2019s required and we see a different we take a different view in terms of value to get, by the way, obviously, we\u2019ll we\u2019re thinking about that all the time but particularly at the moment, and we\u2019ll reflect that in due course.\nBrian Roberts: Jeff, why don\u2019t you take Peacock?\nJeff Shell: Yes. Let me jump in. Jessica, let me take Peacock and then go to costs. So on Peacock, it\u2019s very early, Jessica. We\u2019re three weeks in or so not even three weeks in, so I\u2019m reticent to make any conclusions. But our goals on launching first with Comcast were twofold: one, get the product right technically; and two, learn some things about how people are using it so when we roll it out nationally we can go out with the best product. The early results, as I said, it\u2019s a couple of weeks in, but they\u2019re very, very encouraging, particularly the amount of time that each person is spending on the platform. We have our product is a very, very deep offering. We didn\u2019t launch with a lot of our splashy originals because of COVID but we have so much on there that people are getting on there and they\u2019re spending a lot more time than we had originally anticipated, which is great news. So why not pull it up and launch it earlier? We\u2019re in a marathon, not a sprint. We\u2019re not we have an ad-supported service. We don\u2019t see the value and we\u2019re not trying to gain subscribers. And we want to make sure the product is right before we launch in July. So this is kind of a measured strategy on our part, and I think it\u2019s the right strategy for Peacock. And we\u2019re very encouraged and even more optimistic on it long term. On costs the question about whether we\u2019re right sized on costs given where the environment is headed, the answer is probably no, and we\u2019re addressing that pretty aggressively. We\u2019re trying to be thoughtful within our business though, and there\u2019s obviously a couple of different kinds of businesses. One business is there are businesses like the theme park business where the revenue has just shut off and we have to address our costs, but we\u2019re going to come back at some point. There, we have cut a significant amount of our costs and can flex even further down if this goes longer and deeper than we see right now. And then elsewhere in our business where we\u2019re seeing both short-term and structural declines, I think what we\u2019re trying to do is address our cost base in a way that comes out of this in a different way, that we look like a different company and we can shift our business as we adjust our cost base. But we\u2019re spending a lot of time on our cost base. And certainly, over the next weeks and months, we\u2019ll make pretty significant adjustments there across our business. We\u2019re not we haven\u2019t ad-supported service. We don\u2019t see the value that we\u2019re not trying to gain subscribers. And we want to make sure the product is right before we launch in July. So this is kind of a measured strategy in our partner. I think it\u2019s the right strategy for Peacock, and we\u2019re very encouraged and even more optimistic on it. Long term. On costs, the question about whether we\u2019re rightsized on costs given where the environment is headed, the answer is probably no, and we\u2019re addressing that pretty aggressively. We\u2019re trying to be thoughtful within our business, though, and there\u2019s obviously a couple of different kinds of businesses, one businesses. There are businesses like the Theme park business, where the revenue has just shut up, and we have to address our costs, but we\u2019re going to come back at some point. There, we have cut a significant amount of our costs and can flex even further down if this goes longer and deeper than we see right now and then elsewhere in our business where we\u2019re seeing both short-term and structural declines. I think what we\u2019re trying to do is address our cost base in a way that comes out of this in a different way that we look like a different company, and we can shift our business as we adjust our cost base, but we\u2019re spending a lot of time on our cost base. And certainly, over the next weeks and months, we\u2019ll make pretty significant adjustments there across our business.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Jessica. Carmen we will take the next question.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nCraig Moffett: Hi, thank you. Two questions, if I may. One, on the cable side of the business, what are you seeing with respect to small/medium business in your business services segment? And how should we think about the exposure of that segment in particular to the crisis? Have share shifts continued? And is that perhaps enough to offset the pressure that those businesses are likely to be feeling. And then in the Sky business, if you part of the strategy, I think, for that business has always been to try to grow the OTT platform in Europe given the strength of that brand. Is there a way that you can accelerate that transition now just given that they\u2019re experiencing a lot of the same lockdowns that we are here to try to sort of build the lifeboat, if you will, for the traditional distribution business? And actually, if I could squeeze in just one simpler and more technical question on theme parks, just can you give us an idea of what the breakeven occupancy or attendance rate would have to be when you reopen in order to be profitable?\nBrian Roberts: Okay. That has touched on all parts of the company. So why don\u2019t we start with you, Dave, on SMB and business services, and we\u2019ll go over to Jeremy. And then maybe, Mike, you take the parks question, if you want, or Jeff?\nDave Watson: Got it, Brian. Craig, so this is what we are experiencing right now is primarily, as you noted an SMB issue. In a number of businesses where Mike mentioned earlier, where we have paused their accounts, there is no question, there has been an uptick, an increase. But the rate of that increase is declining. And so you take that, it\u2019s not a huge number but it\u2019s we\u2019re working with our clients to stay very focused on that. There will be some impact for sure as we go into Q2. But overall, to counter, as you referenced, in SMB, we\u2019re still the challenger with around 40% or so penetration. So there the fundamentals of SMB are still very good, and there\u2019s penetration upside. We\u2019re going to go after it. And we still are getting a fair amount of connect business even during this period. So our team\u2019s on it. We\u2019ve had to redeploy folks. People that were out working in communities are now doing driving demand in other ways. And it\u2019s and we\u2019re getting some effective responses. So we\u2019ll stay on that. I think that last point before I turn it over is, over the last decade plus since launching, we started off with SMB, still the primary part of our business. But we have most definitely materially diversified to midsized and enterprise business now. So these segments are really important for us right now, will be in the future. That\u2019s where most of the penetration upside is. So really proud of our Bill Stemper, the business services team, great local operations that have moved on a dime to handle a lot of this at this moment, but we certainly are planning for multiple scenarios. We\u2019ll work with our small business clients. We want to be a partner with them, getting them through it. And so I am optimistic coming out of it, and we\u2019ll be there for them when that happens.\nJeremy Darroch: Thanks. Jeremy here jumping in. The answer is yes, Craig. It will form a bigger part of our mix. It\u2019s another string to our bow, if you like. But we\u2019ll do that in complement to our main services as well. Sky Q, which had been a priority for us, as you know, going into this year, one of the slightly frustrating things as it was going really very well at the start of the year, slightly had to take a step back because of the crisis. But it reminds me of the strength of our platform. But we can push hard on OTT, all of our streaming services. We\u2019re already providing Sky Q directly over fiber in Italy. And all of these provide us with good alternatives and different ways to get to customers in this environment.\nMike Cavanagh: And lastly, it\u2019s Mike on your parks question, Craig. It\u2019s something well short of typical. Seasonally through the year, we\u2019re operating at typical seasonal levels, which are, for the most part of the year, well below full capacity anyway. And so then versus typical, I would guess that we\u2019re breaking even and certainly when we get to sort of 50% of typical, which will be well below capacity on average. And I think another point would just be versus the number I gave for $500 million in second quarter loss if the parks are closed for the full quarter, as Jeff said, if they\u2019re closed longer, there\u2019s ability to flex and do more and change that long-term rate if we are staying closed. But on the other side of that, if we open and have lower attendance, at the lower end because our priority is going to be to make the parks safe, and so we\u2019re not going to push for attendance. But at pretty low levels of return attendance as things ramp up, we\u2019ll be in better shape than were the parks to be closed.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Craig. Next question please.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nPhilip Cusick: Hey guys. Thanks. Number one, can you think through the puts and takes to cash flow this year versus last? I know there is a lot of differences between the timing of cash going out the door and some of the amortization, especially at NBC. And then second, Comcast is taking pride in keeping leverage low to take advantage of disruption opportunities. I understand not buying stock next year, but would you consider buying assets if things come to market at distressed levels or is de-levering from here still your top priority? Thanks.\nMike Cavanagh: So I\u2019ll take that. It\u2019s Mike, Phil. So in terms of puts and takes on cash, as I said, for total capital spend, we\u2019ve got we\u2019re down 5%, 5.2% in the first quarter with declines across all businesses. And I think the natural that will naturally be where we expect the full year to be, which would be sort of modestly down in 2020 versus 2019 across all of our businesses for the host of reasons, some things just getting slowed down, some things getting paused like Epic Universe. So in any event, total capital is down modestly for the year. And then on working capital, it\u2019s the toughest one to predict, lots of volatility and unpredictability in it. But that said, my commentary there was that we\u2019d expect to be roughly flat for the full company, best I can tell as we\u2019re sitting here now. And that\u2019s really on the back of increases that we\u2019ll see in the cable business this year. We got an extra payroll period. We\u2019ll do political ads in the fourth quarter that don\u2019t get paid until the until we\u2019re in the first quarter 2021, etcetera. So and then just a little bit of expected slowdown in consumer payment is why working capital will be up year-over-year in cable, and that offsets declines at NBCU and Sky, which is caused by slowdown in production typically in the TV and film businesses and a little bit of impact on sports. But I\u2019d caveat that one. As we continue conversations with especially with sports-related partners like the Olympics, etc., those numbers could change over the course of the year. But those are the various puts and takes. And then on leverage ratio, it\u2019s important to us that we get back to the leverage ratio commitments we gave to the rating agency. That continues to be a top priority. I think obviously we\u2019re going to be delayed in getting there because of the pressure on EBITDA that comes from COVID particularly related to parks. So it will take time for those to ramp back up. And I think our focus as Brian said, we\u2019ve got lots of opportunity in our existing businesses, and that will be priority number two. And I would never say we wouldn\u2019t be taking a look at things that are sort of inorganic opportunities but the bar would be pretty high.\nBrian Roberts: Yes. I just would only add that definitely that last part, our focus is the businesses we\u2019ve got. We feel we\u2019re in a wonderful position. Again, as I think about the timetable, we know parks are going to reopen and we know sports is going to get back. So these are a temporary hit. And I think being home and watching sports, I think, is pretty safe. And that\u2019s going to return pretty quickly to a great business. And then I look at the majority of the company being broadband in people\u2019s homes and people who are spending more time in their homes, and that\u2019s not going to change quickly. And that\u2019s a great opportunity to develop new products and relationships and deepen those relationships. So as we\u2019ve looked at it, as we talked as a team, I don\u2019t think we would trade positions with anybody. We like our company. We like our hand, and we are going to be focused on improving from here\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Phil. And we have time for one last question.\nOperator: The last question will come from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay, great. Following up on those latest comments on high-speed data, obviously, great numbers even without connect America and the free subs. Can you talk a little bit about the strength there in terms of is it share gains given the ease of self-installation? Or are you guys seeing penetration gains in sort of wiring up what were previously wireless-only customers, given the need for the work-from-home environment? And then I think you guys gave some sub guidance on the video side and some revenue guidance on the high-speed data side. But can you talk about how you expect the sub trends to sort of play out through the course of the year and whether you think the trends you\u2019re seeing now are sort of more related to the outbreak or could you see some secular strength and some follow-through given the demand for connectivity?\nBrian Roberts: So I\u2019ll start. Dave, I think you can help on that. But I think the we think we have a superior product, and we\u2019ve been investing in our network. We\u2019ve had a focus we\u2019ve seen a shift coming in customers\u2019 behaviors. We saw this and really put our emphasis on innovating in broadband, whether it\u2019s speed, coverage, control of various things that xFi stands for the brand itself. And I think a lot of this was happening before there was COVID, and the momentum has been terrific. And Dave and his team, I think, are really, really all over it, and we\u2019re very pleased, both from product side, service side and marketing and consumer perception. And so why wouldn\u2019t this be continued at some level? You then have to put that in the face of huge economic shifts in the country and just temper in that regard as to we don\u2019t know what the economic outlook looks and the slope of recovery. But in terms of focus, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a better focus that we could be having than Dave and the team\u2019s. So Dave, why don\u2019t you talk a little more about that?\nDave Watson: Thanks, Brian. John, so as Brian said, this has been our top priority, continues to be our top priority going forward. And our mission has been to redefine what great broadband is, and Brian hit it. It\u2019s we\u2019re investing, and we have a really great product road map that really hits on all of it, speed, coverage control and now streaming with the addition of Flex and all the content that comes with it. So in this moment, robust, reliable network that can consistently handle this uptick in data consumption as well as all the devices with the WiFi coverage in the home, we have invested and built the network that can stand up to this moment, and it\u2019s going to be important going forward. So and we\u2019re not standing still, but we\u2019re going to continue to improve the value of broadband. And I mentioned introducing Flex that comes with our included in our broadband service, and this is focused for the broadband-only segment. And Jeff mentioned Peacock already. This comes with Peacock comes with Flex. High levels of engagement with content, it\u2019s a great video addition to the broadband service. So but to your main point, John, even in this environment, you have lower move activity that\u2019s suppressing some of the activity, but there are many sources of new broadband share opportunity. And we continue to compete for share from the primary competitors. That\u2019s a big source of business even right now that we take share from folks, we just have a better product and that\u2019s proven out and people need it right now, and we\u2019ll continue to. There\u2019s still a lot of DSL. There is some nevers, never broadbands out there. You had mentioned mobile-only. People are finding you need broadband. And I think once they experience what xFi is, I think we\u2019re optimistic about them staying with it. So along with historic record churn, I think we\u2019re proving right now that we can attract new business for broadband as we go forward. So you look at the 477,000 in Q1 that we feel we took out there\u2019s no Internet Essentials in that number. There\u2019s appropriate reserve that we took out for bad debt projections. It\u2019s not material in Q1, but we took it. And we think that going forward, April, as Mike mentioned, is a very good start. It\u2019s impossible to say how things are going to play out through the quarter. But the fundamentals and the momentum that we have, I think we\u2019ve proven that we can drive connects and that we have we\u2019ll maintain solid churn. So I\u2019m optimistic about our momentum as we go into the rest of the year.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks guys.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, John. So that concludes our first quarter 2020 earnings call.

So Ben, on the PVOD question, I spent a big chunk of the last decade in the film business, and there's no question that theatrical is someday again going to be the central element to our business and the film business, which is how people made their movies and how they expect their movies to be seen. But the flip side is the majority of movies, whether we like it or not, are being consumed at home, and it's not realistic to assume that we're not going to change that this part of the business isn't going to change like all parts of the business is going to change. So as you mentioned, we're in a current unprecedented environment. We had a number of films, including Trolls that were ready to go, that we had worked very hard on and invested a lot of money in, and we really had a choice. Do we delay those movies to a time when we think the theaters are going to be back open again? We did that with Fast and Minions. We sell them or move them to streaming. Some of our other competitors have done that. Or do we try something new to preserve kind of the premium nature of movies? And that's how we came up with the PVOD offering. And I couldn't be first of all, I would say I couldn't be more pleased with Donna Langley and her team, how they executed. The numbers, as you mentioned, are really interesting. It provided consumers with a product that they desperately needed at home, particularly if you have a bunch of seven-year-olds and five-year-olds running around. And it was good for our employees. We kept them working on something. And it gave us an ability to make some money on something that we're proud of. The question is when we come out of this, what is going to be the model? And I would expect that consumers are going to return to the theaters, and we will be a part of that. And I also would expect that PVOD is going to be part of that offering. In some way, it's not going to be replacement, but it's going to be a complementary element, and we're just going to have to see how long that takes and where that takes us. Yes. Let me jump in. Jessica, let me take Peacock and then go to costs. So on Peacock, it's very early, Jessica. We're three weeks in or so not even three weeks in, so I'm reticent to make any conclusions. But our goals on launching first with Comcast were twofold: one, get the product right technically; and two, learn some things about how people are using it so when we roll it out nationally we can go out with the best product. The early results, as I said, it's a couple of weeks in, but they're very, very encouraging, particularly the amount of time that each person is spending on the platform. We have our product is a very, very deep offering. We didn't launch with a lot of our splashy originals because of COVID but we have so much on there that people are getting on there and they're spending a lot more time than we had originally anticipated, which is great news. So why not pull it up and launch it earlier? We're in a marathon, not a sprint. We're not we have an ad-supported service. We don't see the value and we're not trying to gain subscribers. And we want to make sure the product is right before we launch in July. So this is kind of a measured strategy on our part, and I think it's the right strategy for Peacock. And we're very encouraged and even more optimistic on it long term. On costs the question about whether we're right sized on costs given where the environment is headed, the answer is probably no, and we're addressing that pretty aggressively. We're trying to be thoughtful within our business though, and there's obviously a couple of different kinds of businesses. One business is there are businesses like the theme park business where the revenue has just shut off and we have to address our costs, but we're going to come back at some point. There, we have cut a significant amount of our costs and can flex even further down if this goes longer and deeper than we see right now. And then elsewhere in our business where we're seeing both short-term and structural declines, I think what we're trying to do is address our cost base in a way that comes out of this in a different way, that we look like a different company and we can shift our business as we adjust our cost base. But we're spending a lot of time on our cost base. And certainly, over the next weeks and months, we'll make pretty significant adjustments there across our business. We're not we haven't ad-supported service. We don't see the value that we're not trying to gain subscribers. And we want to make sure the product is right before we launch in July. So this is kind of a measured strategy in our partner. I think it's the right strategy for Peacock, and we're very encouraged and even more optimistic on it. Long term. On costs, the question about whether we're rightsized on costs given where the environment is headed, the answer is probably no, and we're addressing that pretty aggressively. We're trying to be thoughtful within our business, though, and there's obviously a couple of different kinds of businesses, one businesses. There are businesses like the Theme park business, where the revenue has just shut up, and we have to address our costs, but we're going to come back at some point. There, we have cut a significant amount of our costs and can flex even further down if this goes longer and deeper than we see right now and then elsewhere in our business where we're seeing both short-term and structural declines. I think what we're trying to do is address our cost base in a way that comes out of this in a different way that we look like a different company, and we can shift our business as we adjust our cost base, but we're spending a lot of time on our cost base. And certainly, over the next weeks and months, we'll make pretty significant adjustments there across our business."

            "name": "Brian Roberts",
            "content": "Thank you, Marci and good morning everyone. These are truly extraordinary times. And on behalf of all of us at Comcast, our hearts go out to everyone who has been impacted by this terrible disease. I would like to echo our thanks to the thousands of heroes on the front lines. Society today is being challenged like never before in our lifetime and I couldn't be more proud of our company, our employees and our leadership teams across Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal and Sky for making a lot of tough, fair, and I believe best decisions for our customers and our organization. I truly believe that when we look back at this unprecedented time we will be reminded of the strength of our employees, the resilience of our business and the important role our services played in our customers' lives. COVID-19 has created a tremendous amount of uncertainty and financial strain for people and businesses around the globe. Every company is different and few are immune to this dynamic. Comcast is no exception. We have businesses like broadband, which had the best first quarter net adds in 12 years and continued its sales momentum in April and then we have businesses like theme parks as well as television and film production, which will be under substantial duress, because we must shelter in place. On today's call, we will discuss our first quarter performance and provide as much information as we can about the future. But perhaps the most important thing we can do is give you a sense for the guiding principles we are using to run our business during this pandemic and share some of the important decisions we have made to help move our company forward. First, how are we supporting our most important asset, our people? We saw the virus in China and then in Italy and Europe, and it gave us a real sense of urgency as to how quickly decisions had to be made and required us to change procedures almost instantaneously across the globe to get ahead of this crisis. It is this global perspective that has helped us immensely as you will hear. The first thing we needed to do was protect our employees, especially on the frontlines. So, for those working in news, managing our network and ensuring that our customers maintain vital connectivity, we have taken many safety precautions to keep them and our customers safe. At the same time, we've successfully moved tens of thousands of employees across Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal and Sky to a work-from-home environment. Most impressive has been our ability to shift thousands of call center representatives at Comcast and Sky to working remotely in a matter of days and weeks. In fact, over 95% of our U.S. call center employees are now serving customers from their homes, and I'm not sure that's ever been achieved before. We have been doing this now for about 45 days since the second week of the crisis, an extraordinary feat. Our digital tools have been instrumental during this time of need. Usage of our xFi digital app is up 60% and we are seeing a 20 point increase in customer satisfaction when they use our digital tools to activate their Internet service. Use of our AI-powered Xfinity Assistant is also up 445%. It's clear that our multiyear investment in digital and AI has prepared us for this crisis, and I cannot be prouder of the work of our teams. For our employees who are not able to work because operations have been closed or severely impacted, we've differentiated ourselves by committing $500 million in direct support to help bridge this moment. Our employees have shown us that they are among the most engaged in the country, and we want to do what we can to support them during this crisis. Our second guiding principle is to serve our customers and continue to innovate at a time when they need us most. This starts with Xfinity Internet. In the face of COVID-19, we quickly agreed to continue service for customers facing economic hardship. Committing to the FCC's Keep Americans Connected Pledge and going further to ensure that all our customers stay informed, engaged and in touch, we are not disconnecting Internet or voice services for failure to pay. We are also offering new Internet Essentials customers two free months of service, providing free Xfinity WiFi access by opening our public hotspots and giving all customers unlimited data for no extra charge and permanently increasing the speed of our low cost internet essentials service. Through all of this, the company is working overtime to ensure that our world-class network and services have the capacity they need to keep Americans productive, informed and entertained during this difficult time. At both NBCUniversal and Sky News, we seamlessly moved to production in home, working 24/7 to keep viewers informed. Sky's riveting documentary, Coronavirus: Inside the red zone, taped from inside the hospitals of Italy, is an example of an incredible investigative look at what's happening in one of the hardest hit regions and countries. It's prominently featured along with other virus-related content on our X1 and Flex boxes, which you can pull up by just saying coronavirus into your voice remote. In the U.S., we responded quickly as theaters shut down, bringing several of our movies, including Trolls World Tour, to customers' homes. And we swiftly redated Fast 9 and Minions to next year to give us a strong theatrical slate in' 21. While this certainly wasn't our plan, there may not have been a better time to launch our free ad supported streaming product, Peacock, for Xfinity customers. Now it's only been 3 weeks, but what I can tell you is we're already pacing ahead of our internal forecast on monthly active users and in time spent viewing. And we're still on track to launch Peacock nationally in July. Moving to our third principle, our balanced efforts to successfully navigate through the crisis, while simultaneously thinking about how to emerge with an even stronger future, we don't know when we will be through the worst nor do we know the shape of the global economic recovery but we are not sitting still. Company-wide, we are using this moment to step back and are looking at our organizational structure and costs. To that end, I am grateful to have as my partner and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Cavanagh, who helped JPMorgan successfully endure the worst of the financial crisis and emerged stronger than ever in \u201808/09 as their CFO. Mike and I lead our global leadership calls where we meet virtually with our teams frequently, collectively sharing best practices, making real-time decisions across the entire organization. Our strategy has not changed but our pace and tactics are being reprioritized so that we can emerge quickly as industry leaders across each of our businesses. We have also enhanced our already strong balance sheet by accessing the debt market, and we currently sit with over $15 billion of liquidity, putting us in an even better position. At this point, I want to touch on some of the specific issues important to many of you on this call. First is broadband. Our network is operating incredibly well and we stress-tested with 700,000 diagnostic speed tests on most days. As you know, our cable business comprises roughly 70% of our consolidated EBITDA, driven primarily by our connectivity businesses. While we have limited access to people's homes as we shelter in place, we continue to connect customers with our newly implemented drop-and-go strategy and we have had tremendous success with our self-install kits, which are especially easy for broadband. In fact, we had our best first quarter high-speed data net additions in 12 years of 477,000, excluding any free Internet Essentials customers and that's up 27% year-over-year. Our engineers have done a wonderful job in creating and maintaining a network flexible enough to allow so many of us to learn and work at home. We have seen an unprecedented shift in network use with a 33% increase in upstream traffic. Yet, our network continues to perform exceedingly well. And if you are interested, you can go to our corporate website to read more about our network performance and some amazing stats. In fact, it is tough to fathom what would have happened if this virus struck just five years ago. The investments we have been making in our broadband products and network every single year are paying off better than almost anywhere in the world, and we will continue to innovate and invest in our network as we had always planned. Second, I want to touch on theme parks. As of today, our theme parks remain closed, resulting in substantial operating losses, which Mike will detail. We have also delayed construction of the fourth gate in Orlando, and Super Nintendo World Japan is likely to open a few months past our original expectation. But there is no doubt that our theme parks will reopen, and when they do, I believe we will benefit from strong pent-up demand. We love these businesses. They have been one of our fastest growing for the last 10 years. They are extremely profitable, historically resilient and enjoy high barriers to entry. Our talented parks team is taking the right near-term steps to control costs while remaining laser-focused on putting in place the appropriate protocols, technology and infrastructure so that when we do reopen, our parks are safe and feel that way to consumers. And while we don't know when that will be in the U.S., I am heartened by what we are seeing in China, where we have been building a magnificent park in Beijing. As we all know, the first case of COVID occurred in China right around the Chinese New Year. Going into that holiday, we had 12,000 construction workers going full bore. But as a result of the virus, that number soon went to zero. As of today, we now have over 15,000 construction workers back at our site, even more than before the virus started. I was part of a group that recently spoke with Mike Hightower, a 40-year parks veteran, who is the head of construction living in Beijing. And he reports we have a safe working environment with many protocols in place. I'm pleased to announce we expect to be open amazingly on time and on budget in 2021. Beijing maybe different, but perhaps it shows the arc of this crisis. My third topic is sports, which have been postponed across the globe, creating significant timing impacts on financial results and forecasts. We absolutely believe that sports will come back, and when they do, there's bound to be so much excitement and enthusiasm which may resonate even more than before, regardless as to whether or not stadiums are filled with fans. Bringing these stories to the world is what our sports teams do best. Given how the sports programming business works in Europe, the postponement of so many games has been a material event, with many customers pausing their sports subscriptions. I have reason to be optimistic as many European teams are already back practicing, and we have hoped that they resume play as early as May. Perhaps this will be the playbook the rest of the world uses and allows us to have conversations with our partners as we constructively work together to find solutions to bring sports back. Fourth, this crisis has shined a bright light on just how much video consumption is evolving. And while such change is disruptive to parts of the company, it reminds us how well we are positioned overall given our strength in broadband, our innovation in streaming products such as Peacock and Flex and our diversification of world-class content across NBCUniversal and Sky. Great content is more valuable than ever even while technology disrupts. In both good times and bad, I think about my father, Ralph, who, 57 years ago, built this company to be vibrant, relevant and attract the best talent to work for us while creating long-term value for shareholders. Ralph was truly the most optimistic man I've ever known, and at the same time, he lived through some of the worst events like the Great Depression and World War II, which instilled in him the need to be prepared for anything. And Ralph's views are deep in my DNA and throughout all of Comcast, and that means having a very healthy balance sheet, a strong portfolio of complementary best-in-class assets, good sense to always take care of your people and a belief that scale really matters, particularly in difficult times. Pulling all of this together requires an entrepreneurial, global leadership team able to pivot at a moment's notice. We are working really hard to find a safe path back while we continue to operate and serve our customers every day. Mike will now take you through our first quarter financial results, which under these circumstances, I feel were quite strong. Mike? Okay. Well, this is Brian. Let me begin and pass off to some of my colleagues to help with those questions. I think that the long-term priorities of the company are we're looking at this whole pandemic in sort of phases. First phase is how do you stay operating and give customers great service, protect your employees, some of the things I said in my opening remarks. I think the second phase is where we're all hoping that we're getting into right now, and you're maybe a bit ahead of us, is getting back into some form of going to the office, some form of normalcy. And then the third is kind of probably where your question is headed, what you see on the \"other side.\" And a lot depends on how that second phase really pans out. I think for me, the priorities have sharpened our focus on taking advantage of the disruptions and where can we reexamine whether it's cost structures, revenue opportunities, innovation and in each of our businesses. Starting with broadband maybe we start with Dave. Why don't you take a crack at that answer? And then Jeff, why don't you talk about the film business? Before, Jeff, you pop in, I want to welcome you to this call, obviously, under tremendous unique circumstances. But you've been with us forever, listened in on a lot of these calls. But come at it with both your maybe broader view of life and specifically, the film question. Well, let me start, Doug. On sports, depending on which part of the ecosystem you're in, as you said, regional, national, U.S. or international, there's not a connection necessarily to all the contracts all synced in one way or the same. They're all very individual. And based on the nature of the season versus the playoffs, it obviously gets even more complicated. So our focus at the moment is trying to work with each of our various leagues, where, I think, ultimately, the answers to some of these questions reside. The leagues have to decide are they going to be playing, what happens to the future if they're just starting a season or the current one that got disrupted. And as I said, I think we're seeing encouraging movement all over the world, including in the U.S. And so I think it's very much top of mind. We if we are able to get clarification, then we can give that to our customers. It works differently in Europe than it does in the U.S. So I don't know that we have any more to add to the information that we gave in the remarks, but our main focus and hope is that there's an awful lot of effort being spent to get back quickly and safely, and I'm hopeful that that's going to happen. But Dave, why don't you talk about anything else on sports but particularly maybe on wireless? So let me Jessica, welcome back to the call. We did talk about sports a little bit. So but let me ask Jeremy since Sky Sports is a separate subscription, for those that aren't familiar with it, it's a different business approach. And people have paused the subscription, which is, I think, a very intelligent approach. And what we're seeing there is let me ask Jeremy to talk about that. And then why don't we take your two questions on Peacock and costs in general, which I think are and ask Jeff to comment when Jeremy's finished. Jeff, why don't you take Peacock? Okay. That has touched on all parts of the company. So why don't we start with you, Dave, on SMB and business services, and we'll go over to Jeremy. And then maybe, Mike, you take the parks question, if you want, or Jeff? Yes. I just would only add that definitely that last part, our focus is the businesses we've got. We feel we're in a wonderful position. Again, as I think about the timetable, we know parks are going to reopen and we know sports is going to get back. So these are a temporary hit. And I think being home and watching sports, I think, is pretty safe. And that's going to return pretty quickly to a great business. And then I look at the majority of the company being broadband in people's homes and people who are spending more time in their homes, and that's not going to change quickly. And that's a great opportunity to develop new products and relationships and deepen those relationships. So as we've looked at it, as we talked as a team, I don't think we would trade positions with anybody. We like our company. We like our hand, and we are going to be focused on improving from here So I'll start. Dave, I think you can help on that. But I think the we think we have a superior product, and we've been investing in our network. We've had a focus we've seen a shift coming in customers' behaviors. We saw this and really put our emphasis on innovating in broadband, whether it's speed, coverage, control of various things that xFi stands for the brand itself. And I think a lot of this was happening before there was COVID, and the momentum has been terrific. And Dave and his team, I think, are really, really all over it, and we're very pleased, both from product side, service side and marketing and consumer perception. And so why wouldn't this be continued at some level? You then have to put that in the face of huge economic shifts in the country and just temper in that regard as to we don't know what the economic outlook looks and the slope of recovery. But in terms of focus, I don't think there's a better focus that we could be having than Dave and the team's. So Dave, why don't you talk a little more about that? Thanks, everybody."

            "name": "Mike Cavanagh",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian and good morning everyone. I first want to echo Brian's sentiments on the terrible impact COVID-19 is having on society, and I sincerely wish all of you well in these very difficult times. Now I'll review our first quarter 2020 results in which the effects of COVID-19 only impacted us toward the end of the quarter. As a result, I will try where possible to offer some commentary on the current conditions in our businesses, but please understand that circumstances are changing rapidly in this environment, making it impossible to offer anything but highly caveated commentary. That said I will do my best to be as informative as possible and get at the many questions I know you have for us. Beginning on Slide 5 with our consolidated results, revenue decreased 0.9% to $26.6 billion. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 4.9% to $8.1 billion. Free cash flow generated in the quarter was $3.3 billion and adjusted earnings per share decreased 6.6% to $0.71. First quarter financials generally reflected strong results in cable, which were more than offset by NBCUniversal and Sky. Now I will unpack the consolidated results at the business segment level, and let's begin with Cable Communications on Slide 6. For the first quarter, cable revenue increased 4.5% to $14.9 billion. EBITDA increased 6.1% to $6.1 billion and EBITDA less capital increased 10% to $4.5 billion. We generated 371,000 customer relationship net additions in the quarter, a 24% increase year-over-year and the best first quarter on record with strength driven by our high-margin connectivity businesses. Together, residential high-speed Internet and business services generated 477,000 broadband customer net additions excluding customers getting free Internet Essentials and high-risk customers who continue to receive services following nonpayment. The 477,000 net additions reflect a 27% year-over-year increase and marks the best quarterly net adds we have had in 12 years and the lowest quarterly churn on record. High-speed Internet revenue increased 9.3% to $5 billion, driven by these strong customer additions and ARPU growth of 3.6%. Business services revenue grew 8% to $2 billion, and revenue per business customer relationship increased 4.1%. Turning to video, revenue was flat in the quarter at $5.6 billion with very healthy ARPU growth of 4.1% offset by video subscriber losses which totaled 409,000. We believe our residential rate adjustment at the beginning of the year was a significant contributor to both the ARPU increase and the video subscriber loss in the quarter. Wireless revenue increased 52% to $343 million, driven by 216,000 additional lines bringing us to 2.3 million total lines. Advertising revenue in the quarter was flat at $557 million. Excluding political, core advertising was down 4.6%. Turning to expenses, Cable Communications first quarter expenses increased 3.4% driven primarily by non-programming expenses, which increased 4.5% in part due to COVID-19 customer-facing employee pay increases and bad debt expense, which increased about 40% to $156 million in the quarter, including an increase in the reserve due to COVID 19. For the quarter, Cable Communications EBITDA grew by 6.1% and margins reached 40.7%, reflecting 60 basis points of year-over-year improvement. Cable capital expenditures decreased 6.9%, resulting in CapEx intensity of 8.5%, down 100 basis points year-over-year. Declines in the quarter were across CPE, line extensions and support capital, partly offset by an 8.3% increase in scalable infrastructure. So now I will touch on what we are currently experiencing in Cable Communications in the second quarter with a reminder of the earlier caveat on the rapidly changing environment. Residential high-speed data net adds are off to a solid start in April. The residential high-speed data revenue growth rate is expected to ease off modestly due to our proactive response to COVID-19, specifically our Keep Americans Connected Pledge, which we recently extended to June 30. We expect to see business services revenue growth moderate to low single-digit year-over-year levels for the second quarter, resulting from the net effect of COVID-19 economic pressures affecting our business customer base with some customers having paused service during lockdowns while others are requesting higher-tiered Internet service as they remain open, often in a remote fashion, which makes their high-speed data service all the more important to them. On the video side, I mentioned earlier that our first quarter net losses were 409,000, which were 288,000 higher than our net losses during the same period last year. We don't see video trends changing as we begin the second quarter, and so we could see a similar year-over-year increase in the number of video customer net losses in the second quarter, likely still a reflection of our beginning-of-year rate increase as well as changing consumer preferences and economic stress. COVID-19 began to impact cable advertising at the end of the first quarter, and we expect advertising to be down significantly in the second quarter. Turning to our outlook for expenses and margins, for programming costs, we continue to expect increases in the second half of 2020 as a result of anticipated programming renewals. We continue to approach programming renewals with a high level of discipline, and we expect sports and other programming to eventually return, driving viewership and overall engagement. For non-programming costs, we expect to continue to bear for a period of time both COVID-related operating expenses, specifically wage increases for our frontline employees; and elevated levels of bad debt expense. Such expenses are expected to be more than offset by expense declines related to slowdown in activity in some aspects of our business and ongoing cost discipline. Taking all this together, we expect to meet our original full year cable EBITDA margin outlook of up to 50 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion. We also expect to meet our full year CapEx intensity outlook for approximately 50 basis points of year-over-year improvement, driven by an increase in network investment offset by declines in CPE, line extensions and support capital. Now I'll turn to NBCUniversal's results on Slide 7. Revenue declined 7% to $7.7 billion and EBITDA was down 25.3% to $1.7 billion, reflecting a challenging film comparison, which was expected, as well as the impact of theme park and theater closures directly resulting from COVID-19. Cable Networks revenue was flat at $2.9 billion and EBITDA was down 1.2% to $1.2 billion. While content licensing and other revenue was strong, up 13% due to the timing of certain SVOD deliverables in addition to a healthy contribution from our digital businesses, distribution revenue declined by 1.5%, resulting from the expected lack of programming renewals, combined with accelerated subscriber losses. Advertising revenue declined 2.2%. Turning to broadcast, revenue was up 8.8% in the first quarter to $2.7 billion as a result of strong content licensing and retrans while EBITDA was up 30% to $501 million driven by this strong revenue growth as well as the benefit of an industry accounting change related to how content is amortized. Advertising revenue was flat. Taking the television businesses together, advertising results at both cable networks and broadcast were impacted at the end of the first quarter due to the postponement of sports resulting from COVID-19. Looking ahead, we anticipate advertising revenue will materially weaken from the first quarter due to the continued postponement of sports as well as the shape of the economic recovery as it reopens from COVID-19 shutdowns. Somewhat offsetting the advertising declines in the second quarter will be lower sports rights amortization given we amortize those rights during the period in which games air. As already announced, the Summer Olympic Games have been moved to 2021, and we remind you that we expect no financial loss in 2020 for this delay. As a result of this change in Olympics timing, in addition to accelerated subscriber losses, we now expect distribution revenue in the Cable Network segment to decline low single-digit percentages for the full year. Film revenue in the first quarter declined by 22.5% to $1.4 billion, and EBITDA declined by 71% to $106 million partly due to challenging comparisons to How to Train Your Dragon and The Grinch, further aggravated by exhibitor closings. In response to these shutdowns, we immediately and proactively moved our theatrical films to a premium video on-demand service. While we're very pleased with the PVOD success, the particular circumstances of each film are unique and we will determine our future distribution approach on a title-by-title basis. Looking forward, we anticipate film revenue and EBITDA to decline substantially, particularly in the second and third quarters as a result of moving our two most highly anticipated feature films, the next installment of Fast and Furious as well as Minions two, to 2021. Theme parks revenue in the first quarter declined 32% to $869 million and EBITDA declined 85% to $76 million due in part to lingering softness in Japan prior to COVID-19, which was subsequently aggravated by the closures of Universal Studios Japan on February 29, Universal Studios Hollywood on March 14 and Universal Orlando Resort on March 16, all a direct result of COVID-19. At this point, all of our theme parks are closed, and we do not know when they will reopen. To help you understand the impact of park closures, were the parks to remain closed the entirety of the second quarter we would expect to incur an EBITDA loss at parks of roughly $500 million in the quarter. The parks team is balancing near-term financial discipline with maximizing the long-term value of this business, and this is a dynamic effort on their part as the situation continues to develop. We remain very confident that the parks business will generate healthy returns over the long term. Nonetheless, we have decided to pause construction of Orlando's fourth gate or Epic Universe at this early stage while we focus on the immediate challenges that COVID-19 presents, while the final stages of work continue in full force for Super Nintendo World Japan, which is expected to open later this year; and Universal Beijing, which remains on schedule to open in 2021. Now, let's move on to Sky results on Slide 8. As a reminder, I will be referring to Sky's growth rates on a constant-currency basis, consistent with what's reflected in our earnings release. For the first quarter 2020, Sky revenue decreased 3.7% to $4.5 billion and EBITDA declined 15% to $551 million. COVID-19 has resulted in the postponement of many sporting events throughout our Sky markets, which started to impact our results in the second half of the quarter. This postponement was the primary driver of the 1.9% decline in direct-to-consumer revenue and 10.5% decline in content revenue. Advertising revenue also decreased by 11.6% due to overall market weakness, which was exacerbated by COVID-19, as well as continuation of the unfavorable impact from a change in legislation related to gambling advertisements in the UK and Italy, which we expect to lap in the third quarter. Given the significant revenue associated with Sky Sports and the fact that sports packages are sold separately, the complete shutdown of sports presents a unique risk of customer attrition, if unaddressed. In light of that challenge, our approach has been to allow our customers to pause their sports-related subscription payments during this time, which mitigates the risk of customer disconnects and keeps us in control of turning this revenue stream back on when sports return. As we look to the rest of the year, we do anticipate, based on reports coming out of each country that most major sports will return to complete their current seasons, although at different times for different sports across the Sky markets. In terms of financial impact, due to the significant pause in sports revenue impacting our residential, commercial and wholesale revenue, the deferral of sports rights cost amortization into the quarter when games are played as well as the headwinds we face with advertising revenue due to the economic pressures of the current environment, we expect Sky EBITDA for the second and third quarters combined to decline roughly 60% year-over-year. Between the second and third quarters, the split in results is difficult to predict since it is very sensitive to the proportion of the remainder of season play between the two quarters in each market, hence the commentary on the second and third quarters combined. While the impact on Sky due to the shutdown of sports is significant and unfortunate, our approach to customer retention gives us confidence that when sports return for their new seasons later in the year, the Sky Sports business will snap back as well. In terms of Sky's 2020 investment agenda, which includes Sky Q acceleration and the launch of broadband in Italy, COVID-19 will cause some delays in execution but we still expect to complete them in due course given their very healthy returns. Fortunately, the impact of COVID-19 on global sports and, therefore, on Sky feels to us to be finite. Sky is a strong business with 24 million customers paying us over $50 per month. And we firmly believe the return to a normalized sports schedule and an end to shelter in place should enable Sky to capitalize on its leading products and brands so as to return to its trajectory of long-term growth. Wrapping up on Slide 9 with free cash flow and capital allocation. Free cash flow was $3.3 billion in the quarter, and we paid $977 million in dividends. Consolidated total capital, which includes CapEx as well as software and intangibles, decreased 5.3% in the first quarter to $2.5 billion driven by declines across all of our businesses, and we now anticipate a modest year-over-year decline for the full year. We anticipate working capital to be roughly in line with last year, with declines at NBCU and Sky resulting from delays in content production and sports programming, offset by an increase in cable. We expect the significant disruption from COVID-19 on EBITDA at NBCU and Sky to pressure our leverage ratio until the affected portions of those businesses have returned and ramped back up. As a result, we no longer expect to resume share repurchases in 2021. Finally, we remain committed to our long-standing balanced capital allocation approach of maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing organically for growth and returning capital to shareholders through a strong commitment to our recurring dividend and an eventual return to share repurchases. So with that, I'll turn it back to Marci who I welcome to the Comcast team. She couldn't have joined at a more interesting time, and it's clear that we are very lucky to have her onboard. And lastly, it's Mike on your parks question, Craig. It's something well short of typical. Seasonally through the year, we're operating at typical seasonal levels, which are, for the most part of the year, well below full capacity anyway. And so then versus typical, I would guess that we're breaking even and certainly when we get to sort of 50% of typical, which will be well below capacity on average. And I think another point would just be versus the number I gave for $500 million in second quarter loss if the parks are closed for the full quarter, as Jeff said, if they're closed longer, there's ability to flex and do more and change that long-term rate if we are staying closed. But on the other side of that, if we open and have lower attendance, at the lower end because our priority is going to be to make the parks safe, and so we're not going to push for attendance. But at pretty low levels of return attendance as things ramp up, we'll be in better shape than were the parks to be closed. So I'll take that. It's Mike, Phil. So in terms of puts and takes on cash, as I said, for total capital spend, we've got we're down 5%, 5.2% in the first quarter with declines across all businesses. And I think the natural that will naturally be where we expect the full year to be, which would be sort of modestly down in 2020 versus 2019 across all of our businesses for the host of reasons, some things just getting slowed down, some things getting paused like Epic Universe. So in any event, total capital is down modestly for the year. And then on working capital, it's the toughest one to predict, lots of volatility and unpredictability in it. But that said, my commentary there was that we'd expect to be roughly flat for the full company, best I can tell as we're sitting here now. And that's really on the back of increases that we'll see in the cable business this year. We got an extra payroll period. We'll do political ads in the fourth quarter that don't get paid until the until we're in the first quarter 2021, etcetera. So and then just a little bit of expected slowdown in consumer payment is why working capital will be up year-over-year in cable, and that offsets declines at NBCU and Sky, which is caused by slowdown in production typically in the TV and film businesses and a little bit of impact on sports. But I'd caveat that one. As we continue conversations with especially with sports-related partners like the Olympics, etc., those numbers could change over the course of the year. But those are the various puts and takes. And then on leverage ratio, it's important to us that we get back to the leverage ratio commitments we gave to the rating agency. That continues to be a top priority. I think obviously we're going to be delayed in getting there because of the pressure on EBITDA that comes from COVID particularly related to parks. So it will take time for those to ramp back up. And I think our focus as Brian said, we've got lots of opportunity in our existing businesses, and that will be priority number two. And I would never say we wouldn't be taking a look at things that are sort of inorganic opportunities but the bar would be pretty high."

            "name": "Jeremy Darroch",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. Yes. So we've broadly stepped into sports customers, as Brian said, and have paused many of our sports customers' subscriptions. We unbundled sports. So we thought that was a very sensible way to manage in an environment where essentially the sports season's gone away for now. That, of course, means that the level of cancellations we've had in sports is de minimis. So we think that positions us well to bring customers back when the sports season resumes. In terms of negotiations with sports rights holders, we are talking pretty much to everybody at the moment. That covers a range of things, but firstly, how do we get sports back, which I think is in everybody's interest. So we're working with rights holders, with governments around what we can do to create a safe environment so that sports can come back. The assumption is that sports does come start to come back over the summer, as Mike talked about. And then in terms of the future on sports renegotiations and new contracts, I mean, the principle is that our my approach doesn't need to change because we start with value, and the value that we see, we bid against that value in a disciplined way. One of the advantages I think about the way sports are sold in Europe is that, typically, we're on shorter cycles. The average cycle will be three, perhaps four years. So that does give us the opportunity. While we think there's some form of reset that's required and we see a different we take a different view in terms of value to get, by the way, obviously, we'll we're thinking about that all the time but particularly at the moment, and we'll reflect that in due course. Thanks. Jeremy here jumping in. The answer is yes, Craig. It will form a bigger part of our mix. It's another string to our bow, if you like. But we'll do that in complement to our main services as well. Sky Q, which had been a priority for us, as you know, going into this year, one of the slightly frustrating things as it was going really very well at the start of the year, slightly had to take a step back because of the crisis. But it reminds me of the strength of our platform. But we can push hard on OTT, all of our streaming services. We're already providing Sky Q directly over fiber in Italy. And all of these provide us with good alternatives and different ways to get to customers in this environment."

            "name": "Dave Watson",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. So there I think there are a handful of things certainly broadband-related when you think about structural opportunities going forward. But even before that, I'd start with the amazing work that the team did in taking 90% of our call center agents and getting them to work from home. So whether or not that stays at that level, we don't know. We'll figure out the right balance going forward. But there has to be a structural benefit in being able to figure that out very quickly and effectively. I think from a broadband standpoint, the process we had already been investing strong product road map around self-install capability, but we've enhanced it with the drop-and-go capability. We leave the SIK kit, provide telephonic and chat support, and those are going to be benefits that I think we'll have going forward. And most certainly, as Brian talked about, our digital tools, a very strong road map there between xFi, My Account and the Xfinity Assistant, the chat capability, these things are game changers and provided, I think, a nice uptick during this period, but I think a lot of that will be sustainable. I think you covered it well in sports. On wireless, Doug, we continue to like our current approach. Even in this moment, we see that all the major areas that we've been focused on around broadband churn yes, there'll be a little bit of impact on retail through this period, but between Bring Your Own Device, new device launches, we continue to be real pleased with the trajectory of the wireless business. As to opportunities, spectrum and/or the relationship, we like our relationship, current one that we have. We're always going to be staring at ways of making improvements to it over time, but the fundamentals are very good. And in regards to spectrum, nothing new to report. We will be opportunistic if it makes sense to our business. Overall, the third objective is to be profitable at scale, and we feel very comfortable with where we're going. Got it, Brian. Craig, so this is what we are experiencing right now is primarily, as you noted an SMB issue. In a number of businesses where Mike mentioned earlier, where we have paused their accounts, there is no question, there has been an uptick, an increase. But the rate of that increase is declining. And so you take that, it's not a huge number but it's we're working with our clients to stay very focused on that. There will be some impact for sure as we go into Q2. But overall, to counter, as you referenced, in SMB, we're still the challenger with around 40% or so penetration. So there the fundamentals of SMB are still very good, and there's penetration upside. We're going to go after it. And we still are getting a fair amount of connect business even during this period. So our team's on it. We've had to redeploy folks. People that were out working in communities are now doing driving demand in other ways. And it's and we're getting some effective responses. So we'll stay on that. I think that last point before I turn it over is, over the last decade plus since launching, we started off with SMB, still the primary part of our business. But we have most definitely materially diversified to midsized and enterprise business now. So these segments are really important for us right now, will be in the future. That's where most of the penetration upside is. So really proud of our Bill Stemper, the business services team, great local operations that have moved on a dime to handle a lot of this at this moment, but we certainly are planning for multiple scenarios. We'll work with our small business clients. We want to be a partner with them, getting them through it. And so I am optimistic coming out of it, and we'll be there for them when that happens. Thanks, Brian. John, so as Brian said, this has been our top priority, continues to be our top priority going forward. And our mission has been to redefine what great broadband is, and Brian hit it. It's we're investing, and we have a really great product road map that really hits on all of it, speed, coverage control and now streaming with the addition of Flex and all the content that comes with it. So in this moment, robust, reliable network that can consistently handle this uptick in data consumption as well as all the devices with the WiFi coverage in the home, we have invested and built the network that can stand up to this moment, and it's going to be important going forward. So and we're not standing still, but we're going to continue to improve the value of broadband. And I mentioned introducing Flex that comes with our included in our broadband service, and this is focused for the broadband-only segment. And Jeff mentioned Peacock already. This comes with Peacock comes with Flex. High levels of engagement with content, it's a great video addition to the broadband service. So but to your main point, John, even in this environment, you have lower move activity that's suppressing some of the activity, but there are many sources of new broadband share opportunity. And we continue to compete for share from the primary competitors. That's a big source of business even right now that we take share from folks, we just have a better product and that's proven out and people need it right now, and we'll continue to. There's still a lot of DSL. There is some nevers, never broadbands out there. You had mentioned mobile-only. People are finding you need broadband. And I think once they experience what xFi is, I think we're optimistic about them staying with it. So along with historic record churn, I think we're proving right now that we can attract new business for broadband as we go forward. So you look at the 477,000 in Q1 that we feel we took out there's no Internet Essentials in that number. There's appropriate reserve that we took out for bad debt projections. It's not material in Q1, but we took it. And we think that going forward, April, as Mike mentioned, is a very good start. It's impossible to say how things are going to play out through the quarter. But the fundamentals and the momentum that we have, I think we've proven that we can drive connects and that we have we'll maintain solid churn. So I'm optimistic about our momentum as we go into the rest of the year."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone. Joining me on this morning's call are Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh, Dave Watson, Jeff Shell, and Dana Strong. Brian and Mike will make formal remarks, while Dave, Jeff and Dana will also be available for Q&A. Let me now refer you to Slide 2, which contains our safe harbor disclaimer and remind you that this conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our 8-K and trending schedules for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. With that, let me turn the call over to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?\nBrian Roberts: Thanks Marci, and good morning, everyone. We just reported a strong fourth quarter to end a year that had a number of important financial milestones. In 2021, we generated record high revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow with contributions coming from across the company. These results reflect our resilience, strategic decision-making and disciplined approach to capital allocation, which is driven by a relentless focus on growth and creating long-term value. I'm incredibly proud of how we've navigated through the past two years amid the unique and ongoing challenges posed by the global pandemic. We've been able to quickly pivot when necessary in order to continue offering world-class connectivity, entertainment and experiences while simultaneously prioritizing the health and well-being of our customers, guests and employees. So now turning to the specifics. Our Broadband centric businesses, Residential, Business Services and Wireless help drive 11% adjusted EBITDA growth and a 190 basis points of organic margin expansion in Cable. And while the quarterly cadence may have come in differently than we expected, we added 1.1 million customer relationships and 1.3 million net broadband subscribers, bringing total customer relationships to 34.2 million and total broadband subscribers to 31.9 million as of year-end. In Wireless, our unique and recently enhanced relationship with Verizon enabled us to bring a more competitive offering for our wireless customers that also improve the economics for us resulting in our largest annual growth in wireless lines yet, while reaching profitability on a standalone basis for the first time since launch. The recovery to our Theme Parks is truly remarkable. We just reported the most profitable fourth quarter on record with demand especially high in Orlando, which had the best quarter in the company's history for any quarter. I'm even more excited for our newest Theme Park, Epic Universe, which is in construction as we speak. Hollywood and Osaka are also on a great trajectory. And we just opened Universal Beijing, which will provide a more meaningful contribution in the years to come. We also accomplished a lot on the content side. We are back to normalized levels of programming and production at both NBCU and Sky. We successfully renewed a number of sports rights agreements, including the NFL, Bundesliga, PGA Tour, Premier League and others, which provides us great visibility for the next several years and we're monetizing IP through creative new windows. I'll share more detail on Peacock in a bit. But 2021 was a fantastic year for our fast-growing streaming service, which has outperformed our high expectations. At Sky, our UK businesses maintain wonderful momentum with very strong trends across all metrics, including customer relationships, ARPU and churn and fueling Sky's full-year EBITDA growth of 10%. Germany is showing signs of a successful recovery and in Italy, we're managing the impact of the transition in our sports rights even better than we had expected. Finally, on 2021, I'd like to highlight the strength of our balance sheet and the increase in the amount of capital we returned to shareholders. We hit our leverage goals a bit earlier than we had anticipated during the pandemic, which enabled us to repurchase $4 billion of stock, the majority completed in the back half of the year. And including our dividend, we returned a total of $8.5 billion more than double that of 2020. Now, let me discuss our priorities for 2022. First is broadband, which is a healthy, scale business with a structurally advantageous financial profile defined by high operating leverage and margin accretion. We believe that the broadband market conditions in 2022 will continue to be impacted by COVID. And within this environment, we will strike the right balance between subscriber acquisition against a large and expanding addressable market as well as long-term profitable growth. On that front, we will evaluate every opportunity to increase our serviceable passings even more so than we have in the past. We will take advantage of the natural progression of new household and business formation, as well as the potential subsidies from the federal, state and local governments to expand into unserved areas. We will also aggressively compete for market share through our strategy of bundling products around broadband, so that every customer in every segment has plenty of choice at the right price. Convergence with Xfinity Mobile will play a big role. In terms of marketing, how our sales force operates, packaging and the overall interface we have with our customers. Scaling this business is a key focus for us in '22 and beyond. And we will do everything we can to continue to improve the experience for our customers and maintain the high levels of retention that started well before the pandemic. Our AI technologies and digital service tools enable us to resolve issues without a call or visit. In fact, this past quarter, total calls handled by our agents decreased 18% year-over-year and truck rolls declined by 16% while we continue to grow our customer base and increase our NPS scores. Broadband connectivity has never been as important as it is now to all of us. And people increasingly expect more than just speed. They also want innovative products that are easy to use and consistent and reliable service throughout their home, that's what we deliver. We have an incredible network, but what differentiates us even more is the ecosystem we've built around this network. We spent the last several years developing the right processes, finding the right technology and hiring the right people so that we can execute at great scale. I'll share a couple of tangible examples that illustrate this. We are moving aggressively on a path to 10G, while maintaining our level of CapEx intensity. It's still early, but we already are out in the marketplace with our new technology and higher upload speeds in some of the markets. And we will continue to expand this in 2022 and beyond. We also just launched the first WiFi 6E gateway, truly the first DOCSIS 4.0 device with the capability of delivering multi-gigabit speed. Our goal is to continue to innovate on top of this and further widen the gap between the in-home experience that we offer versus any of the competition. Priority number two is Peacock. Premium video consumption continues to increase across the industry currently approaching 600 billion hours per year in the U.S., up from 350 billion hours annually in the broadcast led era of the early 1990s. We've also seen that the average household spend on video continues to grow by over 10% since 2014 alone, which is constantly expanding the addressable market. NBCUniversal has played a significant part in this ecosystem ranking as the number one TV portfolio audience and number two film business in box office with incredible engagement. Today, NBCU reaches over 100 million U.S. households, which is nearly 80% of the population every quarter. Of that 100 million, Nielsen reports that nearly 60 million households watch at least 10 hours of our content every single month. That's more households than our competitors in both linear TV and streaming. When we introduced Peacock to you back in early 2020, our vision was to launch a streaming service that offers premium content and is supported primarily by advertising. What we've learned so far is that we started with the right business model. With over 300 million hours of content consumed on Peacock per month, the engagement with our platform has proven extremely valuable to advertisers. We also realized the importance of diversity when it comes to genres. And so we added sports. We introduced early access movies and we started ramping up some originals. Behind these investments, we found ourselves well on our way to exceeding the MAA and revenue targets we initially discussed. In fact, at the end of 2021 we had 24.5 million monthly active accounts in the U.S. or about 75% of the guidance we have provided for 2024. Within these 24.5 million MAA are over 9 million paid subscribers approaching $10 in paid ARPU, which includes the advertising. And that is without much focus on paid subscriber growth. We have another 7 million highly engaged bundled subscribers from Xfinity and other top distributors who use Peacock every single month. And currently receive Peacock Premium at no extra cost. We expect strong conversion of this group to paid subscribers over time. We've accomplished all this despite our movies and NBC content still premiering on other streaming services through the end of 2021 including HBO and Hulu and with the majority of our best content still to come. We just started including the NFL, our Pay-One movie deal kicks in this year and we have a growing number of originals in the pipeline. Our research indicates that 80% of consumers prefer an ad-supported service over a higher cost ad free SVOD offering. We see this in our customer mix, with the vast majority of our paid subscribers choosing the $5 paid AVOD tier over the $10 tier without ads. You combine this with the fact that our paid subscribers have much lower churn and significantly higher engagement and we think the most valuable end state for Peacock is to have two revenue streams. And so while we will continue to leverage the more than $20 billion of programming spend we already have across NBCU and Sky, we are committed to reallocating and increasing investment on top of this to drive further growth in paid subscribers, which we believe is the right path to creating long-term value. I couldn't be more excited about the momentum we are seeing with Peacock in the U.S. as well as the international opportunities ahead. In late 2021, we introduced Peacock on Sky in the U.K. and Ireland. That earlier this week we announced the rollout of Germany and Austria and plans are in place for our own Sky Showtime joint venture to launch later this year. Next, our company's third priority for 2022 is to monetize and expand the reach of our proprietary global technology platform and our addressable customer base. In October, we launched Sky Glass in the U.K. and XClass in the U.S. both build upon our investments in X1, Flex and Sky Q. This year, we'll continue to evolve the strategy to incorporate more markets, additional partners and new distribution outlets. I look forward to updating you on our progress. Our fourth priority is to continue to have a positive impact on society and the communities we serve. A big part of that work is our commitment to DE&I and Digital Equity. A decade ago, we created Internet Essentials, which has become the nation's largest low income broadband adoption program and we have recently expanded our efforts with the launch of Lift Zones where we brought free WiFi to more than a 1,000 community centers around the country. These are just two examples of how our teams have come together to help connect more people to the tools and resources they need to succeed in a digital world. So I am really proud of our many accomplishments in 2021 and extremely optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead for our company. I firmly believe that our integrated strategy with the assets, capabilities and talent we have today will continue to drive growth across our businesses and create long-term shareholder value. Mike?\nMichael Cavanagh: Thanks, Brian, and good morning everyone. I'll begin on slides 4 and 5 with our consolidated 2021 financial results. Revenue increased 9.5% to $30.3 billion for the fourth quarter and 12% to $116.4 billion for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 17% to $8.4 billion for the fourth quarter and 13% to $34.7 billion for the full year. Adjusted EPS increased 38% to $0.77 per share for the fourth quarter and 24% to $3.23 for the full year. And we generated $3.8 billion of free cash flow for the fourth quarter and $17.1 billion for the year on a reported basis, which includes a $1.3 billion benefit related to the tax impact of the bond exchange we completed in August, $620 million of which fell in the fourth quarter as well as roughly $1 billion from returns on investing activities, most of which occurred in the fourth quarter. Excluding these items, free cash flow was $14.8 billion for the year. Now, let's turn to our business segment results, starting with Cable Communications on Slide 6. For the fourth quarter, Cable revenue increased 4.5% to $16.4 billion, EBITDA increased 7.8% to $7.1 billion, and net cash flow grew 9.2% to $4.5 billion. For the full year, we grew customer relationships by 1.1 million with 169,000 net additions in the fourth quarter. Overall customer growth continues to be driven by broadband where we added 1.3 million net new residential and business customers for the year and 212,000 in the fourth quarter. Our net adds this quarter reflect the continuation of lower overall marketplace activity, particularly move activity compared to historical trends. While this resulted in lower connect volumes, it also contributed to high levels of customer retention with broadband churn improving to the lowest rate for any fourth quarter on record. Broadband was also the largest contributor to our Cable revenue growth with broadband revenue increasing 8.5% in the quarter driven by the strong net additions over the past year, as well as healthy growth in average revenue per customer. Moving to Wireless, revenue increased 40% driven by growth in customer lines and higher device sales. Overall, we added 1.2 million lines for the year and 312,000 lines in the quarter, the best result since launching this business in 2017, bringing total mobile lines to 4 million. As Brian noted, over the past year we have made tremendous strides fully integrating wireless into our core cable operations, achieving standalone profitability of $157 million this year. Now that we've crossed strongly into profitability and the business is deeply integrated into our core cable operations, we won't be disclosing standalone wireless EBITDA going forward. Business Services revenue increased 11.5% or approximately 7% excluding the acquisition of Masergy, which closed at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Our strong organic results were driven by customers taking faster data speeds, higher attach rates of our advanced products and rate increases on some of our services, as well as the continued growth in our customer base, which grew by 63,000 net new customers over the past year with 17,000 additions in the fourth quarter. For Video, revenue declined 1.2% driven by customer net losses totaling 1.7 million over the past year, including 373,000 in the fourth quarter, partially offset by higher average revenue per customer. This higher revenue per customer was driven by the residential rate adjustment we implemented at the beginning of 2021, which we believe was also a driver of video subscriber losses. We implemented a similar rate increase earlier this month, so we expect this trend to continue throughout 2022. Last, advertising revenue decreased to 12.5% reflecting lower political advertising compared to record levels in last year's fourth quarter. Excluding political, advertising was up 9% with modest growth in core and double-digit growth in advanced advertising. Turning to expenses, Cable Communications' fourth quarter expenses increased 2%. Programming expenses decreased one 1.2%, reflecting a decline in video customers, partially offset by higher rates. As we enter 2022, programming expenses should reflect the benefit of fewer contract renewals, combined with the impact from our anticipated decline in overall video customers. Non-programming expenses increased 4.1% and were flat on a per relationship basis, reflecting investment to drive organic growth in the business as well as the expenses related to our recent acquisition of Masergy. The primary driver of the year-over-two-year [ph] change was technical and product support, which increased about 10% largely related to growth in our Wireless business and was partially offset by lower bad debt and customer service expense. Cable Communications EBITDA increased 7.8% to $7.1 billion for the fourth quarter and Cable EBITDA margin reached 43.4%, reflecting 130 basis points of year-over-year improvement. We believe we are striking the right balance by continuing to invest in our growth businesses, which are driving the top line and proving to be a great return for us, while at the same time continuing to increase our operating efficiency and take unnecessary cost out of the business. All of this together should enable us to drive higher profitability and expand margins both in 2022 and thereafter. Cable capital expenditures increased 3.7% in the quarter and 4.9% for the year, resulting in capex intensity of 10.8%, our lowest full year on record and essentially in line with 2020s 11% driven by lower spending on customer premise equipment and support capital, partially offset by higher spending on scalable infrastructure and line extensions. As we noted on our call in July, we expect our cable capex intensity will remain around 11% for the next few years as we continue to increase the number of homes and businesses that we pass and accelerate our investment and the technology that will enhance the overall capacity of our network, both downstream and upstream. This is a direct step to DOCSIS 4.0, which allows for multi-gig symmetrical speeds essentially with the software update providing very little to no disruption to the home in a very capital efficient way. Now, let's turn to Slide 7 for NBCUniversal. Starting with total NBCUniversal results, revenue increased 26% to $9.3 billion and EBITDA decreased 6.8% to $1.3 billion. Media revenue increased 8.4% to $5.8 billion, driven by higher distribution and advertising revenue with a significant contribution from Peacock. Distribution revenue increased 12% reflecting higher rates post the successful completion of several carriage renewals at the end of 2020 and a growing contribution from Peacock due to our growth in paid subscribers, partially offset by subscriber declines at our networks. As a reminder, beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we will lap these carriage renewals. Advertising revenue increased 6% reflecting higher pricing, which benefited from our strong upfront and a growing contribution from Peacock, which was only partially offset by ratings declines and a difficult comparison to record levels of political advertising at our local stations and last year's fourth quarter. Media EBITDA decreased 49% to $721.1 million in the fourth quarter, including a $559 million EBITDA loss at Peacock. Excluding Peacock, Media EBITDA decreased 24% reflecting higher costs associated with more sporting events at our regional sports networks compared to last year when the NBA and NHL delayed the start of their seasons due to COVID-19 as well as higher television programming and marketing costs, driven by the return of our full schedule compared to last year when our schedule was impacted by COVID-19. This difficult cost comparison will continue in the first quarter. Before moving on, I want to build on Brian's comments regarding Peacock. In 2021, Peacock generated revenue of nearly $800 million and an EBITDA loss of $1.7 billion, which includes content spend of over $1.5 billion. Even with a relatively limited programming slate we've achieved a level of success in MAAs, paid subs and engagement that is driving our decision to double our content spend on Peacock in 2022 to over $3 billion with the goal of ramping domestic content spend to $5 billion over the next couple of years, some of which will be incremental and some of which will be a reallocation from linear programming. For 2022, while we expect a significant step up in revenue, the incremental investment we are spending in both content and marketing and service will likely result in an EBITDA loss of roughly $2.5 billion. While the timing of when Peacock breaks even maybe pushed out from where we originally expected, we believe pursuing a dual revenue stream is the right strategy to create long-term value, and given the strength in our Theme Parks and high margin linear businesses, the good news is that we will fund this pivot out of NBCUniversal cash flows. Moving next to Studios, revenue increased 36% to $2.4 billion but EBITDA declined 34% to $51 million. This decline was driven by the timing of our film slate, partially offset by growth in TV content licensing. Film has a multi-year business model with titles monetized over time as they transition through different theatrical and licensing windows. As a result of pausing film releases in 2020 during the pandemic, we had fewer new titles come into the licensing window in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago. And at the same time, marketing costs were higher as we released Sing 2 and Halloween Kills in theaters. This impact of fewer carryover titles and higher year-over-year marketing costs associated with more theatrical releases will begin to diminish as we move forward, but will continue to pressure EBITDA growth for the next few quarters. Last, at Theme Parks, revenue increased by $1.2 billion to $1.9 billion and we generated EBITDA of $674 million, which was our highest on record for any fourth quarter driven by strong momentum in the U.S. and Japan. At our U.S. parks, we benefited from strong domestic attendance and per caps that were above pre-pandemic levels. At Universal Studios Japan we saw improved attendance levels as government-mandated capacity restrictions were eased during the quarter. At our newly opened park Universal Beijing, we are pleased with our first full quarter of operations where the level of demand from our guests was high, but overall attendance was impacted by COVID-related restrictions. Despite that, Beijing's EBITDA was essentially breakeven in the quarter and we anticipate modest profitability in our first full year of operation in 2022. For total Theme Parks, while we have been very pleased with the pace of our recovery, particularly in the U.S., we recognize that the business is subject to variability related to the pandemic, which tends to be more pronounced at our International Parks. Now let's turn to Slide 8 for Sky, which I will speak to on a constant currency basis. For the fourth quarter, Sky revenue decreased 2.5% to $5.1 billion as solid growth in the U.K. was offset by our results in Italy, where we continued transition through the change to our Serie A broadcast rights. Direct-to-Consumer revenue decreased 1% reflecting a modest decline in average revenue per customer relationship and overall customer relationship additions of 61,000 in the fourth quarter. This gain mostly came from a meaningful increase in streaming subscribers, primarily driven by seasonally strong entertainment content as well as a widely viewed sports schedule. The higher level of streaming additions in the quarter, more than offset the level of customer losses we experienced in Italy, which were also better than we had anticipated. In the U.K., Direct-to-Consumer revenue increased mid-single digits, driven by continued healthy customer additions, supported by record low churn and higher average revenue per customer. Revenue growth benefited from growth in broadband and wireless streaming and hospitality as pubs and clubs revenue has recovered back to 2019 levels. This was offset by a decrease in customer relationships and average revenue per customer in Italy both mainly due to the change in our Serie A broadcast rights. Rounding out the rest of revenue, Content revenue declined 23% driven by the change in sports licensing agreements in Italy in Germany. And advertising revenue increased 1% with healthy growth in the U.K. and Germany, mostly offset by a decline in Italy. Turning to our EBITDA results; Sky's EBITDA increased 188% to $464 million, driven by our strong performance in the U.K. and improvements in Germany and Italy. Overall, the results reflect lower sports programming costs due to resets in our sports rights, partially offset by a change in sports rights amortization, which resulted in an increase of $130 million. As a reminder, we announced this change last quarter. It did not impact our full year results but it does impact the quarterly pattern of recognizing sports rights amortization costs with expenses higher in the first and fourth quarters and lower in the second and third quarters. I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 9. As I mentioned previously, in 2021, we generated around $15 billion in organic free cash flow excluding the items I referred to earlier. Consolidated total capital increased 3.6% to $12.1 billion, largely driven by higher investment on our broadband network. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect Cable capex intensity to stay around 11% and NBCUniversal capex related to the construction of Epic Universe to be up around the $1 billion. Working capital was $1.5 billion for the year, a $1.3 billion increase over last year's level, reflecting a post-COVID ramp of investment in studio content and our broadcast of the Summer Olympics. But less than we originally expected, largely due to the timing of content spend at both NBCUniversal and Sky and a faster than expected recovery at Theme Parks. Turning to capital allocation, we ended the year with net leverage at 2.4 times and returned a total of $8.5 billion to shareholders, including $4.5 billion in dividend payments and $4 billion in share repurchases. For 2022 as I said previously, we expect to continue to maintain leverage at around current levels, which I expect will support continued strong capital returns. As we announced this morning, we are raising the dividend by $0.08 to $1.08 per share, our 14th consecutive annual increase and our Board of Directors has increased our share repurchase authorization to $10 billion. This capital allocation policy will allow us to maintain the balance we've talked about, investing organically in the businesses, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. So, thanks for joining us on the call this morning. With that, I'll turn it back to Marci who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Mike. Regina, let's open up the call for Q&A, please.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thank you. Good morning. I'd like to ask question about the sort of first two priorities, Brian, that you laid out at the top. So on broadband, you talked about a balance between volume and rate. Obviously, the environment is tricky right now. Maybe Dave, you could talk a little bit about your philosophy on pricing, bundling with wireless, whether there's an opportunity to sort of let wireless pull broadband through. And how you think that sort of segmentation activity can help net ads. And any expectations we should have about net ads for '22 would be helpful? And then I think for Jeff, obviously, after Netflix last week, the market\u2019s view on streaming has cooled a bit. And no surprise, you guys seem to be pacing on ARPU well ahead of where you thought, back when Steve presented the thesis a couple of years ago. Can you put sort of a business plan in front of us a little bit more? So we can understand the incremental investment, the kind of returns you expect? And how does this translate into sort of growth for NBC, the company over time? So we can get a little more context around your decision to step in this much. Thank you, guys.\nBrian Roberts: Thanks so much, and good morning. So I think demand, let me just start higher level with what I think our principles are. And then Dave can get into the specifics of some of the more detail that question. For broadband, just - demand just keeps going up. That's the importance of the product. And I think we're incredibly well-positioned to service our customers and monetize on the investments that we want to make. And the industry penetration has continue to expand. But despite that, we think we have a long runway for growth. We still believe with about 50% penetration in our footprint. That leaves us with the long part of the field to keep going. And we also are expanding the field, because we're able to grow the footprint and grow the addressable market, as I talked about given extensions and government subsidies and some of the investments by the government in broadband. And we're going to evaluate every opportunity we have to accelerate our passings. So from here, I expect the growth is going to be fueled by the strength of the network, focused on innovation and product differentiation. We're going to continue to improve our products to be best-in-class, increase our speeds, and always enhance the customer experience. And so, our ability to compete in segment to customers and do it throughout the entire market, not just regionally, I think these are all the advantages we've gotten where I think we're going to keep growing. But Dave, why don't you go into some of the pricing and volume and some of the questions that Ben asked.\nDavid Watson: Sure. Hey, Ben, so let me start with trends. You asked about that. And so we're seeing a lot of the same trends, we've experienced at the end of last year with connect activity remaining lower than what we experienced towards the end of last year. And one of the key drivers other than seasonality, just not being as normal. One of the key drivers of this is lower move activity. And when you look at external move data, which we track very closely compared to '19, this move data tracks fairly closely to our connect indexing. So, however, in terms of trending, the great news is churn. Churn is at record lows and continues to get better. So one other thing in terms of trending is our focus. We talked about, we go after every segment, and we're going to also make sure we're competitive in the income constraints segment. So it's early, but I think we've done a nice job marketing the benefits of the new ACP program. So in terms of trending, that's where things stand right now. Mobile, I think it's a very good point and totally agree. Our mobile is key for us, in and of itself is a great growth opportunity, but it's also very important to broadband. We've talked a lot about broadband and churn benefits that continues. But we want to bring mobile value to every segment in every offer. So as we segment the marketplace in broadband, and whether it's a standalone broadband relationship, which is fine, but we're going to talk about broadband and mobile. And every single product and offer construct, we will deliver that. And we're simplifying and converging mobile offers just to make sure every single sales channel is optimized to deliver on these offer constructs. So look more in '22. But more of that, as we go throughout the year. And then last but not least, is pricing. In terms of broadband, we've had a very consistent approach to broadband pricing. We've been competing for a long time, in all sorts of different competitive environments. And we focus on different levels of broadband speeds. We focus on innovation and surrounding broadband with product enhancements that are embedded within broadband like Flex, you get security, coverage, great gateway devices. And we just tested a device that points towards longer-term, where we can deliver four gigabits in this trial symmetrically, up and down. So we have a long roadmap of innovation that we feel very good about that will eventually go into pricing. So - but our general approach is a holistic one. In that we are not, we focus on every single product area, but it's the total bill that we look at. And so that is our main focus, leveraging speed tears, taking always a look at the total customer bill. And from that perspective, we're a little bit lighter on broadband, the last couple of years, including this year. And as in video, we take a little bit more in video because of the carriage renewals. You can see our pricing approach as we balanced just to your initial point, share and rate, we think we have a good formula. We be competing like this for some time, and we feel good about this approach going forward.\nJeff Shell: Hey, Ben, it's Jeff. So let me just give a little bit more color on Peacock. So going back to when we did our Investor Day, which is just over two years ago. We believe that the best model for us was an ad supported model. And we plan to offer and we did offer back at that point when we launched three different ways to get Peacock a free AVOD supported model, a light 499 light advertising supported dual revenue stream model with some more premium content. And then we offer - also offer a 999 SVOD product. At the time, we believed that the free AVOD product would kind of be our most popular and our leading product. What we found is that consumers are voting with their feet. And the vast majority of them are choosing the middle model, the 499 model with pretty more premium content, and a light ad load and ad load that's much lighter than linear and much lighter than some of our competitors. And that's resulted in some of the numbers that Brian and Mike laid out. Our MAAs are 24.5%, which is 75% of the way that to where we thought we'd be in '24 back then. We haven't really focused on paid subscribers. And we're already over 9 million people paying us real money. And when you add the fact that in Comcast territory and some other of our distributors, we offer this premium product bundled for free, and over time those will convert to pay. That's a pretty favorable model. And our ARPU has resulted in, has responded. I think in our Investor Day, we expected to get to $6 to $7 in ARPU, and we're already approaching $10 as Mike said in his comments. So this is really favorable for us. And what we've done is we've invested behind this, as Brian said. So we've put some more money into bringing our content back, our Pay-One movies, especially from HBO, which are going to be coming back later this year. And that's resulting in and the greater investment and the greater losses that were laid out. But we think also greater returns because this model is dual revenue stream model really mirrors our existing business. And we think that the peak investment year will probably be '23. Based on our plans, and then the revenue growth will overtake the investment growth and will start turning positive. The most important thing to keep in mind is that we're playing really a different game than our competitors. We've really believe that Peacock is not a separate business for us. It's an extension of our existing business, dual revenue stream. We are organized in our television business so that we run all of them together as one business. We programmed together as one business, picking the right model for each of our pieces of content to maximizes that. And we think over time, that's not just going to lead to good growth on Peacock, but it's going to lead to our TV business once we hit that peak investment period on Peacock returning the growth overall. So that we're as Brian said in the outset, we're number one on NBC. We're number one on news. We're -- our studios really strong. We have, in my opinion, the top content company in the world. And we're using that strength along with our business model to really play a different game in streaming than everybody else's. And we're really pleased with our performance so far.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thanks, everybody.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Ben. Regina, we'll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.\nPhil Cusick: Hey guys, thanks. So one follow-up and then a separate question. First, on the Peacock side, I think you have an opportunity to pull content back from Hulu this year. Does it make sense to do some of that as part of this Peacock investment or is this more organic? And then second, on capital return. You have a $10 billion buyback authorization. You think that's a good guide for 2022 or do you think it could be substantially different? Just given the -- what you've outlined today? Thanks very much.\nBrianRoberts: Jeff, why don't you start with the Hulu question.\nJeff Shell: Yes, thanks. Thanks for the question. So obviously, much of our strong NBC content, as Brian mentioned, premieres on Hulu. And over time, we'd like to bring that back to Peacock. But any discussions that we're having with Hulu, or will have Hulu we're really not going to comment on. So there's nothing really to report at this time.\nBrian Roberts: Mike.\nMichael Cavanagh: Thanks, Jeff. So and Phil so on capital return, I'd not take the authorization of $10 billion as a guide of anything. Not trying to send a signal there. That's the level that the board last authorized. We use some of that up, and we wanted to top it up as we started the year. And as you know, it's easy for us to go back when called for and quickly get greater authorization. So what I tell you to think about as we talk about capital return and buybacks is, Brian and I and all of us here have been talking about our excitement, and the imperative of getting back into balance where strong capital turn through dividends and buybacks, which has been a hallmark of this company over decades and decades. Would be back on the table, along with keeping the balance sheet strong, and obviously, prioritizing making high returning investments in our business, which we talked a lot about what's going on, on that side on the call earlier. So I think it sets us up to be at the place we're at now back in balance with leverage at 24. And I would point everybody not to number expect us to buyback, but rather the leverage level that I expect us to stay at, which is around this level of 2.4x. I think that is going to set this company up for in 2022 and beyond very strong capital returns. And the number you guys all come up with is really just a function of doing your model for your own growth. I think we're going to grow EBITDA. But there's a variety of views there. And I think we enumerated a lot of the areas from Epic, the park in -- theme park in Orlando, to Jeff's commentary and my commentary on expected losses of a Peacock as we invest there, yet that's to be funded out of cash flows that the business itself NBC media will generate. So we think that's a very thoughtful way of funding the pivot to future growth in the media side to name just a few. So and obviously, capex intensity a cable, maintaining at around the 11% level. I think is an important element for people to think about with Dave, having talked six months ago on this call about what he wanted to do to drive towards DOCSIS 4.0, which I think sets our network up for the future. So that's what I got for you on a capital return. Hopefully that hits it off for everybody.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Phil. Regina.\nPhil Cusick: If I can follow-up on one thing. You mentioned that working capital was a little lower in 2022 than for '21 you expected. How should we think about '22 versus '21? Thank you.\nMichael Cavanagh: I should - I could be nick quip, but your guess is good as mine, but really it's a hard number to forecast goes in. Obviously as we get back post-COVID and ramp up some production. I might tell you to expect it to trend a little bit higher than then it was and get back more towards 2019. But I said that last year and it didn't happen. So I will leave it to the point that it's a number that's, we're obviously when we spend money on working capital. We're expecting to get a good return. But I think it's somewhere in the range of where it's been, last year, the range would be where we were last year, or higher up to where we were in '19 pre-COVID. But I'm not in a position to give you a prediction other than give you some color.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks, Mike.\nMarci Ryvicker: All right. Thanks, Phil. Regina, next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. One for Brian, one for Dave. Brian on connected TV, what should we expect the next few years as guideposts for what you would consider success with your connected TV efforts. And now you have some learnings, early learnings with Sky Glass and XClass TV? Do you have all the assets you need to be as successful and CTV as you would like to be? Dave on the wireless side. AT&T indicated yesterday what investors already thought, which is that the overheated wireless market and net ads would slow in 2022. How does that dynamic or would that dynamic a slowing wireless market impact the pace of net ads and promotional strategy for Comcast? And sorry, David, as part of that, now that you've reached full-year profitability in that business, should we think the strategy going forward is to sort of invest in customer acquisition and sort of maintain your breakeven or site profitability, or even though you're not reporting anymore what should we expect margins to continue to improve on the wireless side of the cable business? Thank you.\nBrian Roberts: Okay, there's a lot in there. And, Dana, I may come to you in a moment, or just had to comment a little bit about Connected in our early days of Sky Glass and just maybe in general, how you see it sets us up for the future. But I think that's the big picture answer that I would give, Doug is that we see people connecting to our network in a variety of ways in the future, and different generations of customers have different needs. So from the great new Wi-Fi device that Dave just talked about to what we can do with a new platform whether that gets you into Telemedicine, gaming, education, above and beyond all the entertainment, that news that we're doing today. And so when you play with Sky Glass or a Connected television, you see the potential opening up, it also creates a potential for partnerships with companies that want to use that platform, when extend their own products to different ways. So it creates relevancy for us with consumers. And our early learnings have been, I think pretty spectacular. So Dana, why don't you take a minute and just what you'll hear about Sky Glass also can relate to eventually XClass TVs, but Dana over to you.\nDana Strong: Thanks, Brian and thanks, Doug, for the question. We appreciate it very much. I'll just start by saying really pleased 12 months in with how Sky performed in 2021. And I'd like to highlight landing EBITDA at a 10% growth rate really underpinned by the U.K., which continues to perform very well with growth in EBITDA revenue and customers. And a good turn as we head out of COVID here and we also have made the adjustment in our sports right strategy very successfully in Italy, in Germany with both entities outperforming our expectations. So I would say overall confidence in the Sky business as we walk into 2022 is feeling very good, feeling very confident about our growth prospects. And part of that also leads me to Glass because Glass is this will be our first full-year in Glass, we launched in the fourth quarter last year just before, we're really excited about it because it opens up new headroom for us. So what I mean by that is first, it opens up new customer segments as we move into an IP based service. So it gives us the opportunity to sell to customers that previously couldn't have that service because they weren't allowed Dishes. It opens up new customers who are more streaming focused, and value conscious customers. As we convert the cost of the TV into a monthly low cost price point like the mobile phone model, it opens up new value conscious segments for us. And it's important to kind of say that this is a really good retention product is it's a 24, 48 month contract. It also appeals to existing customers and it really deepens our relationship with them.  So feeling really good about how it appeals to new customer segments ensures that existing customers. The second big source of value for us is it's a new ability to make a margin on equipment. So that's new headroom for us. And the third area for us and Brian reference it's a new platform and what we mean by that is a new platform for innovation for future services, so whether that's syndication to new markets, like our Foxtel deal in Australia, or new services like fitness, watch together games and other things we've got in the hopper, we're feeling like this becomes a continuous source for innovation, to either drive retention or launch into new revenue streams, depending on what the service is. We're off to a strong start. So we've got a great reaction from the market. In the launch phase, we focused on our existing customer base, our most loyal customers as we always do on Sky, we're really excited as we head into quarter one, to open it up to general market, more so and really start to step on the pedal. So for us as we enter into 2022, we really feel that Sky is in a strong position. We think that Glass is really off to a strong start, we're feeling good across all of our products and markets. And we think Glass is a really important growth opportunity for the organization for all the reasons we just touched on, Brian.\nBrian Roberts: Good, Dana. Thank you, Doug. A couple of things. Just following quickly, on Dana's point, we're very excited that Cable Group in the U.S. focusing on that global tech stack, and being able to pull off connected devices. And over time, we'll be opportunistic with what Dana is doing. And that we're leveraging our organizations just brought over from Sky working both with Sky, with Cable, Fraser Stirling that's looking across at all product innovation. And not only video, but also broadband. And that global tech stack is really important for us, XClass TV, it's early, but every single aggregation point will be converged over time, so that I think that's a real leverage opportunity. On your point of wireless, I think the biggest thing, Doug, is that there's just so much upside for us, the way we look at it, every single broadband home is an opportunity and every single broadband home should have at least a couple of lines. So to me, the addressable market expands. And as we continue to build out and add more homes, just more opportunities. So we go after a converged approach with broadband, and mobile, and it's a real opportunity to drive share in and of itself, mobile is a great product. But when you add it together, it just gives value to every single segment that's unique to us, that we can do differently. So to me, '22 is a year of optimizing that, as I mentioned earlier that we're going to take every single sales channel, simplify the go-to-market approach, with mobile included for every segment, whether it's income constrained right on up, there'll be a mobile component in everything that we do. So I think there's just a really big opportunity over time, and you look at it from an operational standpoint, one bill, one app, converge features in and out, leveraging Wi-Fi. There's a lot of opportunities for us in mobile. And by the way, we just launched it in business services and small business, and we're having great early success there. So mobile, I think will impact us about everything we do. One last thing, just a quick clarification for folks. When I was talking about trending, it was I was talking about not the last quarter of course, I meant worse than 2019-2020. But just to clarify that.\nDoug Mitchelson: Helpful, thanks.\nMarci Ryvicker: Virginia, next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Securities.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. Two NBCU questions, first theme parks is a division which seems to have the most upside for the company. And once demand turns it tends to be this like a pent-up demand for years. So can you give us some color on like, what the underlying, what's going on underneath the surface? Are international visitors coming back yet? How much more leverage do you think you'll have in the parks? And what's the timing of Epic Universe opening? And then the second question, I just want to do a quick follow-up on Peacock. You came as you guys said you came out of the gate with a different strategy. But a lot has happened in the last two years with increasing global competition, can you just talk about your longer-term goals? Do you want to be a global platform, you seem more focused on profit and subs versus some of your competitors. How do you think about I guess, Jeff said you're managing the television business as one unit. So how do you think about differentiating content among your different TV businesses?\nMichael Cavanagh: Thanks, Jessica. So let me take those kind of in order. So first of all, it's impossible not just to be excited about our theme park business, we had a great year, we had a great fourth quarter as Brian mentioned. And really across all the metrics of that business, we haven't seen any impact of Omicron in Florida, for example and very limited impacts which we seem to be passed in Hollywood and Japan. So everything's kind of going in the right direction. And even as we start the first quarter, continuing in that direction, I think part of that, by the way is because we continue to invest in our attractions during the pandemic, as Brian also mentioned, with the lots of [indiscernible] in Orlando, and pets in Hollywood, and Nintendo, which is doing really well in Japan has led that park to rebound really, really quickly. So all signs are pointed up in our theme park business. And I agree with you, we have a lot of growth ahead, our international visitation has not returned to what it was historically would be in Florida, we generally are in the low 30s. Right now, we're just above 20 with most of that visitation now coming from the U.K., and Europe, Latin America hasn't returned yet. So we have upside there as people continue to increase travel. And we're also I should mention very happy with Beijing, which is open people love the park. And when travel opens up in China, after the Olympics, we are really optimistic of that park long-term. So everything is going well and then trending in the right direction. Epic is full steam ahead. We're, I was down there a couple of weeks ago. And the construction is going really well. And I think we said this in the past, but we expect that park to open in '25 and certainly in time for the summer of '25 and we'll be back to you and everybody we get more granular on the date. \nBrian Roberts: And just on that point, if I look back over COVID, one of the things I wish we could redo was slowing down Epic, because I agree with your both with Jeff saying and with your point, Jessi, this is a business that if you build wonderful attractions, there is pent-up demand. And we're going to make a fabulous park at Epic and we're full steam. We're going as fast as we can now to make up for lost time.\nMichael Cavanagh: Turning to Peacock, so let me just first say that, that we believe as everybody else does that you need global scale ultimately to compete in the streaming business that that is clear both in terms of your content spend and your technology and brand spend. Like everything else, we're taking a little bit different approach than everybody else. First of all, if you look at where we are today, just like Comcast put their shoulder into Peacock domestically to get us where we are. Without Sky, we would have been a much different place with Sky which has launched Peacock in the U.K. and Germany. Thanks, Dana and is launching in Italy later this year, combined with the Sky Showtime joint venture that we have, we believe those all of those territories get us with the U.S. to 70% of the overall streaming market because remember, you can't launch streaming in places like China, there's parts of the world that just doesn't work. So the real question is how we get to the next 30%. And we're going to be disciplined about it. We're going to look to partnerships and really on a bespoke country-by-country basis of how we expand internationally. And we're going to get to global scale. But we're going to look to do it really probably in a more measured country-by-country way and optimistic that we can get there. And then lastly, your question on content is an interesting one. We believe very strongly that Windows matter in the content, business Windows matter in the movie business, Windows matter in the TV business. When you take a piece of content, and you put it on different platforms, sometimes you get a new user base, which then feeds into demand back in your original platform. And we're going to use the strength of our platform to optimize across each piece of content and give each piece of content the biggest chance of success. So it's not really a science, it's more of an art where we think content can work. And you'll see content from us going across multiple platforms in multiple ways. And we'll really look at it for each piece of content, whether it we think it can drive Peacock subscription, which will start on Peacock or whether we think it can drive reach and will start an NBC or some of our linear platforms. So hopefully that answers your question.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Okay, thank you.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Jessica. Virginia, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.\nJay Li: Hi, this is Jay Li on for Craig Moffett. Thanks for taking the question. On broadband, could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing competitively in markets, whether it's fixed wireless or fiber? And then in the context of share buybacks, can you give any color on the expectation of Peacock content spend in terms of incremental versus reallocation that you mentioned earlier in the call? And then it sounds like you're doing a bit more agile on the cable side and the impact in terms of pace and impact on CapEx there as well. Thank you.\nMichael Cavanagh: It's Mike. On the last two, Peacock we kind of covered the color there. The expectation that losses this year with the investment net of what we get reallocated will be a Peacock loss of $2.5 billion is the likely number we think and then on Cable, the 11% CapEx intensity that we talked about is all in for the all the initiatives, Dave has described. So in competition really hasn't been a notable shift in the competitive environment from either fiber or fixed wireless, still very competitive, plenty of activity going on in terms of overbuild. And we've been at it for quite a while. And by the way, including fixed wireless where the earliest market launches, it's almost three years since we've competed against those early launches in fixed wireless. So, our game plan is to anticipate where and how competition happens. We have a constantly evolving playbook. And we're -- the key point is we're growing penetration where we compete against both fiber and non-fiber. So we take it seriously. We look at each one of the areas, all the varieties of overbuild fiber and fixed wireless and our goal and the game plan is to focus on our ubiquitous network advantage that we have not looking at our competitors so often at a very local level, have to make trade-offs on their network decisions. Our DOCSIS 4.0, DOCSIS game plan is a very robust one puts us in position to deliver and capacity in speeds on every application that's out there. Our goal has always been I mentioned earlier to develop a better product and deliver it. That's very different from our competitors where you just add value, and now including mobile, but we just have a different broadband product. It's better in terms of overall speed and coverage and Wi-Fi when you pull it all together, the net of that is a ubiquitous, better product. And we're delivering more passings and so as competition talks about that we're adding passings and did a really nice job the last handful of years and we will continue to do that. So our goal is to stay ahead of every single application that's out there and deliver the best broadband service and we feel like we're in a good position.\nMarci Ryvicker: Great, that will conclude our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. Thank you everyone for joining us.\nBrian Roberts: Thanks everybody.\nOperator: There will be a replay available of today's call starting at 12 'o clock p.m. Eastern Time and will run through Thursday, February 3 at Midnight Eastern Time.

            "name": "Jeff Shell",
            "content": "Hey, Ben, it's Jeff. So let me just give a little bit more color on Peacock. So going back to when we did our Investor Day, which is just over two years ago. We believe that the best model for us was an ad supported model. And we plan to offer and we did offer back at that point when we launched three different ways to get Peacock a free AVOD supported model, a light 499 light advertising supported dual revenue stream model with some more premium content. And then we offer - also offer a 999 SVOD product. At the time, we believed that the free AVOD product would kind of be our most popular and our leading product. What we found is that consumers are voting with their feet. And the vast majority of them are choosing the middle model, the 499 model with pretty more premium content, and a light ad load and ad load that's much lighter than linear and much lighter than some of our competitors. And that's resulted in some of the numbers that Brian and Mike laid out. Our MAAs are 24.5%, which is 75% of the way that to where we thought we'd be in '24 back then. We haven't really focused on paid subscribers. And we're already over 9 million people paying us real money. And when you add the fact that in Comcast territory and some other of our distributors, we offer this premium product bundled for free, and over time those will convert to pay. That's a pretty favorable model. And our ARPU has resulted in, has responded. I think in our Investor Day, we expected to get to $6 to $7 in ARPU, and we're already approaching $10 as Mike said in his comments. So this is really favorable for us. And what we've done is we've invested behind this, as Brian said. So we've put some more money into bringing our content back, our Pay-One movies, especially from HBO, which are going to be coming back later this year. And that's resulting in and the greater investment and the greater losses that were laid out. But we think also greater returns because this model is dual revenue stream model really mirrors our existing business. And we think that the peak investment year will probably be '23. Based on our plans, and then the revenue growth will overtake the investment growth and will start turning positive. The most important thing to keep in mind is that we're playing really a different game than our competitors. We've really believe that Peacock is not a separate business for us. It's an extension of our existing business, dual revenue stream. We are organized in our television business so that we run all of them together as one business. We programmed together as one business, picking the right model for each of our pieces of content to maximizes that. And we think over time, that's not just going to lead to good growth on Peacock, but it's going to lead to our TV business once we hit that peak investment period on Peacock returning the growth overall. So that we're as Brian said in the outset, we're number one on NBC. We're number one on news. We're -- our studios really strong. We have, in my opinion, the top content company in the world. And we're using that strength along with our business model to really play a different game in streaming than everybody else's. And we're really pleased with our performance so far. Yes, thanks. Thanks for the question. So obviously, much of our strong NBC content, as Brian mentioned, premieres on Hulu. And over time, we'd like to bring that back to Peacock. But any discussions that we're having with Hulu, or will have Hulu we're really not going to comment on. So there's nothing really to report at this time."

            "name": "Brian Roberts",
            "content": "Thanks Marci, and good morning, everyone. We just reported a strong fourth quarter to end a year that had a number of important financial milestones. In 2021, we generated record high revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow with contributions coming from across the company. These results reflect our resilience, strategic decision-making and disciplined approach to capital allocation, which is driven by a relentless focus on growth and creating long-term value. I'm incredibly proud of how we've navigated through the past two years amid the unique and ongoing challenges posed by the global pandemic. We've been able to quickly pivot when necessary in order to continue offering world-class connectivity, entertainment and experiences while simultaneously prioritizing the health and well-being of our customers, guests and employees. So now turning to the specifics. Our Broadband centric businesses, Residential, Business Services and Wireless help drive 11% adjusted EBITDA growth and a 190 basis points of organic margin expansion in Cable. And while the quarterly cadence may have come in differently than we expected, we added 1.1 million customer relationships and 1.3 million net broadband subscribers, bringing total customer relationships to 34.2 million and total broadband subscribers to 31.9 million as of year-end. In Wireless, our unique and recently enhanced relationship with Verizon enabled us to bring a more competitive offering for our wireless customers that also improve the economics for us resulting in our largest annual growth in wireless lines yet, while reaching profitability on a standalone basis for the first time since launch. The recovery to our Theme Parks is truly remarkable. We just reported the most profitable fourth quarter on record with demand especially high in Orlando, which had the best quarter in the company's history for any quarter. I'm even more excited for our newest Theme Park, Epic Universe, which is in construction as we speak. Hollywood and Osaka are also on a great trajectory. And we just opened Universal Beijing, which will provide a more meaningful contribution in the years to come. We also accomplished a lot on the content side. We are back to normalized levels of programming and production at both NBCU and Sky. We successfully renewed a number of sports rights agreements, including the NFL, Bundesliga, PGA Tour, Premier League and others, which provides us great visibility for the next several years and we're monetizing IP through creative new windows. I'll share more detail on Peacock in a bit. But 2021 was a fantastic year for our fast-growing streaming service, which has outperformed our high expectations. At Sky, our UK businesses maintain wonderful momentum with very strong trends across all metrics, including customer relationships, ARPU and churn and fueling Sky's full-year EBITDA growth of 10%. Germany is showing signs of a successful recovery and in Italy, we're managing the impact of the transition in our sports rights even better than we had expected. Finally, on 2021, I'd like to highlight the strength of our balance sheet and the increase in the amount of capital we returned to shareholders. We hit our leverage goals a bit earlier than we had anticipated during the pandemic, which enabled us to repurchase $4 billion of stock, the majority completed in the back half of the year. And including our dividend, we returned a total of $8.5 billion more than double that of 2020. Now, let me discuss our priorities for 2022. First is broadband, which is a healthy, scale business with a structurally advantageous financial profile defined by high operating leverage and margin accretion. We believe that the broadband market conditions in 2022 will continue to be impacted by COVID. And within this environment, we will strike the right balance between subscriber acquisition against a large and expanding addressable market as well as long-term profitable growth. On that front, we will evaluate every opportunity to increase our serviceable passings even more so than we have in the past. We will take advantage of the natural progression of new household and business formation, as well as the potential subsidies from the federal, state and local governments to expand into unserved areas. We will also aggressively compete for market share through our strategy of bundling products around broadband, so that every customer in every segment has plenty of choice at the right price. Convergence with Xfinity Mobile will play a big role. In terms of marketing, how our sales force operates, packaging and the overall interface we have with our customers. Scaling this business is a key focus for us in '22 and beyond. And we will do everything we can to continue to improve the experience for our customers and maintain the high levels of retention that started well before the pandemic. Our AI technologies and digital service tools enable us to resolve issues without a call or visit. In fact, this past quarter, total calls handled by our agents decreased 18% year-over-year and truck rolls declined by 16% while we continue to grow our customer base and increase our NPS scores. Broadband connectivity has never been as important as it is now to all of us. And people increasingly expect more than just speed. They also want innovative products that are easy to use and consistent and reliable service throughout their home, that's what we deliver. We have an incredible network, but what differentiates us even more is the ecosystem we've built around this network. We spent the last several years developing the right processes, finding the right technology and hiring the right people so that we can execute at great scale. I'll share a couple of tangible examples that illustrate this. We are moving aggressively on a path to 10G, while maintaining our level of CapEx intensity. It's still early, but we already are out in the marketplace with our new technology and higher upload speeds in some of the markets. And we will continue to expand this in 2022 and beyond. We also just launched the first WiFi 6E gateway, truly the first DOCSIS 4.0 device with the capability of delivering multi-gigabit speed. Our goal is to continue to innovate on top of this and further widen the gap between the in-home experience that we offer versus any of the competition. Priority number two is Peacock. Premium video consumption continues to increase across the industry currently approaching 600 billion hours per year in the U.S., up from 350 billion hours annually in the broadcast led era of the early 1990s. We've also seen that the average household spend on video continues to grow by over 10% since 2014 alone, which is constantly expanding the addressable market. NBCUniversal has played a significant part in this ecosystem ranking as the number one TV portfolio audience and number two film business in box office with incredible engagement. Today, NBCU reaches over 100 million U.S. households, which is nearly 80% of the population every quarter. Of that 100 million, Nielsen reports that nearly 60 million households watch at least 10 hours of our content every single month. That's more households than our competitors in both linear TV and streaming. When we introduced Peacock to you back in early 2020, our vision was to launch a streaming service that offers premium content and is supported primarily by advertising. What we've learned so far is that we started with the right business model. With over 300 million hours of content consumed on Peacock per month, the engagement with our platform has proven extremely valuable to advertisers. We also realized the importance of diversity when it comes to genres. And so we added sports. We introduced early access movies and we started ramping up some originals. Behind these investments, we found ourselves well on our way to exceeding the MAA and revenue targets we initially discussed. In fact, at the end of 2021 we had 24.5 million monthly active accounts in the U.S. or about 75% of the guidance we have provided for 2024. Within these 24.5 million MAA are over 9 million paid subscribers approaching $10 in paid ARPU, which includes the advertising. And that is without much focus on paid subscriber growth. We have another 7 million highly engaged bundled subscribers from Xfinity and other top distributors who use Peacock every single month. And currently receive Peacock Premium at no extra cost. We expect strong conversion of this group to paid subscribers over time. We've accomplished all this despite our movies and NBC content still premiering on other streaming services through the end of 2021 including HBO and Hulu and with the majority of our best content still to come. We just started including the NFL, our Pay-One movie deal kicks in this year and we have a growing number of originals in the pipeline. Our research indicates that 80% of consumers prefer an ad-supported service over a higher cost ad free SVOD offering. We see this in our customer mix, with the vast majority of our paid subscribers choosing the $5 paid AVOD tier over the $10 tier without ads. You combine this with the fact that our paid subscribers have much lower churn and significantly higher engagement and we think the most valuable end state for Peacock is to have two revenue streams. And so while we will continue to leverage the more than $20 billion of programming spend we already have across NBCU and Sky, we are committed to reallocating and increasing investment on top of this to drive further growth in paid subscribers, which we believe is the right path to creating long-term value. I couldn't be more excited about the momentum we are seeing with Peacock in the U.S. as well as the international opportunities ahead. In late 2021, we introduced Peacock on Sky in the U.K. and Ireland. That earlier this week we announced the rollout of Germany and Austria and plans are in place for our own Sky Showtime joint venture to launch later this year. Next, our company's third priority for 2022 is to monetize and expand the reach of our proprietary global technology platform and our addressable customer base. In October, we launched Sky Glass in the U.K. and XClass in the U.S. both build upon our investments in X1, Flex and Sky Q. This year, we'll continue to evolve the strategy to incorporate more markets, additional partners and new distribution outlets. I look forward to updating you on our progress. Our fourth priority is to continue to have a positive impact on society and the communities we serve. A big part of that work is our commitment to DE&I and Digital Equity. A decade ago, we created Internet Essentials, which has become the nation's largest low income broadband adoption program and we have recently expanded our efforts with the launch of Lift Zones where we brought free WiFi to more than a 1,000 community centers around the country. These are just two examples of how our teams have come together to help connect more people to the tools and resources they need to succeed in a digital world. So I am really proud of our many accomplishments in 2021 and extremely optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead for our company. I firmly believe that our integrated strategy with the assets, capabilities and talent we have today will continue to drive growth across our businesses and create long-term shareholder value. Mike? Thanks so much, and good morning. So I think demand, let me just start higher level with what I think our principles are. And then Dave can get into the specifics of some of the more detail that question. For broadband, just - demand just keeps going up. That's the importance of the product. And I think we're incredibly well-positioned to service our customers and monetize on the investments that we want to make. And the industry penetration has continue to expand. But despite that, we think we have a long runway for growth. We still believe with about 50% penetration in our footprint. That leaves us with the long part of the field to keep going. And we also are expanding the field, because we're able to grow the footprint and grow the addressable market, as I talked about given extensions and government subsidies and some of the investments by the government in broadband. And we're going to evaluate every opportunity we have to accelerate our passings. So from here, I expect the growth is going to be fueled by the strength of the network, focused on innovation and product differentiation. We're going to continue to improve our products to be best-in-class, increase our speeds, and always enhance the customer experience. And so, our ability to compete in segment to customers and do it throughout the entire market, not just regionally, I think these are all the advantages we've gotten where I think we're going to keep growing. But Dave, why don't you go into some of the pricing and volume and some of the questions that Ben asked. Jeff, why don't you start with the Hulu question. Mike. Okay, there's a lot in there. And, Dana, I may come to you in a moment, or just had to comment a little bit about Connected in our early days of Sky Glass and just maybe in general, how you see it sets us up for the future. But I think that's the big picture answer that I would give, Doug is that we see people connecting to our network in a variety of ways in the future, and different generations of customers have different needs. So from the great new Wi-Fi device that Dave just talked about to what we can do with a new platform whether that gets you into Telemedicine, gaming, education, above and beyond all the entertainment, that news that we're doing today. And so when you play with Sky Glass or a Connected television, you see the potential opening up, it also creates a potential for partnerships with companies that want to use that platform, when extend their own products to different ways. So it creates relevancy for us with consumers. And our early learnings have been, I think pretty spectacular. So Dana, why don't you take a minute and just what you'll hear about Sky Glass also can relate to eventually XClass TVs, but Dana over to you. Good, Dana. Thank you, Doug. A couple of things. Just following quickly, on Dana's point, we're very excited that Cable Group in the U.S. focusing on that global tech stack, and being able to pull off connected devices. And over time, we'll be opportunistic with what Dana is doing. And that we're leveraging our organizations just brought over from Sky working both with Sky, with Cable, Fraser Stirling that's looking across at all product innovation. And not only video, but also broadband. And that global tech stack is really important for us, XClass TV, it's early, but every single aggregation point will be converged over time, so that I think that's a real leverage opportunity. On your point of wireless, I think the biggest thing, Doug, is that there's just so much upside for us, the way we look at it, every single broadband home is an opportunity and every single broadband home should have at least a couple of lines. So to me, the addressable market expands. And as we continue to build out and add more homes, just more opportunities. So we go after a converged approach with broadband, and mobile, and it's a real opportunity to drive share in and of itself, mobile is a great product. But when you add it together, it just gives value to every single segment that's unique to us, that we can do differently. So to me, '22 is a year of optimizing that, as I mentioned earlier that we're going to take every single sales channel, simplify the go-to-market approach, with mobile included for every segment, whether it's income constrained right on up, there'll be a mobile component in everything that we do. So I think there's just a really big opportunity over time, and you look at it from an operational standpoint, one bill, one app, converge features in and out, leveraging Wi-Fi. There's a lot of opportunities for us in mobile. And by the way, we just launched it in business services and small business, and we're having great early success there. So mobile, I think will impact us about everything we do. One last thing, just a quick clarification for folks. When I was talking about trending, it was I was talking about not the last quarter of course, I meant worse than 2019-2020. But just to clarify that. And just on that point, if I look back over COVID, one of the things I wish we could redo was slowing down Epic, because I agree with your both with Jeff saying and with your point, Jessi, this is a business that if you build wonderful attractions, there is pent-up demand. And we're going to make a fabulous park at Epic and we're full steam. We're going as fast as we can now to make up for lost time. Thanks everybody."

            "name": "Dana Strong",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian and thanks, Doug, for the question. We appreciate it very much. I'll just start by saying really pleased 12 months in with how Sky performed in 2021. And I'd like to highlight landing EBITDA at a 10% growth rate really underpinned by the U.K., which continues to perform very well with growth in EBITDA revenue and customers. And a good turn as we head out of COVID here and we also have made the adjustment in our sports right strategy very successfully in Italy, in Germany with both entities outperforming our expectations. So I would say overall confidence in the Sky business as we walk into 2022 is feeling very good, feeling very confident about our growth prospects. And part of that also leads me to Glass because Glass is this will be our first full-year in Glass, we launched in the fourth quarter last year just before, we're really excited about it because it opens up new headroom for us. So what I mean by that is first, it opens up new customer segments as we move into an IP based service. So it gives us the opportunity to sell to customers that previously couldn't have that service because they weren't allowed Dishes. It opens up new customers who are more streaming focused, and value conscious customers. As we convert the cost of the TV into a monthly low cost price point like the mobile phone model, it opens up new value conscious segments for us. And it's important to kind of say that this is a really good retention product is it's a 24, 48 month contract. It also appeals to existing customers and it really deepens our relationship with them.  So feeling really good about how it appeals to new customer segments ensures that existing customers. The second big source of value for us is it's a new ability to make a margin on equipment. So that's new headroom for us. And the third area for us and Brian reference it's a new platform and what we mean by that is a new platform for innovation for future services, so whether that's syndication to new markets, like our Foxtel deal in Australia, or new services like fitness, watch together games and other things we've got in the hopper, we're feeling like this becomes a continuous source for innovation, to either drive retention or launch into new revenue streams, depending on what the service is. We're off to a strong start. So we've got a great reaction from the market. In the launch phase, we focused on our existing customer base, our most loyal customers as we always do on Sky, we're really excited as we head into quarter one, to open it up to general market, more so and really start to step on the pedal. So for us as we enter into 2022, we really feel that Sky is in a strong position. We think that Glass is really off to a strong start, we're feeling good across all of our products and markets. And we think Glass is a really important growth opportunity for the organization for all the reasons we just touched on, Brian."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "David Watson",
            "content": "Sure. Hey, Ben, so let me start with trends. You asked about that. And so we're seeing a lot of the same trends, we've experienced at the end of last year with connect activity remaining lower than what we experienced towards the end of last year. And one of the key drivers other than seasonality, just not being as normal. One of the key drivers of this is lower move activity. And when you look at external move data, which we track very closely compared to '19, this move data tracks fairly closely to our connect indexing. So, however, in terms of trending, the great news is churn. Churn is at record lows and continues to get better. So one other thing in terms of trending is our focus. We talked about, we go after every segment, and we're going to also make sure we're competitive in the income constraints segment. So it's early, but I think we've done a nice job marketing the benefits of the new ACP program. So in terms of trending, that's where things stand right now. Mobile, I think it's a very good point and totally agree. Our mobile is key for us, in and of itself is a great growth opportunity, but it's also very important to broadband. We've talked a lot about broadband and churn benefits that continues. But we want to bring mobile value to every segment in every offer. So as we segment the marketplace in broadband, and whether it's a standalone broadband relationship, which is fine, but we're going to talk about broadband and mobile. And every single product and offer construct, we will deliver that. And we're simplifying and converging mobile offers just to make sure every single sales channel is optimized to deliver on these offer constructs. So look more in '22. But more of that, as we go throughout the year. And then last but not least, is pricing. In terms of broadband, we've had a very consistent approach to broadband pricing. We've been competing for a long time, in all sorts of different competitive environments. And we focus on different levels of broadband speeds. We focus on innovation and surrounding broadband with product enhancements that are embedded within broadband like Flex, you get security, coverage, great gateway devices. And we just tested a device that points towards longer-term, where we can deliver four gigabits in this trial symmetrically, up and down. So we have a long roadmap of innovation that we feel very good about that will eventually go into pricing. So - but our general approach is a holistic one. In that we are not, we focus on every single product area, but it's the total bill that we look at. And so that is our main focus, leveraging speed tears, taking always a look at the total customer bill. And from that perspective, we're a little bit lighter on broadband, the last couple of years, including this year. And as in video, we take a little bit more in video because of the carriage renewals. You can see our pricing approach as we balanced just to your initial point, share and rate, we think we have a good formula. We be competing like this for some time, and we feel good about this approach going forward."

            "name": "Michael Cavanagh",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and good morning everyone. I'll begin on slides 4 and 5 with our consolidated 2021 financial results. Revenue increased 9.5% to $30.3 billion for the fourth quarter and 12% to $116.4 billion for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 17% to $8.4 billion for the fourth quarter and 13% to $34.7 billion for the full year. Adjusted EPS increased 38% to $0.77 per share for the fourth quarter and 24% to $3.23 for the full year. And we generated $3.8 billion of free cash flow for the fourth quarter and $17.1 billion for the year on a reported basis, which includes a $1.3 billion benefit related to the tax impact of the bond exchange we completed in August, $620 million of which fell in the fourth quarter as well as roughly $1 billion from returns on investing activities, most of which occurred in the fourth quarter. Excluding these items, free cash flow was $14.8 billion for the year. Now, let's turn to our business segment results, starting with Cable Communications on Slide 6. For the fourth quarter, Cable revenue increased 4.5% to $16.4 billion, EBITDA increased 7.8% to $7.1 billion, and net cash flow grew 9.2% to $4.5 billion. For the full year, we grew customer relationships by 1.1 million with 169,000 net additions in the fourth quarter. Overall customer growth continues to be driven by broadband where we added 1.3 million net new residential and business customers for the year and 212,000 in the fourth quarter. Our net adds this quarter reflect the continuation of lower overall marketplace activity, particularly move activity compared to historical trends. While this resulted in lower connect volumes, it also contributed to high levels of customer retention with broadband churn improving to the lowest rate for any fourth quarter on record. Broadband was also the largest contributor to our Cable revenue growth with broadband revenue increasing 8.5% in the quarter driven by the strong net additions over the past year, as well as healthy growth in average revenue per customer. Moving to Wireless, revenue increased 40% driven by growth in customer lines and higher device sales. Overall, we added 1.2 million lines for the year and 312,000 lines in the quarter, the best result since launching this business in 2017, bringing total mobile lines to 4 million. As Brian noted, over the past year we have made tremendous strides fully integrating wireless into our core cable operations, achieving standalone profitability of $157 million this year. Now that we've crossed strongly into profitability and the business is deeply integrated into our core cable operations, we won't be disclosing standalone wireless EBITDA going forward. Business Services revenue increased 11.5% or approximately 7% excluding the acquisition of Masergy, which closed at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Our strong organic results were driven by customers taking faster data speeds, higher attach rates of our advanced products and rate increases on some of our services, as well as the continued growth in our customer base, which grew by 63,000 net new customers over the past year with 17,000 additions in the fourth quarter. For Video, revenue declined 1.2% driven by customer net losses totaling 1.7 million over the past year, including 373,000 in the fourth quarter, partially offset by higher average revenue per customer. This higher revenue per customer was driven by the residential rate adjustment we implemented at the beginning of 2021, which we believe was also a driver of video subscriber losses. We implemented a similar rate increase earlier this month, so we expect this trend to continue throughout 2022. Last, advertising revenue decreased to 12.5% reflecting lower political advertising compared to record levels in last year's fourth quarter. Excluding political, advertising was up 9% with modest growth in core and double-digit growth in advanced advertising. Turning to expenses, Cable Communications' fourth quarter expenses increased 2%. Programming expenses decreased one 1.2%, reflecting a decline in video customers, partially offset by higher rates. As we enter 2022, programming expenses should reflect the benefit of fewer contract renewals, combined with the impact from our anticipated decline in overall video customers. Non-programming expenses increased 4.1% and were flat on a per relationship basis, reflecting investment to drive organic growth in the business as well as the expenses related to our recent acquisition of Masergy. The primary driver of the year-over-two-year [ph] change was technical and product support, which increased about 10% largely related to growth in our Wireless business and was partially offset by lower bad debt and customer service expense. Cable Communications EBITDA increased 7.8% to $7.1 billion for the fourth quarter and Cable EBITDA margin reached 43.4%, reflecting 130 basis points of year-over-year improvement. We believe we are striking the right balance by continuing to invest in our growth businesses, which are driving the top line and proving to be a great return for us, while at the same time continuing to increase our operating efficiency and take unnecessary cost out of the business. All of this together should enable us to drive higher profitability and expand margins both in 2022 and thereafter. Cable capital expenditures increased 3.7% in the quarter and 4.9% for the year, resulting in capex intensity of 10.8%, our lowest full year on record and essentially in line with 2020s 11% driven by lower spending on customer premise equipment and support capital, partially offset by higher spending on scalable infrastructure and line extensions. As we noted on our call in July, we expect our cable capex intensity will remain around 11% for the next few years as we continue to increase the number of homes and businesses that we pass and accelerate our investment and the technology that will enhance the overall capacity of our network, both downstream and upstream. This is a direct step to DOCSIS 4.0, which allows for multi-gig symmetrical speeds essentially with the software update providing very little to no disruption to the home in a very capital efficient way. Now, let's turn to Slide 7 for NBCUniversal. Starting with total NBCUniversal results, revenue increased 26% to $9.3 billion and EBITDA decreased 6.8% to $1.3 billion. Media revenue increased 8.4% to $5.8 billion, driven by higher distribution and advertising revenue with a significant contribution from Peacock. Distribution revenue increased 12% reflecting higher rates post the successful completion of several carriage renewals at the end of 2020 and a growing contribution from Peacock due to our growth in paid subscribers, partially offset by subscriber declines at our networks. As a reminder, beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we will lap these carriage renewals. Advertising revenue increased 6% reflecting higher pricing, which benefited from our strong upfront and a growing contribution from Peacock, which was only partially offset by ratings declines and a difficult comparison to record levels of political advertising at our local stations and last year's fourth quarter. Media EBITDA decreased 49% to $721.1 million in the fourth quarter, including a $559 million EBITDA loss at Peacock. Excluding Peacock, Media EBITDA decreased 24% reflecting higher costs associated with more sporting events at our regional sports networks compared to last year when the NBA and NHL delayed the start of their seasons due to COVID-19 as well as higher television programming and marketing costs, driven by the return of our full schedule compared to last year when our schedule was impacted by COVID-19. This difficult cost comparison will continue in the first quarter. Before moving on, I want to build on Brian's comments regarding Peacock. In 2021, Peacock generated revenue of nearly $800 million and an EBITDA loss of $1.7 billion, which includes content spend of over $1.5 billion. Even with a relatively limited programming slate we've achieved a level of success in MAAs, paid subs and engagement that is driving our decision to double our content spend on Peacock in 2022 to over $3 billion with the goal of ramping domestic content spend to $5 billion over the next couple of years, some of which will be incremental and some of which will be a reallocation from linear programming. For 2022, while we expect a significant step up in revenue, the incremental investment we are spending in both content and marketing and service will likely result in an EBITDA loss of roughly $2.5 billion. While the timing of when Peacock breaks even maybe pushed out from where we originally expected, we believe pursuing a dual revenue stream is the right strategy to create long-term value, and given the strength in our Theme Parks and high margin linear businesses, the good news is that we will fund this pivot out of NBCUniversal cash flows. Moving next to Studios, revenue increased 36% to $2.4 billion but EBITDA declined 34% to $51 million. This decline was driven by the timing of our film slate, partially offset by growth in TV content licensing. Film has a multi-year business model with titles monetized over time as they transition through different theatrical and licensing windows. As a result of pausing film releases in 2020 during the pandemic, we had fewer new titles come into the licensing window in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago. And at the same time, marketing costs were higher as we released Sing 2 and Halloween Kills in theaters. This impact of fewer carryover titles and higher year-over-year marketing costs associated with more theatrical releases will begin to diminish as we move forward, but will continue to pressure EBITDA growth for the next few quarters. Last, at Theme Parks, revenue increased by $1.2 billion to $1.9 billion and we generated EBITDA of $674 million, which was our highest on record for any fourth quarter driven by strong momentum in the U.S. and Japan. At our U.S. parks, we benefited from strong domestic attendance and per caps that were above pre-pandemic levels. At Universal Studios Japan we saw improved attendance levels as government-mandated capacity restrictions were eased during the quarter. At our newly opened park Universal Beijing, we are pleased with our first full quarter of operations where the level of demand from our guests was high, but overall attendance was impacted by COVID-related restrictions. Despite that, Beijing's EBITDA was essentially breakeven in the quarter and we anticipate modest profitability in our first full year of operation in 2022. For total Theme Parks, while we have been very pleased with the pace of our recovery, particularly in the U.S., we recognize that the business is subject to variability related to the pandemic, which tends to be more pronounced at our International Parks. Now let's turn to Slide 8 for Sky, which I will speak to on a constant currency basis. For the fourth quarter, Sky revenue decreased 2.5% to $5.1 billion as solid growth in the U.K. was offset by our results in Italy, where we continued transition through the change to our Serie A broadcast rights. Direct-to-Consumer revenue decreased 1% reflecting a modest decline in average revenue per customer relationship and overall customer relationship additions of 61,000 in the fourth quarter. This gain mostly came from a meaningful increase in streaming subscribers, primarily driven by seasonally strong entertainment content as well as a widely viewed sports schedule. The higher level of streaming additions in the quarter, more than offset the level of customer losses we experienced in Italy, which were also better than we had anticipated. In the U.K., Direct-to-Consumer revenue increased mid-single digits, driven by continued healthy customer additions, supported by record low churn and higher average revenue per customer. Revenue growth benefited from growth in broadband and wireless streaming and hospitality as pubs and clubs revenue has recovered back to 2019 levels. This was offset by a decrease in customer relationships and average revenue per customer in Italy both mainly due to the change in our Serie A broadcast rights. Rounding out the rest of revenue, Content revenue declined 23% driven by the change in sports licensing agreements in Italy in Germany. And advertising revenue increased 1% with healthy growth in the U.K. and Germany, mostly offset by a decline in Italy. Turning to our EBITDA results; Sky's EBITDA increased 188% to $464 million, driven by our strong performance in the U.K. and improvements in Germany and Italy. Overall, the results reflect lower sports programming costs due to resets in our sports rights, partially offset by a change in sports rights amortization, which resulted in an increase of $130 million. As a reminder, we announced this change last quarter. It did not impact our full year results but it does impact the quarterly pattern of recognizing sports rights amortization costs with expenses higher in the first and fourth quarters and lower in the second and third quarters. I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 9. As I mentioned previously, in 2021, we generated around $15 billion in organic free cash flow excluding the items I referred to earlier. Consolidated total capital increased 3.6% to $12.1 billion, largely driven by higher investment on our broadband network. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect Cable capex intensity to stay around 11% and NBCUniversal capex related to the construction of Epic Universe to be up around the $1 billion. Working capital was $1.5 billion for the year, a $1.3 billion increase over last year's level, reflecting a post-COVID ramp of investment in studio content and our broadcast of the Summer Olympics. But less than we originally expected, largely due to the timing of content spend at both NBCUniversal and Sky and a faster than expected recovery at Theme Parks. Turning to capital allocation, we ended the year with net leverage at 2.4 times and returned a total of $8.5 billion to shareholders, including $4.5 billion in dividend payments and $4 billion in share repurchases. For 2022 as I said previously, we expect to continue to maintain leverage at around current levels, which I expect will support continued strong capital returns. As we announced this morning, we are raising the dividend by $0.08 to $1.08 per share, our 14th consecutive annual increase and our Board of Directors has increased our share repurchase authorization to $10 billion. This capital allocation policy will allow us to maintain the balance we've talked about, investing organically in the businesses, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. So, thanks for joining us on the call this morning. With that, I'll turn it back to Marci who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call. Thanks, Jeff. So and Phil so on capital return, I'd not take the authorization of $10 billion as a guide of anything. Not trying to send a signal there. That's the level that the board last authorized. We use some of that up, and we wanted to top it up as we started the year. And as you know, it's easy for us to go back when called for and quickly get greater authorization. So what I tell you to think about as we talk about capital return and buybacks is, Brian and I and all of us here have been talking about our excitement, and the imperative of getting back into balance where strong capital turn through dividends and buybacks, which has been a hallmark of this company over decades and decades. Would be back on the table, along with keeping the balance sheet strong, and obviously, prioritizing making high returning investments in our business, which we talked a lot about what's going on, on that side on the call earlier. So I think it sets us up to be at the place we're at now back in balance with leverage at 24. And I would point everybody not to number expect us to buyback, but rather the leverage level that I expect us to stay at, which is around this level of 2.4x. I think that is going to set this company up for in 2022 and beyond very strong capital returns. And the number you guys all come up with is really just a function of doing your model for your own growth. I think we're going to grow EBITDA. But there's a variety of views there. And I think we enumerated a lot of the areas from Epic, the park in -- theme park in Orlando, to Jeff's commentary and my commentary on expected losses of a Peacock as we invest there, yet that's to be funded out of cash flows that the business itself NBC media will generate. So we think that's a very thoughtful way of funding the pivot to future growth in the media side to name just a few. So and obviously, capex intensity a cable, maintaining at around the 11% level. I think is an important element for people to think about with Dave, having talked six months ago on this call about what he wanted to do to drive towards DOCSIS 4.0, which I think sets our network up for the future. So that's what I got for you on a capital return. Hopefully that hits it off for everybody. I should - I could be nick quip, but your guess is good as mine, but really it's a hard number to forecast goes in. Obviously as we get back post-COVID and ramp up some production. I might tell you to expect it to trend a little bit higher than then it was and get back more towards 2019. But I said that last year and it didn't happen. So I will leave it to the point that it's a number that's, we're obviously when we spend money on working capital. We're expecting to get a good return. But I think it's somewhere in the range of where it's been, last year, the range would be where we were last year, or higher up to where we were in '19 pre-COVID. But I'm not in a position to give you a prediction other than give you some color. Thanks, Jessica. So let me take those kind of in order. So first of all, it's impossible not just to be excited about our theme park business, we had a great year, we had a great fourth quarter as Brian mentioned. And really across all the metrics of that business, we haven't seen any impact of Omicron in Florida, for example and very limited impacts which we seem to be passed in Hollywood and Japan. So everything's kind of going in the right direction. And even as we start the first quarter, continuing in that direction, I think part of that, by the way is because we continue to invest in our attractions during the pandemic, as Brian also mentioned, with the lots of [indiscernible] in Orlando, and pets in Hollywood, and Nintendo, which is doing really well in Japan has led that park to rebound really, really quickly. So all signs are pointed up in our theme park business. And I agree with you, we have a lot of growth ahead, our international visitation has not returned to what it was historically would be in Florida, we generally are in the low 30s. Right now, we're just above 20 with most of that visitation now coming from the U.K., and Europe, Latin America hasn't returned yet. So we have upside there as people continue to increase travel. And we're also I should mention very happy with Beijing, which is open people love the park. And when travel opens up in China, after the Olympics, we are really optimistic of that park long-term. So everything is going well and then trending in the right direction. Epic is full steam ahead. We're, I was down there a couple of weeks ago. And the construction is going really well. And I think we said this in the past, but we expect that park to open in '25 and certainly in time for the summer of '25 and we'll be back to you and everybody we get more granular on the date. Turning to Peacock, so let me just first say that, that we believe as everybody else does that you need global scale ultimately to compete in the streaming business that that is clear both in terms of your content spend and your technology and brand spend. Like everything else, we're taking a little bit different approach than everybody else. First of all, if you look at where we are today, just like Comcast put their shoulder into Peacock domestically to get us where we are. Without Sky, we would have been a much different place with Sky which has launched Peacock in the U.K. and Germany. Thanks, Dana and is launching in Italy later this year, combined with the Sky Showtime joint venture that we have, we believe those all of those territories get us with the U.S. to 70% of the overall streaming market because remember, you can't launch streaming in places like China, there's parts of the world that just doesn't work. So the real question is how we get to the next 30%. And we're going to be disciplined about it. We're going to look to partnerships and really on a bespoke country-by-country basis of how we expand internationally. And we're going to get to global scale. But we're going to look to do it really probably in a more measured country-by-country way and optimistic that we can get there. And then lastly, your question on content is an interesting one. We believe very strongly that Windows matter in the content, business Windows matter in the movie business, Windows matter in the TV business. When you take a piece of content, and you put it on different platforms, sometimes you get a new user base, which then feeds into demand back in your original platform. And we're going to use the strength of our platform to optimize across each piece of content and give each piece of content the biggest chance of success. So it's not really a science, it's more of an art where we think content can work. And you'll see content from us going across multiple platforms in multiple ways. And we'll really look at it for each piece of content, whether it we think it can drive Peacock subscription, which will start on Peacock or whether we think it can drive reach and will start an NBC or some of our linear platforms. So hopefully that answers your question. It's Mike. On the last two, Peacock we kind of covered the color there. The expectation that losses this year with the investment net of what we get reallocated will be a Peacock loss of $2.5 billion is the likely number we think and then on Cable, the 11% CapEx intensity that we talked about is all in for the all the initiatives, Dave has described. So in competition really hasn't been a notable shift in the competitive environment from either fiber or fixed wireless, still very competitive, plenty of activity going on in terms of overbuild. And we've been at it for quite a while. And by the way, including fixed wireless where the earliest market launches, it's almost three years since we've competed against those early launches in fixed wireless. So, our game plan is to anticipate where and how competition happens. We have a constantly evolving playbook. And we're -- the key point is we're growing penetration where we compete against both fiber and non-fiber. So we take it seriously. We look at each one of the areas, all the varieties of overbuild fiber and fixed wireless and our goal and the game plan is to focus on our ubiquitous network advantage that we have not looking at our competitors so often at a very local level, have to make trade-offs on their network decisions. Our DOCSIS 4.0, DOCSIS game plan is a very robust one puts us in position to deliver and capacity in speeds on every application that's out there. Our goal has always been I mentioned earlier to develop a better product and deliver it. That's very different from our competitors where you just add value, and now including mobile, but we just have a different broadband product. It's better in terms of overall speed and coverage and Wi-Fi when you pull it all together, the net of that is a ubiquitous, better product. And we're delivering more passings and so as competition talks about that we're adding passings and did a really nice job the last handful of years and we will continue to do that. So our goal is to stay ahead of every single application that's out there and deliver the best broadband service and we feel like we're in a good position."

With that, let me turn the call over to A - Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian.\nBrian Roberts: Thanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. We had a wonderful third quarter across the entire Company, with 18% growth in adjusted EBITDA and 34% growth in adjusted EPS. And we generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow. One of our goals the past several years has been to return to a position of offensively investing our existing businesses, paying a growing dividend, and also buying back meaningful amounts of stock.  So, I'm pleased to report that we have now achieved all of that in this quarter and we're back to our desired leverage ratios. Our Cable division continues to be a standout delivering over 7% revenue growth and the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit EBITDA growth of 10% fueled by our broadband business, which generated 300,000 net additions and contributed to a very healthy 255,000 net new customer relationships. Business services has emerged from the pandemic and was also a key driver of our results. And we believe this momentum will continue.  Our success comes from our network advantage, innovative products, and world-class operational capabilities which enable us to provide an unparalleled experience. Just like in residential, we are proactively responding to the needs of our commercial customers and offering personalized solutions. While small business has led our growth for the last decade we're still significantly under-penetrated in the mid-market and enterprise segments.  We see a lot of potential to take share in our large addressable market, which just got even bigger post our recent acquisition of Mesa G (ph.), which builds on our strong offering of technology solutions. Mesa G (ph.) has become a leading provider to companies worldwide and unlocks a customer segment that we don't have today, particularly U.S. based organizations with multi-site global operations. Xfinity Mobile exceeded its prior record, adding 285,000 lines, the most in any quarter since launch.  And we continue to evaluate ways we can accelerate this business even further as wireline and wireless connectivity services continue to converge. We're looking at new, exciting products and packaging that highlight how we're able to provide our customers with the best and most reliable broadband wherever they are or wherever they go, and help them save money at the same time. And with only 6% penetration of our 32 million broadband customers we have a long runway.  Taking all of this together, we have an incredibly robust broadband business and we've been adding over a million broadband customers each year for the past 20 plus years and we continue to deepen these relationships by offering a fantastic and differentiated in-home experience with the fastest modem and gateway and the greatest WIFI coverage.  We plan to continue our relentless focus on aggressively developing and improving our suite of products around connectivity. The foundation of all of this is our network. And we are currently in the process of deploying new technology, updating key infrastructure, and accelerating virtualization across our footprint so that we can deliver even further enhancements, fast and at scale to millions of customers.  And we will continue to evaluate every opportunity we have to expand our passing\u2019s which will bring our amazing suite of products and services to many new homes and businesses. All of David Watson and his team superb execution is around decades of investment that has led to constant new product innovation, including this month's launch of XClass TV, an extension of our leadership in video aggregation.  XClass is an innovative smart television powered by our global technology platform that brings the best of our Company's entertainment operating system to consumers nationwide, together with the option to use either Xfinity, Charter, or other entertainment apps. At NBCUniversal, we continue to see great progress in each of our businesses. But I'd like to highlight our theme parks, especially Orlando, which just reported the most profitable quarter in its history despite having virtually no international guests, due to COVID related travel restraints.  In Hollywood, we continue to see recovery and we had a very successful and exciting opening of Universal Beijing Resort on September 20th. I also look forward to COVID related restrictions easing in Osaka which could happen soon. Our media business is also doing very well. We're benefiting from the many changes Jeff Shell and his team implemented starting in 2020. With new hires, different roles, fresh content, and a more efficient operating structure.  We're seeing the financial success in both our linear networks, as well as Peacock, which has maintained its momentum. We have a new breakout hit with La Brea which has been a contributor to NBC's overall audience lead this primetime season as well as the best performing new show on Peacock. Sunday Night Football has returned with great momentum, which we're seeing across our platforms.  And we're thrilled with the performance of our second Halloween installment, which generated more revenue in its opening weekend at the domestic box office than any other film this year with a day and date streaming release and as the number one non-live event premiere in Peacock's history. We're also looking forward to extending our streaming platforms outside of the U.S. With Peacock launching on Sky next month and Sky Showtime in the works for mid-2022.  At Sky, I want to re-emphasize how well we're performing in the UK, which continues its growth trajectory and customer relationships led by record low . We're also seeing great momentum in our broadband and mobile businesses. Earlier this month, A - Dana Strong and her team introduced Sky Glass in London, a premium all-in-one streaming television and multi-channel subscription package that is so much more than just a stunning TV with amazing sound.  It's an innovation platform that opens up a whole new world of entertainment for our customers, and simplifies the experience so they can stream every channel, every show and every app, in one easy-to-use interface. And already, the customer response has very much exceeded our initial expectations.  We're also incredibly proud that Sky Glass as the first TV to be certified carbon-neutral. Sky has been leading all of Comcast with its sustainability goals. And is the first media Company in the UK to commit to being net carbon zero by 2030. While Glass and X Class are distinct products with different monetization and distribution strategies, they extend our customer base beyond our previous capabilities and they run off the same global technology platform.  This allows us to quickly bring the best features to consumers across territories, segments, and brands, and on Comcast hardware and through our syndication partners. I'm pleased to also announce today that Apple will bring Apple TV Plus and the Apple TV app to our Xfinity and Sky customers on X1, Flex, XClass, Sky Glass, and Sky Q devices and Comcast is bringing the Xfinity stream and  apps to Apple TV devices.  We're working together with our partners to deliver the best apps and experiences on our platforms. And our teams are sharing capabilities and collaborating across the Company collectively drawing on our scale and leadership and broadband aggregation and streaming to innovate and profitably serve new and existing customers.  Looking ahead, I am excited about the opportunities we have to both invest in our business and return capital through buybacks and dividends, all while maintaining leverage around current levels. And I believe we are extremely well-positioned to continue our track record of building long-term shareholder value. So, I'm pleased to now hand it over to Mike for more detail on this strong quarter.\nMike Cavanagh: Thanks, Brian. And good morning, everyone. I'll begin on slide four with our third quarter consolidated 2021 results. Revenue increased 19% to $30.3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 18% to $9 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 34% to $0.87 per share. And finally, we generated 3.2 billion of free cash flow.  Now let's turn to our business segment results, starting with Cable Communication on slide 5. Cable revenue increased 7.4% to $16.1 billion. EBITDA increased 10% to $7.1 billion and net cash flow grew 16% to $5 billion. As a reminder, comparisons to last year were impacted by adjustments accrued for customer RSN fees.  Excluding these adjustments, cable communications revenue increased 6.3% with no corresponding impact to EBITDA. We added 255,000 net new customer relationships in the quarter, once again, driven by broadband, where we added 300,000 net new residential and business customers. We continue to benefit from high levels of customer retention with broadband churn improving to the lowest rate for any third quarter on record.  The strong level of net customer additions over the past year, including this third quarter, coupled with higher average revenue per customer, drove broadband revenue growth of 12%. This growth was about a point lower, excluding the RSN fee adjustments in last year's results. Wireless and business services also drove our strong cable revenue growth. Wireless revenue grew 51% driven by growth in customer lines and higher device sales. Overall, we added 285,000 lines in the quarter, the best results since launching this business in 2017, bringing total mobile lines to 3.7 million.  Business Services revenue increased 8.7%, reflecting an increase in rates and customers primarily driven by the continued improvement in small businesses. We added 18,000 net new customers in the quarter and 72,000 over the past year. We recently closed on our acquisition of Masergy, which enabled us to offer a broader range of products and solutions to mid-market and enterprise customers and expand s our market opportunity to customers with a global presence.  Moving to Video, revenue increased 1.4% and was flat excluding the RSN fee adjustments in last year's third quarter, driven by a residential rate increase at the beginning of the year, mostly offset by a video subscriber, net losses totaling 408,000 this quarter. Last, advertising revenue increased 4.6%, reflecting a strong overall market recovery compared to last year's third quarter which was impacted by COVID, partially offset by lower political advertising.  As a reminder, the Q4 year-over-year comparison will be impacted by record levels of political advertising last year. Turning to expenses, cable communications ' third quarter expenses increased 5.3%. Programming expenses increased 7.6%, mainly reflecting the comparison to last year, which benefited from RSN adjustments.  Excluding these, programming expenses were up 2.8% as we begin to lap the large number of contract renewals that started to cycle through in 2020. Non  expenses increased 3.9% and decreased 0.8% on a per relationship basis, reflecting our investment to drive growth in our core businesses, broadband, wireless, and business services. This resulted in higher technical and product support in advertising, marketing and promotion expenses, which were partially offset by lower bad debt and customer service expense.  Cable Communications' EBITDA increased 10% to $7.1 billion, including a contribution of $51 million from our wireless business. Cable EBITDA margin reached 43.9%, reflecting 120 basis points of year-over-year improvement. While the RSN fee adjustments had no impact on EBITDA, they did impact margins last year. Excluding the RSN adjustment impact, our margin expanded a 160-basis points year-over-year.  Cable capital expenditures decreased 5.4%, resulting in capex intensity of 10.4% for there is typically some choppiness and Cable capex from quarter-to-quarter, mainly due to timing. Now let's turn to Slide 6 for NBCUniversal. Starting with total NBCUniversal results, revenue increased 58% to $10 billion and EBITDA increased 48% to $1.35 billion. Media revenue increased 48% to $6.8 billion, including $1.8 billion associated with the Tokyo Olympics.  Excluding the Olympics, revenue increased 9.2% driven by higher distribution and advertising revenue. Distribution revenue increased over 12%, reflecting higher rates, post the successful completion of several carriage renewals at the end of 2020. And a growing contribution from Peacock, partially offset by subscriber declines, which have been stable for the past few quarters.  Advertising revenue increased 7.2%, reflecting an overall market recovery compared to last year, very strong demand and pricing for our Ad inventory. A higher contribution from Peacock, and a solid start to the new fall season, including Strong NFL ratings partially offset by the timing of sporting events compared to last year when several events that shifted from the second quarter to the third quarter.  Media EBITDA increased 1.2% to $997 million, including results of Tokyo Olympics. The favorable comparison on the timing of other sporting events and Peacock losses that were impacted by higher costs associated with the day and date release of the Boss Baby: Family Business.  As a reminder, our fourth-quarter results will face a difficult comparison to last year due to higher costs associated with the timing of more sporting events at our regional sports network an increase in our original entertainment as we continue to launch our fall season, and the inclusion of our latest studio release, Halloween Kills, on Peacock. Studios revenue increased 27% driven fairly equally by growth in theatrical and content licensing revenue.  The increase in theatrical revenue reflected the continued success of F9 as well as several new releases including the Boss Baby family business, which was in theaters and on Peacock. In addition, content licensing revenue growth benefited from the delivery of content to our networks, Peacock and third parties.  Studio EBITDA declined 47% to $179 million, driven by higher amortization of television and film production costs as we return to pre - COVID levels of production and investment in marketing and promotion to launch our new films. Looking to the fourth quarter, EBITDA comparisons to last year will remain challenging in the short-term as we launch new theatrical releases and ramp our TV productions, which had been impacted by the pandemic.  Moving to theme parks, revenue increased by $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion dollars and we generated EBITDA of $434 million which included about a $130 million of Universal Beijing pre -opening costs. This was our most profitable quarter since the pandemic began in the Q1 of 2020, driven by improved operating results at our U.S. parks, including strong domestic attendance and per caps that were above pre -pandemic levels. In fact, as Brian noted, Universal Orlando delivered its highest EBITDA for any quarter in its history.  At Universal Studios Japan, results were challenging as we continue to operate under a government capacity restriction, keeping attendance below 2019 levels. Last, we opened Universal Beijing on September 20th, where the initial demand has been positive. While our parks offer a great experience year-round, we expect some seasonality given Beijing's weather conditions with lower attendance in the fall and winter and more in spring and summer.  So overall on Parks, we are encouraged by the continued recovery, but getting back to and then exceeding pre -pandemic levels of EBITDA will likely require an improvement in international visitation. Now let's turn to Slide 7 for Sky, which I will speak to on a constant currency basis. For the third quarter, Sky revenue was $5 billion and relatively consistent compared to last year.  Direct-to-consumer revenue was also consistent with last year's results, primarily reflecting strong growth in the UK driven by continued growth in customer relationships and higher ARPU due to the positive impact of a rate increase earlier this year. Higher mobile device sales, and the continued turnaround in hospitality revenue as pubs and clubs come back. This was offset by a decrease in customer relationships and ARPU in Italy, mainly due to a negative impact from the reduction in broadcast rights to Serie A.  Sky's overall customer relationships declined 233,000 entirely driven by customer losses in Italy. Advertising revenue increased 16% with the results in the UK driving the bulk of the growth and reflecting the overall market recovery from COVID-19. This increase was offset by a 26% decline in content revenue, driven by the change in sports licensing agreements in Italy and Germany, as well as the timing of sports events compared to last year when several events had shifted from the second quarter to the third quarter due to COVID-19.  Turning to our EBITDA results during the quarter, there was a change in the way we advertised sports rights. This cost is now aligned more directly to when games are played, including when seasons begin and end. This resulted in a $130 million benefit in the third quarter which will reverse in the fourth quarter.  Going forward, this change will continue to impact the quarterly pattern of recognizing sports rights amortization costs with expense higher in the first and fourth quarters and lower in the second and third quarters, but it should not impact our full-year results. Overall, Sky 's EBITDA increased 76%, reflecting this benefit, as well as lower sports programming costs due to resets in our sports rights and the favorable comparison on the timing of sporting events.  Before I comment on capital returns and balance sheet, let me make a comment on our corporate and other segment. As we've done in the past with other start-up activities, launch costs related to Sky Glass and XClass were reported in our corporate segment, which could become more meaningful beginning with this fourth quarter.  Now I will wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 8. We generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow this quarter, including a $670 million benefit related to the tax impact of the bond exchange we completed in August. Consolidated total capital was $2.9 billion for the quarter. And as expected, networking capital increased, reflecting our broadcast of the Olympics, as well as the continued post COVID ramp of investment in studio content.  Return of capital totaled $2.7 billion including $1.2 billion of dividend payments, and $1.5 billion of share repurchase activity. Our net leverage at quarter-end was 2.4 times, which means we are now back at a level that is consistent with our existing ratings and reflects substantial progress in both debt reduction and a strong rebound in our businesses post the pandemic.  From here, my expectation has that we keep our leverage ratio around where we currently are and continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities, which consists of maintaining a strong Balance Sheet, investing organically for profitable growth, and returning capital to shareholders. Looking ahead, our buyback will be a function of that balance and excess free cash flow available for capital returns. With that, I will turn it back to Marci, who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks Mike. Operator, let's open up the call for questions, please.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. . If you are using a speakerphone, you may need to pick up your handset first before pressing the numbers. . Our first question comes from Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thank you. Good morning. Maybe Brian, starting with you. The Sky Glass -- the move towards the smart TV seems like a really interesting evolution of your product set, taking the business here beyond your footprint as you noted in multiple markets.  Can you just talk about some of the long-term vision of what that turns into for the Company? Because it seems like it's a pretty significant opportunity as you've been limited essentially geographically in the past. And then, I guess I have to come back, Mike, to your last comment there about leverage. Just doing some quick math.  I mean, you guys are run rating -- I guess -- $5 billion of buybacks a year, looking at the second half. You've got a 4 billion or so dividend, you generate a lot of freer cash flow than those two numbers. So, to stay levered here, there's a lot of excess cash flow which is obviously a nice problem to have. Anything else you would add in terms of how you stay at 2.5 times has given the strong free cash flow dynamics of the business would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\nBrian Roberts: Thank you, Ben. Let me start that if you look at where we are today, we -- the global technology platform, we do about 5 billion entertainment streams a week on 75 million devices. So, we have a huge global scale. And one of the great things that we've been working on with Dana and Dave is having a global technology platform and working together on product innovation.  So, to specifically talk about the connected TV, streaming TV, which is what Sky Glass and X Class are really all about. I think it's a natural evolution. So, I think it's a beginning of a logical extension. And so, I was in London for the launch of Sky Glass and we've been working on it since the day we bought Sky, taken about 3 years to see it come to fruition. It's a really exciting product to simplify for the consumer so much Dana can talk at a moment a little bit about it.  It doesn't really breakthrough idea I think on how people buy it and pay for, but mostly, it's an embodiment of what we do well, which is aggregation. And that we're going to find a way for consumers to get to what they want faster, personalize it, and have fun along the way. And then it's a platform for innovation on go-forward basis for where we think television may evolve and whether it's gaming, whether it's fitness, healthcare, education.  And so, having that be part of your relationship with our Company, I think is novel territory for us to do R&D off of in the US, and finally allows us to take it all over Europe, potentially, as you say, in and out of footprint. So, we're starting in the UK but we have ambitions to expand quickly to other countries. And it's great for streamers and streaming services.  Our importance to the streaming universe will continue to grow and our relationship and certainly the Apple announcement today is that the latest iteration of that. In the U.S., pretty much locked in sync with our Sky team is the X Class, and Dave can talk a little bit about that. But -- we look at the markets, there's different opportunities, different realities with our partnership with Hisense and with Walmart, where many Americans get their televisions. And so, we're excited to begin.  And I think -- so different ends of the market, perhaps. We'll look at this as learnings across the globe. And it follows right on the heels of X1 -Q (ph.) Flex and the progress we've made on innovations. So, I'm really excited by it, and I think it also shows the one Company working well together. Let me start with Dana. Why don't you add a few thoughts on Sky Glass? And then Dave over here and I, we'll get to the question on leverage with Mike.\nDana Strong: Thanks so much. Fine. I appreciate it. Sky Glass is our latest innovation for a new streaming TV. And as it was touched on, this eliminates the need for a dish and a set-top box. This is really, really important in the go-forward and we believe it's the smartest TV in the market. I can say based on our experience of product launches, the consumer reaction here has been fantastic. And I think that really starts with the product itself which is quite innovative.  We've changed the commercial model of the product to follow the approach of the mobile handset sales. So, we've converted a large upfront payment to an affordable monthly payment with ownership, of course. It establishes a long-term relationship with the customer as a result and it really improves -- the products really improve our acquisition economics because it allows for self-installation and there is no longer need for a dish and a set-top box.  And another big part of the product innovation has been reducing the complexity of the purchase decision itself. So, everything is inside, all of the highest specs and the customer really only needs to choose the size, inclusive of the audio, which is truly fantastic, all built in. And then the breakthrough in the experience. And that's where Sky really does shine as in the fully integrated product.  So that interplay between linear, on-demand, and app content, which can really enhance people's time spent viewing, so you no longer coming in and out of apps, but the content is lifted up, enabled to tag or crop content more easily. This is what kind of makes the products such as standout. And I think it's driving some of the consumer reaction that we've seen. And Brian touched on, we think Sky Glass gives us some interesting headroom.  It opens up customers we haven't been able to reach before as they've been prohibited from having satellite dishes or didn't want them, opens up customers who are more interested in streaming content. It opened up syndication opportunities for us. And importantly, as Brian touched on it, opens up a lot of opportunity for both stickiness and potentially new revenue areas when we think about things like watch together or fitness and health, long, long term.  We think this is a platform for innovation and really just the beginning. And I think the compelling part about this is that all of the guts of this are exactly the same as all of the Comcast technology. So, this is all built through the collaboration and enablement of Comcast. And so, the synergies between this and some of the smart TV developments in the U.S. are a huge synergy, is where the hardware, the software, the cloud services are almost entirely the same.\nDavid Watson: Hello. This is Dave then, so -- and I think Dana hit it, Brian hit it, it's a -- really is for XClass, we're not starting from scratch because of this constant focus around innovation and working with the Sky team, working together with the cable group. So, we're excited about XClass. It's early days, but it is clearly the smart TV is a really important device to get to.  So, we're able to take our software stack working across the board and focus on the right segment that wants very little friction that just wants the smart TV to work and we're able to do two things. One, delivered the world-class UI. So great voice, great data integration, able to add things like the Charter app, our app on top of it.  And so, we can -- there's a lot of flexibility that we have in the business model that we have. We can go to market with the TV manufacturers, the retailers in mind, and pull it all together in a unique way, it's because we're coming in a little bit later. So, it's a great product, we're very excited about it within our footprint outside. And we're able to position Peacock as a key part of the offering and a great way, and within the UI. And so overall, very excited early but this is clearly a focus of ours.\nMike Cavanagh: Thanks, guys. Ben, it's Mike. On capital allocation and leverage, just to recap things, we ended at 2.4 times leverage. Like I said earlier, we intend to stay around this level from here, plus or minus a tick or so. We're not trying to stick the landing each and every quarter on a specific number by any stretch. But -- that's right. I think the -- we've said all along that our businesses are healthy, as you're going to hear from all the operating executives here.  They're all going to grow free cash flow over the long term, and that does create a big long-term picture for us that will put us in a great position to continue to maintain the strong balance sheet we have, continue invest organically in the businesses, and then return ample capital back to shareholders. And the prompts of the business and the patterning of those investments are what'll dictate the outcome, but it's -- we feel very good about being back at this place where that's what the picture looks like.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thank you, everyone.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Ben. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from Credit Suisse.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. So, I guess that leaves broadband for me. And so, I think Dave, in particular, Brian, I'm not sure if you have thoughts as well. There's just a lot of concerns in the marketplace by investors on fiber build-out and fixed wireless and then of course 3Q came in below 3Q 19. And I think Dave, a couple of questions. One is, what's the right baseline for growth in broadband net additions that investors should think about.  I think during the pandemic, as we move through? A lot of us look at 2019 as a normal year, pre -pandemic. It was a good year for you and the industry for broadband growth. So, one, when you look forward, like what's the right baseline for growth that you measure your businesses on? And then secondarily, any thoughts on how momentum looks in 4Q and how you feel about competitive threats would be helpful. Thank you.\nDavid Watson: You got it, Doug. So first off, as you said, we're still clearly in a fluid environment. To be clear though, the fundamentals of the business are very strong. And there is a really long runway of growth in broadband. So, we haven't changed our feeling on that at all. We have a terrific network scaled. It's ubiquitous and it continues to perform exceptionally well. And we're in a good position for the future.  So, we haven't changed our view on the long-term trajectory of the Connectivity business. I'm just as confident and optimistic in the prospects for this business as I've ever been. been. So, when you look at the whole year, I think it underscores the strength of broadband. Year-to-date we've added over 1.1 million net additions, and we've been adding over 1 million broadband subscribers each year for the past 20 years.  And as you said, while the pace in Q3 was slower than we saw earlier in the year during the height of the pandemic, our broadband net adds are still very healthy and our churn remains at record lows, certainly for Q3. I think it's important to look at the current environment and I think that points a little bit, Doug, to what you're talking about. And just a couple of drivers to call out. One, when you look at the slowdown and Mike talked about this earlier, there have been a slowdown in connects across our footprint and we look very closely at the move activity.  There's more activity earlier in the year around moves, slower now, and certainly with the last couple of months. Below 2019 levels in terms of moves. A little bit less college student activity, not alarmingly so, but a little bit less. And just a little bit less switching activity overall. I think you look at other operators, everyone's turn is down.  That means some less jump balls where we do well. I think the other thing to call out in terms of drivers, we're seeing less growth from the lower income segment. We're still adding customers in this segment but not at the same rate as earlier. There are new government programs like EBB. We're seeing traditional wireless, not fixed wireless, but traditional wireless participates and be very active in this program. And last point on competition, look, we take it all very seriously and we've been in a very competitive situation for some time.  Our focus has not wavered. We innovate, we deliver the best product for each segment. We break the market down in term second -- terms of segments, and we compete at a very local level. We have our granular view literally at the block level geographically. And by each segment from HSV (ph.) is the only -- the multiple product household. So, you add it all up, our turn remains at record lows, whether it's fiber, whether or not. And we look at our competitors' performance overall to ours historically and now.  And I think this says it all. So, as for expectations for full-year results, while current visibility and overall activity creates a little bit of modest risk, we still believe full-year net adds will be around 2019 levels. So overall, when you look at this year and you go back to 2019, 2019 was second best year that we've had and -- well over a decade. It's just a terrific year. And so, for us to be at that level and the consistency that we've had has been so strong and you point to the fundamentals.  There are some things that were on but like always, you attack them and you break them down, but I really like the fundamentals and the momentum that we have, so I think the runway is absolutely still there. And the last point is Business Services is a very important part of the connectivity story. And in there, I love their momentum as well. So, you add it all up, I like where we're at with connectivity.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks very much.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Doug. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks. Dave, I'm wondering if I can follow up on that last question. If the full-year is around 2019 levels which suggests that 4Q is a bit below where you were in 2019, is it your sense that we pulled growth from the fourth quarter earlier into the year and 2022 will be back to that normal trend or do you think the slowdown that we're seeing in 4Q might continue into 2022? And I recognize that it's difficult to have visibility given all of the sort of the puts and takes coming out of the pandemic but any color around the progression of the trend would be -- I think would be really helpful to investors.\nDavid Watson: Understood. As I mentioned, around the visibility. So, I wouldn't comment yet at this point on '22 other to say what I've already said around '19 being very strong and point back towards the fundamentals and terms of the trending around turn the activity that we have. And so, and more to come later, but I think there's -- we have this consistent momentum.  I'll be going back -- pointing back to over a million broadband net adds in over a 20-year period. Just speaks to the strength of the category. So, overall views, long runway for growth, where we're at with penetration, we haven't changed our longer-term view of that.\nJonathan Chaplin: And just following on from that, it's presumably the low churn that you're seeing is speeding into the tremendous EBITDA growth that you're seeing in the Cable segment as well. If churn for the industry has to recover for growth in broadband to recover, would that -- is there an offset to growth in EBITDA then as we think -- as we look ahead as well?\nDavid Watson: I think the main point, churn is already at a very good place. I think Our overall are record lows. So, I think what we're dealing with these transactional activities, it's a little bit later on the connect side. So, we're already in a good position.  I think we have a balanced approach towards ARPU growth. We have a balanced approach towards customer share growth. So, those fundamentals I think are consistent.\nBrian Roberts: That's the one point I just -- this is Brian. Just want to add to Dave, I think gave a very comprehensive and I totally agree with the two questions that got asked he's answered. I think that that last point, I just want to underscore which is where the record low churn suggests to me anyway, very stable business. That's what's so great about the 32 million broadband customers we have. We have a recurring business. So, while maybe there was a pull forward, maybe there's a slowdown, time will tell as your question suggests.  Where we're looking at, how do we grow EBITDA, how do we grow margins, how do we maintain and offer more product connectivity? The very first thing we talked about, what else can you do with broadband? What will broadband evolve to over the next 5 years, 10 years? So, we're super focused on minute-to-minute, but we're also -- I think Dave put in context just how good we feel and its certainly business services the same kind of innovation that we've been doing in residential, we're doing in business services.  And so, it's not some change in market conditions that really, we've all been reading about. While there may be coming, and maybe there's some of that, I actually think it's personally the disruption from the pandemic coupled with a large percentage of Americans have broadband. So, the question for us go forward is, how do we continue to grow the value of that broadband and obviously therefore grow the value to our shareholders.\nJonathan Chaplin: Great, thanks guys. I really appreciate it.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Jonathan. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jessica Reif from BOA Securities.\nJessica Reif: Thank you. I guess a bigger picture question and that's something really short. You look out towards next year. NBC year, we both clearly have a record year, but the Olympics Super Bowl, record upfront, political looks like there's a lot of money being raised. Hopefully we'll see a return of international theme park visitor and  seem to be stabilizing. Sky obviously, you've got this rollout of Sky Glass and Peacock and hopefully benefit from some of the past investments.  And Cable as you guys have just discussed, you're going out of footprint with XClass TV, which I loved your comments, but it seems like it would benefit broadband, Peacock, and advertising mobile more aggressive. So, with that long-winded introduction, I just -- could you talk about your priorities for 2022 and beyond? How different will the business look over the next 3 years to 5 years? And then a quick short question, it's just on Peacock, you didn't mention anything about usage or monthly active accounts. So, if you could give some color there.\nBrian Roberts: Well, let me start, but thanks for -- you're all over the sense of optimism. And at least, I think we all feel for the Company. I think we're one of the fortunate companies. During the pandemic, we've talked in the past about how well I think we transition to work from home, customer care, continued productions.  So, as we come, hopefully, out of this in the U.S. and globally, where are we driving or Company? And I think we will ultimately go where the consumer wants to be. And we have products and different prices that allow customers to come to our Company. We're getting close to nearly $60 million customer relationships. I think $57 million or $58 million global relationships. And these are $100 a month plus type relationships.  And so, we want to be the best leader. And that's why we're continuing the innovation, and then you add in theme parks and she talked about, and the big events that people come to our Company, whether they're advertisers or business partners. So, I think that's all driven off a global technology platform. And that's where I think we have the real leadership. And then, I want to echo what Mike has said a couple of times.  We feel like we're back in balance in our priorities, and that really puts us in a position to go forward to be disciplined in what we're doing, be a leader. And that's going to produce after all the many years that our Company has been building these relationships around the world to produce a lot of free cash that will be returned to shareholders. But, Jeff, why don't you go specifically to the Peacock and other NBC? We haven't heard from you yet. So maybe talk about the Company in general.\nJeff Shell: Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Brian and thanks, Jessica. So, everything on Peacock is heading in the right direction and there's really nothing from a trajectory perspective that's any different than it was last quarter or the quarter before. All metrics are pointed up. Our usage continues to be great. Our mix of users continues to be great.  We added a few million more subs, more MAAs. Everything -- advertising, we -- in this quarter, we just at the tailed of the quarter, we started selling advertising beyond sponsorship of which in the fourth quarter, it's all beyond sponsorship and that is going spectacularly well. So, we're really pleased with Peacock.  It's way ahead of where we expected to be at this point. And every month, every quarter, it gets further ahead. And as you were talking about the business overall for next year, I was getting excited because we're very excited about next year with everything that we've got coming across NBCUniversal from the Olympics or the Super Bowl, to a spectacular movie slate, to a very strong advertising business, ratings at our linear networks improving. And I think Peacock -- I would add to that, that Peacock is doing really well right now without most of its programming strength.  So, if you look at the future, and you look at where we're headed with Peacock, we have -- because of the pandemic we are behind on our original production. So, we're going to start to see a ramp up in originals on Peacock, which is very necessary to continue to grow, to have successful and robust original programming and we're excited about a lot of the things that were making for the service. We decided to buy our first window as we talked about last call of our movies.  So, our Pay1 Rights, so to speak. And the first movie in our Pay1 Rights will hit Peacock in the first quarter, and then we'll have a steady supply of movies. We've seen across all streaming platforms that movies move the dial, they move the dial for Peacock in this quarter with Boss Baby, recently with Halloween Kills, which by the way was a huge hit on Peacock and a huge it at the box office. So, it shows that you can play in two different markets.  So, we have all of our movies coming to Peacock and we couldn't be more excited about where Peacock is, and we'll continue to invest behind that success. I think it's important to remember too that we launched just over a year ago. We launched in July of last year. So, we've been in business for just over a year, and we're already more than a third of where Hulu is now, which is a service that's been more than decades in the making. So, excited about the year overall in the Company and really excited about where Peacock's going.\nJessica Reif: Thank you. Thank you.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Jessica Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.\nCraig Moffett: Hi, thanks. So, I guess, we -- having talked about broadband and some of the growth initiatives across the Company, let's talk about wireless as the other big growth initiative. I guess, first the way I would question sort of, we've seen some data that suggests that your Wi - Fi is offloading a lot more traffic than we would've expected from the contracts so that the gross margins of that business maybe much more -- much higher than we had previously believed.  It makes me wonder, what's the strategic goal for that business? Is it really to drive the business into being the largest, most profitable business it can be or is it still largely to reduce churn on broadband and think of it as more of a defensive product for protecting your existing business. And then if I could just squeeze in a second unrelated question. Can you just update us on your thoughts of Hulu, which, I guess, doesn't necessarily come up until 2024? But is there any opportunity that you might do something with Hulu sooner?\nDavid Watson: Hey, Craig, Dave here. So, let me start with wireless. So, I don't think -- We really haven't changed our -- the strategic imperative behind Mobile, but most certainly, things have accelerated. And we are very focused on how we leveraged Mobile to support broadband. Once we successfully worked on the Verizon relationship and improve the MVNO relationship.  We're able to go-to-market with and launching the new unlimited plans, combining that with By the Gig, just puts us in a unique position. So, I think our goal is what we said earlier is to go faster and leverage mobile completely and everything that we do and how we surround broadband with a terrific product, I think it is profitable. It'll continue to be, we feel confident of that. But the main focus is to drive broadband. And there are a couple of key things: 1.  It is -- it continues to support the broadband churn. Again, pointing towards the record low broadband overall churns, mobile is just one piece of that. But it also drives consideration on the front end. So, when things -- the activity overall begins to tick back up, I think retail on mobile play a huge role. As you pointed out, I think the other key point is: how do we leverage product integration with Wi-Fi? We already do a great job.  Thus, the -- every mobile device -- we contribute just a ton of broadband traffic through these mobile devices over our Wi - Fi network, and its part of our network. So over time, we want to work hard on how do we integrate the experience and just do more. So, I think in the home, and we'll be opportunistic outside the home. So, I think it's -- we're accelerating mobile, every single sales channel, every marketing plan. And we'll continue to package mobile with broadband in unique ways going forward.\nMike Cavanagh: Hey, Craig, it's Mike. So, on Hulu, just tremendous increase in value there. Obviously, great business that's participating in one of the hottest areas of value increased streaming. So, we're happy to be along for that ride. Obviously, while we set up our own thing in Peacock. In terms of the deal, it is a couple of years out.  But remember, we put this together a couple of years ago and I'm certainly glad we didn't exit at the time, 3-year or so years ago. So, like the deal we have and I think we're always open for business. But it will be fine if we stay to the end because I expect value to keep increasing.\nCraig Moffett: Thank you.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Craig. Operator, we have time for 1 last question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Philip Cusick with JPMorgan.\nPhilip Cusick : Hi, guys, thanks for squeezing me in. I want to ask a couple of follow-ups. First on the broadband trends. The last few quarters, and in September, you've been pretty specific on how you thought the year would come in. Is there just less visibility today compared to where we were in September? And it sounds like this isn't a competition issue, just more of an underlying demand. How also does that make you think about price increases this year for broadband and video with the pandemic still going on in new FCC? And as well on the buyback in the last cycle, you weren't really willing to borrow money to buy back stock, preferring to use cash flow and let leverage drift lower.  It sounds like it's different this time. And is that driven by the stock price being really attractive, or you really want to just keep that leverage in that mid-20s range? Thank you.\nDavid Watson: Let me start as Dave, let me start with broadband. As I said, there is some limited visibility on what we've seen and obviously an acceleration of activity earlier in the year, that was more like '20 and the first part of '21, but primarily really -- on the connect side. And I think I walked through some of the drivers behind that. But again, pointing towards the whole year gives perspective on Q4 around the 2019 levels.  Still, I think the key is the overall turn levels just being where they are at and I've talked about that. Your point, our approach is to consistently focus on value. And whether it's fiber or not, our goal is constantly innovating, position the greatest network, I think, for today and tomorrow.  And we're constantly adding speeds. We've improved coverage, great devices, the gateways, the pods, control improvements that we've had, streaming with the Flex, now XClass, and Mobile. We're surrounding broadband with products. It eases some of the pressure around pricing when you can package with so many alternatives. The other thing that we do is we provide multiple tiers of broadband and we've market -- we break down the broadband marketplace into segments.  So, we have a lot of choice out there. And so, it is we go and we consult with the prospects upfront and customers all the time, what's best for them, and we put them in packages that work. And that gives an opportunity to drive ARPU when you do it that way. So, overall, the fundamentals, again, I've talked about in -- you look at the long-term runway of broadband and the consistency of how we performed. To me, that's -- I think points towards the future. So, Brian.\nBrian Roberts: Okay. I think it's a perfect way to end the call. Phil, with your question, let me again state that I think it was a great quarter. And 1 of the highlights of the quarter was returning after several years to what we have, our target leverage ratio, which Mike talked about. And so -- we sort of separate, at least I do in my mind, the borrowing from the buybacks. They are not linked the way you described; they may appear that way.  And I just want to give a complement to our treasury team, Jason Armstrong and the team. During the last 18 months, our Balance sheets have never been in a stronger position. We've done some long-term rollovers and extensions at historically low rates. And so, you put all that together with this operating performance and it does get us back to where we wanted to be, which will then allow us to more aggressively take advantage of what a number of us believe as a great Company.  And, therefore, you can put your own value on it as shareholders, but we certainly are looking forward to buying back stock. And I think Mike described the logic well in the ratios. And all-in-all, a really great quarter. So, thank you, team, and thanks for your support on the call to the shareholders. Marci, over to you.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Phil. And thank you, everyone for joining us on our third quarter call. Have a great day.\nBrian Roberts: Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: There will be a replay available for today's call starting at 12 PM Eastern Standard Time.

So, everything on Peacock is heading in the right direction and there's really nothing from a trajectory perspective that's any different than it was last quarter or the quarter before. All metrics are pointed up. Our usage continues to be great. Our mix of users continues to be great.  We added a few million more subs, more MAAs. Everything -- advertising, we -- in this quarter, we just at the tailed of the quarter, we started selling advertising beyond sponsorship of which in the fourth quarter, it's all beyond sponsorship and that is going spectacularly well. So, we're really pleased with Peacock.  It's way ahead of where we expected to be at this point. And every month, every quarter, it gets further ahead. And as you were talking about the business overall for next year, I was getting excited because we're very excited about next year with everything that we've got coming across NBCUniversal from the Olympics or the Super Bowl, to a spectacular movie slate, to a very strong advertising business, ratings at our linear networks improving. And I think Peacock -- I would add to that, that Peacock is doing really well right now without most of its programming strength.  So, if you look at the future, and you look at where we're headed with Peacock, we have -- because of the pandemic we are behind on our original production. So, we're going to start to see a ramp up in originals on Peacock, which is very necessary to continue to grow, to have successful and robust original programming and we're excited about a lot of the things that were making for the service. We decided to buy our first window as we talked about last call of our movies.  So, our Pay1 Rights, so to speak. And the first movie in our Pay1 Rights will hit Peacock in the first quarter, and then we'll have a steady supply of movies. We've seen across all streaming platforms that movies move the dial, they move the dial for Peacock in this quarter with Boss Baby, recently with Halloween Kills, which by the way was a huge hit on Peacock and a huge it at the box office. So, it shows that you can play in two different markets.  So, we have all of our movies coming to Peacock and we couldn't be more excited about where Peacock is, and we'll continue to invest behind that success. I think it's important to remember too that we launched just over a year ago. We launched in July of last year. So, we've been in business for just over a year, and we're already more than a third of where Hulu is now, which is a service that's been more than decades in the making. So, excited about the year overall in the Company and really excited about where Peacock's going."

            "name": "Brian Roberts",
            "content": "Thanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. We had a wonderful third quarter across the entire Company, with 18% growth in adjusted EBITDA and 34% growth in adjusted EPS. And we generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow. One of our goals the past several years has been to return to a position of offensively investing our existing businesses, paying a growing dividend, and also buying back meaningful amounts of stock.  So, I'm pleased to report that we have now achieved all of that in this quarter and we're back to our desired leverage ratios. Our Cable division continues to be a standout delivering over 7% revenue growth and the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit EBITDA growth of 10% fueled by our broadband business, which generated 300,000 net additions and contributed to a very healthy 255,000 net new customer relationships. Business services has emerged from the pandemic and was also a key driver of our results. And we believe this momentum will continue.  Our success comes from our network advantage, innovative products, and world-class operational capabilities which enable us to provide an unparalleled experience. Just like in residential, we are proactively responding to the needs of our commercial customers and offering personalized solutions. While small business has led our growth for the last decade we're still significantly under-penetrated in the mid-market and enterprise segments.  We see a lot of potential to take share in our large addressable market, which just got even bigger post our recent acquisition of Mesa G (ph.), which builds on our strong offering of technology solutions. Mesa G (ph.) has become a leading provider to companies worldwide and unlocks a customer segment that we don't have today, particularly U.S. based organizations with multi-site global operations. Xfinity Mobile exceeded its prior record, adding 285,000 lines, the most in any quarter since launch.  And we continue to evaluate ways we can accelerate this business even further as wireline and wireless connectivity services continue to converge. We're looking at new, exciting products and packaging that highlight how we're able to provide our customers with the best and most reliable broadband wherever they are or wherever they go, and help them save money at the same time. And with only 6% penetration of our 32 million broadband customers we have a long runway.  Taking all of this together, we have an incredibly robust broadband business and we've been adding over a million broadband customers each year for the past 20 plus years and we continue to deepen these relationships by offering a fantastic and differentiated in-home experience with the fastest modem and gateway and the greatest WIFI coverage.  We plan to continue our relentless focus on aggressively developing and improving our suite of products around connectivity. The foundation of all of this is our network. And we are currently in the process of deploying new technology, updating key infrastructure, and accelerating virtualization across our footprint so that we can deliver even further enhancements, fast and at scale to millions of customers.  And we will continue to evaluate every opportunity we have to expand our passing's which will bring our amazing suite of products and services to many new homes and businesses. All of David Watson and his team superb execution is around decades of investment that has led to constant new product innovation, including this month's launch of XClass TV, an extension of our leadership in video aggregation.  XClass is an innovative smart television powered by our global technology platform that brings the best of our Company's entertainment operating system to consumers nationwide, together with the option to use either Xfinity, Charter, or other entertainment apps. At NBCUniversal, we continue to see great progress in each of our businesses. But I'd like to highlight our theme parks, especially Orlando, which just reported the most profitable quarter in its history despite having virtually no international guests, due to COVID related travel restraints.  In Hollywood, we continue to see recovery and we had a very successful and exciting opening of Universal Beijing Resort on September 20th. I also look forward to COVID related restrictions easing in Osaka which could happen soon. Our media business is also doing very well. We're benefiting from the many changes Jeff Shell and his team implemented starting in 2020. With new hires, different roles, fresh content, and a more efficient operating structure.  We're seeing the financial success in both our linear networks, as well as Peacock, which has maintained its momentum. We have a new breakout hit with La Brea which has been a contributor to NBC's overall audience lead this primetime season as well as the best performing new show on Peacock. Sunday Night Football has returned with great momentum, which we're seeing across our platforms.  And we're thrilled with the performance of our second Halloween installment, which generated more revenue in its opening weekend at the domestic box office than any other film this year with a day and date streaming release and as the number one non-live event premiere in Peacock's history. We're also looking forward to extending our streaming platforms outside of the U.S. With Peacock launching on Sky next month and Sky Showtime in the works for mid-2022.  At Sky, I want to re-emphasize how well we're performing in the UK, which continues its growth trajectory and customer relationships led by record low . We're also seeing great momentum in our broadband and mobile businesses. Earlier this month, A - Dana Strong and her team introduced Sky Glass in London, a premium all-in-one streaming television and multi-channel subscription package that is so much more than just a stunning TV with amazing sound.  It's an innovation platform that opens up a whole new world of entertainment for our customers, and simplifies the experience so they can stream every channel, every show and every app, in one easy-to-use interface. And already, the customer response has very much exceeded our initial expectations.  We're also incredibly proud that Sky Glass as the first TV to be certified carbon-neutral. Sky has been leading all of Comcast with its sustainability goals. And is the first media Company in the UK to commit to being net carbon zero by 2030. While Glass and X Class are distinct products with different monetization and distribution strategies, they extend our customer base beyond our previous capabilities and they run off the same global technology platform.  This allows us to quickly bring the best features to consumers across territories, segments, and brands, and on Comcast hardware and through our syndication partners. I'm pleased to also announce today that Apple will bring Apple TV Plus and the Apple TV app to our Xfinity and Sky customers on X1, Flex, XClass, Sky Glass, and Sky Q devices and Comcast is bringing the Xfinity stream and  apps to Apple TV devices.  We're working together with our partners to deliver the best apps and experiences on our platforms. And our teams are sharing capabilities and collaborating across the Company collectively drawing on our scale and leadership and broadband aggregation and streaming to innovate and profitably serve new and existing customers.  Looking ahead, I am excited about the opportunities we have to both invest in our business and return capital through buybacks and dividends, all while maintaining leverage around current levels. And I believe we are extremely well-positioned to continue our track record of building long-term shareholder value. So, I'm pleased to now hand it over to Mike for more detail on this strong quarter. Thank you, Ben. Let me start that if you look at where we are today, we -- the global technology platform, we do about 5 billion entertainment streams a week on 75 million devices. So, we have a huge global scale. And one of the great things that we've been working on with Dana and Dave is having a global technology platform and working together on product innovation.  So, to specifically talk about the connected TV, streaming TV, which is what Sky Glass and X Class are really all about. I think it's a natural evolution. So, I think it's a beginning of a logical extension. And so, I was in London for the launch of Sky Glass and we've been working on it since the day we bought Sky, taken about 3 years to see it come to fruition. It's a really exciting product to simplify for the consumer so much Dana can talk at a moment a little bit about it.  It doesn't really breakthrough idea I think on how people buy it and pay for, but mostly, it's an embodiment of what we do well, which is aggregation. And that we're going to find a way for consumers to get to what they want faster, personalize it, and have fun along the way. And then it's a platform for innovation on go-forward basis for where we think television may evolve and whether it's gaming, whether it's fitness, healthcare, education.  And so, having that be part of your relationship with our Company, I think is novel territory for us to do R&D off of in the US, and finally allows us to take it all over Europe, potentially, as you say, in and out of footprint. So, we're starting in the UK but we have ambitions to expand quickly to other countries. And it's great for streamers and streaming services.  Our importance to the streaming universe will continue to grow and our relationship and certainly the Apple announcement today is that the latest iteration of that. In the U.S., pretty much locked in sync with our Sky team is the X Class, and Dave can talk a little bit about that. But -- we look at the markets, there's different opportunities, different realities with our partnership with Hisense and with Walmart, where many Americans get their televisions. And so, we're excited to begin.  And I think -- so different ends of the market, perhaps. We'll look at this as learnings across the globe. And it follows right on the heels of X1 -Q (ph.) Flex and the progress we've made on innovations. So, I'm really excited by it, and I think it also shows the one Company working well together. Let me start with Dana. Why don't you add a few thoughts on Sky Glass? And then Dave over here and I, we'll get to the question on leverage with Mike. That's the one point I just -- this is Brian. Just want to add to Dave, I think gave a very comprehensive and I totally agree with the two questions that got asked he's answered. I think that that last point, I just want to underscore which is where the record low churn suggests to me anyway, very stable business. That's what's so great about the 32 million broadband customers we have. We have a recurring business. So, while maybe there was a pull forward, maybe there's a slowdown, time will tell as your question suggests.  Where we're looking at, how do we grow EBITDA, how do we grow margins, how do we maintain and offer more product connectivity? The very first thing we talked about, what else can you do with broadband? What will broadband evolve to over the next 5 years, 10 years? So, we're super focused on minute-to-minute, but we're also -- I think Dave put in context just how good we feel and its certainly business services the same kind of innovation that we've been doing in residential, we're doing in business services.  And so, it's not some change in market conditions that really, we've all been reading about. While there may be coming, and maybe there's some of that, I actually think it's personally the disruption from the pandemic coupled with a large percentage of Americans have broadband. So, the question for us go forward is, how do we continue to grow the value of that broadband and obviously therefore grow the value to our shareholders. Well, let me start, but thanks for -- you're all over the sense of optimism. And at least, I think we all feel for the Company. I think we're one of the fortunate companies. During the pandemic, we've talked in the past about how well I think we transition to work from home, customer care, continued productions.  So, as we come, hopefully, out of this in the U.S. and globally, where are we driving or Company? And I think we will ultimately go where the consumer wants to be. And we have products and different prices that allow customers to come to our Company. We're getting close to nearly $60 million customer relationships. I think $57 million or $58 million global relationships. And these are $100 a month plus type relationships.  And so, we want to be the best leader. And that's why we're continuing the innovation, and then you add in theme parks and she talked about, and the big events that people come to our Company, whether they're advertisers or business partners. So, I think that's all driven off a global technology platform. And that's where I think we have the real leadership. And then, I want to echo what Mike has said a couple of times.  We feel like we're back in balance in our priorities, and that really puts us in a position to go forward to be disciplined in what we're doing, be a leader. And that's going to produce after all the many years that our Company has been building these relationships around the world to produce a lot of free cash that will be returned to shareholders. But, Jeff, why don't you go specifically to the Peacock and other NBC? We haven't heard from you yet. So maybe talk about the Company in general. Okay. I think it's a perfect way to end the call. Phil, with your question, let me again state that I think it was a great quarter. And 1 of the highlights of the quarter was returning after several years to what we have, our target leverage ratio, which Mike talked about. And so -- we sort of separate, at least I do in my mind, the borrowing from the buybacks. They are not linked the way you described; they may appear that way.  And I just want to give a complement to our treasury team, Jason Armstrong and the team. During the last 18 months, our Balance sheets have never been in a stronger position. We've done some long-term rollovers and extensions at historically low rates. And so, you put all that together with this operating performance and it does get us back to where we wanted to be, which will then allow us to more aggressively take advantage of what a number of us believe as a great Company.  And, therefore, you can put your own value on it as shareholders, but we certainly are looking forward to buying back stock. And I think Mike described the logic well in the ratios. And all-in-all, a really great quarter. So, thank you, team, and thanks for your support on the call to the shareholders. Marci, over to you. Thanks, everybody."

            "name": "Dana Strong",
            "content": "Thanks so much. Fine. I appreciate it. Sky Glass is our latest innovation for a new streaming TV. And as it was touched on, this eliminates the need for a dish and a set-top box. This is really, really important in the go-forward and we believe it's the smartest TV in the market. I can say based on our experience of product launches, the consumer reaction here has been fantastic. And I think that really starts with the product itself which is quite innovative.  We've changed the commercial model of the product to follow the approach of the mobile handset sales. So, we've converted a large upfront payment to an affordable monthly payment with ownership, of course. It establishes a long-term relationship with the customer as a result and it really improves -- the products really improve our acquisition economics because it allows for self-installation and there is no longer need for a dish and a set-top box.  And another big part of the product innovation has been reducing the complexity of the purchase decision itself. So, everything is inside, all of the highest specs and the customer really only needs to choose the size, inclusive of the audio, which is truly fantastic, all built in. And then the breakthrough in the experience. And that's where Sky really does shine as in the fully integrated product.  So that interplay between linear, on-demand, and app content, which can really enhance people's time spent viewing, so you no longer coming in and out of apps, but the content is lifted up, enabled to tag or crop content more easily. This is what kind of makes the products such as standout. And I think it's driving some of the consumer reaction that we've seen. And Brian touched on, we think Sky Glass gives us some interesting headroom.  It opens up customers we haven't been able to reach before as they've been prohibited from having satellite dishes or didn't want them, opens up customers who are more interested in streaming content. It opened up syndication opportunities for us. And importantly, as Brian touched on it, opens up a lot of opportunity for both stickiness and potentially new revenue areas when we think about things like watch together or fitness and health, long, long term.  We think this is a platform for innovation and really just the beginning. And I think the compelling part about this is that all of the guts of this are exactly the same as all of the Comcast technology. So, this is all built through the collaboration and enablement of Comcast. And so, the synergies between this and some of the smart TV developments in the U.S. are a huge synergy, is where the hardware, the software, the cloud services are almost entirely the same."

            "name": "Mike Cavanagh",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. And good morning, everyone. I'll begin on slide four with our third quarter consolidated 2021 results. Revenue increased 19% to $30.3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 18% to $9 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 34% to $0.87 per share. And finally, we generated 3.2 billion of free cash flow.  Now let's turn to our business segment results, starting with Cable Communication on slide 5. Cable revenue increased 7.4% to $16.1 billion. EBITDA increased 10% to $7.1 billion and net cash flow grew 16% to $5 billion. As a reminder, comparisons to last year were impacted by adjustments accrued for customer RSN fees.  Excluding these adjustments, cable communications revenue increased 6.3% with no corresponding impact to EBITDA. We added 255,000 net new customer relationships in the quarter, once again, driven by broadband, where we added 300,000 net new residential and business customers. We continue to benefit from high levels of customer retention with broadband churn improving to the lowest rate for any third quarter on record.  The strong level of net customer additions over the past year, including this third quarter, coupled with higher average revenue per customer, drove broadband revenue growth of 12%. This growth was about a point lower, excluding the RSN fee adjustments in last year's results. Wireless and business services also drove our strong cable revenue growth. Wireless revenue grew 51% driven by growth in customer lines and higher device sales. Overall, we added 285,000 lines in the quarter, the best results since launching this business in 2017, bringing total mobile lines to 3.7 million.  Business Services revenue increased 8.7%, reflecting an increase in rates and customers primarily driven by the continued improvement in small businesses. We added 18,000 net new customers in the quarter and 72,000 over the past year. We recently closed on our acquisition of Masergy, which enabled us to offer a broader range of products and solutions to mid-market and enterprise customers and expand s our market opportunity to customers with a global presence.  Moving to Video, revenue increased 1.4% and was flat excluding the RSN fee adjustments in last year's third quarter, driven by a residential rate increase at the beginning of the year, mostly offset by a video subscriber, net losses totaling 408,000 this quarter. Last, advertising revenue increased 4.6%, reflecting a strong overall market recovery compared to last year's third quarter which was impacted by COVID, partially offset by lower political advertising.  As a reminder, the Q4 year-over-year comparison will be impacted by record levels of political advertising last year. Turning to expenses, cable communications ' third quarter expenses increased 5.3%. Programming expenses increased 7.6%, mainly reflecting the comparison to last year, which benefited from RSN adjustments.  Excluding these, programming expenses were up 2.8% as we begin to lap the large number of contract renewals that started to cycle through in 2020. Non  expenses increased 3.9% and decreased 0.8% on a per relationship basis, reflecting our investment to drive growth in our core businesses, broadband, wireless, and business services. This resulted in higher technical and product support in advertising, marketing and promotion expenses, which were partially offset by lower bad debt and customer service expense.  Cable Communications' EBITDA increased 10% to $7.1 billion, including a contribution of $51 million from our wireless business. Cable EBITDA margin reached 43.9%, reflecting 120 basis points of year-over-year improvement. While the RSN fee adjustments had no impact on EBITDA, they did impact margins last year. Excluding the RSN adjustment impact, our margin expanded a 160-basis points year-over-year.  Cable capital expenditures decreased 5.4%, resulting in capex intensity of 10.4% for there is typically some choppiness and Cable capex from quarter-to-quarter, mainly due to timing. Now let's turn to Slide 6 for NBCUniversal. Starting with total NBCUniversal results, revenue increased 58% to $10 billion and EBITDA increased 48% to $1.35 billion. Media revenue increased 48% to $6.8 billion, including $1.8 billion associated with the Tokyo Olympics.  Excluding the Olympics, revenue increased 9.2% driven by higher distribution and advertising revenue. Distribution revenue increased over 12%, reflecting higher rates, post the successful completion of several carriage renewals at the end of 2020. And a growing contribution from Peacock, partially offset by subscriber declines, which have been stable for the past few quarters.  Advertising revenue increased 7.2%, reflecting an overall market recovery compared to last year, very strong demand and pricing for our Ad inventory. A higher contribution from Peacock, and a solid start to the new fall season, including Strong NFL ratings partially offset by the timing of sporting events compared to last year when several events that shifted from the second quarter to the third quarter.  Media EBITDA increased 1.2% to $997 million, including results of Tokyo Olympics. The favorable comparison on the timing of other sporting events and Peacock losses that were impacted by higher costs associated with the day and date release of the Boss Baby: Family Business.  As a reminder, our fourth-quarter results will face a difficult comparison to last year due to higher costs associated with the timing of more sporting events at our regional sports network an increase in our original entertainment as we continue to launch our fall season, and the inclusion of our latest studio release, Halloween Kills, on Peacock. Studios revenue increased 27% driven fairly equally by growth in theatrical and content licensing revenue.  The increase in theatrical revenue reflected the continued success of F9 as well as several new releases including the Boss Baby family business, which was in theaters and on Peacock. In addition, content licensing revenue growth benefited from the delivery of content to our networks, Peacock and third parties.  Studio EBITDA declined 47% to $179 million, driven by higher amortization of television and film production costs as we return to pre - COVID levels of production and investment in marketing and promotion to launch our new films. Looking to the fourth quarter, EBITDA comparisons to last year will remain challenging in the short-term as we launch new theatrical releases and ramp our TV productions, which had been impacted by the pandemic.  Moving to theme parks, revenue increased by $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion dollars and we generated EBITDA of $434 million which included about a $130 million of Universal Beijing pre -opening costs. This was our most profitable quarter since the pandemic began in the Q1 of 2020, driven by improved operating results at our U.S. parks, including strong domestic attendance and per caps that were above pre -pandemic levels. In fact, as Brian noted, Universal Orlando delivered its highest EBITDA for any quarter in its history.  At Universal Studios Japan, results were challenging as we continue to operate under a government capacity restriction, keeping attendance below 2019 levels. Last, we opened Universal Beijing on September 20th, where the initial demand has been positive. While our parks offer a great experience year-round, we expect some seasonality given Beijing's weather conditions with lower attendance in the fall and winter and more in spring and summer.  So overall on Parks, we are encouraged by the continued recovery, but getting back to and then exceeding pre -pandemic levels of EBITDA will likely require an improvement in international visitation. Now let's turn to Slide 7 for Sky, which I will speak to on a constant currency basis. For the third quarter, Sky revenue was $5 billion and relatively consistent compared to last year.  Direct-to-consumer revenue was also consistent with last year's results, primarily reflecting strong growth in the UK driven by continued growth in customer relationships and higher ARPU due to the positive impact of a rate increase earlier this year. Higher mobile device sales, and the continued turnaround in hospitality revenue as pubs and clubs come back. This was offset by a decrease in customer relationships and ARPU in Italy, mainly due to a negative impact from the reduction in broadcast rights to Serie A.  Sky's overall customer relationships declined 233,000 entirely driven by customer losses in Italy. Advertising revenue increased 16% with the results in the UK driving the bulk of the growth and reflecting the overall market recovery from COVID-19. This increase was offset by a 26% decline in content revenue, driven by the change in sports licensing agreements in Italy and Germany, as well as the timing of sports events compared to last year when several events had shifted from the second quarter to the third quarter due to COVID-19.  Turning to our EBITDA results during the quarter, there was a change in the way we advertised sports rights. This cost is now aligned more directly to when games are played, including when seasons begin and end. This resulted in a $130 million benefit in the third quarter which will reverse in the fourth quarter.  Going forward, this change will continue to impact the quarterly pattern of recognizing sports rights amortization costs with expense higher in the first and fourth quarters and lower in the second and third quarters, but it should not impact our full-year results. Overall, Sky 's EBITDA increased 76%, reflecting this benefit, as well as lower sports programming costs due to resets in our sports rights and the favorable comparison on the timing of sporting events.  Before I comment on capital returns and balance sheet, let me make a comment on our corporate and other segment. As we've done in the past with other start-up activities, launch costs related to Sky Glass and XClass were reported in our corporate segment, which could become more meaningful beginning with this fourth quarter.  Now I will wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 8. We generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow this quarter, including a $670 million benefit related to the tax impact of the bond exchange we completed in August. Consolidated total capital was $2.9 billion for the quarter. And as expected, networking capital increased, reflecting our broadcast of the Olympics, as well as the continued post COVID ramp of investment in studio content.  Return of capital totaled $2.7 billion including $1.2 billion of dividend payments, and $1.5 billion of share repurchase activity. Our net leverage at quarter-end was 2.4 times, which means we are now back at a level that is consistent with our existing ratings and reflects substantial progress in both debt reduction and a strong rebound in our businesses post the pandemic.  From here, my expectation has that we keep our leverage ratio around where we currently are and continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities, which consists of maintaining a strong Balance Sheet, investing organically for profitable growth, and returning capital to shareholders. Looking ahead, our buyback will be a function of that balance and excess free cash flow available for capital returns. With that, I will turn it back to Marci, who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call. Thanks, guys. Ben, it's Mike. On capital allocation and leverage, just to recap things, we ended at 2.4 times leverage. Like I said earlier, we intend to stay around this level from here, plus or minus a tick or so. We're not trying to stick the landing each and every quarter on a specific number by any stretch. But -- that's right. I think the -- we've said all along that our businesses are healthy, as you're going to hear from all the operating executives here.  They're all going to grow free cash flow over the long term, and that does create a big long-term picture for us that will put us in a great position to continue to maintain the strong balance sheet we have, continue invest organically in the businesses, and then return ample capital back to shareholders. And the prompts of the business and the patterning of those investments are what'll dictate the outcome, but it's -- we feel very good about being back at this place where that's what the picture looks like. Hey, Craig, it's Mike. So, on Hulu, just tremendous increase in value there. Obviously, great business that's participating in one of the hottest areas of value increased streaming. So, we're happy to be along for that ride. Obviously, while we set up our own thing in Peacock. In terms of the deal, it is a couple of years out.  But remember, we put this together a couple of years ago and I'm certainly glad we didn't exit at the time, 3-year or so years ago. So, like the deal we have and I think we're always open for business. But it will be fine if we stay to the end because I expect value to keep increasing."

            "name": "David Watson",
            "content": "Hello. This is Dave then, so -- and I think Dana hit it, Brian hit it, it's a -- really is for XClass, we're not starting from scratch because of this constant focus around innovation and working with the Sky team, working together with the cable group. So, we're excited about XClass. It's early days, but it is clearly the smart TV is a really important device to get to.  So, we're able to take our software stack working across the board and focus on the right segment that wants very little friction that just wants the smart TV to work and we're able to do two things. One, delivered the world-class UI. So great voice, great data integration, able to add things like the Charter app, our app on top of it.  And so, we can -- there's a lot of flexibility that we have in the business model that we have. We can go to market with the TV manufacturers, the retailers in mind, and pull it all together in a unique way, it's because we're coming in a little bit later. So, it's a great product, we're very excited about it within our footprint outside. And we're able to position Peacock as a key part of the offering and a great way, and within the UI. And so overall, very excited early but this is clearly a focus of ours. You got it, Doug. So first off, as you said, we're still clearly in a fluid environment. To be clear though, the fundamentals of the business are very strong. And there is a really long runway of growth in broadband. So, we haven't changed our feeling on that at all. We have a terrific network scaled. It's ubiquitous and it continues to perform exceptionally well. And we're in a good position for the future.  So, we haven't changed our view on the long-term trajectory of the Connectivity business. I'm just as confident and optimistic in the prospects for this business as I've ever been. been. So, when you look at the whole year, I think it underscores the strength of broadband. Year-to-date we've added over 1.1 million net additions, and we've been adding over 1 million broadband subscribers each year for the past 20 years.  And as you said, while the pace in Q3 was slower than we saw earlier in the year during the height of the pandemic, our broadband net adds are still very healthy and our churn remains at record lows, certainly for Q3. I think it's important to look at the current environment and I think that points a little bit, Doug, to what you're talking about. And just a couple of drivers to call out. One, when you look at the slowdown and Mike talked about this earlier, there have been a slowdown in connects across our footprint and we look very closely at the move activity.  There's more activity earlier in the year around moves, slower now, and certainly with the last couple of months. Below 2019 levels in terms of moves. A little bit less college student activity, not alarmingly so, but a little bit less. And just a little bit less switching activity overall. I think you look at other operators, everyone's turn is down.  That means some less jump balls where we do well. I think the other thing to call out in terms of drivers, we're seeing less growth from the lower income segment. We're still adding customers in this segment but not at the same rate as earlier. There are new government programs like EBB. We're seeing traditional wireless, not fixed wireless, but traditional wireless participates and be very active in this program. And last point on competition, look, we take it all very seriously and we've been in a very competitive situation for some time.  Our focus has not wavered. We innovate, we deliver the best product for each segment. We break the market down in term second -- terms of segments, and we compete at a very local level. We have our granular view literally at the block level geographically. And by each segment from HSV (ph.) is the only -- the multiple product household. So, you add it all up, our turn remains at record lows, whether it's fiber, whether or not. And we look at our competitors' performance overall to ours historically and now.  And I think this says it all. So, as for expectations for full-year results, while current visibility and overall activity creates a little bit of modest risk, we still believe full-year net adds will be around 2019 levels. So overall, when you look at this year and you go back to 2019, 2019 was second best year that we've had and -- well over a decade. It's just a terrific year. And so, for us to be at that level and the consistency that we've had has been so strong and you point to the fundamentals.  There are some things that were on but like always, you attack them and you break them down, but I really like the fundamentals and the momentum that we have, so I think the runway is absolutely still there. And the last point is Business Services is a very important part of the connectivity story. And in there, I love their momentum as well. So, you add it all up, I like where we're at with connectivity. Understood. As I mentioned, around the visibility. So, I wouldn't comment yet at this point on '22 other to say what I've already said around '19 being very strong and point back towards the fundamentals and terms of the trending around turn the activity that we have. And so, and more to come later, but I think there's -- we have this consistent momentum.  I'll be going back -- pointing back to over a million broadband net adds in over a 20-year period. Just speaks to the strength of the category. So, overall views, long runway for growth, where we're at with penetration, we haven't changed our longer-term view of that. I think the main point, churn is already at a very good place. I think Our overall are record lows. So, I think what we're dealing with these transactional activities, it's a little bit later on the connect side. So, we're already in a good position.  I think we have a balanced approach towards ARPU growth. We have a balanced approach towards customer share growth. So, those fundamentals I think are consistent. Hey, Craig, Dave here. So, let me start with wireless. So, I don't think -- We really haven't changed our -- the strategic imperative behind Mobile, but most certainly, things have accelerated. And we are very focused on how we leveraged Mobile to support broadband. Once we successfully worked on the Verizon relationship and improve the MVNO relationship.  We're able to go-to-market with and launching the new unlimited plans, combining that with By the Gig, just puts us in a unique position. So, I think our goal is what we said earlier is to go faster and leverage mobile completely and everything that we do and how we surround broadband with a terrific product, I think it is profitable. It'll continue to be, we feel confident of that. But the main focus is to drive broadband. And there are a couple of key things: 1.  It is -- it continues to support the broadband churn. Again, pointing towards the record low broadband overall churns, mobile is just one piece of that. But it also drives consideration on the front end. So, when things -- the activity overall begins to tick back up, I think retail on mobile play a huge role. As you pointed out, I think the other key point is: how do we leverage product integration with Wi-Fi? We already do a great job.  Thus, the -- every mobile device -- we contribute just a ton of broadband traffic through these mobile devices over our Wi - Fi network, and its part of our network. So over time, we want to work hard on how do we integrate the experience and just do more. So, I think in the home, and we'll be opportunistic outside the home. So, I think it's -- we're accelerating mobile, every single sales channel, every marketing plan. And we'll continue to package mobile with broadband in unique ways going forward. Let me start as Dave, let me start with broadband. As I said, there is some limited visibility on what we've seen and obviously an acceleration of activity earlier in the year, that was more like '20 and the first part of '21, but primarily really -- on the connect side. And I think I walked through some of the drivers behind that. But again, pointing towards the whole year gives perspective on Q4 around the 2019 levels.  Still, I think the key is the overall turn levels just being where they are at and I've talked about that. Your point, our approach is to consistently focus on value. And whether it's fiber or not, our goal is constantly innovating, position the greatest network, I think, for today and tomorrow.  And we're constantly adding speeds. We've improved coverage, great devices, the gateways, the pods, control improvements that we've had, streaming with the Flex, now XClass, and Mobile. We're surrounding broadband with products. It eases some of the pressure around pricing when you can package with so many alternatives. The other thing that we do is we provide multiple tiers of broadband and we've market -- we break down the broadband marketplace into segments.  So, we have a lot of choice out there. And so, it is we go and we consult with the prospects upfront and customers all the time, what's best for them, and we put them in packages that work. And that gives an opportunity to drive ARPU when you do it that way. So, overall, the fundamentals, again, I've talked about in -- you look at the long-term runway of broadband and the consistency of how we performed. To me, that's -- I think points towards the future. So, Brian."

Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Miss Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone. Joining me on this morning\u2019s call are Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh, Dave Watson, Jeff Shell and Dana Strong. Brian and Mike will make formal remarks, while Dave, Jeff and Dana will also be available for Q&A.

With that, let me turn the call over to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?  \nBrian Roberts:   Thanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m really excited to report the strong second quarter results, which were highlighted by exceptional performance at cable, delivering 11% revenue growth and a nearly 15% increase in adjusted EBITDA. This was fueled by our fantastic success in broadband.   We added 354,000 broadband customers, an increase compared to both the same period last year and to 2019. And that drove 294,000 total customer relationship additions. These were the best broadband and customer relationship results we\u2019ve had for any second quarter on record.   Our broadband connect activity is healthy, and churn improved for the 14th quarter in a row. In fact, we hit the lowest second quarter churn rate in our company\u2019s history. Based on our first half results, combined with the strength we\u2019re seeing in current trends, we now expect total broadband net additions for 2021 to increase mid-teens relative to 2019.   We also added 280,000 wireless subscriber lines, the highest of any quarter since launch. And Xfinity Mobile is now a standalone profitable business. We got here on time, if not a bit earlier than expected, and we are experiencing the fastest sales momentum we\u2019ve ever had, a testament to the changes we implemented in the back half of last year when we reprioritized wireless across our sales channels and integrated this business more fully into our core operations. And this past April, we introduced a fabulous unlimited family plan, which we just started offering to our small business customers as well.   So I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with Dave Watson and the team he has assembled as they have a relentless focus on connectivity, which has never been more important. They truly put the customer first, offering innovative and differentiated products and services, and pretty unique to the market. We now offer 1.2 gigs of downstream to essentially all 60 million homes and businesses in our footprint.   The foundation of our success is our network, which we constantly evolve, so that we can easily handle capacity growth, increase in subscribers, and the changing usage patterns of our customers who continue to take faster speeds.   Currently, there are typically 25 connected devices in the home, with eight active at any one time. And this increases every year that drives in-home Wi-Fi usage to 15 times that of wireless, delivering huge amount of data at consistent speeds and reducing latency is what\u2019s powering our growth. And we\u2019re doing this in a cost-efficient way.   Virtualizing our network, combined with our suite of digital tools, also allows us to continue to improve the customer experience, while identifying additional cost savings. And the progress we\u2019ve made is evident in our results.   During the second quarter, total agent calls decreased by 10% and total interactions were down by 7%. We also saw a 22% reduction in truck rolls despite an over 5% increase in our customer base.   So as I look ahead, I think about our philosophy since the early days of broadband, which has been to bet on a never-ending cycle of new technologies, devices and applications that come from Silicon Valley and new startups everywhere that need to take advantage of greater speeds and capacity over time. We see this transformation happening every day and continue to believe that this is ongoing for the foreseeable future.   So what\u2019s that mean for our network? Well, since October of 2020, we\u2019ve been trialing gig and multi-gig symmetrical speeds over our DOCSIS infrastructure to great success. With upstream comprising today less than 10% of total broadband usage, even during a peak, we don\u2019t really have a consumer use case for this technology capability yet, but the strategy for our network is to plan ahead.   We\u2019re investing in architecture that lets us go beyond where consumers are and we can do all of this in a way that won\u2019t affect the capital intensity ratios we currently enjoy. Dave can provide more detail about the technological decisions we\u2019re making during the Q&A.   With Cable comprising roughly 70% of our consolidated EBITDA, broadband is a top strategic priority. I could not be more pleased with the strength of this quarter and the first half of 2021.   Looking at other parts of our business. For the first time since the pandemic, our Theme Parks returned nicely to profitability. This was led by Orlando, where we\u2019ve seen strong domestic demand in both per cap spending and in attendance, which returned to 2019 levels somewhat faster than I thought might happen, despite virtually no international visitation. And in Hollywood, since restrictions have been lifted, attendance is growing week after week.   We continue to see firsthand pent-up demand for high-quality entertainment and family fun outside of the home. And we remain incredibly bullish on our Theme Parks.   Our Studios business is also coming back. We\u2019ve returned to pre-pandemic television production levels, and we\u2019re really optimistic about our upcoming films, especially after the success of Fast 9, which debuted at number one in all territories at launch, and with $600 million of worldwide box office to date remains the biggest U.S. film launch since the pandemic began.   Following Fast, we successfully released Boss Baby 2 and a latest installment of Purge. And over the July 4th weekend, we had the top three films at the domestic box office, the first time that\u2019s happened for any studios since 1995. We have a great slate ahead with Dear Evan Hansen in September, followed by a new Halloween in October; and we end the year with Sing 2.   Next, let\u2019s talk about our media and production strategy, which across the entire company, is aligned around one purpose, create premium programming, which we can then scale and monetize for the very best global distribution outlets. Peacock adds to what we already offer. It\u2019s a great complement to our linear brands, which are successful in their own right.   And together, these platforms provide a continuous loop of content and promotion that seamlessly drive viewership across our ecosystem, offering a different access point to attract new audiences while giving existing viewers more of what they love. We are clearly capitalizing on the strength of our media brands, having just completed the strongest advertising upfront in our history, securing double-digit increases in both volume and price across our entire portfolio.   And I\u2019m pleased to report that as of this week, Peacock has 54 million signups and over 20 million monthly active accounts. This is 50% higher than our last report, driven by a number of factors: the day and date release of Boss Baby 2; debut of Dr. Death, our most successful original to date; and the airing of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.   The third quarter thus far has been a particularly strong period. And we will work hard to manage retention and grow from here, recognizing we are unlikely to replicate such tremendous performance. But we remain optimistic with a lot of programming strength ahead of us, such as more premium originals, Sunday Night Football, the Beijing Olympics, and our reimagined dynamic pay one window, which starting in 2022 shifts our film titles to Peacock exclusively for the first and last four months segments in the pay window with Amazon Prime and Netflix sharing rights for the 10 months in between.   By showcasing content across multiple platforms, Universal films will constantly refresh across the streaming ecosystem, audiences will have multiple access points with which to consume our content. And we will generate more third party revenue while retaining the most valuable window for Peacock. So as you can see, we\u2019ve successfully been able to pivot coming up with creative ways to keep up with consumer demand and in many cases, making even more money than we did before. At Sky, we are pleased revenue is back to pre-COVID levels despite the lingering impact that COVID continues to have on our pubs and clubs segment. Sky\u2019s results were led by the UK with revenue and EBITDA ahead of 2019. And we\u2019re seeing momentum across a number of areas. Premium TV churn is at record low levels.   And screaming we posted ARPU growth of over 20% for the fourth consecutive quarter. And in broadband where we just introduced our 500 -- offering. We experienced improved churn relative to both 2020 and 2019 despite a 6% price increase in the quarter. In addition, Sky mobile had the strongest second quarter activations on record, with churn averaging 40% better than industry average. And today we\u2019re announcing the debut of our international streaming strategy for Peacock. Later this year, we will leverage Sky\u2019s significant scale and powerful brand to include Peacock at no additional cost for its 20 million customers across Europe. The benefits of this launch are tremendous. We will unlock incremental advertising revenue, introduced the Peacock brand and content catalog via Sky to established platforms in key European markets and directly monetize our programming investments.   A decision to make Peacock the anchor tenant on Xfinity X1 and Flex platforms for its domestic launch has been a key driver of brand awareness, scale, consumption and promotion. And we see a similar opportunity with Sky. We\u2019re utilizing all the wonderful assets of our company to create value for audiences everywhere. And we look forward to finalizing agreements with other programming and distribution partners outside of our Sky markets. So summing up, this was a fabulous quarter and a great first half of the year. I\u2019m so pleased we are now in a position to buy back stock which we will report on in Mike\u2019s section. This is a truly very special company. And I\u2019m excited for the road ahead. Mike, over to you.  \nMike Cavanagh:   Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll begin on slide 4 with our second quarter consolidated 2021 results, revenue increased to 20% to $28.5 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 13% to $8.9 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 22% to $0.84 per share. And finally, we generated $4.8 billion of free cash flow.   Now let\u2019s turn to our business segment results starting with Cable Communications on slide 5, Cable revenue increased 11% to $16 billion, EBITDA increased nearly 15% to $7.1 billion and net cash flow grew close to 15% to $5 billion. As a reminder, last year second quarter was most significantly impacted by COVID-19, including adjustments accrued for customer RSN fees. Excluding the impact of these RSN adjustments, Cable Communications\u2019 revenue increased 9.3% with no corresponding impact to EBITDA. We added 294,000 net new customer relationships, up 35% over last year, second quarter and up 93% over the second quarter of 2019. This was the best second quarter on record and was driven by broadband where we added 354,000 net new residential and business customers, up 10% over last year second quarter, and 69% above the second quarter of 2019.   These strong results were driven by improved churn and healthy connects relative to both 2020 and 2019. And this was the lowest second quarter broadband churn on record. Looking ahead, as Brian mentioned earlier, based on our strong results through the first half of the year, as well as current trends, we now expect total broadband net additions for 2021 to be up mid-teens from the 1.4 million net adds in 2019. Broadband revenue increased 14% and grew 13% excluding the RSN fee adjustments in last year second quarter. These results were driven by strong growth in volume and rate. Wireless revenue grew 70% due to an increase in both customer lines and higher device sales. We added 280,000 net new lines in the quarter. The best result since launching this business in 2017, bringing us to 3.4 million total lines as of quarter end. We are encouraged by the initial results on our new unlimited plan, which is driving a notable increase in unlimited connects as well as a lift in overall volume.   Turning to Video, revenue increased 2.6% or 0.5% excluding RSN fee adjustments in last year second quarter, reflecting healthy growth in rates mostly offset by net video subscriber losses totaling 399,000. While our residential rate adjustment at the beginning of the year was the primary driver of the increase in rates, we believe it was also a contributor to the video subscriber loss in the quarter. Business Services revenue increased 10% primarily driven by higher rates due to comparison to last year when Business Services were significantly impacted by COVID-19. Over the past year, we have bounced back, rates have recovered and customer growth is strong, as we added 17,000 net new customers in the quarter and 70,000 over the past year, primarily driven by continued improvement in small business.   Last, advertising revenue increased 59%, reflecting an overall market recovery compared to last year, when we experienced reduced spending from advertisers due to COVID-19. As we move to the second half of the year, we will have difficult comparisons to last year when we\u2019ve benefited from strong political advertising. Turning to expenses, Cable Communications second quarter expenses increased 8.2%, programming expenses increased 12% and were up 5%, excluding the impact of RSN adjustments last year, primarily due to the number of contract renewals that started to cycle through in 2020 combined with annual escalators in existing agreements. Looking to the third quarter, we expect programming expense growth to increase that high single digit levels due to the continued impact of contract renewals, as well as the comparison to last year\u2019s third quarter, which was also favorably impacted by RSN fee adjustments.   For the full year, we continue to expect programming expense to increase at high single digit levels. Non-programming expenses increased 5.7%, or 0.5% on a per relationship basis due to higher technical and product support, and advertising, marketing and promotion spend the drive growth in our core broadband in wireless businesses. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower bad debt expense. These trends should continue in the third quarter. Cable Communications\u2019 EBITDA grew nearly 15% to $7.1 billion, including a contribution of $68 million from our wireless business, the best results since launch. Cable EBITDA margins reached 44.2% reflecting 140 basis points of year-over-year improvement. While the RSN fee adjustments had no impact on EBITDA, they did impact margins last year. Moving the RSN adjustment impact margins expanded 200 basis points year-over-year. Cable capital expenditures increased 17% resulting in CapEx intensity of 10.6%, up 50 basis points compared to last year. These results were driven by an increase in scalable infrastructure as we continue to enhance the capacity of our network, as well as increases in broadband related CPE and line extensions.   As Brian mentioned, we have decided to move a bit faster to the next phase of DOCSIS using very cost effective technology, allowing us to maintain the CapEx intensity level we achieve in 2020, which was the lowest in our history, and we expect to be at this level for the next few years.   Now let\u2019s turn to slide 6 for NBCUniversal. Let\u2019s start with total NBCUniversal results. Revenue increased 39% to $8 billion, and EBITDA increased 13%, $1.6 billion. Media revenue increased 26% driven by higher advertising, distribution and other revenue. Advertising revenue increased 33% reflecting the timing of sports, and overall market recovery compared to last year, and the launch of Peacock. We had significantly more sporting events compared to last year when sports were paused, which benefited our advertising revenue. Excluding this benefit advertising grew at mid-teens levels. Distribution revenue increased 19% or high single digits excluding the RSN fee adjustments that impacted last year\u2019s results. This growth reflects higher rates post the successful completion of several carriage renewals at the end of 2020, partially offset by subscriber declines, which were sequentially flat. Media EBITDA declined 16%, $1.4 billion, including Peacock, which generates revenue of $122 million and an EBITDA loss of $363 million. Excluding Peacock, Media EBITDA was essentially flat, driven by higher sports costs associated with the increase in sporting events this quarter compared to both last year and 2019.   As a reminder, our third quarter Media results will be impacted by our broadcast of the Summer Olympics. Studios revenue increased 8.4% driven by higher theatrical revenue, reflecting the success of Fast 9 in theaters. And compared to last year when theaters were mainly closed due to COVID-19 Studios EBITDA decreased to 52% to $156 million as a result of higher expenses associated with our theatrical release compared to last year when releases were paused the timing of content licensing sales and the comparison to last year, which included transactions with Peacock related to our initial launch of the service. In the second half, EBITDA comparisons to last year will remain challenging as we continue to launch new theatrical releases and ramp our TV production.   Theme Parks revenue increased by $958 million, $1.1 billion and generated EBITDA of $221 million, which included about $150 million of Universal Beijing preopening costs. This is the first profitable quarter we\u2019ve had since the pandemic began in the first quarter of 2020 and was driven by strong results at our Universal Orlando Resort. Orlando has had exceptionally strong demand, with June attendance exceeding 2019 levels, as well as strong per cap growth. Despite virtually no international guests during the quarter due to COVID related travel constraints. We opened our Jurassic World themed roller coaster, VelociCoaster on June 10, to some of the highest guest satisfaction scores we\u2019ve had. Hollywood has been operating without capacity restrictions since mid-June and has experienced strong demand, aided by the opening of our Secret Life of Pets attraction in April.   We\u2019re optimistic that our domestic parks are on a path to return to historic levels of profitability. But we need international visitation to resume which remains dependent on COVID related travel restrictions being lifted. At our Japan Park, results continue to be challenging after closing in late April, we reopened on June 1 with capacity restrictions that are likely to remain in place through the summer. Last, as we prepare to open our newest Park Universal Beijing, we expect overall results will be negatively impacted by up to $250 million in the third quarter.   Now let\u2019s turn to slide 7 for Sky, which I\u2019ll speak to on a constant currency basis. For the second quarter, Sky revenue increased 15% to $5.2 billion, largely reflecting strong growth in our UK business. Direct-to-consumer revenue increased 7.7%, primarily reflecting higher average revenue per customer relationship. Results in the UK drove the bulk of the growth and benefited from the comparison to last year when sports subscriptions were paused, as well as a rate increase, higher mobile device sales, improving hospitality revenue as pubs and clubs reopen. While customer relationships grew in the UK, overall customer relationships declined 248,000 primarily driven by customer losses in Italy and Germany to the end of the football season. As we have previously said, we\u2019ve reset our football rights in Germany and Italy. As a result, we anticipate lower programming and production expense, along with continued customer losses in the third and fourth quarters. We believe this disciplined approach to sports related costs is the right long-term financial decision for the business.   Advertising revenue increased 79% with results in the UK driving the growth and reflecting the overall market recovery from COVID-19, as well as an increase in a number of sporting events compared to last year when sports were paused. Sky generated $560 million in EBITDA, a 32% decline compared to last year second quarter, primarily reflecting higher sports rights amortization related to more events in the current quarter. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower entertainment costs due to production delays. I\u2019ll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on slide 9.   Free cash flow was $4.8 billion in the quarter, a decrease of 20% year-over-year, largely due to the timing of last year\u2019s federal tax payments, which were deferred to the third quarter. While networking capital was a positive contribution to free cash flow in the quarter, we continue to expect it will be a negative drag on our full year results and higher compared to 2019 levels due to an increase in content investments and our broadcast of the Olympics. Consolidated total capital, which includes capital expenditures, as well as software and intangibles, increased 5.2% in second quarter to $2.8 billion reflecting an increase in cable, which was partially offset by the decline at NBCU.   For the full year, we now expect capital to be slightly above 2020 levels, reflecting our plan, as I previously mentioned, to accelerate enhancements to our network. In the second quarter, a return of capital to shareholders included dividend payments totaling $1.2 billion, up 9.5% year-over-year. We also resumed our share repurchase activity late in the second quarter, totaling $500 million as of June 30. As previously communicated, we intend to stay at historical buyback levels until we reach our intended target leverage levels, which we currently expect to reach sometime in 2022. With our return to share repurchase in the quarter, we\u2019re happy to get back to our long standing balanced approach to capital allocation, which consists of maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing organically for profitable growth, and returning capital to shareholders.   Thanks for joining us on the call this morning. I\u2019ll turn it back to Marci, who will lead the question- and-answer portion of the call.  \nMarci Ryvicker:   Thanks, Mike. Operator, let\u2019s open the call for questions.  \nOperator:   Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse.  \nQ - Doug Mitchelson:   Oh, thanks so much. A couple of operating questions for me this quarter. Jeff, any discussion of the shape of parks profitability going forward? You\u2019ve got Beijing shifting from pre-operating losses to opening the U.S. is more fully opening, Japan at some point will more fully opening. How do we think, I know, you gave the 3Q sort of one-time item for Beijing? As we get to 4Q, are the Beijing losses done? Is it an easy comp next year? How should we think about profitability overall?   Dave, can you unpack the margin expansion for us? In the quarter, it looks like advertising and wireless probably drove all the margin expansion. I think about the last few years, you\u2019ve got a lot of margin expansion from leveraging non-programming costs. Was there just unusual year-over-year comps within the Cable business relative to 2Q of last year that expires over the next couple of quarters, and you get back to sort of normal margin expansion on non-programming line? Or is there other investments you\u2019re making that we should consider? Thanks so much.  \nA - Jeff Shell:   So I take the first one. Yes. So hey, Doug, how are you? So on the parks, we are very \u2013 first of all, I would start by saying we\u2019re very pleased with not just the quarter, but the trajectory of our opening. As Mike went through, Orlando is on attendance standpoint, pretty close to back where we were in 2019, even though we don\u2019t have any international visitors, and you would expect those international visitors to pick up over time in Hollywood. We\u2019ve only been open a of couple months and we\u2019re already approaching our capacity and we\u2019re excited about the next couple of months and Halloween Horror Nights. So the domestic parks, obviously, with COVID, you just don\u2019t know. It\u2019s \u2013 things could be lumpy, things could be non-linear. But so far, the trajectory is really good and we expect that to continue.   And I would say the thing we\u2019re most pleased with is the protocols of work. And we\u2019ve been able to keep people safe and keep our workers safe and keep our guests safe. And that I think is driving the confidence in coming to our parks.   Internationally, Brian actually \u2013 and I actually were in Japan. And even though that country is a little bit behind as far as COVID, we\u2019ve been able to get our park back open, we\u2019re open again, with some capacity constraints. We have a great attraction there that we were able to see Nintendo, which is one of our best attractions that we\u2019ve ever built anywhere on the world to rivals Harry Potter. And I\u2019m very excited for that not only in Japan, but for Epic Universe down the road and our other parks eventually.   So Japan is behind, but feels like it\u2019s heading in the right direction. And so that\u2019s going to be great. And then lastly, with Beijing, we\u2019re ready to go in Beijing. The park is ready. It\u2019s awesome. It\u2019s our most technologically advanced park. And we expect \u2013 right now, what we\u2019re doing is going through the final approvals of rides and the process you have to go through and that is somewhat indeterminate. But we expect that park to open in the next couple of months.   And when it does open, as you mentioned, those pre-operating costs go away and we start getting attendance. And so Beijing should be a good contributor to us remainder of the year when it opens and then on to next year. So overall, our parks are on a good trajectory and it\u2019s hard to see what happens with COVID, but we\u2019re pretty pleased. Dave?  \nA - David Watson:   Yes. Hi Doug. So, quick walk through a couple of things on margin in the quarter and looking forward. It\u2019s \u2013 we feel very good about our position on the progress that we continue to make on margin improvement, real focus around the fundamentals.   And so while there\u2019ll be some things within a quarter that move a little bit, if the fundamentals are the things that we stay extremely focused on. And starts with broadband, and both residential and commercial, now both are just drive higher revenue, both the margin accretive, and just help us deploy digital solutions, in particular, and residential, at a higher rate.   So those fundamentals are \u2013 continue to bring us to where we\u2019re at. As we scale mobile, as you said, there are improvements there, advertising as well, with advanced advertising provides support. But it\u2019s primarily the focus around connectivity and just driving more customer relationships there in that space, connected with the digital customer experience improvements, is such a win-win for the customer and for us. Just to provide perspective in the quarter, our total agent calls decreased by 10%, with total interactions lowered at 7% and we saw a 22% reduction in truck rolls. And this is despite an overall 5% increase in the customer base. So if you go back over time, this is just a continuation. Over the past five years, we\u2019ve constantly made progress, taken 37% or almost 100 million calls out of the run rate and reduced truck rolls by 25%.   So, Doug, it\u2019s been -- this is a real focus for us. And while I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll grow the second half of the year margins at the same rate that we did the first half, we\u2019re in a really good place, and we\u2019re doing it in a healthy and sustainable way. And so I like the roadmap that we have around digital tools and the experience, I like the run rate around connectivity. And while we\u2019ll invest in areas like business services, in mobile, sales and marketing, things that are just going to help us grow, we\u2019re going to continue to stay extremely focused on margin.  \nQ - Doug Mitchelson:   Thanks.  \nA - Mike Cavanagh:   This is Mike, and I\u2019d just echo that point that in these \u2013 in this great first half margin expansion, which as Dave said, will ease a little bit in the second half of the year. There\u2019s tremendous investment behind wireless, behind advancing growth in broadband and business services. So it\u2019s really healthy margin expansion because we\u2019re putting the money back into drive future growth.  \nQ - Doug Mitchelson:   Thanks so much.  \nA - Marci Ryvicker:   Thanks, Doug. Operator, next question, please.  \nOperator:   Your next question will come from the line of Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.  \nQ - Benjamin Swinburne:   Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask, actually, also about cable. And then I have a question for Brian sort of on M&A and strategic stuff. Mike and Dave, we\u2019re all trying to figure out what normal looks like as we hopefully emerge from the pandemic. And, Mike, you\u2019ve talked about bad debt being down and I think like it continues to be a tailwind year-on-year. Do you have a sense of what sort of normal looks like as you think about OpEx? I mean, you guys just sounded quite bullish on margins going forward. But there is some concern that as activity normalizes at some costs, come back in the business and I wonder if you could just tackle that.   And the same thing for you, Dave. I mean, churn, it sounds like it keeps coming down. Do we go back to normal churn from pre-COVID or not? I don\u2019t know if you have any sense of that when you look at different geographies and your footprint, if you can glean anything there?   And then, Brian, I\u2019m sure you know there has been lots of press articles on Comcast buying lots of different businesses. And I\u2019m wondering, now that you\u2019ve laid out at least some of your Peacock international strategy, all these articles seem to assume that you don\u2019t have enough scale in NBC to achieve your strategic goals around streaming. And I know you can\u2019t talk about M&A. But I wonder if you could just talk about whether you believe NBC has what it needs to do what the company wants it to do on the streaming front, globally. Thanks, everybody.  \nA - Mike Cavanagh:   So maybe I\u2019ll start Ben, and thanks for the question. I\u2019ll -- I think on non-program expenses OpEx, we still expect low single digit increases compared to 2019 for full year \u201821 here. So that\u2019s all the factors are embedded in there that Dave mentioned. And you\u2019re right; bad debt continues to run low. I think given a feel for what the second half looks like, is the best I\u2019ll do at this stage. I think we are continue to do all of the things in the underlying business, move the business towards more digital, sort of cleaner operations that are low cost, the move to the higher margin, products and broadband Business Services, other things Dave described, are things we\u2019ll work on that will benefit us regardless, I think of what the operating environment normalizes that, but I think that\u2019s the best sense for the second half of the year. And I\u2019ll let David, comment on churn, but it\u2019s a little bit of the same message, which is, we\u2019ll see what normal looks like, but I think, investments in products, investment in network investments in Flex, wireless, you name it, all the things are we\u2019re doing, I think our -- there is at least some element of sustained benefits to churn versus historical levels, at least in my mind. But we\u2019ll see, Dave, over to you.  \nA - David Watson:   Thanks Mike. Hello, Ben. Yes, we expect over time to have a little bit more normalization, as you go into quarters, like Q2 like Q3, with student activity, move activity, seasonality, that could impact the churn, but we\u2019re reaching a level that we expected in terms of overall broadband churn performance. And this is -- it\u2019s the redefinition of great broadband, I think that\u2019s helping deliver this, some of this churn improvement, we have a fantastic network. Yes, we\u2019ve talked about it, Brian might mention it, continuing to invest them in the network, we\u2019re going to stay ahead of the curve in terms of capacity, and usage.   So a lot of focus around the network. And then to compliment, not just speed, but our devices of the pods, the ability of varied great Wi Fi coverage inside the home is just so critical. And staying ahead of that curve is key and adding value extensions to broadband, like mobile, like Flex, that impact churn. And so these are early days, for us in terms of as we, both of those categories are exciting for us. But they\u2019re impacting broadband in a positive way. So can\u2019t give specific guidance in terms of where churn would go, but the fundamentals of and the focus around attracting healthy and keeping healthy customer relationships and connectivity is a key. So very excited about the prospects of mobile and Flex impacting that over time.  \nA - Brian Roberts:\n : And Ben, this is Brian, let me start by saying, I really love the company we\u2019ve got, I can\u2019t imagine really a better quarter, it\u2019s an exceptional quarter. And I believe we have lots of more, lots more organic growth ahead. And we have a very special unique company across distribution and content working so well together. And you start with the Peacock and Sky, and Peacock, and Xfinity and even in our Olympics advertising, we\u2019d like and we are investing behind the businesses. So I don\u2019t think, and I think Mike Cavanagh has been very blunt that we don\u2019t need M&A. We have a majority broadband centric company. And we like to mix. So what might that drive us to consider at least which any kind of partnership is where we have unique special capabilities that could lead in globally or internationally to enhancing our streaming position.   That\u2019s something you might talk to others and consider but as to your scale question. I really think it would -- we have all the parts. And Jeff, why don\u2019t you comment on that in just a second and maybe with some more specifics, but if you looks at the results of Peacock this quarter. Again, we probably were the fastest growing streaming service 50% in 90 days. We have a brand it\u2019s only a year old and it\u2019s either number one or number two new brands in America. It\u2019s been created. So I really think our corporate focus is as we\u2019ve said many times was to get back in balance on capital returns. And probably most pleased this quarter that we were able to get to that place. Buyback stock as Mike just talked about. So I do think we have the scale. I think we have an amazing company. And I feel fortunate with our position, Jeff, why don\u2019t you talk a little more about the scale?  \nA - Jeff Shell:   Yes. Thanks, Brian. Hi, Ben, when you talk about scale, with respect to streaming, and Peacock just to get more granular for a second, there really are, no, there really are three elements of the scale. One is the scale of the platform technologically. And as Brian just mentioned, we launched on the back of the Sky platform, and we\u2019ve leveraged our Xfinity and Dave\u2019s team significantly. So I think we have proved that we would have never launched the success technologically with a platform that looks great and works without the scale that we have already at the company. There\u2019s scale with respect to the brand. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m thrilled with today\u2019s announcement that Peacock is going to be in 20 million Sky homes, and eventually we\u2019ll roll it out across the globe.   And then the most important by far element of scales for streaming is content. And we are really at the beginning of our content rollout on Peacock that\u2019s why this quarter\u2019s growth is really extraordinary. Because this quarter as Brian went through we had a pretty good movie with Boss Baby 2, we had our first real good drama with Doctor Death. And we had and we have obviously rolled into the Olympics here. We\u2019re halfway through the first week of the Olympics. Looking forward, we as part of our plan, we have another Olympics, we have lots of original programming, which Mike mentioned, we\u2019re ramping up production right now on and we\u2019ll be rolling out over the next year, Brian mentioned our movies, we have the -- what I think is one of the top studios in Hollywood, and we have lots of movies coming directly to Peacock and eventually we\u2019re going to have, the Hulu content coming back.   So we have plenty of content coming in this quarter showed that when you put that content on a service, that\u2019s good, you can actually get pretty good growth in the streaming world. And so personally, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever lacked for the capital to do what we need to do to and grow our business. And what I\u2019ll end with is the perfect example that happened in last week, was we at Universal acquired the rights to the next three Exorcist movies. In a pretty unique deal that was done in tandem with Peacock, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to do it if we didn\u2019t have a streaming service that\u2019s where we basically got the rights on the backs of the strength of our studio, where we have Jason Blum and pedigree that\u2019s unmatched and Donna Langley and her team\u2019s ability to market movies. But because we did it with Peacock, we have full optionality going forward, we put the second and third movies direct on Peacock, do we do something hybrid, we can really kind of adapt and be flexible based on how the market works. So we have this scale across our company to do things like that. And I don\u2019t think we\u2019re lacking for scale. Personally, I think we can achieve our success in Peacock, without anything additional. And I think this quarter approved it.  \nOperator:   Your next question will come from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America.  \nQ - Jessica Ehrlich:   Thanks. I have two questions are directed to two people. Brian, first. And this is such a different color than a year ago, you\u2019ve come out of the pandemic in a stronger position than you were even going in at really all of the businesses Cable, NBCU and Sky in every aspect, whether its share gains, margin growth and developing businesses, et cetera. So, sitting here today, what do you think the biggest ongoing benefits will be from all the changes that have been implemented? And then what are your key longer term goals from here? You\u2019ve talked about the near term goals.   And then Jeff, I don\u2019t even know where to start, because there\u2019s so much going on at NBCU. But can you give us a little more color on the upfront and the cross platform benefits? And maybe to drill down a little bit into Peacock, what should we be expecting the next year or so in terms of incremental costs for the international rollout as well as increased content? And then finally, you said in the past that you expect this Olympics to be the most profitable, but you\u2019ve been hit with a little bit of deadlock? I mean, in terms of COVID getting a little bit worse and stuff going on with the athletes. Do you still have that view? Like how do you think about this Olympics and the next one in terms of profitability?  \nA - Brian Roberts:   For the observations because I would -- I share your view. It\u2019s been an extraordinary year. I\u2019m really proud of the company. First of all, on some of our initiatives, our commitment, a $1 billion over 10 years to close the digital divide and have broadband, the accessible and affordable for many more people. And so I guess I\u2019d start by saying the momentum. It\u2019s on us to keep this fabulous execution. Dave talked a lot about that focus. I think what kind of gets lost perhaps a little bit in broadband is not just the consumer broadband, which literally record second quarter. Now saying again, that this year, we expect mid-teens growth from 2019. I did not expect that six months ago. So how do we keep that momentum and build on it that comes down to great products and the network. And a team and a management team, we\u2019ve made a lot of changes. We\u2019ve had some retirements and other things, and the backfilling and moving executive promoting executives, all of that has put our team in an excellent place; we\u2019ve learned how to work in a hybrid manner.   And whatever comes next, I don\u2019t think this team will miss a beat. And so I thank them for their focus. But as I think about broadband, we really don\u2019t talk about business services enough to have a $9 billion business from zero built, literally, with zero market shares and growing only one direction. And keep expanding the definition of that market from small to medium to now really enterprise, every couple of weeks, I get an email that talks about some major accounts that we\u2019ve just won for the first time, and it could lead to way more volume over time. So a Bill Stamper who runs -- has run that business really since inception, and he has done an exceptional job. And we\u2019re trying to do that now at Sky and expand that market. And then we\u2019ve talked a little bit about wireless and mobile. And we\u2019ve really pivoted to being a strategic opportunity with fantastic customer satisfaction ratings a great relationship with Verizon that enables us now to compete and compete well, and to innovate, and so on and on. I think keeping our focus there.   So in the longer term, I think we have an opportunity, see the vital trend of direct-to-consumer, digitization, computing power, evolving our -- the way we live, how relevant will our company remain and be and help lead that change. And I look at the tech company results. And you just see this trend accelerating. So what are some of the takeaways? Well, first of all, being an enabler, a critical opportunity to innovate our network, to help be as relevant in the future as we are today is stop one, I think digital advertising, we saw some of the results from the tech companies, we look at our own, creating more inventory. So the strategy for Peacock, for me feels really smart, we\u2019re creating more digital inventory. That\u2019s the holy grail of ads. That\u2019s why we\u2019re able to get a premium. And, Jeff can talk about Olympics a bit. But in the big picture, we\u2019re in it, we\u2019re reimagining how people consume, and that consumption is enabled by broadband, and now enabled by Peacock and hope to do that in a more significant way. And then retaining talent, and being a company where people want to work at all levels of the company, and that\u2019s being re reimagined in our society. And we read about it every day, how people have more choices and want more balance in their life. figuring that out, we have a talented team that is leading us and that I\u2019m really want to thank here and at this quarter, and this first half of the year and coming through the pandemic it feels, like, hopefully, there\u2019s an opportunity to be a real light even if we have a few more moments. This company is well positioned. And I just really feel that way. So thanks for giving us a chance to ask that question. Over to you Jeff.  \nA - Jeff Shell:   Hey, Jessica. Thanks Brian. So on the upfront, let me take kind of in order, Jessica, how you ask the question. So on the upfront; I think we\u2019ve been I think we\u2019ve talked about that in the past. It\u2019s -- as Brian just mentioned, the strength of our platform, combined with Linda\u2019s, and Linda Yaccarino and her team\u2019s approach. One platform approach was the perfect way to approach this red hot upfront and as Brian said, and Mike said double digit increases in both volume and pricing. And we\u2019ll see those results in the years ahead and particularly happy with both the volume on Peacock and the CPM on Peacock. So that could not have been more pleased with how we did the upfront.   As far as peacock, I should mention that one of the things I didn\u2019t talk about is we concluded our Amazon and Samsung deals this quarter too, there is a lot going on at NBC, we\u2019re now fully distributed, for Peacock. And that\u2019s going to have benefits as we roll out our additional content. I would say that we look at where we are today and being much further ahead than we expected to be at this point, we\u2019ll probably ramp up our investment modestly over what we\u2019ve done in the past. But as I mentioned, we have so much content coming to Peacock that it doesn\u2019t have to be significant. I will stay with Peacock and say little bit about Olympics, we were learning a lot as consumption happens on the Olympics here at day six, and not to ruin everybody tuning in, but we have big upset that just happened in the last hour. And should watch tonight on NBC to see that but exciting US team.   And we\u2019re not -- we\u2019ve had some bad luck. But if you look at the product, it\u2019s fantastic. And it really is impossible. And so what I would say is on Peacock, what we will learn in this Olympics we will take to Beijing and change the product change the offering and each Olympics on our board. And we\u2019re really excited about that. It\u2019s impossible to understate the importance of the Olympics to NBCUniversal, it\u2019s not really financially it\u2019s more operationally across the company; we have 4,000 people literally working on it. Brian and I were in Tokyo, I came back and saw our team in Connecticut, people this is their life work, you go from room to room, and you have experts on surfing and volleyball and gymnastics. And it is an operation that would be very difficult to replicate the talent and the experience that our team brings to it. And they show it every night at NBC. And then of course, the Olympics are the perfect property to show the strength of our platform across not only NBCUniversal but Comcast and Xfinity and Sky. So the Olympics obviously, as you said, Jessica, we had a little bit of bad luck, there was a drumbeat of negativity, we got moved a year and those spectators. And that has resulted a little bit in linear ratings being probably less than we expected. But the flip side of that is the digital strength is kind of offset that. So we look at what\u2019s happening with Peacock that\u2019s directly related to the Olympics. So net-net, with all this bad luck, we\u2019re going to be profitable on the Olympics, which we\u2019re very happy with. And we\u2019re very happy with the product. And then if you watch every night, you\u2019ll see we use this as a fire hose to promote everything else we\u2019re doing at the company, not just across NBCUniversal, but also Comcast. So the Olympics, I think we\u2019re very pleased with the Olympics and very proud of our team and got a ways to go here.  \nOperator:   Your next question comes from the line of Peter Supino with Bernstein.  \nQ - Peter Supino:   Hi, thanks. I have a question about your aggregation business. With Flex is expanding app portfolio. I wonder how you could increase your momentum and aggregation in general. And whether it would make sense to send Flex boxes to all of your internet only subs and maybe even video subs that only have one video box at home, again, in order to drastically increase your scale with a good product.  \nA - David Watson:   Well, I\u2019ll jump in on now. And this is Dave. So we are very excited about Flex. You\u2019re early -- still early days, but now we have over 3.8 million Flex boxes deployed and about half of those are being actively used and engaged so and the reasons why that we\u2019re -- we continue to be excited. It is a terrific long-term platform but it is helping broadband as I mentioned earlier. So there we\u2019re generating about $2 of incremental revenue just on the pay per view, the rev share side of things and advertising opportunities will be above that. So today in terms of what we\u2019re doing within footprint, there are parts of what you mentioned, we absolutely included as part of the broadband subscription. It\u2019s a key part of now that with broadband, you get this great streaming platform. So we\u2019re doing that. We have -- if you\u2019re traditional video customer, we have devices that enable full home the X1 experience throughout so we have that but we are not bashful about letting our customers, broadband customers in particular that really important streaming segment know if this is included. Outside of footprint, we are -- we have syndication partners that we\u2019re working with Cox, the Canadian company. And we continue to explore ways of doing that. And we think that it\u2019s a terrific long-term platform to tie together uniquely, the way that we do with the voice remote thinking the full capability, we\u2019ve been investing in X1, and we can leverage that platform. So we do qualify, we ask the customer if they want it, and then we but we stay right on it, and deliver the great service and the feedback that we\u2019re getting in engagement is very strong. So it\u2019s a really important part of broadband growth today. And we\u2019ll explore outside of footprint opportunities, ways of doing even more over time.  \nOperator:   Your next question comes from the line of Philip Cusick with J.P. Morgan.  \nQ - Philip Cusick:   Hi, guys, thanks, couple of wireless. First, you\u2019re building momentum and growth in this business. Should we think of it as this is sort of a level based on essentially all stores and distribution channels open? Or are there more things you planned to do to push this harder? And then second, did you register for the next wireless option? Thanks.  \nA - David Watson:   Hey there, Phil. This is Dave. So go on sales momentum side of mobile. One of the things that\u2019s happened is we got through the first pandemic phase that we did shut down last year, retail blow things down. And what we saw the back half of last year just continued through this year as every single sales channel now we focused on. Retail is back and but in addition to that, extremely focused on our call centers, digital tools that are optimized by flows for mobile, and how we go-to-market, that has been a huge chance, just the fact that we lead with mobile is so key, and mobile and broadband being a package. So those fundamentals have emerged and really an important part of our go-to-market strategy.   We\u2019ve invested in tools not only for the customer, but for our agents, and how they sell mobile, this improving the experience for customers really key. So a lot of marketing investment around the mobile message, if you live in our footprint, and you\u2019re watching this great Olympics coverage, the Jeff and team are doing, you can\u2019t miss the fact that we are really, really focused around the mobile business. So but I think that natural combination of broadband plus mobile will continue. So the other big addition recently is clearly the unlimited packages that we\u2019ve rolled out. And that is adding to it. We\u2019ve seen a nice shift and mix that we continue to have by the gig. But adding on unlimited really closed and fills the gap that we had in our competitive portfolio, so now with great unlimited of pricing for multi line families. And you can mix and match still between buy the gig and unlimited, we\u2019re in a unique position in our footprint. So like our momentum, the 280,000 lines were just terrific. And set a record for us but we\u2019re continuing to stay focused and we see that this is a real opportunity for us going forward. So on the auction side, I think the last part --  \nA - Brian Roberts:   Mike, why don\u2019t you answer that?  \nA - Mike Cavanagh:   No comment on status for next auction. We take a look on occasion we like our spectrum portfolio, it gives us optionality for offload. So we\u2019ll -- we often take a look if the price is right, but no comment yet on where we stand with the next talk.  \nOperator:   Your final question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.  \nQ - Craig Moffett:   Yes. Hi. And question for Brian and Mike if I could, the free cash flow profile that you guys have over the next few years that you\u2019re -- just given the EBITDA today you\u2019re already running ahead of, would suggest that if you keep your leverage target at something like 2.5x like you\u2019ve talked about, you can be buying back $20 billion a year of stock just to keep your leverage constant. Can you just talk about sort of how high you\u2019re willing to go in terms of share repurchases, and I know you you\u2019ve always talked about keeping your powder dry for optionality. But it would seem like there\u2019s a lot of optionality there. And room for a pretty significant increase in cash returns to shareholders.  \nA - Mike Cavanagh:   Hey, Craig, it\u2019s Mike, I just say First things first, we\u2019re happy with the first half of the year, we\u2019re happy that we\u2019re back in balance starting to get the buyback going again. I think the way we\u2019ll look at it over time is not in terms of is there dollar number; we\u2019re going to think about it in terms of want to keep a strong balance sheet. So I think of us as wanting to be comfortably in the range of ratios, that would support the single A rating, we want to make sure we\u2019re investing behind our businesses, primarily organically, but occasionally tuck-in acquisitions, all that you see that in the normal course, all the time in our business.   And then capital return is the other leg of the stool. We\u2019ve been, this company\u2019s historically been very strong and important part of the priorities to return capital, we\u2019ve increased the dividend for 13 plus years running and one of few companies that have had a strong level of consistent dividend increase. And you look back between the time of the NBC deal and the Sky deal, the level of free cash flow that was returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends combined was incredibly strong. So I think we would continue to execute against that, the first half of the year, I guess the remainder of this year, think of us is continuing to be at the historical levels for now. We\u2019ve got a level of working capital this year that continues -- we continue to expect to be higher than it was in 2019. That\u2019s mostly going to be hitting us in the second half of this year with the Olympics and the ramping of content spend.   But the dynamics of EBITDA, growth and future prospects is as you describe, so we\u2019ll take it quarter at a time and we\u2019ll talk more probably at the end of the year.  \nEnd of Q&A:  \nMarci Ryvicker:   Thanks, Craig, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We hope you have a great rest of the summer and stay safe.  \nOperator:   There will be a replay available of today\u2019s call starting at 12 o\u2019clock PM Eastern Time.

            "content": "This is Mike, and I'd just echo that point that in these \u2013 in this great first half margin expansion, which as Dave said, will ease a little bit in the second half of the year. There's tremendous investment behind wireless, behind advancing growth in broadband and business services. So it's really healthy margin expansion because we're putting the money back into drive future growth. So maybe I'll start Ben, and thanks for the question. I'll -- I think on non-program expenses OpEx, we still expect low single digit increases compared to 2019 for full year \u201821 here. So that's all the factors are embedded in there that Dave mentioned. And you're right; bad debt continues to run low. I think given a feel for what the second half looks like, is the best I'll do at this stage. I think we are continue to do all of the things in the underlying business, move the business towards more digital, sort of cleaner operations that are low cost, the move to the higher margin, products and broadband Business Services, other things Dave described, are things we'll work on that will benefit us regardless, I think of what the operating environment normalizes that, but I think that's the best sense for the second half of the year. And I'll let David, comment on churn, but it's a little bit of the same message, which is, we'll see what normal looks like, but I think, investments in products, investment in network investments in Flex, wireless, you name it, all the things are we're doing, I think our -- there is at least some element of sustained benefits to churn versus historical levels, at least in my mind. But we'll see, Dave, over to you. No comment on status for next auction. We take a look on occasion we like our spectrum portfolio, it gives us optionality for offload. So we'll -- we often take a look if the price is right, but no comment yet on where we stand with the next talk. Hey, Craig, it's Mike, I just say First things first, we're happy with the first half of the year, we're happy that we're back in balance starting to get the buyback going again.

            "name": "A - Brian Roberts",
            "content": ":And Ben, this is Brian, let me start by saying, I really love the company we've got, I can't imagine really a better quarter, it's an exceptional quarter. And I believe we have lots of more, lots more organic growth ahead. And we have a very special unique company across distribution and content working so well together. And you start with the Peacock and Sky, and Peacock, and Xfinity and even in our Olympics advertising, we'd like and we are investing behind the businesses. So I don't think, and I think Mike Cavanagh has been very blunt that we don't need M&A. We have a majority broadband centric company. And we like to mix. So what might that drive us to consider at least which any kind of partnership is where we have unique special capabilities that could lead in globally or internationally to enhancing our streaming position.   That's something you might talk to others and consider but as to your scale question. I really think it would -- we have all the parts. And Jeff, why don't you comment on that in just a second and maybe with some more specifics, but if you looks at the results of Peacock this quarter. Again, we probably were the fastest growing streaming service 50% in 90 days. We have a brand it's only a year old and it's either number one or number two new brands in America. It's been created. So I really think our corporate focus is as we've said many times was to get back in balance on capital returns. And probably most pleased this quarter that we were able to get to that place. Buyback stock as Mike just talked about. So I do think we have the scale. I think we have an amazing company. And I feel fortunate with our position, Jeff, why don't you talk a little more about the scale? For the observations because I would -- I share your view. It's been an extraordinary year. I'm really proud of the company. First of all, on some of our initiatives, our commitment, a $1 billion over 10 years to close the digital divide and have broadband, the accessible and affordable for many more people. And so I guess I'd start by saying the momentum. It's on us to keep this fabulous execution. Dave talked a lot about that focus. I think what kind of gets lost perhaps a little bit in broadband is not just the consumer broadband, which literally record second quarter. Now saying again, that this year, we expect mid-teens growth from 2019. I did not expect that six months ago. So how do we keep that momentum and build on it that comes down to great products and the network. And a team and a management team, we've made a lot of changes. We've had some retirements and other things, and the backfilling and moving executive promoting executives, all of that has put our team in an excellent place; we've learned how to work in a hybrid manner.   And whatever comes next, I don't think this team will miss a beat. And so I thank them for their focus. But as I think about broadband, we really don't talk about business services enough to have a $9 billion business from zero built, literally, with zero market shares and growing only one direction. And keep expanding the definition of that market from small to medium to now really enterprise, every couple of weeks, I get an email that talks about some major accounts that we've just won for the first time, and it could lead to way more volume over time. So a Bill Stamper who runs -- has run that business really since inception, and he has done an exceptional job. And we're trying to do that now at Sky and expand that market. And then we've talked a little bit about wireless and mobile. And we've really pivoted to being a strategic opportunity with fantastic customer satisfaction ratings a great relationship with Verizon that enables us now to compete and compete well, and to innovate, and so on and on. I think keeping our focus there.   So in the longer term, I think we have an opportunity, see the vital trend of direct-to-consumer, digitization, computing power, evolving our -- the way we live, how relevant will our company remain and be and help lead that change. And I look at the tech company results. And you just see this trend accelerating. So what are some of the takeaways? Well, first of all, being an enabler, a critical opportunity to innovate our network, to help be as relevant in the future as we are today is stop one, I think digital advertising, we saw some of the results from the tech companies, we look at our own, creating more inventory. So the strategy for Peacock, for me feels really smart, we're creating more digital inventory. That's the holy grail of ads. That's why we're able to get a premium. And, Jeff can talk about Olympics a bit. But in the big picture, we're in it, we're reimagining how people consume, and that consumption is enabled by broadband, and now enabled by Peacock and hope to do that in a more significant way. And then retaining talent, and being a company where people want to work at all levels of the company, and that's being re reimagined in our society. And we read about it every day, how people have more choices and want more balance in their life. figuring that out, we have a talented team that is leading us and that I'm really want to thank here and at this quarter, and this first half of the year and coming through the pandemic it feels, like, hopefully, there's an opportunity to be a real light even if we have a few more moments. This company is well positioned. And I just really feel that way. So thanks for giving us a chance to ask that question. Over to you Jeff. Mike, why don't you answer that?"

            "name": "Brian Roberts",
            "content": "Thanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. I'm really excited to report the strong second quarter results, which were highlighted by exceptional performance at cable, delivering 11% revenue growth and a nearly 15% increase in adjusted EBITDA. This was fueled by our fantastic success in broadband.   We added 354,000 broadband customers, an increase compared to both the same period last year and to 2019. And that drove 294,000 total customer relationship additions. These were the best broadband and customer relationship results we've had for any second quarter on record.   Our broadband connect activity is healthy, and churn improved for the 14th quarter in a row. In fact, we hit the lowest second quarter churn rate in our company's history. Based on our first half results, combined with the strength we're seeing in current trends, we now expect total broadband net additions for 2021 to increase mid-teens relative to 2019.   We also added 280,000 wireless subscriber lines, the highest of any quarter since launch. And Xfinity Mobile is now a standalone profitable business. We got here on time, if not a bit earlier than expected, and we are experiencing the fastest sales momentum we've ever had, a testament to the changes we implemented in the back half of last year when we reprioritized wireless across our sales channels and integrated this business more fully into our core operations. And this past April, we introduced a fabulous unlimited family plan, which we just started offering to our small business customers as well.   So I couldn't be more pleased with Dave Watson and the team he has assembled as they have a relentless focus on connectivity, which has never been more important. They truly put the customer first, offering innovative and differentiated products and services, and pretty unique to the market. We now offer 1.2 gigs of downstream to essentially all 60 million homes and businesses in our footprint.   The foundation of our success is our network, which we constantly evolve, so that we can easily handle capacity growth, increase in subscribers, and the changing usage patterns of our customers who continue to take faster speeds.   Currently, there are typically 25 connected devices in the home, with eight active at any one time. And this increases every year that drives in-home Wi-Fi usage to 15 times that of wireless, delivering huge amount of data at consistent speeds and reducing latency is what's powering our growth. And we're doing this in a cost-efficient way.   Virtualizing our network, combined with our suite of digital tools, also allows us to continue to improve the customer experience, while identifying additional cost savings. And the progress we've made is evident in our results.   During the second quarter, total agent calls decreased by 10% and total interactions were down by 7%. We also saw a 22% reduction in truck rolls despite an over 5% increase in our customer base.   So as I look ahead, I think about our philosophy since the early days of broadband, which has been to bet on a never-ending cycle of new technologies, devices and applications that come from Silicon Valley and new startups everywhere that need to take advantage of greater speeds and capacity over time. We see this transformation happening every day and continue to believe that this is ongoing for the foreseeable future.   So what's that mean for our network? Well, since October of 2020, we've been trialing gig and multi-gig symmetrical speeds over our DOCSIS infrastructure to great success. With upstream comprising today less than 10% of total broadband usage, even during a peak, we don't really have a consumer use case for this technology capability yet, but the strategy for our network is to plan ahead.   We're investing in architecture that lets us go beyond where consumers are and we can do all of this in a way that won't affect the capital intensity ratios we currently enjoy. Dave can provide more detail about the technological decisions we're making during the Q&A.   With Cable comprising roughly 70% of our consolidated EBITDA, broadband is a top strategic priority. I could not be more pleased with the strength of this quarter and the first half of 2021.   Looking at other parts of our business. For the first time since the pandemic, our Theme Parks returned nicely to profitability. This was led by Orlando, where we've seen strong domestic demand in both per cap spending and in attendance, which returned to 2019 levels somewhat faster than I thought might happen, despite virtually no international visitation. And in Hollywood, since restrictions have been lifted, attendance is growing week after week.   We continue to see firsthand pent-up demand for high-quality entertainment and family fun outside of the home. And we remain incredibly bullish on our Theme Parks.   Our Studios business is also coming back. We've returned to pre-pandemic television production levels, and we're really optimistic about our upcoming films, especially after the success of Fast 9, which debuted at number one in all territories at launch, and with $600 million of worldwide box office to date remains the biggest U.S. film launch since the pandemic began.   Following Fast, we successfully released Boss Baby 2 and a latest installment of Purge. And over the July 4th weekend, we had the top three films at the domestic box office, the first time that's happened for any studios since 1995. We have a great slate ahead with Dear Evan Hansen in September, followed by a new Halloween in October; and we end the year with Sing 2.   Next, let's talk about our media and production strategy, which across the entire company, is aligned around one purpose, create premium programming, which we can then scale and monetize for the very best global distribution outlets. Peacock adds to what we already offer. It's a great complement to our linear brands, which are successful in their own right.   And together, these platforms provide a continuous loop of content and promotion that seamlessly drive viewership across our ecosystem, offering a different access point to attract new audiences while giving existing viewers more of what they love. We are clearly capitalizing on the strength of our media brands, having just completed the strongest advertising upfront in our history, securing double-digit increases in both volume and price across our entire portfolio.   And I'm pleased to report that as of this week, Peacock has 54 million signups and over 20 million monthly active accounts. This is 50% higher than our last report, driven by a number of factors: the day and date release of Boss Baby 2; debut of Dr. Death, our most successful original to date; and the airing of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.   The third quarter thus far has been a particularly strong period. And we will work hard to manage retention and grow from here, recognizing we are unlikely to replicate such tremendous performance. But we remain optimistic with a lot of programming strength ahead of us, such as more premium originals, Sunday Night Football, the Beijing Olympics, and our reimagined dynamic pay one window, which starting in 2022 shifts our film titles to Peacock exclusively for the first and last four months segments in the pay window with Amazon Prime and Netflix sharing rights for the 10 months in between.   By showcasing content across multiple platforms, Universal films will constantly refresh across the streaming ecosystem, audiences will have multiple access points with which to consume our content. And we will generate more third party revenue while retaining the most valuable window for Peacock. So as you can see, we've successfully been able to pivot coming up with creative ways to keep up with consumer demand and in many cases, making even more money than we did before. At Sky, we are pleased revenue is back to pre-COVID levels despite the lingering impact that COVID continues to have on our pubs and clubs segment. Sky's results were led by the UK with revenue and EBITDA ahead of 2019. And we're seeing momentum across a number of areas. Premium TV churn is at record low levels.   And screaming we posted ARPU growth of over 20% for the fourth consecutive quarter. And in broadband where we just introduced our 500 -- offering. We experienced improved churn relative to both 2020 and 2019 despite a 6% price increase in the quarter. In addition, Sky mobile had the strongest second quarter activations on record, with churn averaging 40% better than industry average. And today we're announcing the debut of our international streaming strategy for Peacock. Later this year, we will leverage Sky's significant scale and powerful brand to include Peacock at no additional cost for its 20 million customers across Europe. The benefits of this launch are tremendous. We will unlock incremental advertising revenue, introduced the Peacock brand and content catalog via Sky to established platforms in key European markets and directly monetize our programming investments.   A decision to make Peacock the anchor tenant on Xfinity X1 and Flex platforms for its domestic launch has been a key driver of brand awareness, scale, consumption and promotion. And we see a similar opportunity with Sky. We're utilizing all the wonderful assets of our company to create value for audiences everywhere. And we look forward to finalizing agreements with other programming and distribution partners outside of our Sky markets. So summing up, this was a fabulous quarter and a great first half of the year. I'm so pleased we are now in a position to buy back stock which we will report on in Mike's section. This is a truly very special company. And I'm excited for the road ahead. Mike, over to you."

            "name": "A - Jeff Shell",
            "content": "So I take the first one. Yes. So hey, Doug, how are you? So on the parks, we are very \u2013 first of all, I would start by saying we're very pleased with not just the quarter, but the trajectory of our opening. As Mike went through, Orlando is on attendance standpoint, pretty close to back where we were in 2019, even though we don't have any international visitors, and you would expect those international visitors to pick up over time in Hollywood. We've only been open a of couple months and we're already approaching our capacity and we're excited about the next couple of months and Halloween Horror Nights. So the domestic parks, obviously, with COVID, you just don't know. It's \u2013 things could be lumpy, things could be non-linear. But so far, the trajectory is really good and we expect that to continue.   And I would say the thing we're most pleased with is the protocols of work. And we've been able to keep people safe and keep our workers safe and keep our guests safe. And that I think is driving the confidence in coming to our parks.   Internationally, Brian actually \u2013 and I actually were in Japan. And even though that country is a little bit behind as far as COVID, we've been able to get our park back open, we're open again, with some capacity constraints. We have a great attraction there that we were able to see Nintendo, which is one of our best attractions that we've ever built anywhere on the world to rivals Harry Potter. And I'm very excited for that not only in Japan, but for Epic Universe down the road and our other parks eventually.   So Japan is behind, but feels like it's heading in the right direction. And so that's going to be great. And then lastly, with Beijing, we're ready to go in Beijing. The park is ready. It's awesome. It's our most technologically advanced park. And we expect \u2013 right now, what we're doing is going through the final approvals of rides and the process you have to go through and that is somewhat indeterminate. But we expect that park to open in the next couple of months.   And when it does open, as you mentioned, those pre-operating costs go away and we start getting attendance. And so Beijing should be a good contributor to us remainder of the year when it opens and then on to next year. So overall, our parks are on a good trajectory and it's hard to see what happens with COVID, but we're pretty pleased. Dave? Yes. Thanks, Brian. Hi, Ben, when you talk about scale, with respect to streaming, and Peacock just to get more granular for a second, there really are, no, there really are three elements of the scale. One is the scale of the platform technologically. And as Brian just mentioned, we launched on the back of the Sky platform, and we've leveraged our Xfinity and Dave's team significantly. So I think we have proved that we would have never launched the success technologically with a platform that looks great and works without the scale that we have already at the company. There's scale with respect to the brand. And that's why I'm thrilled with today's announcement that Peacock is going to be in 20 million Sky homes, and eventually we'll roll it out across the globe.   And then the most important by far element of scales for streaming is content. And we are really at the beginning of our content rollout on Peacock that's why this quarter's growth is really extraordinary. Because this quarter as Brian went through we had a pretty good movie with Boss Baby 2, we had our first real good drama with Doctor Death. And we had and we have obviously rolled into the Olympics here. We're halfway through the first week of the Olympics. Looking forward, we as part of our plan, we have another Olympics, we have lots of original programming, which Mike mentioned, we're ramping up production right now on and we'll be rolling out over the next year, Brian mentioned our movies, we have the -- what I think is one of the top studios in Hollywood, and we have lots of movies coming directly to Peacock and eventually we're going to have, the Hulu content coming back.   So we have plenty of content coming in this quarter showed that when you put that content on a service, that's good, you can actually get pretty good growth in the streaming world. And so personally, I don't think we've ever lacked for the capital to do what we need to do to and grow our business. And what I'll end with is the perfect example that happened in last week, was we at Universal acquired the rights to the next three Exorcist movies. In a pretty unique deal that was done in tandem with Peacock, we wouldn't have been able to do it if we didn't have a streaming service that's where we basically got the rights on the backs of the strength of our studio, where we have Jason Blum and pedigree that's unmatched and Donna Langley and her team's ability to market movies. But because we did it with Peacock, we have full optionality going forward, we put the second and third movies direct on Peacock, do we do something hybrid, we can really kind of adapt and be flexible based on how the market works. So we have this scale across our company to do things like that. And I don't think we're lacking for scale. Personally, I think we can achieve our success in Peacock, without anything additional. And I think this quarter approved it. Hey, Jessica. Thanks Brian. So on the upfront, let me take kind of in order, Jessica, how you ask the question. So on the upfront; I think we've been I think we've talked about that in the past. It's -- as Brian just mentioned, the strength of our platform, combined with Linda's, and Linda Yaccarino and her team's approach. One platform approach was the perfect way to approach this red hot upfront and as Brian said, and Mike said double digit increases in both volume and pricing. And we'll see those results in the years ahead and particularly happy with both the volume on Peacock and the CPM on Peacock. So that could not have been more pleased with how we did the upfront.   As far as peacock, I should mention that one of the things I didn't talk about is we concluded our Amazon and Samsung deals this quarter too, there is a lot going on at NBC, we're now fully distributed, for Peacock. And that's going to have benefits as we roll out our additional content. I would say that we look at where we are today and being much further ahead than we expected to be at this point, we'll probably ramp up our investment modestly over what we've done in the past. But as I mentioned, we have so much content coming to Peacock that it doesn't have to be significant. I will stay with Peacock and say little bit about Olympics, we were learning a lot as consumption happens on the Olympics here at day six, and not to ruin everybody tuning in, but we have big upset that just happened in the last hour. And should watch tonight on NBC to see that but exciting US team.   And we're not -- we've had some bad luck. But if you look at the product, it's fantastic. And it really is impossible. And so what I would say is on Peacock, what we will learn in this Olympics we will take to Beijing and change the product change the offering and each Olympics on our board. And we're really excited about that. It's impossible to understate the importance of the Olympics to NBCUniversal, it's not really financially it's more operationally across the company; we have 4,000 people literally working on it. Brian and I were in Tokyo, I came back and saw our team in Connecticut, people this is their life work, you go from room to room, and you have experts on surfing and volleyball and gymnastics. And it is an operation that would be very difficult to replicate the talent and the experience that our team brings to it. And they show it every night at NBC. And then of course, the Olympics are the perfect property to show the strength of our platform across not only NBCUniversal but Comcast and Xfinity and Sky. So the Olympics obviously, as you said, Jessica, we had a little bit of bad luck, there was a drumbeat of negativity, we got moved a year and those spectators. And that has resulted a little bit in linear ratings being probably less than we expected. But the flip side of that is the digital strength is kind of offset that. So we look at what's happening with Peacock that's directly related to the Olympics. So net-net, with all this bad luck, we're going to be profitable on the Olympics, which we're very happy with. And we're very happy with the product. And then if you watch every night, you'll see we use this as a fire hose to promote everything else we're doing at the company, not just across NBCUniversal, but also Comcast. So the Olympics, I think we're very pleased with the Olympics and very proud of our team and got a ways to go here."

            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on slide 4 with our second quarter consolidated 2021 results, revenue increased to 20% to $28.5 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 13% to $8.9 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 22% to $0.84 per share. And finally, we generated $4.8 billion of free cash flow.   Now let's turn to our business segment results starting with Cable Communications on slide 5, Cable revenue increased 11% to $16 billion, EBITDA increased nearly 15% to $7.1 billion and net cash flow grew close to 15% to $5 billion. As a reminder, last year second quarter was most significantly impacted by COVID-19, including adjustments accrued for customer RSN fees. Excluding the impact of these RSN adjustments, Cable Communications' revenue increased 9.3% with no corresponding impact to EBITDA. We added 294,000 net new customer relationships, up 35% over last year, second quarter and up 93% over the second quarter of 2019. This was the best second quarter on record and was driven by broadband where we added 354,000 net new residential and business customers, up 10% over last year second quarter, and 69% above the second quarter of 2019.   These strong results were driven by improved churn and healthy connects relative to both 2020 and 2019. And this was the lowest second quarter broadband churn on record. Looking ahead, as Brian mentioned earlier, based on our strong results through the first half of the year, as well as current trends, we now expect total broadband net additions for 2021 to be up mid-teens from the 1.4 million net adds in 2019. Broadband revenue increased 14% and grew 13% excluding the RSN fee adjustments in last year second quarter. These results were driven by strong growth in volume and rate. Wireless revenue grew 70% due to an increase in both customer lines and higher device sales. We added 280,000 net new lines in the quarter. The best result since launching this business in 2017, bringing us to 3.4 million total lines as of quarter end. We are encouraged by the initial results on our new unlimited plan, which is driving a notable increase in unlimited connects as well as a lift in overall volume.   Turning to Video, revenue increased 2.6% or 0.5% excluding RSN fee adjustments in last year second quarter, reflecting healthy growth in rates mostly offset by net video subscriber losses totaling 399,000. While our residential rate adjustment at the beginning of the year was the primary driver of the increase in rates, we believe it was also a contributor to the video subscriber loss in the quarter. Business Services revenue increased 10% primarily driven by higher rates due to comparison to last year when Business Services were significantly impacted by COVID-19. Over the past year, we have bounced back, rates have recovered and customer growth is strong, as we added 17,000 net new customers in the quarter and 70,000 over the past year, primarily driven by continued improvement in small business.   Last, advertising revenue increased 59%, reflecting an overall market recovery compared to last year, when we experienced reduced spending from advertisers due to COVID-19. As we move to the second half of the year, we will have difficult comparisons to last year when we've benefited from strong political advertising. Turning to expenses, Cable Communications second quarter expenses increased 8.2%, programming expenses increased 12% and were up 5%, excluding the impact of RSN adjustments last year, primarily due to the number of contract renewals that started to cycle through in 2020 combined with annual escalators in existing agreements. Looking to the third quarter, we expect programming expense growth to increase that high single digit levels due to the continued impact of contract renewals, as well as the comparison to last year's third quarter, which was also favorably impacted by RSN fee adjustments.   For the full year, we continue to expect programming expense to increase at high single digit levels. Non-programming expenses increased 5.7%, or 0.5% on a per relationship basis due to higher technical and product support, and advertising, marketing and promotion spend the drive growth in our core broadband in wireless businesses. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower bad debt expense. These trends should continue in the third quarter. Cable Communications' EBITDA grew nearly 15% to $7.1 billion, including a contribution of $68 million from our wireless business, the best results since launch. Cable EBITDA margins reached 44.2% reflecting 140 basis points of year-over-year improvement. While the RSN fee adjustments had no impact on EBITDA, they did impact margins last year. Moving the RSN adjustment impact margins expanded 200 basis points year-over-year. Cable capital expenditures increased 17% resulting in CapEx intensity of 10.6%, up 50 basis points compared to last year. These results were driven by an increase in scalable infrastructure as we continue to enhance the capacity of our network, as well as increases in broadband related CPE and line extensions.   As Brian mentioned, we have decided to move a bit faster to the next phase of DOCSIS using very cost effective technology, allowing us to maintain the CapEx intensity level we achieve in 2020, which was the lowest in our history, and we expect to be at this level for the next few years.   Now let's turn to slide 6 for NBCUniversal. Let's start with total NBCUniversal results. Revenue increased 39% to $8 billion, and EBITDA increased 13%, $1.6 billion. Media revenue increased 26% driven by higher advertising, distribution and other revenue. Advertising revenue increased 33% reflecting the timing of sports, and overall market recovery compared to last year, and the launch of Peacock. We had significantly more sporting events compared to last year when sports were paused, which benefited our advertising revenue. Excluding this benefit advertising grew at mid-teens levels. Distribution revenue increased 19% or high single digits excluding the RSN fee adjustments that impacted last year's results. This growth reflects higher rates post the successful completion of several carriage renewals at the end of 2020, partially offset by subscriber declines, which were sequentially flat. Media EBITDA declined 16%, $1.4 billion, including Peacock, which generates revenue of $122 million and an EBITDA loss of $363 million. Excluding Peacock, Media EBITDA was essentially flat, driven by higher sports costs associated with the increase in sporting events this quarter compared to both last year and 2019.   As a reminder, our third quarter Media results will be impacted by our broadcast of the Summer Olympics. Studios revenue increased 8.4% driven by higher theatrical revenue, reflecting the success of Fast 9 in theaters. And compared to last year when theaters were mainly closed due to COVID-19 Studios EBITDA decreased to 52% to $156 million as a result of higher expenses associated with our theatrical release compared to last year when releases were paused the timing of content licensing sales and the comparison to last year, which included transactions with Peacock related to our initial launch of the service. In the second half, EBITDA comparisons to last year will remain challenging as we continue to launch new theatrical releases and ramp our TV production.   Theme Parks revenue increased by $958 million, $1.1 billion and generated EBITDA of $221 million, which included about $150 million of Universal Beijing preopening costs. This is the first profitable quarter we've had since the pandemic began in the first quarter of 2020 and was driven by strong results at our Universal Orlando Resort. Orlando has had exceptionally strong demand, with June attendance exceeding 2019 levels, as well as strong per cap growth. Despite virtually no international guests during the quarter due to COVID related travel constraints. We opened our Jurassic World themed roller coaster, VelociCoaster on June 10, to some of the highest guest satisfaction scores we've had. Hollywood has been operating without capacity restrictions since mid-June and has experienced strong demand, aided by the opening of our Secret Life of Pets attraction in April.   We're optimistic that our domestic parks are on a path to return to historic levels of profitability. But we need international visitation to resume which remains dependent on COVID related travel restrictions being lifted. At our Japan Park, results continue to be challenging after closing in late April, we reopened on June 1 with capacity restrictions that are likely to remain in place through the summer. Last, as we prepare to open our newest Park Universal Beijing, we expect overall results will be negatively impacted by up to $250 million in the third quarter.   Now let's turn to slide 7 for Sky, which I'll speak to on a constant currency basis. For the second quarter, Sky revenue increased 15% to $5.2 billion, largely reflecting strong growth in our UK business. Direct-to-consumer revenue increased 7.7%, primarily reflecting higher average revenue per customer relationship. Results in the UK drove the bulk of the growth and benefited from the comparison to last year when sports subscriptions were paused, as well as a rate increase, higher mobile device sales, improving hospitality revenue as pubs and clubs reopen. While customer relationships grew in the UK, overall customer relationships declined 248,000 primarily driven by customer losses in Italy and Germany to the end of the football season. As we have previously said, we've reset our football rights in Germany and Italy. As a result, we anticipate lower programming and production expense, along with continued customer losses in the third and fourth quarters. We believe this disciplined approach to sports related costs is the right long-term financial decision for the business.   Advertising revenue increased 79% with results in the UK driving the growth and reflecting the overall market recovery from COVID-19, as well as an increase in a number of sporting events compared to last year when sports were paused. Sky generated $560 million in EBITDA, a 32% decline compared to last year second quarter, primarily reflecting higher sports rights amortization related to more events in the current quarter. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower entertainment costs due to production delays. I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on slide 9.   Free cash flow was $4.8 billion in the quarter, a decrease of 20% year-over-year, largely due to the timing of last year's federal tax payments, which were deferred to the third quarter. While networking capital was a positive contribution to free cash flow in the quarter, we continue to expect it will be a negative drag on our full year results and higher compared to 2019 levels due to an increase in content investments and our broadcast of the Olympics. Consolidated total capital, which includes capital expenditures, as well as software and intangibles, increased 5.2% in second quarter to $2.8 billion reflecting an increase in cable, which was partially offset by the decline at NBCU.   For the full year, we now expect capital to be slightly above 2020 levels, reflecting our plan, as I previously mentioned, to accelerate enhancements to our network. In the second quarter, a return of capital to shareholders included dividend payments totaling $1.2 billion, up 9.5% year-over-year. We also resumed our share repurchase activity late in the second quarter, totaling $500 million as of June 30. As previously communicated, we intend to stay at historical buyback levels until we reach our intended target leverage levels, which we currently expect to reach sometime in 2022. With our return to share repurchase in the quarter, we're happy to get back to our long standing balanced approach to capital allocation, which consists of maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing organically for profitable growth, and returning capital to shareholders.   Thanks for joining us on the call this morning. I'll turn it back to Marci, who will lead the question- and-answer portion of the call."

            "content": "Yes. Hi Doug. So, quick walk through a couple of things on margin in the quarter and looking forward. It's \u2013 we feel very good about our position on the progress that we continue to make on margin improvement, real focus around the fundamentals.   And so while there'll be some things within a quarter that move a little bit, if the fundamentals are the things that we stay extremely focused on. And starts with broadband, and both residential and commercial, now both are just drive higher revenue, both the margin accretive, and just help us deploy digital solutions, in particular, and residential, at a higher rate.   So those fundamentals are \u2013 continue to bring us to where we're at. As we scale mobile, as you said, there are improvements there, advertising as well, with advanced advertising provides support. But it's primarily the focus around connectivity and just driving more customer relationships there in that space, connected with the digital customer experience improvements, is such a win-win for the customer and for us. Just to provide perspective in the quarter, our total agent calls decreased by 10%, with total interactions lowered at 7% and we saw a 22% reduction in truck rolls. And this is despite an overall 5% increase in the customer base. So if you go back over time, this is just a continuation. Over the past five years, we've constantly made progress, taken 37% or almost 100 million calls out of the run rate and reduced truck rolls by 25%.   So, Doug, it's been -- this is a real focus for us. And while I don't think we'll grow the second half of the year margins at the same rate that we did the first half, we're in a really good place, and we're doing it in a healthy and sustainable way. And so I like the roadmap that we have around digital tools and the experience, I like the run rate around connectivity. And while we'll invest in areas like business services, in mobile, sales and marketing, things that are just going to help us grow, we're going to continue to stay extremely focused on margin. Thanks Mike. Hello, Ben. Yes, we expect over time to have a little bit more normalization, as you go into quarters, like Q2 like Q3, with student activity, move activity, seasonality, that could impact the churn, but we're reaching a level that we expected in terms of overall broadband churn performance. And this is -- it's the redefinition of great broadband, I think that's helping deliver this, some of this churn improvement, we have a fantastic network. Yes, we've talked about it, Brian might mention it, continuing to invest them in the network, we're going to stay ahead of the curve in terms of capacity, and usage.   So a lot of focus around the network. And then to compliment, not just speed, but our devices of the pods, the ability of varied great Wi Fi coverage inside the home is just so critical. And staying ahead of that curve is key and adding value extensions to broadband, like mobile, like Flex, that impact churn. And so these are early days, for us in terms of as we, both of those categories are exciting for us. But they're impacting broadband in a positive way. So can't give specific guidance in terms of where churn would go, but the fundamentals of and the focus around attracting healthy and keeping healthy customer relationships and connectivity is a key. So very excited about the prospects of mobile and Flex impacting that over time. Well, I'll jump in on now. And this is Dave. So we are very excited about Flex. You're early -- still early days, but now we have over 3.8 million Flex boxes deployed and about half of those are being actively used and engaged so and the reasons why that we're -- we continue to be excited. It is a terrific long-term platform but it is helping broadband as I mentioned earlier. So there we're generating about $2 of incremental revenue just on the pay per view, the rev share side of things and advertising opportunities will be above that. So today in terms of what we're doing within footprint, there are parts of what you mentioned, we absolutely included as part of the broadband subscription. It's a key part of now that with broadband, you get this great streaming platform. So we're doing that. We have -- if you're traditional video customer, we have devices that enable full home the X1 experience throughout so we have that but we are not bashful about letting our customers, broadband customers in particular that really important streaming segment know if this is included. Outside of footprint, we are -- we have syndication partners that we're working with Cox, the Canadian company. And we continue to explore ways of doing that. And we think that it's a terrific long-term platform to tie together uniquely, the way that we do with the voice remote thinking the full capability, we've been investing in X1, and we can leverage that platform. So we do qualify, we ask the customer if they want it, and then we but we stay right on it, and deliver the great service and the feedback that we're getting in engagement is very strong. So it's a really important part of broadband growth today. And we'll explore outside of footprint opportunities, ways of doing even more over time. Hey there, Phil. This is Dave. So go on sales momentum side of mobile. One of the things that's happened is we got through the first pandemic phase that we did shut down last year, retail blow things down. And what we saw the back half of last year just continued through this year as every single sales channel now we focused on. Retail is back and but in addition to that, extremely focused on our call centers, digital tools that are optimized by flows for mobile, and how we go-to-market, that has been a huge chance, just the fact that we lead with mobile is so key, and mobile and broadband being a package. So those fundamentals have emerged and really an important part of our go-to-market strategy.   We've invested in tools not only for the customer, but for our agents, and how they sell mobile, this improving the experience for customers really key. So a lot of marketing investment around the mobile message, if you live in our footprint, and you're watching this great Olympics coverage, the Jeff and team are doing, you can't miss the fact that we are really, really focused around the mobile business. So but I think that natural combination of broadband plus mobile will continue. So the other big addition recently is clearly the unlimited packages that we've rolled out. And that is adding to it. We've seen a nice shift and mix that we continue to have by the gig. But adding on unlimited really closed and fills the gap that we had in our competitive portfolio, so now with great unlimited of pricing for multi line families. And you can mix and match still between buy the gig and unlimited, we're in a unique position in our footprint. So like our momentum, the 280,000 lines were just terrific. And set a record for us but we're continuing to stay focused and we see that this is a real opportunity for us going forward. So on the auction side, I think the last part --"

Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Miss Ryvicker.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone. Joining me on this morning\u2019s call, are Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh, Dave Watson, Jeff Shell, and Dana Strong. Brian and Mike will make formal remarks, while Dave, Jeff and Dana will also be available for Q&A. Let me now refer you to slide 2, which contains our safe harbor disclaimer, and remind you that this conference call may include forward-looking statements, subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our 8-K and trending schedules for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. With that, let me turn the call over to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?\nBrian Roberts: Thanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. We certainly got off to a great start this year. Our entire Company performed well, and we once again had particularly strong results at Cable, which posted its third consecutive quarter of double-digit EBITDA growth, ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit net cash flow growth. We added 461, 000 broadband customers, which drove 380,000 customer relationship additions. This is the best first quarter on record. Our connect activity was healthy and broadband churn improved for the 13th quarter in a row, hitting our lowest churn rate in our Company\u2019s history. I\u2019m very proud of this quarter\u2019s results and our long record of growth, which I believe is a direct result of disciplined investment, fantastic innovation and consistent execution in a highly competitive market. This morning, I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper in two areas, the robustness of our network in the U.S. and more broadly how we positioned ourselves to successfully compete against alternative providers and technologies. We\u2019ve spent nearly $30 billion in the last decade, building an expansive fiber dense network comprised of 191, 000 route miles that carries an immense amount of traffic has demonstrated extraordinary performance throughout the pandemic. Under Tony Werner, our retiring Chief Technology Officer, we have consistently engineered our network to anticipate change. And during his 15-plus years at Comcast, he has helped transform us into a product and technology innovator and leader. Tony, we thank you. He\u2019s being succeeded by Charlie Herrin. Many of you on this call are familiar with Charlie. He helped develop game-changing products, including scaling X1 and most recently led a successful effort to redefine how we interact with customers, which has resulted in significantly higher NPS scores and lower operating costs. Charlie, Dave and I have been fortunate to work together for 20 years. Under Dave and Tony, we\u2019ve recruited the best engineering talent around the world and now are working as one global tech team to create platforms, apps and experiences that evolve the way people connect and consume entertainment. We\u2019ve done all this while keeping the network our number one priority. We\u2019ve introduced the xFi Advanced Gateway, the most powerful of its kind. Our highest users are connecting a wide variety of devices in the home and streaming multiple services simultaneously over WiFi. Our xFi pods integrate with Xfinity Gateways to form a mesh network that maximizes WiFi coverage. All you do is plug one of these pods into an outlet to get great coverage in every room. We provide our customers with what they need, which goes well beyond extraordinary connectivity and speed. Xfinity is the only broadband provider to offer advanced security for monitoring devices inside and soon outside of the home. We also uniquely provide our customers with a whole home speed test and enable parents to manage internet time spent by streaming application. This is all backed by a network that is built to consistently deliver the fastest speeds and outperform well into the future with two major initiatives underway. The first is virtualizing our network by leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning. We\u2019re taking functions that were once performed by thousands of large and expensive pieces of hardware and moving them into the cloud, which alone has reduced innovation cycles from years down to just months. We\u2019re also automating many of our core network functions so that we can deliver instant capacity as well as identify and fix network issues before they ever affect a customer. Our second priority is further enhancing how we deliver our broadband product over our network. We currently offer downstream speeds of 1. 2 gigs across our entire footprint using our DOCSIS 3.1 architecture, and can increase upstream in a capital-efficient way. We\u2019re making great progress to deliver multi-gig symmetrical speeds. And in the last six months, we completed two important milestones on our roadmap. In October, we conducted a successful live test of 1. 25 gig symmetrical speeds. And earlier this month, our engineers completed the first ever live lab test of DOCSIS 4.0, which establishes a foundation for us to deliver multi-gigabit speeds over our existing network without the need for massive digging and construction projects. Let me next talk about Xfinity Mobile, where we\u2019re having great success. This past quarter, we reached breakeven on a standalone basis for the first time and added 278,000 mobile lines, the highest quarterly addition since launch. We just announced a new unlimited family plan, which can provide $600 in annual savings relative to other competitor family plans. Now, let\u2019s turn to Sky, which despite renewed lockdowns in Europe, generated revenue growth and delivered the best first quarter customer relationships net addition in six years. I am particularly encouraged by our strong performance in the UK. Excluding pubs and clubs, which remain closed, UK direct-to-consumer revenue grew 8% over the first quarter 2020, and 11% relative to 2019. Churn continued to trend down. Two-thirds of our customer base in the UK now have Sky Q, we\u2019re seeing great acceleration in mobile, and we just launched Sky Connect, our B2B broadband service that leverages the expertise of Comcast Cable. Dana Strong is off to a great start and is syncing up more than ever with Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal, so that together, we\u2019re all innovating more quickly, better serving our customers and viewers and increasing operating efficiencies. We\u2019re also encouraged by the trends we\u2019re seeing across NBCU. Our Parks segment broke even, excluding Beijing, for the second consecutive quarter driven by remarkable attendance at Universal Orlando. We can see firsthand pent-up demand for high-quality entertainment and family fun outside of the home, and we remain incredibly bullish on the Parks business. While Osaka recently had to close temporarily, Universal Studios Hollywood reopened on April 16th, the first time since the pandemic started. Our long-term excitement stems from the fact that we have a fabulous roadmap of new attractions and experiences awaiting guests as they safely return to our current parks. In NBCUniversal\u2019s Media segment under Jeff Shell and Mark Lazarus, we\u2019re starting to see the benefits of our new operating structure. Excluding Peacock, adjusted EBITDA increased 10% year-over-year. Our news content continues to experience tremendous momentum and distribution revenue is trending above expectations, a testament to the strength of our linear brands. We\u2019re back in business on the studio side with more than 30 television series currently in production and we\u2019re excited for our first big theatrical debut with Fast 9, launching in both the U.S. and China later in the second quarter. We\u2019re also making great progress with Peacock, our premium ad-supported streaming service. Just one year post launch, we have 42 million sign-ups. Monthly users of the service are consuming nearly 20% more programming hours each month than our traditional audience on NBC. And we just crossed 1 billion total hours watched, nearly double our plan when we launched. This strength in users and engagement has enabled us to create additional advertising inventory outside of our initial partnership, with CPMs at a material premium to linear prime time. Key to Peacock\u2019s domestic success has been Xfinity with X1 and Flex driving subscriber acquisitions and healthy engagement. With Peacock, we\u2019ve created great options for ourselves with several opportunities on the horizon. We\u2019ve recently secured more original programming with creative partners like WWE and the NFL, providing a strong path to upsell into Peacock premium. And as Peacock gained scale in the U.S., we see compelling ways we can expand internationally. We\u2019re looking to take advantage of the brand and scales of Sky across our European markets and potentially strike partnerships with local programmers and distributors in geographies where it makes sense. We plan to share more information on Peacock throughout this year. So, in summary, we\u2019re all very proud and encouraged by our first quarter results. This performance is a testament to the resilience and evolution of our Company. Excellent execution of our growth initiatives combined with tight cost control brings us one step closer to our balance sheet goals, and I am eager to see us return to our historical practice of repurchasing shares starting in the second half of this year. Lastly, I want to thank our team. Everyone across the Company has continued to show up and innovate for our customers, audience, guests and each other. We were recently named as one of the top 5 big companies to work for in the U.S. and one of the top 10 inclusive companies in the UK, a testament to the work and passion of our wonderful employees. Mike, over to you.\nMike Cavanagh: Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll begin on slide 4 with our first quarter consolidated 2021 results. Revenue increased 2.2% to $27.2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 3.5% to $8.4 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 7% to $0.76 per share. And finally, we generated $5.3 billion of free cash flow. Now, let\u2019s turn to our business segment results starting with Cable Communications on slide 5. Cable revenue increased 5.9% to $15.8 billion. EBITDA increased 12% to $6.8 billion and EBITDA less capital grew 16% to $5.1 billion. We added 380,000 net new customer relationships, up 2.4% over last year\u2019s first quarter and up 27% over the first quarter of 2019. This was the best first quarter on record and was driven by broadband, where we added 461,000 net new residential and business customers, only slightly below last year\u2019s first quarter and 23% above the first quarter of 2019. We saw healthy connect activity, and this quarter marked the lowest broadband churn in our history. This positive momentum has continued into the second quarter. And from what we see today, we anticipate total broadband additions for the year to grow by mid-single-digit levels compared to 2019, which, aside from the extraordinary growth we had in an unusual 2020 was the best year in more than a decade. The strong customer additions, coupled with ARPU growth of 4.4%, drove a 12% increase in broadband revenue for the first quarter, the largest driver of overall cable revenue, and we expect this trend will continue. We also saw an acceleration in both, business and wireless. Business services revenue increased 6.1% and delivered 11,000 net new customer additions, primarily driven by continued improvement in small business. Wireless revenue grew 50% and due to an increase in both customer lines and higher device sales. We added 278,000 net new lines in the quarter, the best results since launching this business in 2017, bringing us to 3.1 million total lines as of quarter end. Turning to video. Revenue was consistent with the prior year, reflecting very healthy ARPU growth of 6.8% offset by net video subscriber losses totaling 491,000, which we felt mostly on the connect side as residential churn improved year-over-year. We believe our residential rate adjustment at the beginning of the year was a significant contributor to both the ARPU increase and the video subscriber loss in the quarter, and we expect video losses in the second quarter will remain elevated. We currently anticipate Cable Communications revenue growth in the second quarter to accelerate by a few hundred basis points from the 5.9% we just reported, partly due to the comparison to last year\u2019s second quarter, which was most significantly impacted by COVID-19, as well as our focus on driving growth in our connectivity businesses. Turning to expenses. Cable Communications first quarter expenses increased 1.5%. Programming expenses were up 5.5%, primarily due to the number of contract renewals that started to cycle through in 2020, combined with annual escalators in existing agreements. Looking to the second quarter, we expect programming expense growth to increase at low double-digit levels due to the continued impact of contract renewals as well as the comparison to last year\u2019s second quarter, which was favorably impacted by adjustments accrued for customer RSN fees. For the full year, we continue to expect programming expense to increase at high single-digit levels. Non-programming expenses declined 1.1% on an absolute basis, and 5.9% on a per relationship basis, while our customer relationships grew 5% year-over-year. Non-programming expenses should increase at high single-digit rate in the second quarter due in part to the comparison to last year, which reflected the slowdown in business activity due to COVID-19, as well as our continued focus on driving growth in our core broadband and wireless businesses. Cable Communications EBITDA grew by 12%, with margins reaching 43.2%, reflecting 250 basis points of year-over-year improvement. These results include the important milestone of our wireless business reaching breakeven for the first time since launch. Cable capital expenditures increased 8%, resulting in CapEx intensity of 8.7%, up slightly compared to last year and driven by a 23% increase in scalable infrastructure as we continue to invest to enhance the capacity of our network. This spending was partially offset by lower customer premise equipment and support. Now, let\u2019s turn to slide 6 for NBCUniversal. As you know, we recently issued an 8-K with updated trending schedules and a new reporting format that reflects the way the business is now managed. We moved Peacock, which was previously reported in our corporate results to NBCUniversal. And now we present NBCU in three business segments: Media, which combines our TV businesses and Peacock; Studios, which combines our film and television studio businesses; and Theme Parks. I will discuss today\u2019s results in this new format. Let\u2019s start with total NBCUniversal results. Revenue decreased 9.1% to $7 billion and EBITDA was down 12% to $1.5 billion. Media revenue increased 3.2%, driven by 9.1% growth in distribution revenue, which reflected higher rates post the successful completion of several carriage renewals at the end of 2020, partially offset by subscriber declines, which showed sequential improvement. Advertising revenue declined 3.4% as lower entertainment ratings and tough political comps were partially offset by more sports in the quarter, strength in news and the launch of Peacock. Media EBITDA declined 3.7% when including Peacock, which generated revenue of $91 million and an EBITDA loss of $277 million. Excluding Peacock, media EBITDA increased 10%, primarily driven by lower expenses, which was partly due to lower entertainment costs associated with fewer original hours aired and partly due to our new operating model. This year-over-year reduction more than offset higher sports cost, resulting from additional events. Looking to the second quarter, we expect healthy growth in distribution revenue to continue. We will have significantly more sporting events compared to last year, which should result in higher advertising revenue, but also a significant increase in sports-related programming and production costs. Studio revenue was flat compared to last year, primarily reflecting higher content licensing revenue, offset by lower theatrical revenue. Content licensing revenue increased 14%, primarily due to licensing deals, including the office, which became exclusively available for streaming on Peacock this past January. Theatrical revenue decreased 88%, reflecting the deferral of theatrical releases due to COVID-19. Significantly fewer releases in the first quarter resulted in lower expenses, driving EBITDA growth of 66%. We\u2019re excited to be releasing Fast 9 in theaters later in the second quarter, but we delayed the release of Minions 2 from July of this year to July of 2022, which will shift the profits from 2021 to 2022 as well as we continue to manage our film fleet to maximize value. Theme Parks revenue decreased 33.1% in the quarter and generated an EBITDA loss of $61 million, which included $100 million of Universal Beijing preopening costs. These results reflect Universal Orlando Resort operating at limited capacity, but trends remain encouraging as attendance continues to rebound, and we\u2019ve been at or near capacity limits through spring break. Hollywood remained closed during the quarter, but we recently opened at a 25% capacity limit and expect this to move higher by June 15th. In Japan, we recently had to close our park temporarily due to rising COVID cases, but prior to this, we had seen strong demand. Looking ahead, we expect our EBITDA results to improve in the back half of the year as domestic attendance trends improve, and we remain on track to open our new park, Universal Beijing this summer. Now, let\u2019s turn to slide 7 for Sky, which I will speak to on a constant currency basis. For the first quarter, Sky revenue increased 2% to $5 billion, largely reflecting healthy growth in our UK business. Direct-to-consumer revenue increased 1.8% with growth in the UK even stronger. This result was driven by higher average rates per customer and strong customer growth across all markets. We generated 221,000 net customer additions the best first quarter in six years, driven by streaming across our markets as well as steady momentum in mobile and broadband within the UK. Advertising revenue increased 3.4% as we continue to outperform the market, particularly in the UK, where the ad market is rebounding more quickly than we expected, and we are driving growth through advanced advertising. Sky generated $364 million in EBITDA in the first quarter. As expected, this reflects elevated expenses, including higher sports rights amortization, resulting from more events in the current quarter as well as higher expenses associated with successfully growing our mobile and broadband businesses and investment in key growth initiatives, which now include Sky Connect, our recently launched commercial broadband business in the UK. For the second quarter, we expect revenue growth to accelerate to low double-digit levels on a constant currency basis due to the comparison to last year\u2019s second quarter, which was the most impacted by COVID-19 as well as continued strength in our UK business. We also anticipate significantly higher Sports rights amortization compared to last year when events were paused. As a result, we expect to generate a similar level of EBITDA in the second quarter as we did in the first quarter. We were recently outbid for some of the broadcast rights for Serie A in Italy as we stood firm and our disciplined approach to sports-related costs. We believe this was the right long-term financial decision, but we expect a reduction in programming and production expenses and a potential decline in customer relationships in Italy as a result. We continue to expect Sky EBITDA in the second half of this year to accelerate from first half levels, reflecting the benefits of a reset to major sports rights as well as a more efficient operating structure. I\u2019ll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on slide 8. Free cash flow was $5.3 billion in the quarter, an increase of roughly 60% year-over-year, primarily due to an improvement in net working capital and higher EBITDA. Net working capital will continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis, and we still expect the full year drag increase relative to 2019 due to an increase in content investments, our broadcast of the Olympics and the reversal of COVID-related onetime tax deferrals. Consolidated total capital, which includes capital expenditures as well as software and intangibles, decreased 1.1% in the first quarter to $2.5 billion, reflecting a decline at NBCU, which was partially offset by increases at Sky and Cable. We ended the first quarter with $104 billion of debt with a weighted average cost of 3.6% and a weighted average life of 14. 5 years and net debt of $86 billion for a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.7 times. Throughout the pandemic, we have maintained an elevated cash balance to fortify our liquidity position, and we ended the first quarter with $15 billion of cash and cash equivalents. We expect to gradually reduce our cash position by deploying excess cash towards debt reduction throughout the remainder of the year as our business operations continue to recover. Finally, we remain committed to our longstanding balanced approach to capital allocation, which consists of maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing organically for profitable growth and returning capital to shareholders for a strong commitment to our recurring dividends and our expected return to share repurchases in the second half of this year. Thanks for joining us on the call this morning. I\u2019ll turn it back to Marci, who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Mike. Regina, let\u2019s open the call for questions, please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. Good morning. The Company clearly is on an upswing as we come out of COVID and the leverage in the business is really apparent in the first quarter numbers. So, I have a broad-based question that covers basically all the divisions. In Cable, it feels like they\u2019re beginning for advanced advertising. We\u2019re seeing strength still in broadband, the price decrease in mobile should drive market share. In NBCU, which seems like the division with the most upside coming out of COVID, I\u2019m just -- I don\u2019t know if this is the year of peak losses for Peacock, but Theme Parks seem like they\u2019re on a 5-year growth trend, advertise -- production is coming back, et cetera. Sky, you can see the leverage. So, my question finally is, where do you see the most leverage overall in each of the businesses? And can margins and free cash flow continue to improve?\nBrian Roberts: Well, thank you, Jessica, for those comments. Why don\u2019t we just go around the horn and why don\u2019t we just go from Dave to Dana to Jeff, and everybody give a crack at their view of the business and a chance for them to introduce themselves on the call here.\nDave Watson: Thank you, Jessica. This is Dave. Start with -- our focus continues to be maintaining momentum around the connectivity side of the business. So, broadband, residential, commercial is enormously important and a great growth engine for us. So, we\u2019re going to continue to enhance broadband, keep adding to it, speed, control coverage and now streaming, and as you mentioned, mobile. So, we\u2019re going to focus on accelerating mobile and just surrounding broadband with these products. So, that\u2019s going to be -- that\u2019s our strategy, nothing will shake that. And in terms of EBITDA that we are -- we like our -- the recurring revenue aspect of the connectivity business. We like the margins that, that contributes towards. We\u2019re very focused on taking out the transactions that cause customer noise. And so, focusing on digital, focusing on things like self-install kits, those -- all the things that we\u2019ve been talking about will continue. So, I feel very good about our position in the marketplace. So, there\u2019s a lot of upside still in broadband, feel good about mobile and business services.\nDana Strong: Thanks, Jessica. This is Dana, following up from Dave\u2019s side. From the Sky angle, we\u2019re really, really happy with the fundamentals of the business. I think Q1 -- our Q1 results demonstrate the position that we\u2019re in, subscriber numbers up, that\u2019s in fact, quarter one in about six years, churn is down, revenue is up. All of the fundamental factors of the business position us well to exit COVID. To be more specific on your question in regards to where do we see the most leverage, if I had to boil it down, I would say, the UK, the UK is an extraordinary position for growth. We got a very diverse revenue base with DTH having its best performance in Q1 in six years, streaming is going well, mobile is going very well, broadband is growing well with a lot of innovation potential. And so, I think what we see in the UK is a lot of growth left in that business and a really solid business to build upon in the rest of the portfolio.\nJeff Shell: Hi, Jessica, this is Jeff. And everybody. So, there\u2019s a lot of different places I could pick and choose from NBCUniversal, but let me just talk about two points of leverage that I\u2019m excited about. I think, first of all, as we\u2019ve talked about in previous calls, we really adjusted our cost base across the entire Company during the pandemic. We didn\u2019t do this just to cut cost. We obviously looked at where the business was going and changed our organization, particularly on the TV side, but I\u2019m excited about the business being kind of adjusting the new cost base and as we grow revenue side, that\u2019s going to help. And then, the obvious other one that really was affected and has been affected during the pandemic is our Parks business, which normally is a really, really great business. But obviously, during a pandemic when you close, it\u2019s not a good business. It\u2019s going to be choppy, getting open again as things surge and come back and so forth, but it\u2019s hard not to get excited about our Parks business. So, the demand is there. We\u2019re seeing it in Orlando. We have no international travel yet, which is a significant part of the business, and we still are hitting capacity, the capacity we\u2019ve set for ourselves based on safety protocols every day. Just reopened Hollywood and we\u2019re seeing the same thing in Hollywood. Japan is obviously going back and forth, but we\u2019re excited long-term about that park and then Beijing coming. And the other thing that\u2019s happened during the pandemic is we\u2019ve continued to build attraction. So, we are hitting the front of the market with some pretty exciting attractions in each of our parks. We have Nintendo, which we think is one of the great attractions that we\u2019ve ever built in Japan and come in Beijing as well. We have out in Los Angeles, our new pets attraction, we\u2019re getting stellar reviews and people love it. And then, most excitingly to me, we have a new roller coaster in Orlando called the VelociCoaster and Jurassic roller coaster, which I rode a couple of weeks ago. It is both, spectacular and petrifying. And I think when we open that to the public in June, going to be another driver for our business. So, I\u2019m very excited about the Parks business. And it\u2019s the one business that\u2019s going to come back really strongly from the depth of pandemic.\nMike Cavanagh: And maybe -- it\u2019s Mike. I\u2019ll just jump in after the -- and put it all together because I think the ultimate question was what happens with free cash flow over time, what\u2019s our confidence. And I think, as we\u2019ve been saying, pre-COVID for a couple of years, in my tenure, we\u2019ve been investing in -- we love our businesses. We\u2019ve been investing so they stay relevant and strong years into the future. And while free cash flow is always lumpy, as you\u2019re in different periods of time, we\u2019ve been confident that we are going to grow free cash flow in the years ahead on a multiyear basis. COVID got in the way, obviously, of that story, but that\u2019s, as you recall, what we felt pre-COVID, and I continue to feel that way as we sit here now. And as everybody just chimed in, I think we see the light at the end of the tunnel of COVID. And all of the earnings power of our businesses that we felt were there before, COVID, I think these results say that they\u2019re still there and perhaps then some.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nDoug Mitchelson: I guess, maybe there are two quick ones. But Dave, on your side, the new wireless pricing, does that suggest another investment round in wireless, or would you just look at that as consistent with the focus on trying to drive share there? Ultimately, what\u2019s the wireless strategy? And what are you hoping the new pricing levels to accomplish? And Jeff, just path for Peacock monetization with engagement coming in double expectations, my guess is, you haven\u2019t seen much difference relative to your revenue expectations because of limits on advertising. Can you just remind us when does that advertising inventory get opened up to new advertisers? And how will Peacock monetization progress from here? Thank you.\nDave Watson: Doug, this is Dave. I\u2019ll start. So, our wireless strategy has been very consistent also. And the new unlimited plans are an opportunity for us to improve that value proposition still have by the gig. Now introducing unlimited, I don\u2019t -- it\u2019s not going to be a material shift in investment side. There\u2019ll be some, but not material. It\u2019s just a great addition to the portfolio. And this -- we\u2019ve talked about it, it was important for us to accelerate. We think it\u2019s good for broadband. It is helping broadband. We see the results in terms of churn and it\u2019s just a growth engine for us, period. So really happy about the 278,000 lines, the most line additions in a quarter since we launched. It grew revenue 50%, achieved profitability. So, we\u2019re focused across the board in terms of everything that we said we wanted to do. And this is one piece of it. So, focusing on every sales channel, and this is just going to be consistent with our approach. You\u2019ll probably see a bit more packaging with broadband and mobile, but that\u2019s not really different than anything that we\u2019ve been talking about doing. So, it\u2019s off -- it\u2019s early with the unlimited stuff, but it\u2019s -- we\u2019re very encouraged. But, we like our complete suite of products that we have in the marketplace.\nJeff Shell: Doug, this is Jeff. So, let me just take the opportunity with your question to maybe spend a minute or two on Peacock and just provide a little bit more granularity and how we\u2019re doing more broadly than your question. So, first of all, we are very pleased with our steady growth on Peacock, and we\u2019re particularly pleased that we chose this business model, which is an ad-supported AVOD model for the business. It was the right decision to pursue that clearly for our Company. Our revenue in that model is a mix of both, subscription revenue and ad revenue. And if you actually break down what drives the ad revenue in the future, it\u2019s really four things we track. The first thing is sign-ups. I think, Brian mentioned in his opening that we reached 42 million sign-ups. This is up 9 million from last quarter. And we\u2019re very pleased not just with that growth, but with a steady growth in that over time as we\u2019ve added things. The second metric is how many of those people who sign up, use the service on a regular basis. We internally use a metric known as MAAs, which I think others in the industry also use, monthly active accounts, that\u2019s how many households actually use it monthly. It\u2019s either -- to be granular, it\u2019s either somebody who pays a household, pays a great subscription fee or somebody who uses it monthly. And by that basis, roughly a third of our sign-ups are by our metrics MAAs. And that -- put that in the context. That is about a third of where Hulu is today. We\u2019ve only been national for less than a year, Hulu\u2019s been 13 years. So, we\u2019re very pleased with how that\u2019s grown steadily. And MAA is the way we track them actually kind of understate the engagement, because there are many people who use it, but just not enough to be an MAA. If you actually made it quarterly assumption, then we\u2019d be up to another $10 million above that number. So, one of the upsides for us is converting those non-MAA sign-ups to MAAs, which we think we\u2019ll do over time. The third metric is usage, which is very strong, double our projections. And to put that in context, the -- an average Peacock MAA is using Peacock more than an average TV viewer is watching NBC. So, we\u2019re very pleased with that. And then finally, how do we monetize those users and usage is the CPM, which gets to your question. We set out, as you mentioned, in the sponsorship model. So, the vast majority of our revenue coming out was set up by 10 charter advertisers. But, we actually are exceeding the guarantees that we made to those advertisers. So, we are already, even this quarter, selling some of the excess inventory on a spot basis. And we\u2019re achieving CPMs that are equal or in some cases, above what we\u2019re getting on NBC Prime, which is our gold standard. That\u2019s very encouraging. And to answer your question, in Q4 of this year, that\u2019s when the sponsorship deals roll off and we start selling all of our inventory on a spot basis, but we\u2019re in early stages of the upfront right now. So, we\u2019re already starting to talk to advertisers about making upfront commitments that include Peacock. Let me just mention one other thing. All of this success is without most of the programming that we anticipated. We anticipated launching with the Olympics. We have not had -- we have two Olympics in the next seven months. We\u2019re going to do some pretty exciting things on Peacock with our Olympics programming. And then, even though we\u2019re back in production, as Mike mentioned or Brian mentioned on 30 shows right now, most of those have not hit Peacock yet. So, the strength of our original programming that we have planned to launch with is really coming in future quarters. So, very encouraged by Peacock going forward, very steady growth so far, and we\u2019re confident about the future.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBen Swinburne: One on Cable, one on Sky. Maybe for Dave, or Dave and Brian. Thank you for the comments in the prepared remarks on the network. As you know, there\u2019s a lot of focus on symmetric offers, particularly in Washington. And I\u2019m just wondering, from a business point of view, do you think there\u2019s real demand there? And what kind of timeline should we be thinking about in terms of adding that capability or more of that capability to your network? And can you talk a little bit about what that might mean for capital intensity, which I\u2019m sure is what most investors are focused on. And then, for Dana, there\u2019s been an unbelievable amount of kind of tectonic shifts in the European sports landscape just this year. And you mentioned Sky, you have Serie A. Can you just put all this in context, when you look at the Bundesliga deal, what we\u2019re reading about with EPL, Serie A. Is this helpful to Sky hitting its EBITDA targets of doubling over time, or is this a headwind? Can you maybe just -- because these are obviously massive contracts. Could you just talk a little bit about the soccer background? That would be great for all of us. Thank you.\nBrian Roberts: Dave, why don\u2019t you talk a little bit about symmetrical?\nDave Watson: Sure. Hi, Ben. So, this is a focus for us over the next several years. But overall, our approach, our strategy is to continue to enhance broadband completely. And that you want to have the best overall speeds in the marketplace that go from the house of the business, great WiFi coverage within where people are, control streaming, now mobile is part of the overall solution, and making it all seamless. So, it\u2019s the overall experience that we\u2019re focusing on. But, we continue to improve speeds along the way, we got 20 years in a row, we got constant increases in terms of speeds. And we address both, downstream and upstream. Let me put usage in perspective in terms of what we\u2019ve seen pre-pandemic and most certainly through the pandemic where a network met the moment and then some. But putting usage in perspective, upstream is less than a tenth of downstream. And so, name the application, whether it\u2019s video streaming, whether it\u2019s gaming, host of education applications. Our network, I think, really stood up, as Brian talked about earlier. And so, while our competitors are spending heavily to try to catch up to us, we\u2019ve already -- they\u2019re testing, we\u2019re not standing still. We\u2019ve done 2 gigabits of download speed for testing, symmetrical 1 gig. And so, we have an architecture that I think is going to continue to put us in position to do it in an effective and a very efficient, capital-efficient way. So again, not standing still. So, we feel very good about the long-term architecture because of DOCSIS. DOCSIS 3.1 that we have is a very -- is a strong roadmap that we can deliver. And so, right now, as we sit here, we have 1.2 gigabits deployed throughout our entire footprint. We\u2019ve increased the upstream speed. And so, over time, I think we can address symmetrical issues. But in the near term, the midterm, we are in a very good position. And I do not see an incremental need for upgrade in terms of capital. We constantly invest in the network. This is not something that just happened overnight. We invest all the time and we\u2019re making our infrastructure more efficient as we virtualize things like CMTSs, and we\u2019re just taking cost out of how we deliver this, couple that with the great DOCSIS standard. I think, we\u2019re in a pretty good position. So, broadband, commercial and residential is growing. It\u2019s a great business. We\u2019re going to continue to strengthen our lead position. And I think it\u2019s going to continue to be a great return on investment for us. And we decide to accelerate our plans. Our CapEx intensity might be a little bit higher one year versus the other. But, we\u2019re still going to be in the ballpark of what we\u2019ve been doing. And it\u2019s just not going to be uptick by a material amount. So, I feel very good about our position, and I really like our long-term roadmap.\nDana Strong: And Ben, this is Dana. Good morning. And thanks very much for your question. There has certainly been a lot of noise around sport and football in Europe over the past four or six weeks. But if you put it all into context, what I would say is that Sky has had a very good track record of renewing sports rights, and we\u2019re generally feeling good that that track record will continue. With English Premier League at the last renewal, we made a deliberate choice to reduce our investment by 15%, but we still secured an improved set of rights. In Bundesliga, for the upcoming season, we continue to hold all of the rights to the very best games, but we weren\u2019t able to secure a discount to our previous contract. And with Serie A, I think it just demonstrates that we will walk away when we feel the economics don\u2019t work. I think, more importantly and to broaden the periscope a bit, I would underscore that Sky has been on a journey for over 15 years to really expand our value proposition beyond sport. And that\u2019s worked extraordinarily well. And I think it comes through in the performance of the business, the fundamentals are in the right place. Our customers are taking more products and services. Our viewing is up significantly on Sky channels. Our churn is significantly lower. Sky streaming is growing considerably. And the aggregation platform is really working, as Brian mentioned, with two-thirds customers in the UK. So, I think we feel very, very comfortable that the business fundamentals are very well-positioned across all of our markets. We really like the position that we\u2019re in, and we feel confident we can continue to build and grow on these fundamentals. So, I think the core of your question is to remain confident in our ambition to double the EBITDA over the next several years. And I would say, yes, we do remain confident in that ambition. And I would say that\u2019s based on confidence in a range of factors. Strong bounce back that we\u2019re already seeing after the effects of COVID, our ability to continue to use the retail engine to drive the customer base and reduce churn through aggregation, and our strategy for multiservice bundles, a very good disciplined cost focus. The team is executing very well. Secure content supply and then really a diversification of that to our expansion into originals and exclusives has worked very well. And we still see a lot of strength in the UK growth opportunities. So, all of that gives me a lot of confidence to say we\u2019re on track for our ambition of doubling EBITDA over the next several years. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nPhil Cusick: Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess a couple of follow-ups here. Brian, as Ben said, thanks for the detail on broadband, and clearly, it\u2019s not just about speed. It\u2019s interesting that when the market is worried about competition, you guys are raising the bar on yourself for ads. What\u2019s the mix of drivers that you see between strong market growth and share shifting? And then second, on mobile, it looks like you\u2019re hiring a lot of people in that business, probably getting ready for a network build. Can you expand on where that network effort is headed? Thanks.\nBrian Roberts: So, let me start. Dave, why don\u2019t you also feel free to jump in on -- I think Dave gave pretty complete answers on broadband. We do believe that by having the best product, and I think we have that, you\u2019re in the enviable position. And so, we balance constantly looking at new technologies where competitors might be coming over the last, I don\u2019t know, 15 years. We\u2019ve had lots and lots of fiber competition. We\u2019ve had lots of overbuild competition, DSL competition, we\u2019ve added 20 million broadband, it\u2019s an -- over a consistent period of time. And so, I think we know how to compete. We go from market share, and we do that while we\u2019re able to increase the EBITDA and free cash flow from the business. We really focused on the business sector, haven\u2019t talked a lot about that today. They had a great quarter and real momentum as all businesses are reopening. People are rethinking their relationships. And we have the latest, greatest, best technology. And you\u2019ll be hearing a lot, or I think, from our business services unit. In wireless, just to add to all the points Dave made about our focus on mobile, while, yes, we bought some spectrum and we\u2019ll be doing some trials to see how we can offload, and that really will prove to be a cost savings. If we get it right. In dense areas, that whole relationship requires a healthy partnership with a wireless MNO. And in the case of Verizon, we\u2019re really pleased with the partnership restructured it so that we\u2019re able to make these unlimited offerings in a way that continues our profitability March and real value for consumers, and in a way that Verizon is happy that their network is getting used. So, good work to our team that worked hard, and to Verizon\u2019s team who are bringing great offerings to the market with expanding mobile. So, net-net, I think both of those important two products and we now bundle them together, put us in a position to continue to grow and be able to compete with where the world evolves itself.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nCraig Moffett: Yes. Hi. A question for Dave, if I could - -two actually. First, can you talk about how your Cable segment is preparing for federal stimulus? And how you think that -- what impact that\u2019s likely to have on your business? Can you quantify at all what you expect to come from stimulus, including how many essentials customers you have and whether you expect those customers to now generate higher ARPU under the stimulus plan? And then on the wireless business, I just want to drill down on a question that was asked before. With the new pricing, do you think that you can still be EBITDA positive in that business, even with the new pricing, which presumably will mean at least somewhat lower ARPU going forward?\nDave Watson: Thank you, Craig. So, first, on stimulus. There probably will be some non-pay benefit and we -- and there are a couple of different ways that could play out, but our voluntary churn and non-pay churn have been consistently been running low for the past year and been trending lower pre-pandemic. So, our earlier churn performance was regardless of when stimulus checks were received, but could be some -- a little bit of additional support around that. But, I think, you have to look at the longer term trends. Our performance overall reflects what we\u2019ve been talking about. We\u2019re building a great network and improving the products constantly. So, I think, there could be just a little bit of non-pay support, but again, we\u2019re already doing fairly well there. In regards to wireless, I think, in terms of EBITDA, the new pricing, yes. The way that we think about this, it\u2019s a long-term growth opportunity. Certainly, for broadband, we\u2019ve talked about it. But, when you look at the overall marketplace, you feel -- we feel good about that we\u2019re -- we have a little over 3 million lines, less than 2 million customer relationships, mobile relationships out of a pool of 33 million customer relationships. So, low penetration, lots of runway. So, we always -- and take a look at any of our approaches to key categories. We take a very-disciplined approach towards packaging and improving value. And so, yes, we feel very good about unlimited as part of the portfolio and not changing the strategy or materially the results in terms of ARPU and mobile and the impact towards EBITDA. So, overall, again, Brian mentioned it, we really appreciate, and the Verizon relationship, it\u2019s important for us. And I think we\u2019re good for them, very good for them. And it\u2019s -- so it\u2019s a good win-win for us to be able to add this new set of unlimited to already strong portfolio. So, feel good about our ability to continue to drive healthy EBITDA with it.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: A couple of follow-ups for Jeff. Jeff, lots of news in terms of sports rights in the U.S. as well, with you guys adding WWE and the NFL deal and not renewing NHL and the shutdown of the NBC Sports net. So, can you talk about your strategy going forward? And maybe what were some of the drivers of those decisions? And then, also back to Peacock, the big B2C platforms are obviously spending sort of multiples of what Peacock is on content. And what I realize those are fundamentally different services. Should we expect the strategy to evolve over time with potentially further investment to capture growth and engagement, or do you guys think you guys are fully capturing the opportunity at current levels? Thanks.\nJeff Shell: Yes. Thanks, John. Let me take them in order. So first of all, we\u2019re really thrilled to continue our NFL relationship. That was an important one for us. The NFL really kind of encompasses what we want in sports rights. It is obviously very important for our traditional business, number one show in prime time for over a decade and with our Al and Cris, and now Drew Brees and Mike Tirico and our talent, we\u2019re -- that is a very important tent-pole for our existing business. At the same time, as the business evolves and moves to streaming and on demand, that deal also gave us a lot of content that now we can use on Peacock and our other platforms, whether it\u2019s simulcast of games and exclusive games or additional rights to show highlights and other footage. It\u2019s really the perfect deal with the premier sports in the U.S. So, that really is kind of our model. The Olympics is the same thing where we have rights to use content across multiple platforms; same thing with golf, which is an important tent-pole for us. And we\u2019ll continue to be aggressive and look for sports that not only we can get for a price that we think we can get a return on, but also properties where we can drive usage, both linear and digital. And WWE is kind of the perfect one on that, where we were able to take a franchise that was already important to us on USA and our linear networks and extended across in the Peacock in a way that\u2019s been very successful. So, we\u2019re thrilled with our portfolio now. We\u2019ll continue to be opportunistic we find opportunities that match all those things. Turning to Peacock spending. I think, it\u2019s important to recognize that we really have -- and Mark Lazarus has laid this out pretty well. We want to build our television business to match what consumers are doing. Consumers are watching content across a variety of different platforms, not just linear, not just streaming, but lots of different ways. And our spending really should be looked at in that context, not just what we\u2019re discretely spending on Peacock, but what we\u2019re spending across our whole portfolio. And when you look at that, we match up pretty well versus our competitors. And with Peacock, we actually don\u2019t -- as I mentioned earlier, we don\u2019t even have the benefit of most of the spending that we had planned because of the production delays with COVID. So, at the moment, we\u2019re pretty pleased with the content we have on Peacock and the content that\u2019s coming in future days. And as I said before, with the success of Peacock, and I think Brian mentioned this in opening, we have a lot of options going forward, and we\u2019ll continue to watch the way the world changes and how our product evolves, and we\u2019ll evaluate those options.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, John. Regina, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: I was curious if you could share how much of the programming spend within NBCU is exclusive to your platform, whether created by the studio, live sports, news? And where do you see that mix going over the next few years, especially as you look to expand the reach of the Peacock platform? Thanks.\nBrian Roberts: Yes. Thanks. I would say, virtually, all of our programming, the vast majority of our programming is exclusive. The exclusivity of programming is very, very important to us. And it\u2019s not just the traditional exclusivity, whether it\u2019s an S&L or a drama, but it\u2019s the exclusivity of a Rachel Maddow every night on MSNBC or exclusivity of our various sports properties, most notably the Olympics. So, exclusivity is critical when you look at programming, not just in NBC, but across some of the new digital platforms, too. I don\u2019t know if that answers your question, but virtually, all of our programming.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Mike. And I just want to thank all of you for joining us on our first quarter 2021 earnings call. We hope you all continue to stay healthy and safe.\nOperator: There will be a replay available of today\u2019s call starting at 12 o\u2019clock p.m. Eastern Time. It will run through Thursday, May 6th, at midnight Eastern Time. A dial-in number is 855-859-2056, and the conference ID number is 5168008.

            "content": "Hi, Jessica, this is Jeff. And everybody. So, there's a lot of different places I could pick and choose from NBCUniversal, but let me just talk about two points of leverage that I'm excited about. I think, first of all, as we've talked about in previous calls, we really adjusted our cost base across the entire Company during the pandemic. We didn't do this just to cut cost. We obviously looked at where the business was going and changed our organization, particularly on the TV side, but I'm excited about the business being kind of adjusting the new cost base and as we grow revenue side, that's going to help. And then, the obvious other one that really was affected and has been affected during the pandemic is our Parks business, which normally is a really, really great business. But obviously, during a pandemic when you close, it's not a good business. It's going to be choppy, getting open again as things surge and come back and so forth, but it's hard not to get excited about our Parks business. So, the demand is there. We're seeing it in Orlando. We have no international travel yet, which is a significant part of the business, and we still are hitting capacity, the capacity we've set for ourselves based on safety protocols every day. Just reopened Hollywood and we're seeing the same thing in Hollywood. Japan is obviously going back and forth, but we're excited long-term about that park and then Beijing coming. And the other thing that's happened during the pandemic is we've continued to build attraction. So, we are hitting the front of the market with some pretty exciting attractions in each of our parks. We have Nintendo, which we think is one of the great attractions that we've ever built in Japan and come in Beijing as well. We have out in Los Angeles, our new pets attraction, we're getting stellar reviews and people love it. And then, most excitingly to me, we have a new roller coaster in Orlando called the VelociCoaster and Jurassic roller coaster, which I rode a couple of weeks ago. It is both, spectacular and petrifying. And I think when we open that to the public in June, going to be another driver for our business. So, I'm very excited about the Parks business. And it's the one business that's going to come back really strongly from the depth of pandemic. Doug, this is Jeff. So, let me just take the opportunity with your question to maybe spend a minute or two on Peacock and just provide a little bit more granularity and how we're doing more broadly than your question. So, first of all, we are very pleased with our steady growth on Peacock, and we're particularly pleased that we chose this business model, which is an ad-supported AVOD model for the business. It was the right decision to pursue that clearly for our Company. Our revenue in that model is a mix of both, subscription revenue and ad revenue. And if you actually break down what drives the ad revenue in the future, it's really four things we track. The first thing is sign-ups. I think, Brian mentioned in his opening that we reached 42 million sign-ups. This is up 9 million from last quarter. And we're very pleased not just with that growth, but with a steady growth in that over time as we've added things. The second metric is how many of those people who sign up, use the service on a regular basis. We internally use a metric known as MAAs, which I think others in the industry also use, monthly active accounts, that's how many households actually use it monthly. It's either -- to be granular, it's either somebody who pays a household, pays a great subscription fee or somebody who uses it monthly. And by that basis, roughly a third of our sign-ups are by our metrics MAAs. And that -- put that in the context. That is about a third of where Hulu is today. We've only been national for less than a year, Hulu's been 13 years. So, we're very pleased with how that's grown steadily. And MAA is the way we track them actually kind of understate the engagement, because there are many people who use it, but just not enough to be an MAA. If you actually made it quarterly assumption, then we'd be up to another $10 million above that number. So, one of the upsides for us is converting those non-MAA sign-ups to MAAs, which we think we'll do over time. The third metric is usage, which is very strong, double our projections. And to put that in context, the -- an average Peacock MAA is using Peacock more than an average TV viewer is watching NBC. So, we're very pleased with that. And then finally, how do we monetize those users and usage is the CPM, which gets to your question. We set out, as you mentioned, in the sponsorship model. So, the vast majority of our revenue coming out was set up by 10 charter advertisers. But, we actually are exceeding the guarantees that we made to those advertisers. So, we are already, even this quarter, selling some of the excess inventory on a spot basis. And we're achieving CPMs that are equal or in some cases, above what we're getting on NBC Prime, which is our gold standard. That's very encouraging. And to answer your question, in Q4 of this year, that's when the sponsorship deals roll off and we start selling all of our inventory on a spot basis, but we're in early stages of the upfront right now. So, we're already starting to talk to advertisers about making upfront commitments that include Peacock. Let me just mention one other thing. All of this success is without most of the programming that we anticipated. We anticipated launching with the Olympics. We have not had -- we have two Olympics in the next seven months. We're going to do some pretty exciting things on Peacock with our Olympics programming. And then, even though we're back in production, as Mike mentioned or Brian mentioned on 30 shows right now, most of those have not hit Peacock yet. So, the strength of our original programming that we have planned to launch with is really coming in future quarters. So, very encouraged by Peacock going forward, very steady growth so far, and we're confident about the future. Yes. Thanks, John. Let me take them in order. So first of all, we're really thrilled to continue our NFL relationship. That was an important one for us. The NFL really kind of encompasses what we want in sports rights. It is obviously very important for our traditional business, number one show in prime time for over a decade and with our Al and Cris, and now Drew Brees and Mike Tirico and our talent, we're -- that is a very important tent-pole for our existing business.

It's really the perfect deal with the premier sports in the U.S. So, that really is kind of our model. The Olympics is the same thing where we have rights to use content across multiple platforms; same thing with golf, which is an important tent-pole for us. And we'll continue to be aggressive and look for sports that not only we can get for a price that we think we can get a return on, but also properties where we can drive usage, both linear and digital. And WWE is kind of the perfect one on that, where we were able to take a franchise that was already important to us on USA and our linear networks and extended across in the Peacock in a way that's been very successful.

And as I said before, with the success of Peacock, and I think Brian mentioned this in opening, we have a lot of options going forward, and we'll continue to watch the way the world changes and how our product evolves, and we'll evaluate those options."

            "name": "Brian Roberts",
            "content": "Thanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. We certainly got off to a great start this year. Our entire Company performed well, and we once again had particularly strong results at Cable, which posted its third consecutive quarter of double-digit EBITDA growth, ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit net cash flow growth. We added 461, 000 broadband customers, which drove 380,000 customer relationship additions. This is the best first quarter on record. Our connect activity was healthy and broadband churn improved for the 13th quarter in a row, hitting our lowest churn rate in our Company's history. I'm very proud of this quarter's results and our long record of growth, which I believe is a direct result of disciplined investment, fantastic innovation and consistent execution in a highly competitive market. This morning, I'd like to go a bit deeper in two areas, the robustness of our network in the U.S. and more broadly how we positioned ourselves to successfully compete against alternative providers and technologies. We've spent nearly $30 billion in the last decade, building an expansive fiber dense network comprised of 191, 000 route miles that carries an immense amount of traffic has demonstrated extraordinary performance throughout the pandemic. Under Tony Werner, our retiring Chief Technology Officer, we have consistently engineered our network to anticipate change. And during his 15-plus years at Comcast, he has helped transform us into a product and technology innovator and leader. Tony, we thank you. He's being succeeded by Charlie Herrin. Many of you on this call are familiar with Charlie. He helped develop game-changing products, including scaling X1 and most recently led a successful effort to redefine how we interact with customers, which has resulted in significantly higher NPS scores and lower operating costs. Charlie, Dave and I have been fortunate to work together for 20 years. Under Dave and Tony, we've recruited the best engineering talent around the world and now are working as one global tech team to create platforms, apps and experiences that evolve the way people connect and consume entertainment. We've done all this while keeping the network our number one priority. We've introduced the xFi Advanced Gateway, the most powerful of its kind. Our highest users are connecting a wide variety of devices in the home and streaming multiple services simultaneously over WiFi. Our xFi pods integrate with Xfinity Gateways to form a mesh network that maximizes WiFi coverage. All you do is plug one of these pods into an outlet to get great coverage in every room. We provide our customers with what they need, which goes well beyond extraordinary connectivity and speed. Xfinity is the only broadband provider to offer advanced security for monitoring devices inside and soon outside of the home. We also uniquely provide our customers with a whole home speed test and enable parents to manage internet time spent by streaming application. This is all backed by a network that is built to consistently deliver the fastest speeds and outperform well into the future with two major initiatives underway. The first is virtualizing our network by leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning. We're taking functions that were once performed by thousands of large and expensive pieces of hardware and moving them into the cloud, which alone has reduced innovation cycles from years down to just months. We're also automating many of our core network functions so that we can deliver instant capacity as well as identify and fix network issues before they ever affect a customer. Our second priority is further enhancing how we deliver our broadband product over our network. We currently offer downstream speeds of 1. 2 gigs across our entire footprint using our DOCSIS 3.1 architecture, and can increase upstream in a capital-efficient way. We're making great progress to deliver multi-gig symmetrical speeds. And in the last six months, we completed two important milestones on our roadmap. In October, we conducted a successful live test of 1. 25 gig symmetrical speeds. And earlier this month, our engineers completed the first ever live lab test of DOCSIS 4.0, which establishes a foundation for us to deliver multi-gigabit speeds over our existing network without the need for massive digging and construction projects. Let me next talk about Xfinity Mobile, where we're having great success. This past quarter, we reached breakeven on a standalone basis for the first time and added 278,000 mobile lines, the highest quarterly addition since launch. We just announced a new unlimited family plan, which can provide $600 in annual savings relative to other competitor family plans. Now, let's turn to Sky, which despite renewed lockdowns in Europe, generated revenue growth and delivered the best first quarter customer relationships net addition in six years. I am particularly encouraged by our strong performance in the UK. Excluding pubs and clubs, which remain closed, UK direct-to-consumer revenue grew 8% over the first quarter 2020, and 11% relative to 2019. Churn continued to trend down. Two-thirds of our customer base in the UK now have Sky Q, we're seeing great acceleration in mobile, and we just launched Sky Connect, our B2B broadband service that leverages the expertise of Comcast Cable. Dana Strong is off to a great start and is syncing up more than ever with Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal, so that together, we're all innovating more quickly, better serving our customers and viewers and increasing operating efficiencies. We're also encouraged by the trends we're seeing across NBCU. Our Parks segment broke even, excluding Beijing, for the second consecutive quarter driven by remarkable attendance at Universal Orlando. We can see firsthand pent-up demand for high-quality entertainment and family fun outside of the home, and we remain incredibly bullish on the Parks business. While Osaka recently had to close temporarily, Universal Studios Hollywood reopened on April 16th, the first time since the pandemic started. Our long-term excitement stems from the fact that we have a fabulous roadmap of new attractions and experiences awaiting guests as they safely return to our current parks. In NBCUniversal's Media segment under Jeff Shell and Mark Lazarus, we're starting to see the benefits of our new operating structure. Excluding Peacock, adjusted EBITDA increased 10% year-over-year. Our news content continues to experience tremendous momentum and distribution revenue is trending above expectations, a testament to the strength of our linear brands. We're back in business on the studio side with more than 30 television series currently in production and we're excited for our first big theatrical debut with Fast 9, launching in both the U.S. and China later in the second quarter. We're also making great progress with Peacock, our premium ad-supported streaming service. Just one year post launch, we have 42 million sign-ups. Monthly users of the service are consuming nearly 20% more programming hours each month than our traditional audience on NBC. And we just crossed 1 billion total hours watched, nearly double our plan when we launched. This strength in users and engagement has enabled us to create additional advertising inventory outside of our initial partnership, with CPMs at a material premium to linear prime time. Key to Peacock's domestic success has been Xfinity with X1 and Flex driving subscriber acquisitions and healthy engagement. With Peacock, we've created great options for ourselves with several opportunities on the horizon. We've recently secured more original programming with creative partners like WWE and the NFL, providing a strong path to upsell into Peacock premium. And as Peacock gained scale in the U.S., we see compelling ways we can expand internationally. We're looking to take advantage of the brand and scales of Sky across our European markets and potentially strike partnerships with local programmers and distributors in geographies where it makes sense. We plan to share more information on Peacock throughout this year. So, in summary, we're all very proud and encouraged by our first quarter results. This performance is a testament to the resilience and evolution of our Company. Excellent execution of our growth initiatives combined with tight cost control brings us one step closer to our balance sheet goals, and I am eager to see us return to our historical practice of repurchasing shares starting in the second half of this year. Lastly, I want to thank our team. Everyone across the Company has continued to show up and innovate for our customers, audience, guests and each other. We were recently named as one of the top 5 big companies to work for in the U.S. and one of the top 10 inclusive companies in the UK, a testament to the work and passion of our wonderful employees. Mike, over to you. Well, thank you, Jessica, for those comments. Why don't we just go around the horn and why don't we just go from Dave to Dana to Jeff, and everybody give a crack at their view of the business and a chance for them to introduce themselves on the call here. Dave, why don't you talk a little bit about symmetrical? So, let me start. Dave, why don't you also feel free to jump in on -- I think Dave gave pretty complete answers on broadband. We do believe that by having the best product, and I think we have that, you're in the enviable position. And so, we balance constantly looking at new technologies where competitors might be coming over the last, I don't know, 15 years. We've had lots and lots of fiber competition. We've had lots of overbuild competition, DSL competition, we've added 20 million broadband, it's an -- over a consistent period of time. And so, I think we know how to compete. We go from market share, and we do that while we're able to increase the EBITDA and free cash flow from the business. We really focused on the business sector, haven't talked a lot about that today. They had a great quarter and real momentum as all businesses are reopening. People are rethinking their relationships. And we have the latest, greatest, best technology. And you'll be hearing a lot, or I think, from our business services unit. In wireless, just to add to all the points Dave made about our focus on mobile, while, yes, we bought some spectrum and we'll be doing some trials to see how we can offload, and that really will prove to be a cost savings. If we get it right. In dense areas, that whole relationship requires a healthy partnership with a wireless MNO. And in the case of Verizon, we're really pleased with the partnership restructured it so that we're able to make these unlimited offerings in a way that continues our profitability March and real value for consumers, and in a way that Verizon is happy that their network is getting used. So, good work to our team that worked hard, and to Verizon's team who are bringing great offerings to the market with expanding mobile. So, net-net, I think both of those important two products and we now bundle them together, put us in a position to continue to grow and be able to compete with where the world evolves itself. Yes. Thanks. I would say, virtually, all of our programming, the vast majority of our programming is exclusive. The exclusivity of programming is very, very important to us. And it's not just the traditional exclusivity, whether it's an S&L or a drama, but it's the exclusivity of a Rachel Maddow every night on MSNBC or exclusivity of our various sports properties, most notably the Olympics. So, exclusivity is critical when you look at programming, not just in NBC, but across some of the new digital platforms, too. I don't know if that answers your question, but virtually, all of our programming."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Dana Strong",
            "content": "Thanks, Jessica. This is Dana, following up from Dave's side. From the Sky angle, we're really, really happy with the fundamentals of the business. I think Q1 -- our Q1 results demonstrate the position that we're in, subscriber numbers up, that's in fact, quarter one in about six years, churn is down, revenue is up. All of the fundamental factors of the business position us well to exit COVID. To be more specific on your question in regards to where do we see the most leverage, if I had to boil it down, I would say, the UK, the UK is an extraordinary position for growth. We got a very diverse revenue base with DTH having its best performance in Q1 in six years, streaming is going well, mobile is going very well, broadband is growing well with a lot of innovation potential. And so, I think what we see in the UK is a lot of growth left in that business and a really solid business to build upon in the rest of the portfolio. And Ben, this is Dana. Good morning. And thanks very much for your question. There has certainly been a lot of noise around sport and football in Europe over the past four or six weeks. But if you put it all into context, what I would say is that Sky has had a very good track record of renewing sports rights, and we're generally feeling good that that track record will continue. With English Premier League at the last renewal, we made a deliberate choice to reduce our investment by 15%, but we still secured an improved set of rights. In Bundesliga, for the upcoming season, we continue to hold all of the rights to the very best games, but we weren't able to secure a discount to our previous contract. And with Serie A, I think it just demonstrates that we will walk away when we feel the economics don't work. I think, more importantly and to broaden the periscope a bit, I would underscore that Sky has been on a journey for over 15 years to really expand our value proposition beyond sport. And that's worked extraordinarily well. And I think it comes through in the performance of the business, the fundamentals are in the right place. Our customers are taking more products and services. Our viewing is up significantly on Sky channels. Our churn is significantly lower. Sky streaming is growing considerably. And the aggregation platform is really working, as Brian mentioned, with two-thirds customers in the UK. So, I think we feel very, very comfortable that the business fundamentals are very well-positioned across all of our markets. We really like the position that we're in, and we feel confident we can continue to build and grow on these fundamentals. So, I think the core of your question is to remain confident in our ambition to double the EBITDA over the next several years. And I would say, yes, we do remain confident in that ambition. And I would say that's based on confidence in a range of factors. Strong bounce back that we're already seeing after the effects of COVID, our ability to continue to use the retail engine to drive the customer base and reduce churn through aggregation, and our strategy for multiservice bundles, a very good disciplined cost focus. The team is executing very well. Secure content supply and then really a diversification of that to our expansion into originals and exclusives has worked very well. And we still see a lot of strength in the UK growth opportunities. So, all of that gives me a lot of confidence to say we're on track for our ambition of doubling EBITDA over the next several years. Thanks."

            "name": "Mike Cavanagh",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on slide 4 with our first quarter consolidated 2021 results. Revenue increased 2.2% to $27.2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 3.5% to $8.4 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 7% to $0.76 per share. And finally, we generated $5.3 billion of free cash flow. Now, let's turn to our business segment results starting with Cable Communications on slide 5. Cable revenue increased 5.9% to $15.8 billion. EBITDA increased 12% to $6.8 billion and EBITDA less capital grew 16% to $5.1 billion. We added 380,000 net new customer relationships, up 2.4% over last year's first quarter and up 27% over the first quarter of 2019. This was the best first quarter on record and was driven by broadband, where we added 461,000 net new residential and business customers, only slightly below last year's first quarter and 23% above the first quarter of 2019. We saw healthy connect activity, and this quarter marked the lowest broadband churn in our history. This positive momentum has continued into the second quarter. And from what we see today, we anticipate total broadband additions for the year to grow by mid-single-digit levels compared to 2019, which, aside from the extraordinary growth we had in an unusual 2020 was the best year in more than a decade. The strong customer additions, coupled with ARPU growth of 4.4%, drove a 12% increase in broadband revenue for the first quarter, the largest driver of overall cable revenue, and we expect this trend will continue. We also saw an acceleration in both, business and wireless. Business services revenue increased 6.1% and delivered 11,000 net new customer additions, primarily driven by continued improvement in small business. Wireless revenue grew 50% and due to an increase in both customer lines and higher device sales. We added 278,000 net new lines in the quarter, the best results since launching this business in 2017, bringing us to 3.1 million total lines as of quarter end. Turning to video. Revenue was consistent with the prior year, reflecting very healthy ARPU growth of 6.8% offset by net video subscriber losses totaling 491,000, which we felt mostly on the connect side as residential churn improved year-over-year. We believe our residential rate adjustment at the beginning of the year was a significant contributor to both the ARPU increase and the video subscriber loss in the quarter, and we expect video losses in the second quarter will remain elevated. We currently anticipate Cable Communications revenue growth in the second quarter to accelerate by a few hundred basis points from the 5.9% we just reported, partly due to the comparison to last year's second quarter, which was most significantly impacted by COVID-19, as well as our focus on driving growth in our connectivity businesses. Turning to expenses. Cable Communications first quarter expenses increased 1.5%. Programming expenses were up 5.5%, primarily due to the number of contract renewals that started to cycle through in 2020, combined with annual escalators in existing agreements. Looking to the second quarter, we expect programming expense growth to increase at low double-digit levels due to the continued impact of contract renewals as well as the comparison to last year's second quarter, which was favorably impacted by adjustments accrued for customer RSN fees. For the full year, we continue to expect programming expense to increase at high single-digit levels. Non-programming expenses declined 1.1% on an absolute basis, and 5.9% on a per relationship basis, while our customer relationships grew 5% year-over-year. Non-programming expenses should increase at high single-digit rate in the second quarter due in part to the comparison to last year, which reflected the slowdown in business activity due to COVID-19, as well as our continued focus on driving growth in our core broadband and wireless businesses. Cable Communications EBITDA grew by 12%, with margins reaching 43.2%, reflecting 250 basis points of year-over-year improvement. These results include the important milestone of our wireless business reaching breakeven for the first time since launch. Cable capital expenditures increased 8%, resulting in CapEx intensity of 8.7%, up slightly compared to last year and driven by a 23% increase in scalable infrastructure as we continue to invest to enhance the capacity of our network. This spending was partially offset by lower customer premise equipment and support. Now, let's turn to slide 6 for NBCUniversal. As you know, we recently issued an 8-K with updated trending schedules and a new reporting format that reflects the way the business is now managed. We moved Peacock, which was previously reported in our corporate results to NBCUniversal. And now we present NBCU in three business segments: Media, which combines our TV businesses and Peacock; Studios, which combines our film and television studio businesses; and Theme Parks. I will discuss today's results in this new format. Let's start with total NBCUniversal results. Revenue decreased 9.1% to $7 billion and EBITDA was down 12% to $1.5 billion. Media revenue increased 3.2%, driven by 9.1% growth in distribution revenue, which reflected higher rates post the successful completion of several carriage renewals at the end of 2020, partially offset by subscriber declines, which showed sequential improvement. Advertising revenue declined 3.4% as lower entertainment ratings and tough political comps were partially offset by more sports in the quarter, strength in news and the launch of Peacock. Media EBITDA declined 3.7% when including Peacock, which generated revenue of $91 million and an EBITDA loss of $277 million. Excluding Peacock, media EBITDA increased 10%, primarily driven by lower expenses, which was partly due to lower entertainment costs associated with fewer original hours aired and partly due to our new operating model. This year-over-year reduction more than offset higher sports cost, resulting from additional events. Looking to the second quarter, we expect healthy growth in distribution revenue to continue. We will have significantly more sporting events compared to last year, which should result in higher advertising revenue, but also a significant increase in sports-related programming and production costs. Studio revenue was flat compared to last year, primarily reflecting higher content licensing revenue, offset by lower theatrical revenue. Content licensing revenue increased 14%, primarily due to licensing deals, including the office, which became exclusively available for streaming on Peacock this past January. Theatrical revenue decreased 88%, reflecting the deferral of theatrical releases due to COVID-19. Significantly fewer releases in the first quarter resulted in lower expenses, driving EBITDA growth of 66%. We're excited to be releasing Fast 9 in theaters later in the second quarter, but we delayed the release of Minions 2 from July of this year to July of 2022, which will shift the profits from 2021 to 2022 as well as we continue to manage our film fleet to maximize value. Theme Parks revenue decreased 33.1% in the quarter and generated an EBITDA loss of $61 million, which included $100 million of Universal Beijing preopening costs. These results reflect Universal Orlando Resort operating at limited capacity, but trends remain encouraging as attendance continues to rebound, and we've been at or near capacity limits through spring break. Hollywood remained closed during the quarter, but we recently opened at a 25% capacity limit and expect this to move higher by June 15th. In Japan, we recently had to close our park temporarily due to rising COVID cases, but prior to this, we had seen strong demand. Looking ahead, we expect our EBITDA results to improve in the back half of the year as domestic attendance trends improve, and we remain on track to open our new park, Universal Beijing this summer. Now, let's turn to slide 7 for Sky, which I will speak to on a constant currency basis. For the first quarter, Sky revenue increased 2% to $5 billion, largely reflecting healthy growth in our UK business. Direct-to-consumer revenue increased 1.8% with growth in the UK even stronger. This result was driven by higher average rates per customer and strong customer growth across all markets. We generated 221,000 net customer additions the best first quarter in six years, driven by streaming across our markets as well as steady momentum in mobile and broadband within the UK. Advertising revenue increased 3.4% as we continue to outperform the market, particularly in the UK, where the ad market is rebounding more quickly than we expected, and we are driving growth through advanced advertising. Sky generated $364 million in EBITDA in the first quarter. As expected, this reflects elevated expenses, including higher sports rights amortization, resulting from more events in the current quarter as well as higher expenses associated with successfully growing our mobile and broadband businesses and investment in key growth initiatives, which now include Sky Connect, our recently launched commercial broadband business in the UK. For the second quarter, we expect revenue growth to accelerate to low double-digit levels on a constant currency basis due to the comparison to last year's second quarter, which was the most impacted by COVID-19 as well as continued strength in our UK business. We also anticipate significantly higher Sports rights amortization compared to last year when events were paused. As a result, we expect to generate a similar level of EBITDA in the second quarter as we did in the first quarter. We were recently outbid for some of the broadcast rights for Serie A in Italy as we stood firm and our disciplined approach to sports-related costs. We believe this was the right long-term financial decision, but we expect a reduction in programming and production expenses and a potential decline in customer relationships in Italy as a result. We continue to expect Sky EBITDA in the second half of this year to accelerate from first half levels, reflecting the benefits of a reset to major sports rights as well as a more efficient operating structure. I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on slide 8. Free cash flow was $5.3 billion in the quarter, an increase of roughly 60% year-over-year, primarily due to an improvement in net working capital and higher EBITDA. Net working capital will continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis, and we still expect the full year drag increase relative to 2019 due to an increase in content investments, our broadcast of the Olympics and the reversal of COVID-related onetime tax deferrals. Consolidated total capital, which includes capital expenditures as well as software and intangibles, decreased 1.1% in the first quarter to $2.5 billion, reflecting a decline at NBCU, which was partially offset by increases at Sky and Cable. We ended the first quarter with $104 billion of debt with a weighted average cost of 3.6% and a weighted average life of 14. 5 years and net debt of $86 billion for a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.7 times. Throughout the pandemic, we have maintained an elevated cash balance to fortify our liquidity position, and we ended the first quarter with $15 billion of cash and cash equivalents. We expect to gradually reduce our cash position by deploying excess cash towards debt reduction throughout the remainder of the year as our business operations continue to recover. Finally, we remain committed to our longstanding balanced approach to capital allocation, which consists of maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing organically for profitable growth and returning capital to shareholders for a strong commitment to our recurring dividends and our expected return to share repurchases in the second half of this year. Thanks for joining us on the call this morning. I'll turn it back to Marci, who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call. And maybe -- it's Mike. I'll just jump in after the -- and put it all together because I think the ultimate question was what happens with free cash flow over time, what's our confidence. And I think, as we've been saying, pre-COVID for a couple of years, in my tenure, we've been investing in -- we love our businesses. We've been investing so they stay relevant and strong years into the future. And while free cash flow is always lumpy, as you're in different periods of time, we've been confident that we are going to grow free cash flow in the years ahead on a multiyear basis. COVID got in the way, obviously, of that story, but that's, as you recall, what we felt pre-COVID, and I continue to feel that way as we sit here now. And as everybody just chimed in, I think we see the light at the end of the tunnel of COVID. And all of the earnings power of our businesses that we felt were there before, COVID, I think these results say that they're still there and perhaps then some."

            "name": "Dave Watson",
            "content": "Thank you, Jessica. This is Dave. Start with -- our focus continues to be maintaining momentum around the connectivity side of the business. So, broadband, residential, commercial is enormously important and a great growth engine for us. So, we're going to continue to enhance broadband, keep adding to it, speed, control coverage and now streaming, and as you mentioned, mobile. So, we're going to focus on accelerating mobile and just surrounding broadband with these products. So, that's going to be -- that's our strategy, nothing will shake that. And in terms of EBITDA that we are -- we like our -- the recurring revenue aspect of the connectivity business. We like the margins that, that contributes towards. We're very focused on taking out the transactions that cause customer noise. And so, focusing on digital, focusing on things like self-install kits, those -- all the things that we've been talking about will continue. So, I feel very good about our position in the marketplace. So, there's a lot of upside still in broadband, feel good about mobile and business services. Doug, this is Dave. I'll start. So, our wireless strategy has been very consistent also. And the new unlimited plans are an opportunity for us to improve that value proposition still have by the gig. Now introducing unlimited, I don't -- it's not going to be a material shift in investment side. There'll be some, but not material. It's just a great addition to the portfolio. And this -- we've talked about it, it was important for us to accelerate. We think it's good for broadband. It is helping broadband. We see the results in terms of churn and it's just a growth engine for us, period. So really happy about the 278,000 lines, the most line additions in a quarter since we launched. It grew revenue 50%, achieved profitability. So, we're focused across the board in terms of everything that we said we wanted to do. And this is one piece of it. So, focusing on every sales channel, and this is just going to be consistent with our approach. You'll probably see a bit more packaging with broadband and mobile, but that's not really different than anything that we've been talking about doing. So, it's off -- it's early with the unlimited stuff, but it's -- we're very encouraged. But, we like our complete suite of products that we have in the marketplace. Sure. Hi, Ben. So, this is a focus for us over the next several years. But overall, our approach, our strategy is to continue to enhance broadband completely. And that you want to have the best overall speeds in the marketplace that go from the house of the business, great WiFi coverage within where people are, control streaming, now mobile is part of the overall solution, and making it all seamless. So, it's the overall experience that we're focusing on. But, we continue to improve speeds along the way, we got 20 years in a row, we got constant increases in terms of speeds. And we address both, downstream and upstream. Let me put usage in perspective in terms of what we've seen pre-pandemic and most certainly through the pandemic where a network met the moment and then some. But putting usage in perspective, upstream is less than a tenth of downstream. And so, name the application, whether it's video streaming, whether it's gaming, host of education applications. Our network, I think, really stood up, as Brian talked about earlier. And so, while our competitors are spending heavily to try to catch up to us, we've already -- they're testing, we're not standing still. We've done 2 gigabits of download speed for testing, symmetrical 1 gig. And so, we have an architecture that I think is going to continue to put us in position to do it in an effective and a very efficient, capital-efficient way. So again, not standing still. So, we feel very good about the long-term architecture because of DOCSIS. DOCSIS 3.1 that we have is a very -- is a strong roadmap that we can deliver. And so, right now, as we sit here, we have 1.2 gigabits deployed throughout our entire footprint. We've increased the upstream speed. And so, over time, I think we can address symmetrical issues. But in the near term, the midterm, we are in a very good position. And I do not see an incremental need for upgrade in terms of capital. We constantly invest in the network. This is not something that just happened overnight. We invest all the time and we're making our infrastructure more efficient as we virtualize things like CMTSs, and we're just taking cost out of how we deliver this, couple that with the great DOCSIS standard. I think, we're in a pretty good position. So, broadband, commercial and residential is growing. It's a great business. We're going to continue to strengthen our lead position. And I think it's going to continue to be a great return on investment for us. And we decide to accelerate our plans. Our CapEx intensity might be a little bit higher one year versus the other. But, we're still going to be in the ballpark of what we've been doing. And it's just not going to be uptick by a material amount. So, I feel very good about our position, and I really like our long-term roadmap. Thank you, Craig. So, first, on stimulus. There probably will be some non-pay benefit and we -- and there are a couple of different ways that could play out, but our voluntary churn and non-pay churn have been consistently been running low for the past year and been trending lower pre-pandemic. So, our earlier churn performance was regardless of when stimulus checks were received, but could be some -- a little bit of additional support around that. But, I think, you have to look at the longer term trends. Our performance overall reflects what we've been talking about. We're building a great network and improving the products constantly. So, I think, there could be just a little bit of non-pay support, but again, we're already doing fairly well there. In regards to wireless, I think, in terms of EBITDA, the new pricing, yes. The way that we think about this, it's a long-term growth opportunity. Certainly, for broadband, we've talked about it. But, when you look at the overall marketplace, you feel -- we feel good about that we're -- we have a little over 3 million lines, less than 2 million customer relationships, mobile relationships out of a pool of 33 million customer relationships. So, low penetration, lots of runway. So, we always -- and take a look at any of our approaches to key categories. We take a very-disciplined approach towards packaging and improving value. And so, yes, we feel very good about unlimited as part of the portfolio and not changing the strategy or materially the results in terms of ARPU and mobile and the impact towards EBITDA. So, overall, again, Brian mentioned it, we really appreciate, and the Verizon relationship, it's important for us. And I think we're good for them, very good for them. And it's -- so it's a good win-win for us to be able to add this new set of unlimited to already strong portfolio. So, feel good about our ability to continue to drive healthy EBITDA with it."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Comcast's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded.  I will now turn the call over to Executive Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.\nMarci Ryvicker : Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone. On this morning's call are Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh and Jason Armstrong, who are also joined by Dave Watson, Jeff Shell and Dana Strong, Brian and Mike will make formal remarks, while Dave, Jeff and Dana will also be available for Q&A. Let me now refer you to Slide 2, which contains our safe harbor disclaimer and remind you that this conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our 8-K and trending schedules for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.  With that, let me turn the call over to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?\nBrian Roberts: Thanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. I'm really proud of how our team executed throughout 2022. We achieved the highest levels of revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS in our company's history. And we returned a record $17.7 billion of capital to shareholders through both our recurring dividend, which we just increased for the 15th consecutive year and robust share repurchase activity. We did all this while accelerating investment in key growth initiatives, which are showing great progress, particularly our broadband network as we transition to 10G but also in Xfinity Mobile, Peacock and our theme parks. I attribute all this success to the incredible talent across our organization, who work collaboratively to ensure we are constantly evolving and innovating so that our customers have the absolute best experience with us at every point of interaction. What also sets us apart is our very strong balance sheet, which, when combined with the cost actions we have taken this past quarter, position us to perform well no matter what the macro environment might bring. I want to start with cable, where our financial performance both for the year and the fourth quarter confirm that we are striking the right balance between rate and volume in residential broadband, and we plan to continue to do so in 2023. At Xfinity Mobile and Comcast business remain strong growth drivers and we have successfully identified the appropriate mix between cutting costs to drive efficiencies and investing for our future. We have always maintained an intense focus on providing the absolute best products and experiences, which comes down to having the highest capacity, most reliable and most efficient broadband network. Our evolution to 10G and the unique way we are pursuing this through DOCSIS 4.0 is a huge benefit for our customers across the entire footprint that they will all have access to an entire ecosystem built around multi-gigabit symmetrical speeds, some as early as this year. It's also great for the company investors as our transition to a virtual software-based network infused with the marvelous AI capabilities will not only provide tangible benefits when it comes to operating and capital expenses, but it will enable us to innovate faster than ever before, solidifying our leadership position in broadband, which is extremely important given what is certain to be continued increases in demand for both speed and usage. In fact, we continue to see signs of this today. Our residential broadband-only customers are now consuming nearly 700 gigabytes of data every month, and customers on our Gigabit Plus products now comprise one-third of our broadband subscribers.  In addition to creating more value from our current customer base and further penetrating the total homes and businesses that we pass today, another great opportunity is for us to extend our networks to homes and businesses in the U.S. that do not have the ability to receive our services. To that end, we increased our passings by 1.4% or $840,000 in 2022, and we expect to accelerate in 2023, where we are aiming to add around 1 million while still maintaining the same CapEx intensity level we achieved in 2022, reaching nearly 62.5 million by the end of the year. We are taking a disciplined approach, and we'll only pursue those areas that have a return profile similar to what we have been able to historically achieve. Wireless is playing an integral part of our overall strategy at cable, and it's an area where we continue to shine. This past quarter was another record in net line additions, bringing us to over 5 million total lines in just five years. Only 9% penetration of our current base of residential broadband customers, we have plenty of runway ahead, and we're just getting started in offering wireless to our commercial segment, which is another great example of how we are selling more products into our existing base of business customers. When you combine our broadband network, WiFi overlay and MVNO with Verizon, we are in the best position to win in convergence. We have a leg up on our competitors with a capital-light strategy that does not involve customer or network trade-offs. At NBCUniversal, we are seeing some great momentum in Peacock and parks. And across all of NBCUniversal, our intellectual property is really resonating. We had the number 2 studio in terms of worldwide box office in 2022, fueled by a strong slate, including Jurassic, Minions, Nope, Ticket to Paradise, Puss in Boots, Black Bone, Halloween, which have also had great carryover success to Peacock through our Pay-One window and select day and date releases. And our box office momentum continued into the first quarter with M3GAN, so all in all, a really strong film slate. Peacock ended the year with over 20 million paying subscribers, more than double where we started. And we added over 5 million paid subscribers in the fourth quarter alone. Our success was broad-based, fueled by some of the films I just mentioned but also sporting events like the World Cup, NFL, Premier League, several new originals and our exclusive next-day broadcast of NBC. Looking ahead, and based on our experience to date, we expect our subscriber cadence will follow our content launches, which will fall more in the second half of 23. And we continue to see positive trends in engagement, churn and ARPU.  Mark Woodburry had a fabulous first year as our CEO of the Parks business, and we hit a number of new records this past quarter. It was the highest fourth quarter EBITDA for the entire segment, led by Orlando and Hollywood, and Japan had the best EBITDA performance since 2019. This was driven by attendance that for us surpassed pre pandemic levels at all three parks.  While attendance at our Park in Beijing was significantly impacted by COVID in 2022, we are seeing some exciting demand to start the year. Given the excellent returns we have generated to-date, we continue to seek ways to expand our parks. I'm really excited about our two recently announced extensions. First universal park designed specifically for younger audiences near Dallas, and the first year around horror entertainment experience in Las Vegas.  These are new innovative ways to utilize our substantial IP, including from DreamWorks and Illumination, while also extending our brand, both of which had helped fuel growth in all of our parks.  Our linear video business, we are managing subscriber declines by taking a disciplined approach to our cost base. We are continuing to invest in our global technology platform, and you will see a number of announcements from us in the weeks and months ahead.  For example, in 2023, we will launch one global user interface for Sky Glass, Xfinity, X1, Flex, XUMO, at our U.S. and International partners. Every entertainment customer around the world will get the same Emmy award winning voice controlled experience.  This scale not only brings us operational efficiencies, but it also puts us in the enviable position when it comes to conversations with distributors, OEMs, programmers, app developers and talent. At Sky, we are managing through the macro economic challenges in Europe. While staying intensely focused on retention and continuing to provide our customers with the best entertainment and connectivity experiences.  We're seeing some encouraging results. In the UK, Sky Glass had the top selling UHD TV model. Sky mobile is the fastest growing mobile provider, surpassing three million lines. And we are narrowing the gap between us and the current number one broadband provider with Sky Broadband, now sitting at over 6.5 million subscribers.  Wrapping up, our consistently strong financial performance, healthy balance sheet, record high return of capital of shareholders underscore how the scale capabilities and talent across our company enable us to successfully execute our long term growth strategy. I'm convinced we are on the right path and that we have the right team to capture our many opportunities and overcome whatever challenges happen along the way.  So before handing over the call, I want to congratulate Jason Armstrong, recently promoted to Chief Financial Officer, succeeding Mike Cavanagh. Could not be more confident and the leadership team's ability to continue to drive us forward and create more value for our shareholders.  Mike, over to you. \nMike Cavanagh: Thanks, Brian. And good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to just say that it's been a pleasure serving as CFO of Comcast for the last seven plus years. And I couldn't be prouder to have Jason be my successor. Knowing that with Jason, the financial leadership of our company is in proven and expert hands.  Since Jason didn't take over as CFO until early in the new year, I will handle the CFO portion of this call and hand it over to Jason for the first quarter call in April.  So now I'll begin on Slides four and five to discuss our consolidated 2022 financial results. Revenue increased just under 1% to $30.6 billion for the fourth quarter and 4.3% to $121.4 billion for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 4.9% to $8 billion for the fourth quarter, and increased 5% to $36.5 billion for the full year.  The quarterly results include severance expenses booked in each of our businesses, totaling $638 million, which is $541 million higher than the prior year period. Including this increase, adjusted EBITDA increased 1.5% in the fourth quarter, and 6.6% for the full year.  Adjusted EPS increased 6.5% to $0.82 of share for the fourth quarter and 13% to $3.64 for the full year. And we generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow for the fourth quarter and $12.6 billion for the full year, while absorbing increased investments in Peacock and theme parks, as well as higher working capital as content creation normalizes post COVID. Now let's turn to our business segment results starting with Cable Communications on Slide six. Cable revenue increased 1.4% to $16.6 billion, EBITDA increased 1.5% to $7.2 billion and cable EBITDA margins improved 10 basis points year-over-year to 43.5%. These results include $345 million of severance expense, which is $305 million higher compared to last year's fourth quarter, excluding severance cable EBITDA increased 5.8% and cable EBITDA margin improved by 190 basis points to a record high of 45.3%.  These strong results also included the impact of Hurricane Ian in Southwest Florida, which resulted in the loss or severe damage to many homes we serve in this market. Excluding the hurricane impacts, we would have added approximately 4000 broadband customers versus the 26,000 loss we reported. And we estimate that we would have lost approximately 36,000 customer relationships versus the 71,000 we reported.  Overall, our broadband customer results in the fourth quarter were fairly consistent with the prior two quarters, reflecting lower levels of new customer connections, offset by churn which remained well below 2019 levels.  Now let's discuss cable financials in more detail. Cable revenue growth of 1.4% was driven by higher broadband wireless business services and advertising revenue, partially offset by lower video and voice revenue. Broadband revenue increased 5.4% driven by growth in ARPU and in our customer base when compared to last year. Broadband ARPU increased 3.8% year-over-year, when adjusting for some COVID related customer credits last year. This organic ARPU growth is similar to the growth we've generated over the last couple of quarters and is consistent with our strategy.  We are focused on optimizing our customer relationships by consistently adding more capabilities, services and value, so as to provide the best broadband experience, which has and should continue to deliver broadband ARPU growth. The elements of growth this quarter include increased rate, attaching more customers to higher tiers, as well as other services. We expect ARPU growth will continue to be the primary driver of our residential broadband revenue growth in 2023.  Wireless revenue increased 25%, mainly driven by service revenue, which was fueled by growth in customer lines. We added 1.3 million lines in 2022, including 365,000 lines in the fourth quarter, which is our highest number of net additions for any quarter on record. Business Services revenue increased 4.6%, which includes the results of Masergy in both this quarter and in the prior year period, as we lap the closing of this acquisition at the beginning of the quarter.  Revenue growth was primarily driven by rate, including customers taking faster data speeds, higher attach rates of our advanced products, and rate increases on some of our services.  Advertising revenue increased 9.1% driven by strong political revenue, partially offset by the absence of advertising revenue that is now part of XUMO, our joint venture with Charter. Adjusting for those items, cable advertising revenue decreased 1.6%, reflecting decline in our local core advertising business, partially offset by solid growth at our advanced advertising business.  Video revenue declined 5.6% driven by year-over-year customer net losses, partially offset by ARPU growth of 5.8%, due to a residential rate increase we implemented at the beginning of 2022. And last, voice revenue declined 13% primarily reflecting year-over-year customer losses.  Turning to expenses. Cable Communications fourth quarter expenses increased 1.4%, reflecting higher non-programming expenses, which included the $305 million in higher severance costs, partially offset by lower programming expenses. Programming expenses decreased 5.9%, reflecting the year-over-year decline in video customers partially offset by higher contractual rates. Non-programming expenses, which again include $305 million and higher severance costs, increased 5.6%.  Excluding severance, these expenses were flat compared to last year, reflecting an increase in bad debt as we return to more normalized pre pandemic levels an increased technical and product support expenses driven by growth in our wireless business. These were offset by a decline in marketing and promotion and customer service expenses due to lower activity levels, efficiencies in running the business, and improvements we continue to make in our customer experience.  Our focus on growing our high margin connectivity businesses, coupled with our focus on increasing operating efficiency and cost controls, drove strong EBITDA growth and margin expansion in 2022, excluding the higher severance expense, we grew full year EBITDA by 5.7% and increased EBITDA margins by 110 basis points to 44.8%.  We believe that our disciplined approach to running the business, including the benefits from our cost reduction efforts this quarter, positioned us to drive higher profitability, and further expand margins, both in 2023 and thereafter.  Now, let's turn to Slide seven for NBCUniversal. Starting with total NBCUniversal results, fourth quarter revenue increased 5.9% to $9.9 billion, and EBITDA decreased 36% to $817 million, including $182 million of severance expense in the quarter, excluding severance EBITDA decreased 22%. Media revenue increased 2.6% to $6 billion, mainly driven by Peacock, which nearly doubled its revenue to $660 million and Telemundos broadcast of the World Cup.  Advertising revenue increased 4%, reflecting an incremental $263 million from the World Cup, as well as strong growth at Peacock and a healthy contribution of political advertising, partially offset by a decline in linear advertising.  If we exclude the World Cup, advertising revenue declined 5.6% reflecting softening in the overall advertising market, distribution revenue increased 3.8% reflecting growth at Peacock driven by increases in paid subscribers, which more than doubled compared to last year, as well as higher contractual rates at our networks partially offset by linear subscriber declines. Media EBITDA was $132 million in the fourth quarter including a $978 million EBITDA loss at Peacock, reflecting the cost of new content, such as our exclusive next-day broadcast and Bravo content, our robust lineup of Pay-One titles, day and date releases like Halloween, NFL Premier League and the World Cup. Peacock's full year EBITDA loss of $2.5 billion was in line with the outlook we provided a year ago. And for 2023, we expect Peacock losses to be up modestly to around $3 billion. As we've said previously, we believe 2023 will be peak losses for Peacock and, from there, steadily improve. Excluding Peacock, Media EBITDA in the fourth quarter decreased 13%, reflecting the lower revenue and fairly flat expenses despite the higher costs associated with broadcasting the World Cup. Looking to the first quarter. While we remain focused on managing costs, we expect underlying Media EBITDA, excluding Peacock, to continue to be impacted by the top line pressures at our linear networks. Moving to Studios. Revenue increased 13% to $2.7 billion driven by growth in content licensing and theatrical revenue. Content licensing was up 16% driven by the benefit of our carryover titles and the acceleration in film windows as well as healthy growth in television licensing. Theatrical revenue increased 47% due to the success of recent releases, including Ticket to Paradise, Puss in Boots, Violent Night and Halloween Ends. EBITDA increased $109 million to $160 million for the quarter, reflecting the higher revenue partially offset by an increase in marketing and promotion expense, reflecting the size and timing of this quarter's theatrical slate as well as the corresponding higher programming and production costs. At Theme Parks, revenue increased 12% to $2.1 billion, while EBITDA increased 16% to $782 million, our highest level of EBITDA on record for our fourth quarter. These results were driven by growth at our parks in the U.S. and Japan partially offset by our park in Beijing, which was negatively impacted by COVID-related restrictions.  At our U.S. parks, we continue to see strong demand with attendance and guest spending up year-over-year and with Orlando and Hollywood both delivering record high EBITDA for the fourth quarter. Universal Japan continued to rebound since capacity restrictions were lifted at the end of March and delivered strong year-over-year EBITDA growth in the quarter. Now let's turn to Slide 8 for Sky. Reported results were meaningfully impacted by currency translation due to the strengthening dollar, but I will speak to Sky's results on a constant currency basis. For the fourth quarter, Sky revenue was relatively consistent compared to last year at $4.4 billion.  Direct-to-consumer revenue was also consistent compared to last year, reflecting growth in the U.K. driven by wireless and broadband revenue offset by declines in Germany and Italy. On a customer basis, we added 129,000 customer relationships in the quarter with positive additions across all three territories, the U.K., Italy and Germany. These net additions were driven by streaming, broadband and wireless customer additions and reflect our team's strong execution in a challenging macroeconomic environment across Europe. Rounding out the rest of Sky revenue, content revenue increased 6.5% driven by licensing our entertainment content, and advertising revenue decreased 9.6% primarily driven by lower revenue in the U.K., reflecting the timing of the World Cup and the macro environment. Turning to EBITDA. Sky's EBITDA decreased 15% to $340 million, including $89 million of severance expense, which is $53 million higher compared to last year's fourth quarter. Excluding severance, EBITDA declined 2% compared to last year, reflecting an increase in direct network costs driven by growth in our residential mobile and broadband businesses and higher other expenses, which were mostly offset by lower programming costs due to the timing of sports programming as four weeks of EPL games were paused during the fourth quarter to accommodate the World Cup.  However, we will incur higher sports costs in the first half of 2023, reflecting the higher number of games as the season is extended and the remainder of the games which were paused are now played. Now I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 9. As I mentioned previously, in 2022, we generated around $12.6 billion in free cash flow while absorbing increased investments in Peacock and Theme Parks as well as higher working capital as content creation normalizes post COVID. Full year consolidated total capital investment increased 14.2% or $1.7 billion to $13.8 billion due to increased spending at NBCUniversal and Cable partially offset by a decrease at Sky. At Cable, total capital spending increased 8.3% or $695 million with CapEx intensity coming in at 11.4% primarily driven by investments to further strengthen and extend our network.  In 2023, we expect CapEx intensity to stay at around 11%, similar to 2022 levels as we aim to accelerate our homes passed growth to about 1 million and continue to transition our entire broadband network to DOCSIS 4.0 over the next few years. NBCUniversal total capital spending increased $1.4 billion driven by parks CapEx increasing $1.1 billion, of which Epic was around $800 million and reflects our continued investment in new attractions like Super Nintendo World at Hollywood and Donkey Kong at Japan.  In 2023, we expect parks CapEx to increase by around $1.2 billion over last year as we continue to build Epic, which we plan to open in 2025 and begin work on our recently announced park extensions mentioned earlier. The required investment to develop these extensions is nowhere near the scale of Epic or Universal Beijing but rather enable us to leverage our already large market opportunity and can serve as a model that contributes to even higher growth at Theme Parks in the future. Working capital was $3 billion for the year, a $1.5 billion increase over last year's level, reflecting a post-COVID ramp of investment in content creation.  Turning to capital allocation. We ended the year with net leverage at 2.4 times and returned a total of $17.7 billion to shareholders, including $4.7 billion in dividend payments and $13 billion in share repurchases. For 2023, we expect to continue to maintain leverage at around current levels, which I expect will support continued strong capital returns. As we announced this morning, we are raising the dividend by $0.08 a share to $1.16 per share, our 15th consecutive annual increase. This reflects our long-standing balanced capital allocation policy. We're committed to investing organically in the businesses while maintaining a strong balance sheet and also returning a very healthy amount of capital to shareholders.  Thanks for joining us on the call this morning. I'll turn it back to Marci, who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Mike. Operator, let's open the call for Q&A, please. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. \nDoug Mitchelson: Good morning. And thank you. Brian and Mike as well giving your promotion to President, congratulations on that, by the way. And Jason, congratulations on the CFO role. Brian, Mike, since we're turning to a new calendar year, I wanted to ask for an updated vision for the company and how you see the company evolving over time. As part of that, investors are certainly interested how the company best addresses cable broadband competition and connectivity convergence and media streaming challenges and whether you see notable growth opportunities for the company that would shift allocation of capital as well. So how do you address the challenges and opportunities? And how has the company evolved over the next three to five years? Thanks.\nMike Cavanagh: Thanks, Doug. It's Mike. So maybe I'll take a first crack, and then Brian can pile on if he likes. So vision in the next few years, it's -- I think how you think about that requires a little bit of a reflection of where we stand at the moment. So if I look at 2022 and you really reflect on what are truly excellent operating results. So kudos to the people running the businesses deep down into the organization to produce the kind of results we had, record revenues and record adjusted EBITDA. And that's fundamentally great management discipline, operating discipline, financial discipline in the day-to-day. When you zoom out a little bit, it puts us in a position where we are returning record capital in our industry at 2.4 times leverage, so it allows us the opportunity both of those things in good balance. To then go at your real question, which is what is our opportunity, what are our challenges and do we have the resources to go after them. And so I'd say there, you heard it in the call, but I'll recount them, we've got an excellent number of organic investments that are going after all the opportunities and challenges that we currently see. Obviously, as others emerge, we'll go after it the way we usually do. But those are you take the network and Dave can pile in. But we're on a path to 10G. So DOCSIS 4.0 is going to get us, as we've talked about, in a very capital-efficient way to a network that's going to have symmetrical upstream, downstream in a few short years. We're going to start rolling that out at the back end of this year.  So I think our commitment is to have the best network out there and to put a tremendous amount of services surrounding that network, whether it be WiFi or Flex and the like, as you've heard us talk about before. You heard about the tech platform. Brian mentioned it. We're going to get to a single global tech platform, integrating all of the build of glass in the U.K., X1 here in the U.S., what we do in Peacock behind a single scaled global tech platform that we can use in many ways. You know about the XUMO partnership that we have with Charter, for example, to take that capability outside of our footprint. And then finally, on the Cable side, it's a wireless. Wireless, we've been at it for five years, have 5 million lines now. We put the investment in along the way, and we continue to do it, but it's a capital-light approach. And I think that totality is a great set of strategies for how we're going to drive growth in the cable business looking ahead. And so I'd say, expect us to continue to keep driving along those lines. On the Media side, we think Peacock is absolutely the right strategy for our company. And Jeff has repeatedly said, we're not going to place somebody else's hand. We have an excellent business in NBC and our cable networks. We spend quite a bit of money creating content and so migrating some of that content as eyeballs move to a more streaming universe. We like what we're doing. And we had a phenomenal year getting paid subs to 20 million paid subs from less than 10 a year ago. And we see this coming year as the peak year in investment there, but we'll keep on that plan. And then finally, I'll mention parks. Parks, we've got Nintendo opening in Hollywood in February. We're ramping the build of what's going to be a phenomenal theme park, Epic universe in Orlando, opening in 2025. And as I said earlier, we'll increase our spend this year in '24 to sort of peak levels there ahead of that opening. And then we're leveraging the great product that we have with some new ideas, some innovation around that with a kids-based theme park, smaller scale in Dallas and Hollywood Hard Nights in Las Vegas. So these are big investment agendas that go out all the issues that I think are out there across our different businesses. So I think we're well positioned to continue to drive primarily an organic investment agenda and drive growth across our businesses in the years ahead.  Obviously, it's our job to consider inorganic things as they come up. But as I've said before, the bar is very high. It's our job to make sure that we are looking at organic opportunities and executing well against them, and I think we are. So Brian, you got anything to add?\nBrian Roberts: First of all, I could see why you're the right person for the job. That was a fantastic answer and covered a lot of the vision of the company. So I'm going to try not to be at all repetitive and maybe even zoom out further with the lens and say, what are -- just pick two themes of what you just talked about and say, think about the vision of the company, what are the two big trends.  It's what's happening in broadband, both as a competitive reality, and I'm sure Dave will get into that with some of the questions; but in longer term, what's likely to happen to consumers' needs for usage -- what are we making our bets on in that vision question. And the other is the convergence to streaming and where are we in that journey. So if you think about the 10G initiative Mike talked about, it's really to widen our lead to clearly and demonstrably explain to consumers and give them a product and be able to brand it for resident consumers and businesses that we have something you want to have if you rely on a need and enjoy broadband and the investments we're making, the ubiquitous nature of it. And if you look at broadband usage, and we cited some stats in the prepared remarks, but if you just look at even Thursday night and the NFL being on Amazon, that creates a lot of broadband usage. And is there going to be more of that in the future or less of that in the future? And what percentage of America today consumes that way? And what will it look like 5, 10 years from now. And so we want to be a company that is uniquely positioned to capitalize on these macro changing trends. And the same goes in streaming. And Peacock -- with just my kudos to the team at the whole of NBCUniversal and Comcast and Sky working together have put us in double in one year to 20 million-plus paying customers in addition to what lies ahead. It's the best bargain. For $5 a month, you get everything from the World Cup to Sunday Night Football to incredible movies to incredible next-day NBC to all our cable content original content, and consumers are finding that. So I think our company, I echo what Mike said, I think we're extremely well positioned. And I we'll continue to grow organically and having the ability to keep the balance sheet strong and return capital to shareholders. And those finding that balance, we did it really well in 2022, and we hope to do it again.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Doug. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nBen Swinburne: Good morning. Thank you. I want to ask Jeff about the NBC outlook, both sort of some of the key trends you're seeing in '23 but also longer term. I mean I think the business did over $8.5 billion of EBITDA back in 2019. I think $23 million will probably be down from 22 just given the Peacock losses and the pressure on the Media business.  But can you just talk about your long-term opportunity at the NBCUniversal? Do you think you can climb back to those EBITDA levels over any sort of reasonable investment horizon? And what are you -- how are you feeling about sort of things like advertising and parks sitting here today given all the macro concerns? And then I just had one question for Mike on cash flow. You mentioned the $3 billion net working capital drag in '22. Any help on that for 2023, if you have any visibility there? Thank you, both.\nJeff Shell: Ben, this is Jeff. I'll start and then hand it over to Mike. So we feel really good about NBC growth trajectory going forward. If you kind of break it down, our content businesses has had a great quarter and is doing -- have never been better than they are right now or movie studio. We're off to a great start this year. The slate going forward is really good. Our TV businesses, studios are great. So our content business is doing great, and that's a business that should grow over time. The parks business, Brian and Mike both talked about the parks business, it's never been better for us. We had a record year last year. Trajectory is going to slow a little bit in the U.S. just because we are doing so well. But we're seeing -- we found our footing in Japan in the fourth quarter. That's going to grow based on the Nintendo attraction there in Beijing, which really had kind of got to profitability in the third quarter suffered from COVID in the fourth quarter. First couple of weeks of this year, with the economy opening up there, is really doing well even with poor weather. So I think our parks business has a lot of growth ahead. And as Mike talked about and Brian talked about, we're investing in it. So those two businesses are great. The Media segment, as Brian just went through very well, we made a decision to invest in Peacock. It's very clear that we picked the right business model at this point, given where we are. And it's very clear that the content strength that I talked about, which has led to our linear networks being number one for decades, is paying off on Peacock. So what -- when we -- we were going to grow -- we've made that investment. We've been clear from the start that we're going to see a return on investment. I think we feel better on that now based on where we are. And we also made that investment to return the Media segment to growth over time, which we feel even more confident today than we did maybe a year or two ago, then that's going to happen. And the timing of that really is up to macro conditions, how -- when does the ad market recover, how -- what are linear declines going forward. And then, of course, we continue to cut costs in the linear segment to maintain our margins.  So I'm pretty confident that we have a lot of growth ahead in NBCUniversal, particularly after the progress we've made this year and the Media segment, we wouldn't be investing in Peacock. We didn't think it was going to return the segment to growth over time.\nMike Cavanagh: And then the -- on working capital, we said a year ago that it was going to be spiked to a higher than typical run rate level just on the back of the disruptions caused by COVID in getting content creation in the phase we're in up to normalized levels. So expect to just ease back off of the levels we saw in 2022. It's a hard number to predict, but I think we are past peak there.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Ben. Operator we\u2019ll take the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. \nCraig Moffett: Thank you. And congratulations to both of you, Mike and Jason. The question I have is on margins. As I think about the Cable segment, I think most people at this point are aware of the puts and takes where growing broadband, it raises margins, losing video raises margins. As you think about wireless now sort of accounting for a larger and larger piece of the pie, how do those pieces fit together as sort of a longer-term outlook for margins? Is it possible for the growth rate of wireless at whatever margin it sort of contributes to keep margins growing in the cable business?\nDave Watson: Craig, Dave. So I think the good news is we have a great portfolio of opportunities and business lines. So as you said, we have real strength in broadband and not only just solid broadband relationships with the ability to drive revenue in a healthy way. So resi broadband, I believe, will continue to be accretive not just revenue but margin. And business services is a real long-term opportunity has been, will continue to be. So when you look at top line margin impact, including mobile, I think it's a good -- and video slowing down. On the top line, it contributes towards margin.  The second thing clearly are the expenses. And just lower activity levels, our constant focus around the two big buckets of the transactional activity, the experience improvements that we have that really drive things like self-install and the apps that help people resolve issues independently. And then our focus around cost, just fixed cost, ongoing. And so that all those things, I think, shows that it's not a singular moment. This has been steady progress over a long period of time around margin. So I think we still have a good runway.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Craig. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Ehrlich with BofA Securities. Please go ahead. \nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. Going back to NBCU of kind of two topics on theme parks, you've got three park planned for the U.S. Can you talk about global plans? And as peak spend in '24, I think that's what Mike just said. And then on Peacock, it sounds like this year will be peak losses. When do you expect breakeven? And can you talk about long-term profit potential like what margins would you look for? And then finally, kind of all around, can you just talk about your appetite for acquisitions? Mike said organic and non-organic. I'm just wondering WWE is obviously for sale. There's IP. Is this the year we finally see some more media consolidation? Thank you.\nBrian Roberts: Operator?\nOperator: Please continue, your line is open. \nBrian Roberts: Jessica sorry about that. We're back.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Did you hear my question? I thought it was me. Thank you. So I just wanted to go back to NBCU. You've got three parks planned for the U.S. I'm just wondering if you have any global plans. And it sounds like from what Mike said that peak spend will be in '24, I just wanted to clarify that.  And on Peacock, it sounds like this year will be peak losses. Can you talk about like when you expect breakeven and what you think about the long-term profit potential or margins there? And then finally, Mike again said organic and inorganic growth. So I'm just wondering what your appetite is for acquisitions, whether it's something like WWE or IP. Like is this the year we finally see media consolidation?\nJeff Shell: Thanks. Jeff again. Sorry about the delay here. So let me -- this is Jeff. So let me start with parks. So parks we are always looking to invest in our parks, given how well we've done. And during the pandemic, we took share. We've had pretty solid growth. And we -- it's a business that we want to deploy capital to, as Brian said, we're really excited about Epic. It's coming out of the ground. It looks great and our timing couldn't be better for that. But we always want to have things that we're investing in, both domestically and internationally. The concept that we're going to build in Dallas, which is a design for a younger audience, less investment, if it's successful, which we're pretty confident it will be, it's a concept that will work in a lot of places around the world that may not support a full-scale theme park like we have in Orlando or Beijing, but it could support something else. So that -- we're excited about that concept. And then the Halloween horror nights experience in Vegas, which I'm really excited about, could also be expanded to a number of different places around the world. So we're definitely having our eye towards places expanding internationally not just domestically with a number of markets kind of on the docket. And they won't all be places for a big giant primary theme park that we might look at different concepts for different markets. And as far as peak spending, I think Epic, I think we expect our peak spend probably to be this year, although '23 and '24 will be comparable as we ramp down at the beginning of '25 prior to opening. So that's the parks.  Peacock, we are could not be more positive about our trajectory so far. We're right where we expected to be as far as investment, and we're well above where we expected to be as far as paid subs, which was going to pay off. We will hit our peak spend, as I think Mike or Brian said in the opening, this year and then improve steadily from there. And we wouldn't be making the investment if we do see the investment in Peacock alone delivering return over time. As I said, in my prior answer that I'm more confident now that we're going to get to that, and it's going to be a good return just on that investment alone and the overall Media segment. And based on how we're doing so far, I'm more and more confident that that we made the right choice of business model and that our investment is appropriate for that business. So I don't know, Mike, if you want to talk about acquisitions.\nMike Cavanagh: Yes. Consolidation, and Jeff can pile in too, I mean, I think when it comes to media consolidation, we'll see what happens. But I think go back to the earlier discussion, we've got a robust set of plans to invest in our own businesses. So anything that we would look at when we saw our job to consider things, we have healthy discussions. And our bias has to be to be investing behind our businesses themselves, where we control, operate, know what we're doing, have momentum, no surprises. So like I said, the -- across any inorganic opportunity, we're going to put ourselves through the real discussion. Is it worth it relative to the choices we have to invest in our own business, like Jeff just described?\nJeff Shell: And I would just add that we're always looking for bolt-on acquisitions that bolster our business. And I'll give two examples. We bought DreamWorks. We talked about that in the past, and it's been paying off steadily since our acquisition and just now, with Puss in Boots, which is a big hit at the box office really our entry back into the Shrek Universe, continues to make that acquisition look really favorable.  And we've invested in our Blumhouse investment over time. We're a partner with Jason Blum, and we have a big hit, M3GAN, this month, which is coming out of that investment. So we're always looking at bolt-on acquisitions. Don't necessarily involve big industry consolidation questions. \nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Jessica. Operator we\u2019ll take the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nBrett Feldman: Yes, thanks for taking the question. So later last year, one of the points you had made was just sort of based on market conditions. It was unlikely that you were going to see your broadband subscriber base really change in size, so basically stayed pretty flat for at least some period of time, and we saw effectively that trend in your fourth quarter results.  I was hoping you can give us an update. How would you frame market conditions right now? Are you seeing any tailwinds begin to emerge? And do you need a meaningful improvement in market conditions to get back to more sustainably positive broadband net adds? Or do you think some of the steps you've been taking position you to accomplish that at some point this year regardless of the backdrop? Thank you.\nDave Watson: Brett, Dave here. So let me start with kind of your first point on the overall environment and pointing towards our results in broadband. So starting with Q4, clearly, excluding the impact of the hurricane, we reported net adds, broadband net adds of 4,000. And this has been consistent, consistent the last couple of quarters, reflecting the continued impact of lower move activity, increased competition. But what's different has been the near record low churn.  So this -- the current environment is similar. Macro -- the macro environment still reflects depressed move activity. Competition continues to be very strong, and we're seeing some normalization in non-pay activity and churn. So it remains a challenging environment to add subscribers right now. However, as our record high revenue, adjusted EBITDA and margins in 2022 show, we have a successful model. We're driving revenue, EBITDA and cash flow rather than just chasing units. And so you look at our ARPU growth, holding the line on the relationships, but our ARPU growth was 3.8% in terms of broadband. So we're protecting ARPU growth, constantly adding more value, investing in our network, all within the parameters that we've talked about. And so -- and it -- results within the mix of the base is showing. As Brian said, you know, the one-third of our customers, broadband customers that get our Gigabit Plus products. So this is only just 5% that number just three years ago. So you look at usage. You look at the entire long-term opportunity, I think as Brian said, whether it's a couple more sporting events that go towards streaming, it just points towards you need better broadband. So from our competitive situation that we see, as I said, it's going to continue, but I think we're going to focus on our great network, ubiquitous network. We're going to continue to invest in that. We will constantly segment the marketplace and address each competitor.  And so I think it's a similar environment, but we're very focused on being in position to drive results. But yes, we're going to do both. We're going to balance rate and volume.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Brett. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead. \nMichael Rollins: Thanks, good morning. And congrats to Mike and Jason on your new roles. Just two topics, if I could. First, on the XUMO platform, if you can give us an update on how that's progressing and maybe some of the milestones to watch as you look out over the next one to two years. And then on the cost-cutting and efficiency actions that you took exiting 2022, how should we think about the annual cost savings opportunity? Thanks.\nDave Watson: Let me start -- Michael, this is Dave. I'll start with XUMO. It's really early. Excited about the opportunity. Early discussions are positive and just a variety of partners. So we're excited about the relationship with Charter. And so -- but it's really early at this point in terms of XUMO, but I expect more to come, and we'll keep you posted along the way. Mike?\nMike Cavanagh: On the cost actions we took in the course of the year, it's really to get our businesses set up to drive the results we gave some commentary on the outlook. We don't give guidance, but I think consider it all factored into the outlooks that Jeff, Dave and I have given thus far on the call, which is, again, continued opportunity for expanding margins and growth in EBITDA in the cable business and everything Jeff just described on the Media side, including growth in parks, growth in studios and the net dynamics with linear versus Peacock in the Media side.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Mike. Operator next question, please. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \nPhilip Cusick: Thanks, guys. Two follow-ups, if I can. Your tone around new footprint expansion and broadband efforts has -- there's no change. Does bead funding or state subsidies going forward, accelerate that further? Or do you think the $1 million annually is the right figure to think about going forward?  For Jeff, any update on trends in advertising since your comments in early December? And then finally, I wonder if you guys can talk about the $500 million in severance this quarter. Is there more to come? And Mike, I heard you say that margins in Cable should continue higher. What impact do you expect on cost going forward? Thanks very much.\nDave Watson: Let me start, Phil, this is Dave, and talk about the footprint expansion expectations. So pretty steady progress. You look at '21, did $813,000; '22, last year did $840,000. So good progress and in line with our expectations. And we do expect to accelerate in '23. So there's an opportunity to do around 1 million passings. And so the opportunity clearly still within footprint and residential, also hyper builds we call the commercial growth. Those all still exist. We're excited about that. And that's the majority still of the footprint expansion. The newer ones will be the rural edge-outs that we've been talking about, and that will begin to pick up the pace. Having said that, we're excited about it. We're going to lean in. We think we're doing well early stage in terms of the grants and the wins around these communities. But we're going to take a very disciplined approach, and we're going to go after returns that are similar to historic levels as we do that. So -- and we're -- I think all of the -- whether it's the network upgrades, the footprint expansions, we're still right on target with what we said and going back to '21 and being around 11% Cable CapEx intensity. So very excited about both of those areas, how we upgrade, the elegant path to upgrade and the footprint expansion. Jeff?\nJeff Shell: Thanks, Dave, and thanks, Phil. So on the ad market, I think in prior calls, the market -- the ad market steadily worsened over the course of last year. It kind of feels like it bottomed out around late November, early December. And really since then, it hasn't gotten worse and maybe even a little bit better. I describe it really as shallow.  There's parts of the market that are actually doing really well, Pharma, entertainment. Travel is on fire. There's parts of the market that feels uncertain, tech, auto, financial services, all are weak. It feels like the weakness is due less to businesses not doing well and more to just macro uncertainty. I mean none of us really know where the economy is headed, and I think some advertisers in those segments are really holding back. And when they do advertise, they're coming in later than usual. So I think we have -- we're doing a little bit better than our peers for a couple of reasons. One is Peacock's growth is really helping to offset the linear weakness, which is fortuitous for us. And I think, secondly, we've made big investments in data and measurement, and we have the best team, and that's really helping. But I guess I would just summarize it by saying the ad market feels to me like it stabilized a bit. And we're assuming it's going to stay weak for the first half of this year and then recover. But who really knows based on the macro economy?\nMike Cavanagh: And then, Phil, Mike. So just picking up on macro. I mean looking into 2023, as many businesses, just uncertainty about the environment, we took -- I'll tell you what we did on severance. We offered voluntary retirement across the company, something we do on a periodic basis, which has benefits, obviously, of giving more opportunities for younger talent anyway as well as some of the tactical situations we have in select businesses to just make sure we're as efficient as we can be heading into uncertain times. We've executed against all these things as we roll into 2023. So it's behind us.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Phil. Operator, we\u2019ll take our last question. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead. \nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thank you. Maybe a couple of questions for Dave on wireless and on video. On wireless, you talked about the 9% penetration. I mean are you seeing the positive impact on the broadband base from selling wireless into that? And then do you expect to continue to lean in? I think you guys don't really look at that as a separate profit pool but just sort of supporting the broadband business. And is that unlikely to change? That's number one.  You also -- Dave talked about selling into the business segments. Just anything, sort of any color on how you're doing that or what that opportunity is? And then lastly, on video losses, just they were little better than what we expected. Anything different there in terms of maybe selling of skinny bundles or how we should expect that to trend as we look into '23? Thanks.\nDave Watson: Sure, John. So when we look at wireless, we actually do, it's a nice growth opportunity in and of itself. But the core real opportunity is to surround broadband, both residentially and commercially, as you brought up. You look at the opportunity, the road map, and Mike said, we just crossed the 5 million lines. But the way we look at it, when you include business relationships, we had 34 million broadband relationships. And you look at the amount of lines that the other competitors do, the lines per relationship, we're talking about an opportunity that's around 80 million lines over the long run. So we had a strong quarter in mobile, really strong quarter. Good momentum. This has been building, will continue. So it's a good runway. We really like our position. We like the core service offerings approach, the capital-light approach, buy the gig unlimited, different tiers of unlimited and then really leveraging best-in-class WiFi. So the mobile game plan is really to support broadband. We do see continued positive results. When you package the broadband with mobile, there is a churn benefit to that. And so we'll continue to really -- that's our -- part of our core strategy is to do that. And leverage is a feisty competitive marketplace in wireless. For those that are offering different kinds of offers will be there with bring your own device as well. So we got a really good balance towards. And business services is just getting going in mobile. We're excited about that, and there -- it's early but good progress. In video, it's a combination just less attach rate on the front end. That is really one of the main drivers. But when you look at churn, churn is better, and it continues to improve on the video side. And when you look at the combination of video and broadband right now, that combination of full disconnect churn, it's down over 20% against the -- since the pre-pandemic 2019 level. So we segment the marketplace. Video is an important part of the portfolio. We'll continue to market it where it makes sense per segment. But overall, that's the story around video.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, John, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer session and today's conference call. A replay of the call will be available starting at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time today on Comcast Investor Relations website. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect.",

            "name": "Dave Watson",
            "content": "Craig, Dave. So I think the good news is we have a great portfolio of opportunities and business lines. So as you said, we have real strength in broadband and not only just solid broadband relationships with the ability to drive revenue in a healthy way. So resi broadband, I believe, will continue to be accretive not just revenue but margin. And business services is a real long-term opportunity has been, will continue to be. So when you look at top line margin impact, including mobile, I think it's a good -- and video slowing down. On the top line, it contributes towards margin.  The second thing clearly are the expenses. And just lower activity levels, our constant focus around the two big buckets of the transactional activity, the experience improvements that we have that really drive things like self-install and the apps that help people resolve issues independently. And then our focus around cost, just fixed cost, ongoing. And so that all those things, I think, shows that it's not a singular moment. This has been steady progress over a long period of time around margin. So I think we still have a good runway. Brett, Dave here. So let me start with kind of your first point on the overall environment and pointing towards our results in broadband. So starting with Q4, clearly, excluding the impact of the hurricane, we reported net adds, broadband net adds of 4,000. And this has been consistent, consistent the last couple of quarters, reflecting the continued impact of lower move activity, increased competition. But what's different has been the near record low churn.  So this -- the current environment is similar. Macro -- the macro environment still reflects depressed move activity. Competition continues to be very strong, and we're seeing some normalization in non-pay activity and churn. So it remains a challenging environment to add subscribers right now. However, as our record high revenue, adjusted EBITDA and margins in 2022 show, we have a successful model. We're driving revenue, EBITDA and cash flow rather than just chasing units. And so you look at our ARPU growth, holding the line on the relationships, but our ARPU growth was 3.8% in terms of broadband. So we're protecting ARPU growth, constantly adding more value, investing in our network, all within the parameters that we've talked about. And so -- and it -- results within the mix of the base is showing. As Brian said, you know, the one-third of our customers, broadband customers that get our Gigabit Plus products. So this is only just 5% that number just three years ago. So you look at usage. You look at the entire long-term opportunity, I think as Brian said, whether it's a couple more sporting events that go towards streaming, it just points towards you need better broadband. So from our competitive situation that we see, as I said, it's going to continue, but I think we're going to focus on our great network, ubiquitous network. We're going to continue to invest in that. We will constantly segment the marketplace and address each competitor.  And so I think it's a similar environment, but we're very focused on being in position to drive results. But yes, we're going to do both. We're going to balance rate and volume. Let me start -- Michael, this is Dave. I'll start with XUMO. It's really early. Excited about the opportunity. Early discussions are positive and just a variety of partners. So we're excited about the relationship with Charter. And so -- but it's really early at this point in terms of XUMO, but I expect more to come, and we'll keep you posted along the way. Mike? Let me start, Phil, this is Dave, and talk about the footprint expansion expectations. So pretty steady progress. You look at '21, did $813,000; '22, last year did $840,000. So good progress and in line with our expectations. And we do expect to accelerate in '23. So there's an opportunity to do around 1 million passings. And so the opportunity clearly still within footprint and residential, also hyper builds we call the commercial growth. Those all still exist. We're excited about that. And that's the majority still of the footprint expansion. The newer ones will be the rural edge-outs that we've been talking about, and that will begin to pick up the pace. Having said that, we're excited about it. We're going to lean in. We think we're doing well early stage in terms of the grants and the wins around these communities. But we're going to take a very disciplined approach, and we're going to go after returns that are similar to historic levels as we do that. So -- and we're -- I think all of the -- whether it's the network upgrades, the footprint expansions, we're still right on target with what we said and going back to '21 and being around 11% Cable CapEx intensity. So very excited about both of those areas, how we upgrade, the elegant path to upgrade and the footprint expansion. Jeff? Sure, John. So when we look at wireless, we actually do, it's a nice growth opportunity in and of itself. But the core real opportunity is to surround broadband, both residentially and commercially, as you brought up. You look at the opportunity, the road map, and Mike said, we just crossed the 5 million lines. But the way we look at it, when you include business relationships, we had 34 million broadband relationships. And you look at the amount of lines that the other competitors do, the lines per relationship, we're talking about an opportunity that's around 80 million lines over the long run. So we had a strong quarter in mobile, really strong quarter. Good momentum. This has been building, will continue. So it's a good runway. We really like our position. We like the core service offerings approach, the capital-light approach, buy the gig unlimited, different tiers of unlimited and then really leveraging best-in-class WiFi. So the mobile game plan is really to support broadband. We do see continued positive results. When you package the broadband with mobile, there is a churn benefit to that. And so we'll continue to really -- that's our -- part of our core strategy is to do that. And leverage is a feisty competitive marketplace in wireless. For those that are offering different kinds of offers will be there with bring your own device as well. So we got a really good balance towards. And business services is just getting going in mobile. We're excited about that, and there -- it's early but good progress. In video, it's a combination just less attach rate on the front end. That is really one of the main drivers. But when you look at churn, churn is better, and it continues to improve on the video side. And when you look at the combination of video and broadband right now, that combination of full disconnect churn, it's down over 20% against the -- since the pre-pandemic 2019 level. So we segment the marketplace. Video is an important part of the portfolio. We'll continue to market it where it makes sense per segment. But overall, that's the story around video."

            "name": "Jeff Shell",
            "content": "Ben, this is Jeff. I'll start and then hand it over to Mike. So we feel really good about NBC growth trajectory going forward. If you kind of break it down, our content businesses has had a great quarter and is doing -- have never been better than they are right now or movie studio. We're off to a great start this year. The slate going forward is really good. Our TV businesses, studios are great. So our content business is doing great, and that's a business that should grow over time. The parks business, Brian and Mike both talked about the parks business, it's never been better for us. We had a record year last year. Trajectory is going to slow a little bit in the U.S. just because we are doing so well. But we're seeing -- we found our footing in Japan in the fourth quarter. That's going to grow based on the Nintendo attraction there in Beijing, which really had kind of got to profitability in the third quarter suffered from COVID in the fourth quarter. First couple of weeks of this year, with the economy opening up there, is really doing well even with poor weather. So I think our parks business has a lot of growth ahead. And as Mike talked about and Brian talked about, we're investing in it. So those two businesses are great. The Media segment, as Brian just went through very well, we made a decision to invest in Peacock. It's very clear that we picked the right business model at this point, given where we are. And it's very clear that the content strength that I talked about, which has led to our linear networks being number one for decades, is paying off on Peacock. So what -- when we -- we were going to grow -- we've made that investment. We've been clear from the start that we're going to see a return on investment. I think we feel better on that now based on where we are. And we also made that investment to return the Media segment to growth over time, which we feel even more confident today than we did maybe a year or two ago, then that's going to happen. And the timing of that really is up to macro conditions, how -- when does the ad market recover, how -- what are linear declines going forward. And then, of course, we continue to cut costs in the linear segment to maintain our margins.  So I'm pretty confident that we have a lot of growth ahead in NBCUniversal, particularly after the progress we've made this year and the Media segment, we wouldn't be investing in Peacock. We didn't think it was going to return the segment to growth over time. Thanks. Jeff again. Sorry about the delay here. So let me -- this is Jeff. So let me start with parks. So parks we are always looking to invest in our parks, given how well we've done. And during the pandemic, we took share. We've had pretty solid growth. And we -- it's a business that we want to deploy capital to, as Brian said, we're really excited about Epic. It's coming out of the ground. It looks great and our timing couldn't be better for that. But we always want to have things that we're investing in, both domestically and internationally. The concept that we're going to build in Dallas, which is a design for a younger audience, less investment, if it's successful, which we're pretty confident it will be, it's a concept that will work in a lot of places around the world that may not support a full-scale theme park like we have in Orlando or Beijing, but it could support something else. So that -- we're excited about that concept. And then the Halloween horror nights experience in Vegas, which I'm really excited about, could also be expanded to a number of different places around the world. So we're definitely having our eye towards places expanding internationally not just domestically with a number of markets kind of on the docket. And they won't all be places for a big giant primary theme park that we might look at different concepts for different markets. And as far as peak spending, I think Epic, I think we expect our peak spend probably to be this year, although '23 and '24 will be comparable as we ramp down at the beginning of '25 prior to opening. So that's the parks.  Peacock, we are could not be more positive about our trajectory so far. We're right where we expected to be as far as investment, and we're well above where we expected to be as far as paid subs, which was going to pay off. We will hit our peak spend, as I think Mike or Brian said in the opening, this year and then improve steadily from there. And we wouldn't be making the investment if we do see the investment in Peacock alone delivering return over time. As I said, in my prior answer that I'm more confident now that we're going to get to that, and it's going to be a good return just on that investment alone and the overall Media segment. And based on how we're doing so far, I'm more and more confident that that we made the right choice of business model and that our investment is appropriate for that business. So I don't know, Mike, if you want to talk about acquisitions. And I would just add that we're always looking for bolt-on acquisitions that bolster our business. And I'll give two examples. We bought DreamWorks. We talked about that in the past, and it's been paying off steadily since our acquisition and just now, with Puss in Boots, which is a big hit at the box office really our entry back into the Shrek Universe, continues to make that acquisition look really favorable.  And we've invested in our Blumhouse investment over time. We're a partner with Jason Blum, and we have a big hit, M3GAN, this month, which is coming out of that investment. So we're always looking at bolt-on acquisitions. Don't necessarily involve big industry consolidation questions. Thanks, Dave, and thanks, Phil. So on the ad market, I think in prior calls, the market -- the ad market steadily worsened over the course of last year. It kind of feels like it bottomed out around late November, early December. And really since then, it hasn't gotten worse and maybe even a little bit better. I describe it really as shallow.  There's parts of the market that are actually doing really well, Pharma, entertainment. Travel is on fire. There's parts of the market that feels uncertain, tech, auto, financial services, all are weak. It feels like the weakness is due less to businesses not doing well and more to just macro uncertainty. I mean none of us really know where the economy is headed, and I think some advertisers in those segments are really holding back. And when they do advertise, they're coming in later than usual. So I think we have -- we're doing a little bit better than our peers for a couple of reasons. One is Peacock's growth is really helping to offset the linear weakness, which is fortuitous for us. And I think, secondly, we've made big investments in data and measurement, and we have the best team, and that's really helping. But I guess I would just summarize it by saying the ad market feels to me like it stabilized a bit. And we're assuming it's going to stay weak for the first half of this year and then recover. But who really knows based on the macro economy?"

            "name": "Brian Roberts",
            "content": "Thanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. I'm really proud of how our team executed throughout 2022. We achieved the highest levels of revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS in our company's history. And we returned a record $17.7 billion of capital to shareholders through both our recurring dividend, which we just increased for the 15th consecutive year and robust share repurchase activity. We did all this while accelerating investment in key growth initiatives, which are showing great progress, particularly our broadband network as we transition to 10G but also in Xfinity Mobile, Peacock and our theme parks. I attribute all this success to the incredible talent across our organization, who work collaboratively to ensure we are constantly evolving and innovating so that our customers have the absolute best experience with us at every point of interaction. What also sets us apart is our very strong balance sheet, which, when combined with the cost actions we have taken this past quarter, position us to perform well no matter what the macro environment might bring. I want to start with cable, where our financial performance both for the year and the fourth quarter confirm that we are striking the right balance between rate and volume in residential broadband, and we plan to continue to do so in 2023. At Xfinity Mobile and Comcast business remain strong growth drivers and we have successfully identified the appropriate mix between cutting costs to drive efficiencies and investing for our future. We have always maintained an intense focus on providing the absolute best products and experiences, which comes down to having the highest capacity, most reliable and most efficient broadband network. Our evolution to 10G and the unique way we are pursuing this through DOCSIS 4.0 is a huge benefit for our customers across the entire footprint that they will all have access to an entire ecosystem built around multi-gigabit symmetrical speeds, some as early as this year. It's also great for the company investors as our transition to a virtual software-based network infused with the marvelous AI capabilities will not only provide tangible benefits when it comes to operating and capital expenses, but it will enable us to innovate faster than ever before, solidifying our leadership position in broadband, which is extremely important given what is certain to be continued increases in demand for both speed and usage. In fact, we continue to see signs of this today. Our residential broadband-only customers are now consuming nearly 700 gigabytes of data every month, and customers on our Gigabit Plus products now comprise one-third of our broadband subscribers.  In addition to creating more value from our current customer base and further penetrating the total homes and businesses that we pass today, another great opportunity is for us to extend our networks to homes and businesses in the U.S. that do not have the ability to receive our services. To that end, we increased our passings by 1.4% or $840,000 in 2022, and we expect to accelerate in 2023, where we are aiming to add around 1 million while still maintaining the same CapEx intensity level we achieved in 2022, reaching nearly 62.5 million by the end of the year. We are taking a disciplined approach, and we'll only pursue those areas that have a return profile similar to what we have been able to historically achieve. Wireless is playing an integral part of our overall strategy at cable, and it's an area where we continue to shine. This past quarter was another record in net line additions, bringing us to over 5 million total lines in just five years. Only 9% penetration of our current base of residential broadband customers, we have plenty of runway ahead, and we're just getting started in offering wireless to our commercial segment, which is another great example of how we are selling more products into our existing base of business customers. When you combine our broadband network, WiFi overlay and MVNO with Verizon, we are in the best position to win in convergence. We have a leg up on our competitors with a capital-light strategy that does not involve customer or network trade-offs. At NBCUniversal, we are seeing some great momentum in Peacock and parks. And across all of NBCUniversal, our intellectual property is really resonating. We had the number 2 studio in terms of worldwide box office in 2022, fueled by a strong slate, including Jurassic, Minions, Nope, Ticket to Paradise, Puss in Boots, Black Bone, Halloween, which have also had great carryover success to Peacock through our Pay-One window and select day and date releases. And our box office momentum continued into the first quarter with M3GAN, so all in all, a really strong film slate. Peacock ended the year with over 20 million paying subscribers, more than double where we started. And we added over 5 million paid subscribers in the fourth quarter alone. Our success was broad-based, fueled by some of the films I just mentioned but also sporting events like the World Cup, NFL, Premier League, several new originals and our exclusive next-day broadcast of NBC. Looking ahead, and based on our experience to date, we expect our subscriber cadence will follow our content launches, which will fall more in the second half of 23. And we continue to see positive trends in engagement, churn and ARPU.  Mark Woodburry had a fabulous first year as our CEO of the Parks business, and we hit a number of new records this past quarter. It was the highest fourth quarter EBITDA for the entire segment, led by Orlando and Hollywood, and Japan had the best EBITDA performance since 2019. This was driven by attendance that for us surpassed pre pandemic levels at all three parks.  While attendance at our Park in Beijing was significantly impacted by COVID in 2022, we are seeing some exciting demand to start the year. Given the excellent returns we have generated to-date, we continue to seek ways to expand our parks. I'm really excited about our two recently announced extensions. First universal park designed specifically for younger audiences near Dallas, and the first year around horror entertainment experience in Las Vegas.  These are new innovative ways to utilize our substantial IP, including from DreamWorks and Illumination, while also extending our brand, both of which had helped fuel growth in all of our parks.  Our linear video business, we are managing subscriber declines by taking a disciplined approach to our cost base. We are continuing to invest in our global technology platform, and you will see a number of announcements from us in the weeks and months ahead.  For example, in 2023, we will launch one global user interface for Sky Glass, Xfinity, X1, Flex, XUMO, at our U.S. and International partners. Every entertainment customer around the world will get the same Emmy award winning voice controlled experience.  This scale not only brings us operational efficiencies, but it also puts us in the enviable position when it comes to conversations with distributors, OEMs, programmers, app developers and talent. At Sky, we are managing through the macro economic challenges in Europe. While staying intensely focused on retention and continuing to provide our customers with the best entertainment and connectivity experiences.  We're seeing some encouraging results. In the UK, Sky Glass had the top selling UHD TV model. Sky mobile is the fastest growing mobile provider, surpassing three million lines. And we are narrowing the gap between us and the current number one broadband provider with Sky Broadband, now sitting at over 6.5 million subscribers.  Wrapping up, our consistently strong financial performance, healthy balance sheet, record high return of capital of shareholders underscore how the scale capabilities and talent across our company enable us to successfully execute our long term growth strategy. I'm convinced we are on the right path and that we have the right team to capture our many opportunities and overcome whatever challenges happen along the way.  So before handing over the call, I want to congratulate Jason Armstrong, recently promoted to Chief Financial Officer, succeeding Mike Cavanagh. Could not be more confident and the leadership team's ability to continue to drive us forward and create more value for our shareholders.  Mike, over to you. First of all, I could see why you're the right person for the job. That was a fantastic answer and covered a lot of the vision of the company. So I'm going to try not to be at all repetitive and maybe even zoom out further with the lens and say, what are -- just pick two themes of what you just talked about and say, think about the vision of the company, what are the two big trends.  It's what's happening in broadband, both as a competitive reality, and I'm sure Dave will get into that with some of the questions; but in longer term, what's likely to happen to consumers' needs for usage -- what are we making our bets on in that vision question. And the other is the convergence to streaming and where are we in that journey. So if you think about the 10G initiative Mike talked about, it's really to widen our lead to clearly and demonstrably explain to consumers and give them a product and be able to brand it for resident consumers and businesses that we have something you want to have if you rely on a need and enjoy broadband and the investments we're making, the ubiquitous nature of it. And if you look at broadband usage, and we cited some stats in the prepared remarks, but if you just look at even Thursday night and the NFL being on Amazon, that creates a lot of broadband usage. And is there going to be more of that in the future or less of that in the future? And what percentage of America today consumes that way? And what will it look like 5, 10 years from now. And so we want to be a company that is uniquely positioned to capitalize on these macro changing trends. And the same goes in streaming. And Peacock -- with just my kudos to the team at the whole of NBCUniversal and Comcast and Sky working together have put us in double in one year to 20 million-plus paying customers in addition to what lies ahead. It's the best bargain. For $5 a month, you get everything from the World Cup to Sunday Night Football to incredible movies to incredible next-day NBC to all our cable content original content, and consumers are finding that. So I think our company, I echo what Mike said, I think we're extremely well positioned. And I we'll continue to grow organically and having the ability to keep the balance sheet strong and return capital to shareholders. And those finding that balance, we did it really well in 2022, and we hope to do it again. Operator? Jessica sorry about that. We're back."

            "name": "Mike Cavanagh",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. And good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to just say that it's been a pleasure serving as CFO of Comcast for the last seven plus years. And I couldn't be prouder to have Jason be my successor. Knowing that with Jason, the financial leadership of our company is in proven and expert hands.  Since Jason didn't take over as CFO until early in the new year, I will handle the CFO portion of this call and hand it over to Jason for the first quarter call in April.  So now I'll begin on Slides four and five to discuss our consolidated 2022 financial results. Revenue increased just under 1% to $30.6 billion for the fourth quarter and 4.3% to $121.4 billion for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 4.9% to $8 billion for the fourth quarter, and increased 5% to $36.5 billion for the full year.  The quarterly results include severance expenses booked in each of our businesses, totaling $638 million, which is $541 million higher than the prior year period. Including this increase, adjusted EBITDA increased 1.5% in the fourth quarter, and 6.6% for the full year.  Adjusted EPS increased 6.5% to $0.82 of share for the fourth quarter and 13% to $3.64 for the full year. And we generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow for the fourth quarter and $12.6 billion for the full year, while absorbing increased investments in Peacock and theme parks, as well as higher working capital as content creation normalizes post COVID. Now let's turn to our business segment results starting with Cable Communications on Slide six. Cable revenue increased 1.4% to $16.6 billion, EBITDA increased 1.5% to $7.2 billion and cable EBITDA margins improved 10 basis points year-over-year to 43.5%. These results include $345 million of severance expense, which is $305 million higher compared to last year's fourth quarter, excluding severance cable EBITDA increased 5.8% and cable EBITDA margin improved by 190 basis points to a record high of 45.3%.  These strong results also included the impact of Hurricane Ian in Southwest Florida, which resulted in the loss or severe damage to many homes we serve in this market. Excluding the hurricane impacts, we would have added approximately 4000 broadband customers versus the 26,000 loss we reported. And we estimate that we would have lost approximately 36,000 customer relationships versus the 71,000 we reported.  Overall, our broadband customer results in the fourth quarter were fairly consistent with the prior two quarters, reflecting lower levels of new customer connections, offset by churn which remained well below 2019 levels.  Now let's discuss cable financials in more detail. Cable revenue growth of 1.4% was driven by higher broadband wireless business services and advertising revenue, partially offset by lower video and voice revenue. Broadband revenue increased 5.4% driven by growth in ARPU and in our customer base when compared to last year. Broadband ARPU increased 3.8% year-over-year, when adjusting for some COVID related customer credits last year. This organic ARPU growth is similar to the growth we've generated over the last couple of quarters and is consistent with our strategy.  We are focused on optimizing our customer relationships by consistently adding more capabilities, services and value, so as to provide the best broadband experience, which has and should continue to deliver broadband ARPU growth. The elements of growth this quarter include increased rate, attaching more customers to higher tiers, as well as other services. We expect ARPU growth will continue to be the primary driver of our residential broadband revenue growth in 2023.  Wireless revenue increased 25%, mainly driven by service revenue, which was fueled by growth in customer lines. We added 1.3 million lines in 2022, including 365,000 lines in the fourth quarter, which is our highest number of net additions for any quarter on record. Business Services revenue increased 4.6%, which includes the results of Masergy in both this quarter and in the prior year period, as we lap the closing of this acquisition at the beginning of the quarter.  Revenue growth was primarily driven by rate, including customers taking faster data speeds, higher attach rates of our advanced products, and rate increases on some of our services.  Advertising revenue increased 9.1% driven by strong political revenue, partially offset by the absence of advertising revenue that is now part of XUMO, our joint venture with Charter. Adjusting for those items, cable advertising revenue decreased 1.6%, reflecting decline in our local core advertising business, partially offset by solid growth at our advanced advertising business.  Video revenue declined 5.6% driven by year-over-year customer net losses, partially offset by ARPU growth of 5.8%, due to a residential rate increase we implemented at the beginning of 2022. And last, voice revenue declined 13% primarily reflecting year-over-year customer losses.  Turning to expenses. Cable Communications fourth quarter expenses increased 1.4%, reflecting higher non-programming expenses, which included the $305 million in higher severance costs, partially offset by lower programming expenses. Programming expenses decreased 5.9%, reflecting the year-over-year decline in video customers partially offset by higher contractual rates. Non-programming expenses, which again include $305 million and higher severance costs, increased 5.6%.  Excluding severance, these expenses were flat compared to last year, reflecting an increase in bad debt as we return to more normalized pre pandemic levels an increased technical and product support expenses driven by growth in our wireless business. These were offset by a decline in marketing and promotion and customer service expenses due to lower activity levels, efficiencies in running the business, and improvements we continue to make in our customer experience.  Our focus on growing our high margin connectivity businesses, coupled with our focus on increasing operating efficiency and cost controls, drove strong EBITDA growth and margin expansion in 2022, excluding the higher severance expense, we grew full year EBITDA by 5.7% and increased EBITDA margins by 110 basis points to 44.8%.  We believe that our disciplined approach to running the business, including the benefits from our cost reduction efforts this quarter, positioned us to drive higher profitability, and further expand margins, both in 2023 and thereafter.  Now, let's turn to Slide seven for NBCUniversal. Starting with total NBCUniversal results, fourth quarter revenue increased 5.9% to $9.9 billion, and EBITDA decreased 36% to $817 million, including $182 million of severance expense in the quarter, excluding severance EBITDA decreased 22%. Media revenue increased 2.6% to $6 billion, mainly driven by Peacock, which nearly doubled its revenue to $660 million and Telemundos broadcast of the World Cup.  Advertising revenue increased 4%, reflecting an incremental $263 million from the World Cup, as well as strong growth at Peacock and a healthy contribution of political advertising, partially offset by a decline in linear advertising.  If we exclude the World Cup, advertising revenue declined 5.6% reflecting softening in the overall advertising market, distribution revenue increased 3.8% reflecting growth at Peacock driven by increases in paid subscribers, which more than doubled compared to last year, as well as higher contractual rates at our networks partially offset by linear subscriber declines. Media EBITDA was $132 million in the fourth quarter including a $978 million EBITDA loss at Peacock, reflecting the cost of new content, such as our exclusive next-day broadcast and Bravo content, our robust lineup of Pay-One titles, day and date releases like Halloween, NFL Premier League and the World Cup. Peacock's full year EBITDA loss of $2.5 billion was in line with the outlook we provided a year ago. And for 2023, we expect Peacock losses to be up modestly to around $3 billion. As we've said previously, we believe 2023 will be peak losses for Peacock and, from there, steadily improve. Excluding Peacock, Media EBITDA in the fourth quarter decreased 13%, reflecting the lower revenue and fairly flat expenses despite the higher costs associated with broadcasting the World Cup. Looking to the first quarter. While we remain focused on managing costs, we expect underlying Media EBITDA, excluding Peacock, to continue to be impacted by the top line pressures at our linear networks. Moving to Studios. Revenue increased 13% to $2.7 billion driven by growth in content licensing and theatrical revenue. Content licensing was up 16% driven by the benefit of our carryover titles and the acceleration in film windows as well as healthy growth in television licensing. Theatrical revenue increased 47% due to the success of recent releases, including Ticket to Paradise, Puss in Boots, Violent Night and Halloween Ends. EBITDA increased $109 million to $160 million for the quarter, reflecting the higher revenue partially offset by an increase in marketing and promotion expense, reflecting the size and timing of this quarter's theatrical slate as well as the corresponding higher programming and production costs. At Theme Parks, revenue increased 12% to $2.1 billion, while EBITDA increased 16% to $782 million, our highest level of EBITDA on record for our fourth quarter. These results were driven by growth at our parks in the U.S. and Japan partially offset by our park in Beijing, which was negatively impacted by COVID-related restrictions.  At our U.S. parks, we continue to see strong demand with attendance and guest spending up year-over-year and with Orlando and Hollywood both delivering record high EBITDA for the fourth quarter. Universal Japan continued to rebound since capacity restrictions were lifted at the end of March and delivered strong year-over-year EBITDA growth in the quarter. Now let's turn to Slide 8 for Sky. Reported results were meaningfully impacted by currency translation due to the strengthening dollar, but I will speak to Sky's results on a constant currency basis. For the fourth quarter, Sky revenue was relatively consistent compared to last year at $4.4 billion.  Direct-to-consumer revenue was also consistent compared to last year, reflecting growth in the U.K. driven by wireless and broadband revenue offset by declines in Germany and Italy. On a customer basis, we added 129,000 customer relationships in the quarter with positive additions across all three territories, the U.K., Italy and Germany. These net additions were driven by streaming, broadband and wireless customer additions and reflect our team's strong execution in a challenging macroeconomic environment across Europe. Rounding out the rest of Sky revenue, content revenue increased 6.5% driven by licensing our entertainment content, and advertising revenue decreased 9.6% primarily driven by lower revenue in the U.K., reflecting the timing of the World Cup and the macro environment. Turning to EBITDA. Sky's EBITDA decreased 15% to $340 million, including $89 million of severance expense, which is $53 million higher compared to last year's fourth quarter. Excluding severance, EBITDA declined 2% compared to last year, reflecting an increase in direct network costs driven by growth in our residential mobile and broadband businesses and higher other expenses, which were mostly offset by lower programming costs due to the timing of sports programming as four weeks of EPL games were paused during the fourth quarter to accommodate the World Cup.  However, we will incur higher sports costs in the first half of 2023, reflecting the higher number of games as the season is extended and the remainder of the games which were paused are now played. Now I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 9. As I mentioned previously, in 2022, we generated around $12.6 billion in free cash flow while absorbing increased investments in Peacock and Theme Parks as well as higher working capital as content creation normalizes post COVID. Full year consolidated total capital investment increased 14.2% or $1.7 billion to $13.8 billion due to increased spending at NBCUniversal and Cable partially offset by a decrease at Sky. At Cable, total capital spending increased 8.3% or $695 million with CapEx intensity coming in at 11.4% primarily driven by investments to further strengthen and extend our network.  In 2023, we expect CapEx intensity to stay at around 11%, similar to 2022 levels as we aim to accelerate our homes passed growth to about 1 million and continue to transition our entire broadband network to DOCSIS 4.0 over the next few years. NBCUniversal total capital spending increased $1.4 billion driven by parks CapEx increasing $1.1 billion, of which Epic was around $800 million and reflects our continued investment in new attractions like Super Nintendo World at Hollywood and Donkey Kong at Japan.  In 2023, we expect parks CapEx to increase by around $1.2 billion over last year as we continue to build Epic, which we plan to open in 2025 and begin work on our recently announced park extensions mentioned earlier. The required investment to develop these extensions is nowhere near the scale of Epic or Universal Beijing but rather enable us to leverage our already large market opportunity and can serve as a model that contributes to even higher growth at Theme Parks in the future. Working capital was $3 billion for the year, a $1.5 billion increase over last year's level, reflecting a post-COVID ramp of investment in content creation.  Turning to capital allocation. We ended the year with net leverage at 2.4 times and returned a total of $17.7 billion to shareholders, including $4.7 billion in dividend payments and $13 billion in share repurchases. For 2023, we expect to continue to maintain leverage at around current levels, which I expect will support continued strong capital returns. As we announced this morning, we are raising the dividend by $0.08 a share to $1.16 per share, our 15th consecutive annual increase. This reflects our long-standing balanced capital allocation policy. We're committed to investing organically in the businesses while maintaining a strong balance sheet and also returning a very healthy amount of capital to shareholders.  Thanks for joining us on the call this morning. I'll turn it back to Marci, who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call. Thanks, Doug. It's Mike. So maybe I'll take a first crack, and then Brian can pile on if he likes. So vision in the next few years, it's -- I think how you think about that requires a little bit of a reflection of where we stand at the moment. So if I look at 2022 and you really reflect on what are truly excellent operating results. So kudos to the people running the businesses deep down into the organization to produce the kind of results we had, record revenues and record adjusted EBITDA. And that's fundamentally great management discipline, operating discipline, financial discipline in the day-to-day. When you zoom out a little bit, it puts us in a position where we are returning record capital in our industry at 2.4 times leverage, so it allows us the opportunity both of those things in good balance. To then go at your real question, which is what is our opportunity, what are our challenges and do we have the resources to go after them. And so I'd say there, you heard it in the call, but I'll recount them, we've got an excellent number of organic investments that are going after all the opportunities and challenges that we currently see. Obviously, as others emerge, we'll go after it the way we usually do. But those are you take the network and Dave can pile in. But we're on a path to 10G. So DOCSIS 4.0 is going to get us, as we've talked about, in a very capital-efficient way to a network that's going to have symmetrical upstream, downstream in a few short years. We're going to start rolling that out at the back end of this year.  So I think our commitment is to have the best network out there and to put a tremendous amount of services surrounding that network, whether it be WiFi or Flex and the like, as you've heard us talk about before. You heard about the tech platform. Brian mentioned it. We're going to get to a single global tech platform, integrating all of the build of glass in the U.K., X1 here in the U.S., what we do in Peacock behind a single scaled global tech platform that we can use in many ways. You know about the XUMO partnership that we have with Charter, for example, to take that capability outside of our footprint. And then finally, on the Cable side, it's a wireless. Wireless, we've been at it for five years, have 5 million lines now. We put the investment in along the way, and we continue to do it, but it's a capital-light approach. And I think that totality is a great set of strategies for how we're going to drive growth in the cable business looking ahead. And so I'd say, expect us to continue to keep driving along those lines. On the Media side, we think Peacock is absolutely the right strategy for our company. And Jeff has repeatedly said, we're not going to place somebody else's hand. We have an excellent business in NBC and our cable networks. We spend quite a bit of money creating content and so migrating some of that content as eyeballs move to a more streaming universe. We like what we're doing. And we had a phenomenal year getting paid subs to 20 million paid subs from less than 10 a year ago. And we see this coming year as the peak year in investment there, but we'll keep on that plan. And then finally, I'll mention parks. Parks, we've got Nintendo opening in Hollywood in February. We're ramping the build of what's going to be a phenomenal theme park, Epic universe in Orlando, opening in 2025. And as I said earlier, we'll increase our spend this year in '24 to sort of peak levels there ahead of that opening. And then we're leveraging the great product that we have with some new ideas, some innovation around that with a kids-based theme park, smaller scale in Dallas and Hollywood Hard Nights in Las Vegas. So these are big investment agendas that go out all the issues that I think are out there across our different businesses. So I think we're well positioned to continue to drive primarily an organic investment agenda and drive growth across our businesses in the years ahead.  Obviously, it's our job to consider inorganic things as they come up. But as I've said before, the bar is very high. It's our job to make sure that we are looking at organic opportunities and executing well against them, and I think we are. So Brian, you got anything to add? And then the -- on working capital, we said a year ago that it was going to be spiked to a higher than typical run rate level just on the back of the disruptions caused by COVID in getting content creation in the phase we're in up to normalized levels. So expect to just ease back off of the levels we saw in 2022. It's a hard number to predict, but I think we are past peak there. Yes. Consolidation, and Jeff can pile in too, I mean, I think when it comes to media consolidation, we'll see what happens. But I think go back to the earlier discussion, we've got a robust set of plans to invest in our own businesses. So anything that we would look at when we saw our job to consider things, we have healthy discussions. And our bias has to be to be investing behind our businesses themselves, where we control, operate, know what we're doing, have momentum, no surprises. So like I said, the -- across any inorganic opportunity, we're going to put ourselves through the real discussion. Is it worth it relative to the choices we have to invest in our own business, like Jeff just described? On the cost actions we took in the course of the year, it's really to get our businesses set up to drive the results we gave some commentary on the outlook. We don't give guidance, but I think consider it all factored into the outlooks that Jeff, Dave and I have given thus far on the call, which is, again, continued opportunity for expanding margins and growth in EBITDA in the cable business and everything Jeff just described on the Media side, including growth in parks, growth in studios and the net dynamics with linear versus Peacock in the Media side. And then, Phil, Mike. So just picking up on macro. I mean looking into 2023, as many businesses, just uncertainty about the environment, we took -- I'll tell you what we did on severance. We offered voluntary retirement across the company, something we do on a periodic basis, which has benefits, obviously, of giving more opportunities for younger talent anyway as well as some of the tactical situations we have in select businesses to just make sure we're as efficient as we can be heading into uncertain times. We've executed against all these things as we roll into 2023. So it's behind us."

Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Executive Vice President, Investor Relations Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead Ms. Ryvicker.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thank you operator, and welcome everyone. Joining me on this morning's call are Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh, Dave Watson, Jeff Shell and Dana Strong. Brian and Mike will make formal remarks while Dave, Jeff and Dana will also be available for Q&A. Let me now refer you to Slide 2, which contains our Safe Harbor disclaimer. I remind you that this conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our 8-K and trending schedules for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. With that let me turn the call over to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?\nBrian Roberts: Thanks, Marci and good morning, everyone. I'm really proud of the company and our results this quarter. We are reporting adjusted EBITDA growth of 6%, adjusted EPS growth of 10% and significant free cash flow, while also investing in our future and returning a record high amount of capital to our shareholders. The strong financials today are a testament to our focus on driving profitable growth through innovation as well as a reflection on the professionalism of our employees. Together, I believe we are collaborating and executing at the highest levels. I especially want to recognize and publicly thank all of our teammates in Florida as well as those who traveled to Florida over the last several weeks. They worked tirelessly to assist customers who were impacted by Hurricane Ian, even while many of these employees had their own losses. This was a devastating storm particularly for us, as we are the primary cable operator in most of the areas where it hit and we expect this affected about half of our traditional Florida seasonal customers. Digging into the third quarter, our results at Cable Communications again underscore the impressive consistency in this business, with 5% EBITDA growth and 120 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion bringing us to 45.1%, our highest margin on record. While we are still in a challenging environment in terms of depressed move activity and increased competition from new entrants, we were pleased to see that back-to-school provided a tailwind and we ended the third quarter with 14,000 net new broadband subscribers. There have been four primary drivers of revenue growth at our Cable segment: residential broadband units, residential broadband ARPU, wireless and business services. And while we don't anticipate residential broadband units to be a significant driver for now, we expect to maintain healthy growth in the other three, leading to continued strong financial performance at Cable for the foreseeable future. My confidence stems from the fact that we have always been able to strike the right balance between units and profitability. We compete aggressively while also staying focused on investing in and managing the business to deliver long-term profitable growth which is exactly what this quarter has shown. We have a distinct competitive advantage that goes beyond just fast and consistent speeds. We provide a differentiated and superior experience within the home, which is the foundation of our ARPU growth. For example, we offer reliable WiFi coverage in every room, device control and cybersecurity features and a world-class entertainment platform as well as other complementary solutions like Xfinity Mobile that increase the value and utility of our broadband product even more. All of this is only getting better as we further improve our network and we're making great progress.  During the quarter we announced that we have begun to roll out multi-gig download speeds combined with up to 5 to 10x faster upload speeds. And we expect to have this available at 20% of our footprint by the end of this year and to the vast majority of our footprint by the end of 2025.  Directly on the back of this we're completing the core technical foundation for 10G and we're transitioning to a cloud-based virtualized network as we work towards DOCSIS 4.0 which will enable us to deliver multi-gig symmetrical speeds to customers beginning in the back half of next year.  Looking further ahead the combination of our high-capacity network differentiated broadband experience and our terrific MVNO in wireless puts Comcast in a winning position to offer in-home and mobile connectivity that is both robust and ubiquitous. And it doesn't involve trade-offs which is going to become even more important as people's level of data consumption and overall expectations continue to rise overtime.  On average our broadband customers who don't subscribe to traditional video from us are already using nearly 650 gigabytes of data per month and that's just today. We are doing a fantastic job leveraging our wireless business. We're still in the very early growth phase in penetrating this segment and we're having a lot of success. We added 333,000 wireless lines the most of any quarter to date. And this morning we announced that we now have over five million Xfinity Mobile lines and we're just getting started. So summing up we're pleased with our strong financial performance at Cable. We're encouraged by the long-term trends in demand for connectivity and our competitive advantages. And we're confident in our future growth. At NBCUniversal we saw some great momentum with EBITDA growth of 25%, despite the tough comparison to the Tokyo Olympics last year. Our Park segment continues to be a real standout generating the highest quarterly EBITDA on record driven by growth in each of our geographies including Beijing which hit profitability for the first time since the grand opening last September. We're seeing clear evidence that the investments we made throughout the pandemic continue to pay off. We launched Super Nintendo World in Japan, the Velocicoaster in Orlando, Secret Life of Pets in Hollywood and our drumbeat of innovation goes on. For example, Super Nintendo World will open in Hollywood early next year. We're adding another Nintendo-themed area, Donkey Kong to Japan in 2024. And I'm especially excited for Epic Universe to open in the summer of 2025 which will transform Universal Orlando into a weeklong destination.  Studios also performed exceptionally well resulting from a huge summer box office led by Jurassic World, Minions, Black Phone and Nope. Our leadership is driving change in the industry. Our flexible windowing strategy has enhanced the overall profitability of our Studios business and it's also had a significant positive carryover to Peacock which just started to benefit from our new Pay-One agreement. At the end of the third quarter, Peacock had more than 15 million highly engaged paid subscribers in the US. On top of that 15 million, Peacock also had approximately 14 million bundled and free users totaling around 30 million monthly active accounts. Peacock has become the best streaming value in the market providing customers with a massive premium content offering across movies, TV entertainment, sports, and news in English and in Spanish. And with less than five minutes of ads per hour for just $5 per month, it is really a great value. Our sports content is unmatched with customers enjoying live coverage of the biggest leagues and events including the NFL with Sunday Night Football, MLB, Premier League, Notre Dame, Big 10 starting in 2023 as well as the WWE and marquee events including Super Bowl and Olympics, French Open, US Open, Tour de France, Triple Crown, and later this year, the World Cup. We also provide the best of other sports with very passionate fan communities including IndyCar, Supercross, and Track and Field. We're seeing a nice uplift from our next-day broadcast which at last are exclusively ours. And coming up through the rest of this year and into 2023 is a strong slate of highly anticipated originals from proven creators including the Best Fan, Mrs. Davis, Poker Face, and others. While it only launched a little over two years ago, Peacock is already an important part of our portfolio and reflects how we're running our Media business holistically. Switching gears, the UK and other European markets have been adversely affected by the Ukraine conflict as we all know higher energy costs, higher interest rates, higher overall inflation, and currency headwinds. This quarter we took a non-cash charge as a result of all of this at Sky based on this environment which Mike will talk a bit more about. Our Sky team is working hard amidst this changing economic backdrop that's putting pressure on the average customer in the region. We remain focused on customer retention as well as providing the best experience and value in entertainment and connectivity, which contributed to the highest quarterly customer growth since we've owned Sky, including some nice momentum in our broadband and wireless business. We are keeping an eye on churn and acknowledge that ARPU may be affected in the future as customers deal with this unstable and inflationary environment. We are successfully managing through a variety of measures and we remain disciplined on our cost structure. We reset the majority of our major sports rights within the last two years and are looking for more efficiency in a number of areas. So, looking at the company as a whole all of us are paying attention to economists' and other experts' view about how some of these issues in Europe may come to the US. And while we are certainly not immune to potential macroeconomic headwinds, I firmly believe that Comcast is in a very strong position relative to our peers and most other companies. We are a leader in very large and highly profitable markets. And our healthy balance sheet and substantial free cash flow generation enable us to continue to invest organically in our strategic initiatives while simultaneously returning a substantial amount of capital to our shareholders. We pay nearly $5 billion in dividends per year and we bought back $9.5 billion of our shares year-to-date through the third quarter. We have a great business including a fantastic team. Earlier this month, we announced that we promoted Mike Cavanagh to President. For the past seven years Mike has been an incredible leader, partner and friend. And we are both very focused on continuing to innovate and grow this wonderful company for all our employees, customers and guests. So it's my pleasure to hand it over to Mike. \nMike Cavanagh: Thanks, Brian. I look forward to the new role. It's quite an honor, and I appreciate the trust that you and the Board continue to have in me. I'm excited to work with the leaders on this call, Dana, Dave and Jeff and all of our colleagues to take advantage of the great opportunities for Comcast's future. So now I'll begin on slide 4 with our third quarter consolidated 2022 financial results. Revenue decreased 1.5% to $29.8 billion, reflecting the comparison to last year's quarter, which included the Tokyo Summer Olympics as well as a headwind from currency translation at Sky and our international theme parks due to the strengthening dollar. After adjusting for both of these items, our revenue was up about 7% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 5.9% to $9.5 billion and on a constant currency basis increased about 8%. We generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow and we reported an EPS loss of $1.05 per share, which was mainly impacted by an impairment charge at Sky. We test goodwill annually across the company in the third quarter. Challenging economic conditions in the UK and other European markets have resulted in a significant increase in discount rates used in the annual impairment analysis and reduced estimated future cash flows at Sky. As a result, we have taken an impairment charge related to Sky goodwill and intangible assets totaling $8.6 billion. On an adjusted basis EPS increased 10% to $0.96 per share. And on a constant currency basis, adjusted EPS increased about 12%. Now let's turn to our business segment results starting with Cable Communications on slide 5. Cable revenue increased 2.6% to $16.5 billion, driven by higher rate and volume in residential broadband as well as growth in business services, wireless and advertising. The strong growth in these businesses was partially offset by lower revenue in video and voice. Total customer relationships were up 315,000 compared to last year and down 21,000 sequentially in the third quarter. Diving further into the details, first our revenue growth drivers. Broadband revenue increased 5.7% driven by growth in ARPU and in our customer base compared to last year. Broadband ARPU increased 3.7% year-over-year consistent with the growth rate in the second quarter. We expect ARPU growth will continue to be the primary driver of our residential broadband revenue growth in the near term. Wireless revenue increased 31% mainly driven by service revenue, which was fueled by growth in customer lines. We added 1.3 million lines over the last year including 333,000 lines in the quarter, which is our highest number of net additions for any quarter on record and marks the fourth consecutive quarter of adding more than 300,000 lines. Business services revenue increased 9.4% or approximately 5% excluding the acquisition of Masergy, which closed at the beginning of last year's fourth quarter. This healthy organic growth was driven by increases in both ARPU and our customer base. We continue to see healthy performance across our diverse customer segments including SMB, mid-market and enterprise with this quarter's organic growth driven by a mix shift to a higher data speeds and increased sales of our advanced services, as well as rate increases and growth in our customer base. Advertising revenue increased 7.2% primarily driven by political and our advanced advertising business FreeWheel partially offset by a decline in our local core advertising business and the absence of our streaming business XUMO. As we previously announced XUMO is now part of our joint venture with Charter with those results reported in Corporate and Other. If we exclude the impact of XUMO, cable advertising revenue would have increased 12%. Partially offsetting the growth from these revenue drivers was video revenue, which declined 4.4%, driven by year-over-year customer net losses partially offset by 6% ARPU growth due to a residential rate increase at the beginning of this year. And last, voice revenue declined 12.5% primarily reflecting year-over-year customer losses. Turning to expenses. Cable Communications third quarter expenses increased 0.5%, reflecting higher non-programming expenses mostly offset by lower programming expenses. Programming expenses decreased 2.8% reflecting the year-over-year decline in video customer\u2019s, partially offset by higher contractual rates. Non-programming expenses increased 2.5% driven by growth in other expenses due to an increase in bad debt compared to last year, reflecting a return to more normalized levels and increased technical and product support expenses driven by growth in our wireless business as well as the addition of Masergy. These higher costs were partially offset by a decline in advertising marketing and promotion expenses partly due to the comparison to last year, which included some Olympic sponsorship spending as well as lower activity levels. The lower activity levels coupled with the improvements we continue to make in our customer experience also contributed to the decrease in customer service expenses. Cable EBITDA increased 5.4% to $7.5 billion in the quarter with Cable EBITDA margins improving 120 basis points year-over-year, reaching a record high of 45.1%. And on a per customer relationship basis, we grew EBITDA 4% as we focus on monetizing these relationships over their lifetime. Before moving to NBCUniversal, Hurricane Ian has impacted our footprint in Southwest Florida causing outages and damage to our cable network that our cable team is still repairing. Many of our customers' homes and commercial locations were severely damaged or destroyed. While our third quarter results were not impacted by the storm, we expect to report an impact in the fourth quarter including net losses of broadband customers. Now let's turn to slide 6 for NBCUniversal. Starting with total NBCUniversal results, revenue decreased 4.3% to $9.6 billion, reflecting the difficult comparison to last year, which included $1.8 billion from the Tokyo Olympics included in our media segment. EBITDA increased to 24.6% to $1.7 billion. Media revenue decreased 23% to $5.2 billion, again reflecting the comparison to the revenue associated with the Tokyo Olympics last year. Excluding the Olympics, Media revenue increased 4.4% driven by Peacock with revenue of $506 million, which more than doubled compared to last year. Distribution revenue increased 4.6% reflecting growth at Peacock driven by increases in paid subscribers compared to last year, as well as higher contractual rates at our networks partially offset by linear subscriber declines that accelerated sequentially. Advertising revenue increased 4.7% reflecting strong increases from Peacock, partially offset by a decline in linear advertising. Media EBITDA decreased 41.5% to $583 million in the third quarter, including a $614 million EBITDA loss at Peacock. We continue to expect Peacock's EBITDA loss will be roughly $2.5 billion for the year, with the fourth quarter's loss reflecting the cost of new content. Excluding Peacock Media EBITDA in the third quarter decreased 21% reflecting the difficult comparison to last year's Tokyo Olympics, as well as revenue pressure at our linear networks. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect Media growth ex-Peacock to be impacted by a gradual acceleration in pay TV cord cutting, as well as some deterioration in the ad market reflecting broader economic uncertainty, as well as higher costs associated with the broadcast of the World Cup on Telemundo. Moving to Studios. Revenue increased 31% to $3.2 billion driven by strong theatrical and content licensing revenue. Theatrical revenue more than doubled compared to last year, driven by the success of our summer film slate including Jurassic World: Dominion, Minions: Rise of Gru, Black Phone and Nope. In addition, content licensing was up 17% driven by the benefit of our carryover titles and the acceleration in film windows, as well as healthy growth in television licensing. EBITDA increased $358 million to $537 million for the quarter primarily reflecting the higher theatrical and content licensing revenue, partially offset by the corresponding higher programming and production costs, and also the benefit of the timing of marketing costs that we incurred in the second quarter for films in the third quarter. Last at Theme Parks, revenue increased 42% to $2.1 billion. And EBITDA increased 89% to $819 million, our highest level of EBITDA on record. These results were driven by growth in each of our parks. At Universal Beijing, we had our first profitable quarter since opening compared to the third quarter last year, when it incurred $130 million of preopening costs. At our US parks, we continue to see strong demand with attendance and guest spending increasing year-over-year. In fact, Orlando, broke a new record delivering its highest level of EBITDA for a third quarter despite the park being closed for two days due to Hurricane Ian. Universal Japan, continues to rebound since capacity restrictions were lifted at the end of March and compared to last year when the park operated under more strict COVID-related controls.  Now let's turn to Slide 7 for Sky. As I said earlier, our reported results were meaningfully impacted from the currency translation due to the strengthening dollar, but I will speak to Sky's results on a constant currency basis. For the third quarter, Sky revenue was consistent compared to last year at $4.3 billion, as low single-digit growth in the UK was mostly offset by lower revenue in Italy and Germany. Direct-to-consumer revenue was also consistent compared to last year, reflecting low single-digit growth in the UK driven by broadband and wireless revenue offset by declines in Italy and Germany. On a customer basis, we added 320,000 customer relationships in the quarter, with positive additions across all three territories: the UK, Italy and Germany. These net additions were driven by streaming customers, due to the timing of unique content and the early start of football seasons, including the EPL to accommodate the timing of the World Cup in the fourth quarter. We do not expect a similar level of additions in the fourth quarter. Rounding out the rest of revenue at Sky, content revenue increased 6.4% driven by licensing our entertainment content. And advertising revenue decreased 1.6%, with lower revenue in Italy, and relatively flat revenue in the UK and Germany, reflecting the difficult macro environment. Turning to EBITDA. Sky's EBITDA decreased 15.5% to $701 million, primarily reflecting the timing of sports costs, again, due to the early start of the football seasons and the shift of matches into the third quarter to accommodate the timing of the World Cup in the fourth quarter. While this shift will benefit sports costs in the fourth quarter as four weeks of games are paused, results will also be impacted by the challenging economic environment in Europe. And we will incur higher sports costs in the first half of 2023, reflecting the higher number of games as the season is extended and the remainder of the paused games are played. Now, I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on slide 8. We generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow this quarter. Consolidated total capital increased 24% due to increased spending at NBCUniversal and Cable, partially offset by a decrease at Sky. The increase at NBCUniversal was driven by higher CapEx at parks, as we continue to invest in attractions and make significant progress in building Epic Universe in Orlando. Cable capital spend increased 17% with CapEx intensity coming in at 12.2%, due to timing. On a year-to-date basis, Cable CapEx intensity was 10.4%, and we continue to expect Cable CapEx intensity to be around 11% for the year. Working capital was $1 billion for the third quarter, reflecting the continued ramp in content creation and the timing of annual sports rights payments. As we enter the fourth quarter and look to our year ahead, we remain focused on driving long-term growth during an increasingly challenged economic environment. As a result, we expect we'll be taking severance and other cost reduction-related charges in the fourth quarter in anticipation of expense reduction actions that will provide benefits in 2023 and beyond. Wrapping-up with capital allocation, last month, we increased our buyback authorization to $20 billion, up from $10 billion. And during the quarter, we repurchased $3.5 billion worth of our shares. In addition, dividend payments totaled $1.2 billion for a total return of capital in the third quarter of $4.7 billion. We ended the quarter with net leverage at 2.3 times, in line with our expectations for leverage to remain around 2.4 times. Thanks for joining us on the call this morning. I'll turn it back to Marci, who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Mike. Operator, let's open the call for Q&A please.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you. Good morning. Brian, I'd love to hear from you, how you're thinking about capital allocation given just we've had this significant increase in cost of capital and investors are highly focused on where you guys are making your big bet in the business. How are you thinking about priorities, including M&A, just given the backdrop we're in right now and some of the macro concerns we see ahead of us? And along those lines, one of the big announcements you guys and you talked about in your prepared remarks is into the cable network around DOCSIS 4. So, I'd love to hear from Dave, sort of what are the capital needs to get where you want to go over the next few years? Is that going to drive up CapEx? Is there an argument to spend the money faster to help the business differentiate better in the market, or how do you think about the benefits to the business from getting to DOCSIS 4.0 over the next few years? Thank you.\nBrian Roberts: Thanks, Ben. Let me just start and then kick it to Mike. Given his new job, I'm looking for him to help on those capital allocation questions quite a bit. But I think the bar is the highest it's been in terms of M&A. Obviously, cost of capital has gone up and we think our stock is attractive and have increased the buyback as Mike just said, we announced both in actions this quarter and in our Board authorization. So, we feel really great about that opportunities to look at things, but we really like the company we've got. Mike, why don't you do that? Dave can talk about DOCSIS 4.\nMike Cavanagh: Sure, Ben. Thanks. Good morning. So, I'd just step back a little bit and think about what we do with capital through the lens of start with how we generate capital. So, if you look at this quarter, you see we had record margins in the Cable business, 45%. We had record profits in the Theme Parks business and record profits in the Studio businesses, so just to call out a few examples. And those are the result of us putting tremendous energy and effort and capital back in our businesses. So, when we talk about the formula that we've got, it's always with the view to have growth opportunities in our existing businesses, so we can put capital to work and in the future get the kind of results we've had now on the back of the investments that we have had in the past. So, priority one right now is to invest in the network. I'll let Dave expand on that. But we've got a great path to symmetrical multi-gig through DOCSIS 4.0 in a reasonable time frame at reasonable cost inside the envelope that we talked about of about 11% CapEx intensity. We've got Theme Parks with Epic Universe well underway. We've got investment in streaming with Peacock that Jeff will talk about. So, we're excited about putting money first and foremost back into our businesses to drive great results for years to come. And so that's the virtuous cycle that you see. So that's step one, put money back in the business. Two, keep a strong balance sheet. We get asked a lot about that. But I think, when you look at the environment we're in, I think we're happy to have what I would say is the best strongest balance sheet in the business period. So, I think that's piece two. And then piece three and I'm very happy with the results Brian talked about $9.5 billion of buybacks year-to-date, $5 billion-ish run rate of dividends for the year. We were asked the questions over the last several years, are we committed? And when we got back to leverage targets would we be able to -- would we be committed, are we committed to returning capital to shareholders? And we said all along that it was our highest priority to get back to that place, but to do it in the context of the formula I just described. So, I think, hopefully, everybody has confidence that we understand that formula and you all understand that formula. So as you look ahead on capital return, I think, we're going to be guided as we've been in the recent past by our leverage. We'll stay around 2.4 times leverage while doing all the things I just described and that will dictate ample amount of return to shareholders. So that's that. And then, I think, on the M&A side of things, it's -- we like the business we have. With all the opportunities we have in the businesses and the stock where it is, I see us very focused on the opportunities in the business and as I just described. So I'll give Dave -- over to Dave for DOCSIS 4.0. \nDavid Watson: Thanks, Mike. Hello, Ben. So one of the -- our game plans have always been to consistently invest in the network. I think our network is one of our core strengths. We have this ubiquitous footprint and we serve every segment with, I think, a great round of broadband tiers. So -- and we're able to do things like we just announced, the 20 million customers just had a speed upgrade. We've been doing this consistently. So the initiatives that we have are -- it's a great road map, starting with what we've talked about mid-split capability in DOCSIS and that rolls to DOCSIS 4.0. And also we're going to play offense to just adding more passing. So we're anticipating longer-term growth in broadband, real opportunities in every segment. And so, in terms of mid-splits, we're rolling it out right now, delivering multi-gig download speeds and upload speeds that are on a 200 to 300 megabits, which is up to 10 times faster than our current upload speed. So will be deployed to 20% of our footprint by the end of this year and will be -- by the end of 2025 we'll be -- it will be serving the vast majority of our footprint with mid-split. And then on the back of this to DOCSIS 4.0, will be in the market in the second half of 2023 with multi-gig symmetrical speeds, as Mike mentioned. And the vast majority of our footprint will begin the process in 2025. So we do all of this with the CapEx intensity of around 11%. And we're able to do this as we virtualize key parts of the network. It's part of the road map to be able to do this. So we'll have the most effective and efficient, I think, game plan in regards to the network. And we're also going to limit the amount of CPE change-outs that are required, whether its video set-top boxes, gateways, we're able to just focus on serving every segment effectively and efficiently. So -- and what we're seeing, it's early, but we really like the customer experience benefits as we do this. But it's a really effective very efficient road map. We're real pleased with our position to serve ubiquitously. I think -- by the way, one of the big reasons why our -- that we have a near record low churn, because our network is so solid. \nBen Swinburne: Thanks, everyone.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Ben, Next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks, so much. One for Mike, one for Dave. Congrats Mike on the promotion. On the hurricane commentary for the 4Q net losses of broadband customers is there any sizing or context for how big the hurricane impact might be? And whether ex hurricane there would have been positive broadband net adds for 4Q, if I heard your comment correctly? And then for Dave, I just wanted to follow-up on DOCSIS 4.0 from Ben's question. I'm just curious how would you articulate the end state for DOCSIS 4.0-based network or node versus a fiber-based one? There's a lot of debate as to whether DOCSIS will be fully competitive on speed and latency particularly from a consumer perception basis? And is there any other benefits to an upgraded plan that we should consider relative to your operations today as you push forward these upgrades? Thank you both.\nMike Cavanagh: Thanks Doug. I'll let Dave really chime in. It's his team that's doing amazing work to get the network back up in Southwest Florida those are our markets. They were -- like Brian said earlier, our plant was the one hit hardest. It will be in the tens of thousands, but we're still working on the numbers in terms of homes that -- residences that won't turn back on, but we'll tell you what the number is when we get through it during the course of this quarter. And you can look back at some hurricane experiences, it's typically tens and tens of thousands.\nDave Watson: Hey, Doug. Let me -- so, piggyback on what Mike was saying in regards to the hurricane really remarkable. We have just amazing teammates that respond to these moments. It's just incredible. I think it's a testament to how we run the business. We run it very locally. And so our teammates live and work in these communities which we serve. And so, they were positioned to get to work almost immediately even when in some cases, they're personally dealing with situation. So we've started rebuilding and repairing right away. It's a pretty big area of impact for us in Florida. It's about -- in terms of just sizing, it seasonally, it's about half of our seasonal activity that was impacted by this hurricane. So, when you look at it, I think Mike mentioned in terms of the overall impact on subs with -- have that kind of impact that will be negative in terms of broadband. But when you look at the underlying business, I think we're around the same as where we were in Q3. The conditions are similar in that regard. So, in terms of fiber, in terms of DOCSIS that in state, I think we have all the benefits of DOCSIS the roadmap that we have. And in terms of the customer experience, in terms of multi-gig speeds that are symmetrical and the roadmap that we have I don't really see a difference. And by the way, we build a lot of fiber into our network today. And we were able with this architecture to feather in fiber to be able to serve MDUs directly where needed. And so we just have the flexibility within DOCSIS to pull fiber deeper as needed. And so, we actually provide a significant amount of fiber today already. But we really don't to -- it minimizes as I mentioned Doug earlier the need to change out a bunch of CapEx. But I really like the roadmap to get to multi-gig symmetrical over the long run. And to me that puts us right there and do it in a ubiquitous way where other network providers are having to pick and choose how they get to certain communities. We serve every community with our every tier of broadband that we have.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks Doug. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nCraig Moffett : Yes. Hi. Let's talk about wireless if we could a bit. There have been reports that you've been pretty aggressively deploying strand-mounted small cells to offload traffic. I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about your experience thus far with traffic offload. It's still today mostly on Wi-Fi. But what you're thinking in terms of how much traffic can be offloaded? And is there the potential for something broader than just the CBRS strategy with getting some of your own mid-band spectrum to try to offload significantly more traffic? And just what do you think the margins of that business could ultimately look like?\nDave Watson : Hey, Craig, Dave. So let me start with where we're at right now with mobile and I'll talk about spectrum. We really like our trajectory in mobile. Obviously, we had a record-setting net add quarter. And so we like our capital-light approach. We like our position what we're able to do competitively, how we surround broadband. With mobile we get to play offense. And we also get to package mobile with business services. Business services in small business is in the market now with mobile and having -- it's early, but having great success out of the gates with that. So when you combine By the Gig with new unlimited pricing that we have and then compare it against the telephone companies, we can help customers save up to 50% in some cases. So it's -- we're well positioned to compete with mobile today. But -- and as I said so we really like our position the capital light that we have. But we do view providing enhanced 5G connectivity service areas where we have a high concentration of traffic as a very good potential opportunity. So we've always been opportunistic. Today Wi-Fi is a part of how we look at managing our network. Most of the traffic goes over Wi-Fi today. So we look at the spectrum whether it's CBRS or 600 megahertz spectrum as a good opportunity. So there's nothing new really to talk about, but we're testing. And we've talked about that before. We're working closely with Charter on modeling out the potential in these high dense traffic areas and what the savings could be. But no new news at this point Craig in terms of specific modeling opportunities. But we do look at it as a potential opportunity down the road. \nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Craig. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBrett Feldman: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. So you mentioned during your prepared remarks that for now you would expect that broadband ARPU growth would be the primary driver of overall broadband revenue growth. We've definitely gotten a little pushback from investors on that. They look at a more competitive market and households having lots of other pressures in their budgets in an inflationary environment. And so what gives you confidence that you can sustain a profile of ARPU growth? How do you think that's going to break down between rate increases or upselling or maybe something else? Thank you.\nDave Watson : Well, good question. And part of it is our results. You look at our results consistently that we've had in a very competitive environment, we've been dealing with very intense competitive activity for a long time now. We've had fiber overbuild now over -- just over 40% new competitive entrants. And so we've been able to -- and part of the reason why, I think, we do perform well and we have a balanced approach in terms of share and ARPU is we serve every segment and we break it down by every segment. So we had healthy ARPU growth of 3.7% in Q3. And we look at the opportunities to focus on tier mix as an opportunity. So starting with HSD-only and then how we package. And we surround again we leverage mobile to do some of the lifting in terms of value and focusing on broadband ARPU there. We take a very balanced approach towards rates. We do have rate increases that we manage through. And we've had -- segmentation is part of our acquisition plan but it's also part of our retention plan. We have -- we model out retention opportunities by segment. And so we've been very disciplined, I think, in terms of all these things. And so it's an opportunity for us to drive both share and balance ARPU growth. We've been doing it over a very long time. And we anticipate competition to be very substantial. And -- but we also look at the road map that we have and being able to leverage mobile and other services. And so we like our position. We've always taken a balanced approach towards ARPU and share. \nBrian Roberts: And just one other point to add, you know, long-term or longer term, I continue to believe broadband is so critical. It's such an important dynamic part of our society and it's changing all the time, and people want the best. And the best is experience. It's speed, it's innovation, it's service and that's what we're really focused on and we've been that way. And I think it's why we have the number one position today and we want to retain that. \nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Brett. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good morning. Just sticking in the Cable business. If you look at the pace of video revenue, would you expect the current pace of video cord cutting to continue at this level? And how much of the video losses that you're experiencing are simply a function of changing customer preferences for consumption relative to the elasticity from the pricing initiatives to offset the higher programming costs? \nDave Watson: I'll start. This is Dave. The -- I anticipate the changing nature of video to continue. We've anticipated it. We've looked at this. We've been able to manage through it and the focus on multiple growth drivers for us in terms of broadband, business services, mobile events. But we also have looked at video as a broad platform opportunity. So, yes, we've had the fluid nature of video putting pressure on the more mature tiers of video service, but we've also offset a substantial part of that through Flex. We've invested in the ability to do smart TV thanks -- the joint venture with Charter is an opportunity. So we view video as an opportunity long-term as a platform. So we will continue to focus on that. And I think that will balance both things. But we've navigated through I think this before but I don't see it changing. \nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Mike. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. \nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Questions. One on Cable and one on NBCU. On Cable you talked like I guess it was about nine years ago when you introduced or announced the Comcast Technology Center. Can you talk about the progress you've made in making Comcast a leading hub of innovation how your view of Comcast position I think you called it like unique cross-section of media and technology. How has that changed over time or evolved? And then on NBCU I can't believe you haven't gotten questions really. But what are the long-term aspirations for Peacock let's say over the next three to 4 five years what do you think it will look like? And can you talk about on Theme Parks the advanced bookings or visibility? Are international visitors coming back yet? \nJeff Shell: Yes. We'll take it -- this is Jeff Jessica. I was hoping to get no questions so you broke my streak here. But we're going to do it in reverse order a little bit here. So in the Theme Park business record quarter in the third quarter first quarter ever profitability in Beijing. And despite the economic uncertainty that you see elsewhere in the economy we're seeing no effects of that right now in the Theme Parks even in terms of our performance our actual performance or our bookings going forward. Florida is really strong. Hollywood is really strong. Japan really ended the quarter pretty strong. So it kind of defies logic a little bit but part of it is based on the investments Brian outlined in his opening were really paying off. So the Theme Park business is really strong and we're seeing no weakness there. As far as Peacock our long-term aspirations on Peacock is for it to be -- to balance out our overall Media business. I think we've said all along that we -- our strategy in streaming is different than some of the premium SVOD players like Netflix and Disney+. We view it as a part of our business. We manage it as one. We make decisions on programming as one. We sell advertising across the business as one. And as viewership shifts to -- from linear to Peacock we want Peacock to get to a level and a scale that causes our business to be balanced as consumer sentiments and advertiser sentiments change. And very pleased with our performance in this quarter over 15 million and we're right on track for what we expected to do as we've built that business.\nBrian Roberts: Okay. Dave, why don't you start on innovation and I'll add at the end? I think it's a great question.\nDave Watson: Yeah, it is Jessica. So this is -- this facility is a big part not the only part, but a big part of how we think about long-term growth and innovation. And so it really -- when you think about the teams over there it culturally has changed the company I think in terms of getting multiple groups multiple teams together to work on exciting projects that literally changes categories. And if you look at video what we -- the question before you go from the linear video delivery system to a broad-based platform on multiple devices. This innovation happened with teams over there being able to change broadband and to tie in WiFi and to be able to do it for residential and business services and being able to deliver leading gateway devices and the road map that I talked about from mid-split to DOCSIS 4.0 happened over there. In addition, the teams are changing the customer experience there as well and very focused on digital and what is possible to be able to help customers do everything over any device. And so, you look at where things are going the Internet of Things being able with devices and cameras being able to tie everything together. This is where these teams are focused on what's possible. So, it really has been game changing in terms of what we've been doing.\nBrian Roberts: I'll just quickly add that post the pandemic, it's pretty exciting to walk through the technology center and see people back at work and the energy and buzz. But I think of ourselves as a unique media and technology company and we're focused on this sector. We view the competition has changed. It includes the tech companies on the West Coast and we have been looking to add to that scale. And I think we made real progress in the last 12 months for things like our voice remote which for those who have it, whether you're using it for a streaming service or for a video bundle, were to now do other things and look up your account and many other aspects of how voice is deeply embedded in all of our products on Sky Glass globally. We now have between Sky, the new Charter arrangement previous deals with Cox and all of Canadian operators are virtually all a roadmap for innovation. And I think as we look forward to the company that's what's going to keep powering what Mike was talking about the virtuous cycle of investment and return. So, we're all mindful of the economy and the world that we live in, but we have a pretty unique company. And this is a big part of what I think will make it more unique in the future is to continue to try to innovate. So, glad you asked that question. \nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks Jessica. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Philip Cusick with JPMorgan.\nPhilip Cusick: Hi guys. Thank you and Mike congratulations again. We've danced around it a little bit. But Brian I want to ask about your sort of vision of the video ecosystem because we see this linear acceleration to the downside. Peacock is growing, but Comcast and Charter and I think Cox customers get that for free now. And so maybe Brian talk about where the video ecosystem is growing and how the company shifts the way you make money there? And Jeff remind us what success is in Peacock paying subs and MAUs over time and how you sort of balance that Media business model overall? Is that fair?\nBrian Roberts: Very fair. I think let me just start and I'll let my colleagues join in. The way we're trying to manage the company and we said this several years ago, which was a shift was we saw a change coming and we tried to think like a customer and think like the consumer. And we've learned I -- at least think I've tried to learn from other successes with that mentality. And the consumers many consumers didn't want the big video package. And so what -- we can fight that or we can try to embrace it. And so our leadership in broadband was the first evidence of okay let's try to embrace it. Let's put Netflix on X1 going back several years. And more people I think in a Comcast market view Netflix via X1 than any other device. I think that's still relatively true, Dave you can comment on that. Our voice remote integrated all of Netflix's content and along came many others. Let's just jump to Apple most recently. I think we have the best integration in the world of Apple TV+ on our consumer devices. Over on the content side at NBCUniversal that create -- that change allowed us to create content for Netflix or Amazon or Apple many others. We own one-third of Hulu. So when we bought the company, all of our content was committed to Hulu in the streaming -- much of our content. As we've discussed that relationship's in -- changed and much of it is now back on Peacock. And Peacock has only been out there for a couple of years and super successful and a great quarter. And congratulations to all of NBCUniversal and the Peacock team for the results this quarter in my opinion. And we came up with a different model since we were starting at a different time and ad-centric low cost to the consumer. So again it's back thinking from the consumer's perspective, how do we fit in and how do we do so on a profitable long-term value-creating way. And so the results you're seeing this quarter, I mean if you look at last year, last year was our best year in EBITDA and our best year in EPS in the 60 years Comcast has been in business. And we're on pace to do better in this year than last year. So I think we have a good model, but it starts with thinking from the customer. And so the shift in video, we got to a place where we're actually somewhat indifferent. What the consumer prefers we want to be for the customer. And then if they're now taking our mobile product, they're getting an even better value. And if they're taking Peacock, they're getting an even continued relationship with NBC if they've changed how they're consuming. So I think we're in a very unique playing offense in a very changing world in a way that continues to yield great results for the company. \nJeff Shell: Yeah. So let me jump in Brian, and Phil I\u2019ll take your question on Peacock. So if you go to 30,000 feet and look at the NBCUniversal business, the business at our core is producing content. And if you look at this quarter alone most successful profitable quarter in the history of the movie business. We think our movie business is second to none right now. Our TV business has expanded dramatically. We sell as Brian said to others in addition to ourselves. Our news division second to none, and our sports division is doing really great. And so if you want to -- if you have a great content business the way you maximize your returns is having platforms where you can have the flexibility to put your content on your own platforms and move it around to give your content the best chance of success. And we've had that over the years. So when you look at Peacock what is the definition of success? It's really two things. One is taking that ecosystem that I just talked about and giving yourself an addition to your platform, which allows you more flexibility to maximize the return of your content both in terms of allowing it -- a show to have a better chance of being a hit or a movie to have a better return when you can move it around, and have the right platform for the right piece of content. So we want to get Peacock to a scale where we're fairly indifferent between content going on linear and content going on Peacock and having the best platform out there. And we think we're well on our way to that. The second is just the traditional way you look at any investment, which is that we're investing a lot of money in Peacock. And we view the fact that it's going to get to a level of profitability that will generate a return on that investment that will add value to shareholders. And this quarter makes us more confident that we're along that trajectory. So those are really the two measures.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks Phil. Operator, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Hodulik from UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Hey, thank you. Maybe last one for Dave, back on the Cable side. The business market certainly emerged as one of the drivers of revenue growth in that segment. And it sounds like you guys are having some real success across small, medium and enterprise markets. I mean just any commentary on sort of penetration levels in those markets give us a sense of how much runway you have? And then commentary on sort of the profitability of that business segment versus say the rest of the Cable business? Thanks.\nDave Watson: Hey, John, so look we \u2013 as Brian mentioned, one of the core growth drivers for us is business services. I'm really glad you asked about it because the team is doing an outstanding job. When you look at our performance in business services, we outperformed all competitors and peers. It really is a very interesting long-term consistent performance from our group. Bill Stemper and the team have really done a terrific job. And we're generating now approaching $10 billion in annual revenue and have a great opportunity to grow further. So it's high margins. And you look at the addressable marketplace, we're serving less than \u2013 we have less than 20% share of our addressable marketplace of $50 billion in our footprint. So you break it down SMB, we are \u2013 along with share and very focused on that but we're also very focused on the corollary to what we talked about early in residential is ARPU. And we focus both share and revenue and with WiFi, enhanced WiFi for small business customers, wireless backup, cameras security and now mobile. So we have a strong portfolio to go up against the telephone companies with and it's working. So very balanced approach towards growth. In mid-market and enterprise, it is a key long-term growth opportunity. And there it's more sophisticated applications like SD-WAN, enhanced security and UCaaS, the advanced unified messaging. So \u2013 and Masergy has just been a terrific addition, giving us international scale in being able to help us with certain applications. So no specifics beyond that but it really is a very important part of our business and they're doing a terrific job. \nEnd of Q&A:\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks John. And thank you everyone for joining us this morning.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer session and today's conference call. A replay of the call will be available starting at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time today on Comcast Investor Relations website. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect.",

So the Theme Park business is really strong and we're seeing no weakness there. As far as Peacock our long-term aspirations on Peacock is for it to be -- to balance out our overall Media business. I think we've said all along that we -- our strategy in streaming is different than some of the premium SVOD players like Netflix and Disney+. We view it as a part of our business. We manage it as one. We make decisions on programming as one. We sell advertising across the business as one. And as viewership shifts to -- from linear to Peacock we want Peacock to get to a level and a scale that causes our business to be balanced as consumer sentiments and advertiser sentiments change. And very pleased with our performance in this quarter over 15 million and we're right on track for what we expected to do as we've built that business. Yeah. So let me jump in Brian, and Phil I'll take your question on Peacock. So if you go to 30,000 feet and look at the NBCUniversal business, the business at our core is producing content. And if you look at this quarter alone most successful profitable quarter in the history of the movie business. We think our movie business is second to none right now. Our TV business has expanded dramatically. We sell as Brian said to others in addition to ourselves. Our news division second to none, and our sports division is doing really great. And so if you want to -- if you have a great content business the way you maximize your returns is having platforms where you can have the flexibility to put your content on your own platforms and move it around to give your content the best chance of success. And we've had that over the years. So when you look at Peacock what is the definition of success? It's really two things. One is taking that ecosystem that I just talked about and giving yourself an addition to your platform, which allows you more flexibility to maximize the return of your content both in terms of allowing it -- a show to have a better chance of being a hit or a movie to have a better return when you can move it around, and have the right platform for the right piece of content. So we want to get Peacock to a scale where we're fairly indifferent between content going on linear and content going on Peacock and having the best platform out there. And we think we're well on our way to that. The second is just the traditional way you look at any investment, which is that we're investing a lot of money in Peacock. And we view the fact that it's going to get to a level of profitability that will generate a return on that investment that will add value to shareholders. And this quarter makes us more confident that we're along that trajectory. So those are really the two measures."

            "name": "Brian Roberts",
            "content": "Thanks, Marci and good morning, everyone. I'm really proud of the company and our results this quarter. We are reporting adjusted EBITDA growth of 6%, adjusted EPS growth of 10% and significant free cash flow, while also investing in our future and returning a record high amount of capital to our shareholders. The strong financials today are a testament to our focus on driving profitable growth through innovation as well as a reflection on the professionalism of our employees. Together, I believe we are collaborating and executing at the highest levels. I especially want to recognize and publicly thank all of our teammates in Florida as well as those who traveled to Florida over the last several weeks. They worked tirelessly to assist customers who were impacted by Hurricane Ian, even while many of these employees had their own losses. This was a devastating storm particularly for us, as we are the primary cable operator in most of the areas where it hit and we expect this affected about half of our traditional Florida seasonal customers. Digging into the third quarter, our results at Cable Communications again underscore the impressive consistency in this business, with 5% EBITDA growth and 120 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion bringing us to 45.1%, our highest margin on record. While we are still in a challenging environment in terms of depressed move activity and increased competition from new entrants, we were pleased to see that back-to-school provided a tailwind and we ended the third quarter with 14,000 net new broadband subscribers. There have been four primary drivers of revenue growth at our Cable segment: residential broadband units, residential broadband ARPU, wireless and business services. And while we don't anticipate residential broadband units to be a significant driver for now, we expect to maintain healthy growth in the other three, leading to continued strong financial performance at Cable for the foreseeable future. My confidence stems from the fact that we have always been able to strike the right balance between units and profitability. We compete aggressively while also staying focused on investing in and managing the business to deliver long-term profitable growth which is exactly what this quarter has shown. We have a distinct competitive advantage that goes beyond just fast and consistent speeds. We provide a differentiated and superior experience within the home, which is the foundation of our ARPU growth. For example, we offer reliable WiFi coverage in every room, device control and cybersecurity features and a world-class entertainment platform as well as other complementary solutions like Xfinity Mobile that increase the value and utility of our broadband product even more. All of this is only getting better as we further improve our network and we're making great progress.  During the quarter we announced that we have begun to roll out multi-gig download speeds combined with up to 5 to 10x faster upload speeds. And we expect to have this available at 20% of our footprint by the end of this year and to the vast majority of our footprint by the end of 2025.  Directly on the back of this we're completing the core technical foundation for 10G and we're transitioning to a cloud-based virtualized network as we work towards DOCSIS 4.0 which will enable us to deliver multi-gig symmetrical speeds to customers beginning in the back half of next year.  Looking further ahead the combination of our high-capacity network differentiated broadband experience and our terrific MVNO in wireless puts Comcast in a winning position to offer in-home and mobile connectivity that is both robust and ubiquitous. And it doesn't involve trade-offs which is going to become even more important as people's level of data consumption and overall expectations continue to rise overtime.  On average our broadband customers who don't subscribe to traditional video from us are already using nearly 650 gigabytes of data per month and that's just today. We are doing a fantastic job leveraging our wireless business. We're still in the very early growth phase in penetrating this segment and we're having a lot of success. We added 333,000 wireless lines the most of any quarter to date. And this morning we announced that we now have over five million Xfinity Mobile lines and we're just getting started. So summing up we're pleased with our strong financial performance at Cable. We're encouraged by the long-term trends in demand for connectivity and our competitive advantages. And we're confident in our future growth. At NBCUniversal we saw some great momentum with EBITDA growth of 25%, despite the tough comparison to the Tokyo Olympics last year. Our Park segment continues to be a real standout generating the highest quarterly EBITDA on record driven by growth in each of our geographies including Beijing which hit profitability for the first time since the grand opening last September. We're seeing clear evidence that the investments we made throughout the pandemic continue to pay off. We launched Super Nintendo World in Japan, the Velocicoaster in Orlando, Secret Life of Pets in Hollywood and our drumbeat of innovation goes on. For example, Super Nintendo World will open in Hollywood early next year. We're adding another Nintendo-themed area, Donkey Kong to Japan in 2024. And I'm especially excited for Epic Universe to open in the summer of 2025 which will transform Universal Orlando into a weeklong destination.  Studios also performed exceptionally well resulting from a huge summer box office led by Jurassic World, Minions, Black Phone and Nope. Our leadership is driving change in the industry. Our flexible windowing strategy has enhanced the overall profitability of our Studios business and it's also had a significant positive carryover to Peacock which just started to benefit from our new Pay-One agreement. At the end of the third quarter, Peacock had more than 15 million highly engaged paid subscribers in the US. On top of that 15 million, Peacock also had approximately 14 million bundled and free users totaling around 30 million monthly active accounts. Peacock has become the best streaming value in the market providing customers with a massive premium content offering across movies, TV entertainment, sports, and news in English and in Spanish. And with less than five minutes of ads per hour for just $5 per month, it is really a great value. Our sports content is unmatched with customers enjoying live coverage of the biggest leagues and events including the NFL with Sunday Night Football, MLB, Premier League, Notre Dame, Big 10 starting in 2023 as well as the WWE and marquee events including Super Bowl and Olympics, French Open, US Open, Tour de France, Triple Crown, and later this year, the World Cup. We also provide the best of other sports with very passionate fan communities including IndyCar, Supercross, and Track and Field. We're seeing a nice uplift from our next-day broadcast which at last are exclusively ours. And coming up through the rest of this year and into 2023 is a strong slate of highly anticipated originals from proven creators including the Best Fan, Mrs. Davis, Poker Face, and others. While it only launched a little over two years ago, Peacock is already an important part of our portfolio and reflects how we're running our Media business holistically. Switching gears, the UK and other European markets have been adversely affected by the Ukraine conflict as we all know higher energy costs, higher interest rates, higher overall inflation, and currency headwinds. This quarter we took a non-cash charge as a result of all of this at Sky based on this environment which Mike will talk a bit more about. Our Sky team is working hard amidst this changing economic backdrop that's putting pressure on the average customer in the region. We remain focused on customer retention as well as providing the best experience and value in entertainment and connectivity, which contributed to the highest quarterly customer growth since we've owned Sky, including some nice momentum in our broadband and wireless business. We are keeping an eye on churn and acknowledge that ARPU may be affected in the future as customers deal with this unstable and inflationary environment. We are successfully managing through a variety of measures and we remain disciplined on our cost structure. We reset the majority of our major sports rights within the last two years and are looking for more efficiency in a number of areas. So, looking at the company as a whole all of us are paying attention to economists' and other experts' view about how some of these issues in Europe may come to the US. And while we are certainly not immune to potential macroeconomic headwinds, I firmly believe that Comcast is in a very strong position relative to our peers and most other companies. We are a leader in very large and highly profitable markets. And our healthy balance sheet and substantial free cash flow generation enable us to continue to invest organically in our strategic initiatives while simultaneously returning a substantial amount of capital to our shareholders. We pay nearly $5 billion in dividends per year and we bought back $9.5 billion of our shares year-to-date through the third quarter. We have a great business including a fantastic team. Earlier this month, we announced that we promoted Mike Cavanagh to President. For the past seven years Mike has been an incredible leader, partner and friend. And we are both very focused on continuing to innovate and grow this wonderful company for all our employees, customers and guests. So it's my pleasure to hand it over to Mike. Thanks, Ben. Let me just start and then kick it to Mike. Given his new job, I'm looking for him to help on those capital allocation questions quite a bit. But I think the bar is the highest it's been in terms of M&A. Obviously, cost of capital has gone up and we think our stock is attractive and have increased the buyback as Mike just said, we announced both in actions this quarter and in our Board authorization. So, we feel really great about that opportunities to look at things, but we really like the company we've got. Mike, why don't you do that? Dave can talk about DOCSIS 4. And just one other point to add, you know, long-term or longer term, I continue to believe broadband is so critical. It's such an important dynamic part of our society and it's changing all the time, and people want the best. And the best is experience. It's speed, it's innovation, it's service and that's what we're really focused on and we've been that way. And I think it's why we have the number one position today and we want to retain that. Okay. Dave, why don't you start on innovation and I'll add at the end? I think it's a great question. I'll just quickly add that post the pandemic, it's pretty exciting to walk through the technology center and see people back at work and the energy and buzz. But I think of ourselves as a unique media and technology company and we're focused on this sector. We view the competition has changed. It includes the tech companies on the West Coast and we have been looking to add to that scale. And I think we made real progress in the last 12 months for things like our voice remote which for those who have it, whether you're using it for a streaming service or for a video bundle, were to now do other things and look up your account and many other aspects of how voice is deeply embedded in all of our products on Sky Glass globally. We now have between Sky, the new Charter arrangement previous deals with Cox and all of Canadian operators are virtually all a roadmap for innovation. And I think as we look forward to the company that's what's going to keep powering what Mike was talking about the virtuous cycle of investment and return. So, we're all mindful of the economy and the world that we live in, but we have a pretty unique company. And this is a big part of what I think will make it more unique in the future is to continue to try to innovate. So, glad you asked that question. Very fair. I think let me just start and I'll let my colleagues join in. The way we're trying to manage the company and we said this several years ago, which was a shift was we saw a change coming and we tried to think like a customer and think like the consumer. And we've learned I -- at least think I've tried to learn from other successes with that mentality. And the consumers many consumers didn't want the big video package. And so what -- we can fight that or we can try to embrace it. And so our leadership in broadband was the first evidence of okay let's try to embrace it. Let's put Netflix on X1 going back several years. And more people I think in a Comcast market view Netflix via X1 than any other device. I think that's still relatively true, Dave you can comment on that. Our voice remote integrated all of Netflix's content and along came many others. Let's just jump to Apple most recently. I think we have the best integration in the world of Apple TV+ on our consumer devices. Over on the content side at NBCUniversal that create -- that change allowed us to create content for Netflix or Amazon or Apple many others. We own one-third of Hulu. So when we bought the company, all of our content was committed to Hulu in the streaming -- much of our content. As we've discussed that relationship's in -- changed and much of it is now back on Peacock. And Peacock has only been out there for a couple of years and super successful and a great quarter. And congratulations to all of NBCUniversal and the Peacock team for the results this quarter in my opinion. And we came up with a different model since we were starting at a different time and ad-centric low cost to the consumer. So again it's back thinking from the consumer's perspective, how do we fit in and how do we do so on a profitable long-term value-creating way. And so the results you're seeing this quarter, I mean if you look at last year, last year was our best year in EBITDA and our best year in EPS in the 60 years Comcast has been in business. And we're on pace to do better in this year than last year. So I think we have a good model, but it starts with thinking from the customer. And so the shift in video, we got to a place where we're actually somewhat indifferent. What the consumer prefers we want to be for the customer. And then if they're now taking our mobile product, they're getting an even better value. And if they're taking Peacock, they're getting an even continued relationship with NBC if they've changed how they're consuming. So I think we're in a very unique playing offense in a very changing world in a way that continues to yield great results for the company."

            "name": "Mike Cavanagh",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. I look forward to the new role. It's quite an honor, and I appreciate the trust that you and the Board continue to have in me. I'm excited to work with the leaders on this call, Dana, Dave and Jeff and all of our colleagues to take advantage of the great opportunities for Comcast's future. So now I'll begin on slide 4 with our third quarter consolidated 2022 financial results. Revenue decreased 1.5% to $29.8 billion, reflecting the comparison to last year's quarter, which included the Tokyo Summer Olympics as well as a headwind from currency translation at Sky and our international theme parks due to the strengthening dollar. After adjusting for both of these items, our revenue was up about 7% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 5.9% to $9.5 billion and on a constant currency basis increased about 8%. We generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow and we reported an EPS loss of $1.05 per share, which was mainly impacted by an impairment charge at Sky. We test goodwill annually across the company in the third quarter. Challenging economic conditions in the UK and other European markets have resulted in a significant increase in discount rates used in the annual impairment analysis and reduced estimated future cash flows at Sky. As a result, we have taken an impairment charge related to Sky goodwill and intangible assets totaling $8.6 billion. On an adjusted basis EPS increased 10% to $0.96 per share. And on a constant currency basis, adjusted EPS increased about 12%. Now let's turn to our business segment results starting with Cable Communications on slide 5. Cable revenue increased 2.6% to $16.5 billion, driven by higher rate and volume in residential broadband as well as growth in business services, wireless and advertising. The strong growth in these businesses was partially offset by lower revenue in video and voice. Total customer relationships were up 315,000 compared to last year and down 21,000 sequentially in the third quarter. Diving further into the details, first our revenue growth drivers. Broadband revenue increased 5.7% driven by growth in ARPU and in our customer base compared to last year. Broadband ARPU increased 3.7% year-over-year consistent with the growth rate in the second quarter. We expect ARPU growth will continue to be the primary driver of our residential broadband revenue growth in the near term. Wireless revenue increased 31% mainly driven by service revenue, which was fueled by growth in customer lines. We added 1.3 million lines over the last year including 333,000 lines in the quarter, which is our highest number of net additions for any quarter on record and marks the fourth consecutive quarter of adding more than 300,000 lines. Business services revenue increased 9.4% or approximately 5% excluding the acquisition of Masergy, which closed at the beginning of last year's fourth quarter. This healthy organic growth was driven by increases in both ARPU and our customer base. We continue to see healthy performance across our diverse customer segments including SMB, mid-market and enterprise with this quarter's organic growth driven by a mix shift to a higher data speeds and increased sales of our advanced services, as well as rate increases and growth in our customer base. Advertising revenue increased 7.2% primarily driven by political and our advanced advertising business FreeWheel partially offset by a decline in our local core advertising business and the absence of our streaming business XUMO. As we previously announced XUMO is now part of our joint venture with Charter with those results reported in Corporate and Other. If we exclude the impact of XUMO, cable advertising revenue would have increased 12%. Partially offsetting the growth from these revenue drivers was video revenue, which declined 4.4%, driven by year-over-year customer net losses partially offset by 6% ARPU growth due to a residential rate increase at the beginning of this year. And last, voice revenue declined 12.5% primarily reflecting year-over-year customer losses. Turning to expenses. Cable Communications third quarter expenses increased 0.5%, reflecting higher non-programming expenses mostly offset by lower programming expenses. Programming expenses decreased 2.8% reflecting the year-over-year decline in video customer's, partially offset by higher contractual rates. Non-programming expenses increased 2.5% driven by growth in other expenses due to an increase in bad debt compared to last year, reflecting a return to more normalized levels and increased technical and product support expenses driven by growth in our wireless business as well as the addition of Masergy. These higher costs were partially offset by a decline in advertising marketing and promotion expenses partly due to the comparison to last year, which included some Olympic sponsorship spending as well as lower activity levels. The lower activity levels coupled with the improvements we continue to make in our customer experience also contributed to the decrease in customer service expenses. Cable EBITDA increased 5.4% to $7.5 billion in the quarter with Cable EBITDA margins improving 120 basis points year-over-year, reaching a record high of 45.1%. And on a per customer relationship basis, we grew EBITDA 4% as we focus on monetizing these relationships over their lifetime. Before moving to NBCUniversal, Hurricane Ian has impacted our footprint in Southwest Florida causing outages and damage to our cable network that our cable team is still repairing. Many of our customers' homes and commercial locations were severely damaged or destroyed. While our third quarter results were not impacted by the storm, we expect to report an impact in the fourth quarter including net losses of broadband customers. Now let's turn to slide 6 for NBCUniversal. Starting with total NBCUniversal results, revenue decreased 4.3% to $9.6 billion, reflecting the difficult comparison to last year, which included $1.8 billion from the Tokyo Olympics included in our media segment. EBITDA increased to 24.6% to $1.7 billion. Media revenue decreased 23% to $5.2 billion, again reflecting the comparison to the revenue associated with the Tokyo Olympics last year. Excluding the Olympics, Media revenue increased 4.4% driven by Peacock with revenue of $506 million, which more than doubled compared to last year. Distribution revenue increased 4.6% reflecting growth at Peacock driven by increases in paid subscribers compared to last year, as well as higher contractual rates at our networks partially offset by linear subscriber declines that accelerated sequentially. Advertising revenue increased 4.7% reflecting strong increases from Peacock, partially offset by a decline in linear advertising. Media EBITDA decreased 41.5% to $583 million in the third quarter, including a $614 million EBITDA loss at Peacock. We continue to expect Peacock's EBITDA loss will be roughly $2.5 billion for the year, with the fourth quarter's loss reflecting the cost of new content. Excluding Peacock Media EBITDA in the third quarter decreased 21% reflecting the difficult comparison to last year's Tokyo Olympics, as well as revenue pressure at our linear networks. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect Media growth ex-Peacock to be impacted by a gradual acceleration in pay TV cord cutting, as well as some deterioration in the ad market reflecting broader economic uncertainty, as well as higher costs associated with the broadcast of the World Cup on Telemundo. Moving to Studios. Revenue increased 31% to $3.2 billion driven by strong theatrical and content licensing revenue. Theatrical revenue more than doubled compared to last year, driven by the success of our summer film slate including Jurassic World: Dominion, Minions: Rise of Gru, Black Phone and Nope. In addition, content licensing was up 17% driven by the benefit of our carryover titles and the acceleration in film windows, as well as healthy growth in television licensing. EBITDA increased $358 million to $537 million for the quarter primarily reflecting the higher theatrical and content licensing revenue, partially offset by the corresponding higher programming and production costs, and also the benefit of the timing of marketing costs that we incurred in the second quarter for films in the third quarter. Last at Theme Parks, revenue increased 42% to $2.1 billion. And EBITDA increased 89% to $819 million, our highest level of EBITDA on record. These results were driven by growth in each of our parks. At Universal Beijing, we had our first profitable quarter since opening compared to the third quarter last year, when it incurred $130 million of preopening costs. At our US parks, we continue to see strong demand with attendance and guest spending increasing year-over-year. In fact, Orlando, broke a new record delivering its highest level of EBITDA for a third quarter despite the park being closed for two days due to Hurricane Ian. Universal Japan, continues to rebound since capacity restrictions were lifted at the end of March and compared to last year when the park operated under more strict COVID-related controls.  Now let's turn to Slide 7 for Sky. As I said earlier, our reported results were meaningfully impacted from the currency translation due to the strengthening dollar, but I will speak to Sky's results on a constant currency basis. For the third quarter, Sky revenue was consistent compared to last year at $4.3 billion, as low single-digit growth in the UK was mostly offset by lower revenue in Italy and Germany. Direct-to-consumer revenue was also consistent compared to last year, reflecting low single-digit growth in the UK driven by broadband and wireless revenue offset by declines in Italy and Germany. On a customer basis, we added 320,000 customer relationships in the quarter, with positive additions across all three territories: the UK, Italy and Germany. These net additions were driven by streaming customers, due to the timing of unique content and the early start of football seasons, including the EPL to accommodate the timing of the World Cup in the fourth quarter. We do not expect a similar level of additions in the fourth quarter. Rounding out the rest of revenue at Sky, content revenue increased 6.4% driven by licensing our entertainment content. And advertising revenue decreased 1.6%, with lower revenue in Italy, and relatively flat revenue in the UK and Germany, reflecting the difficult macro environment. Turning to EBITDA. Sky's EBITDA decreased 15.5% to $701 million, primarily reflecting the timing of sports costs, again, due to the early start of the football seasons and the shift of matches into the third quarter to accommodate the timing of the World Cup in the fourth quarter. While this shift will benefit sports costs in the fourth quarter as four weeks of games are paused, results will also be impacted by the challenging economic environment in Europe. And we will incur higher sports costs in the first half of 2023, reflecting the higher number of games as the season is extended and the remainder of the paused games are played. Now, I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on slide 8. We generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow this quarter. Consolidated total capital increased 24% due to increased spending at NBCUniversal and Cable, partially offset by a decrease at Sky. The increase at NBCUniversal was driven by higher CapEx at parks, as we continue to invest in attractions and make significant progress in building Epic Universe in Orlando. Cable capital spend increased 17% with CapEx intensity coming in at 12.2%, due to timing. On a year-to-date basis, Cable CapEx intensity was 10.4%, and we continue to expect Cable CapEx intensity to be around 11% for the year. Working capital was $1 billion for the third quarter, reflecting the continued ramp in content creation and the timing of annual sports rights payments. As we enter the fourth quarter and look to our year ahead, we remain focused on driving long-term growth during an increasingly challenged economic environment. As a result, we expect we'll be taking severance and other cost reduction-related charges in the fourth quarter in anticipation of expense reduction actions that will provide benefits in 2023 and beyond. Wrapping-up with capital allocation, last month, we increased our buyback authorization to $20 billion, up from $10 billion. And during the quarter, we repurchased $3.5 billion worth of our shares. In addition, dividend payments totaled $1.2 billion for a total return of capital in the third quarter of $4.7 billion. We ended the quarter with net leverage at 2.3 times, in line with our expectations for leverage to remain around 2.4 times. Thanks for joining us on the call this morning. I'll turn it back to Marci, who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call. Sure, Ben. Thanks. Good morning. So, I'd just step back a little bit and think about what we do with capital through the lens of start with how we generate capital. So, if you look at this quarter, you see we had record margins in the Cable business, 45%. We had record profits in the Theme Parks business and record profits in the Studio businesses, so just to call out a few examples. And those are the result of us putting tremendous energy and effort and capital back in our businesses. So, when we talk about the formula that we've got, it's always with the view to have growth opportunities in our existing businesses, so we can put capital to work and in the future get the kind of results we've had now on the back of the investments that we have had in the past. So, priority one right now is to invest in the network. I'll let Dave expand on that. But we've got a great path to symmetrical multi-gig through DOCSIS 4.0 in a reasonable time frame at reasonable cost inside the envelope that we talked about of about 11% CapEx intensity. We've got Theme Parks with Epic Universe well underway. We've got investment in streaming with Peacock that Jeff will talk about. So, we're excited about putting money first and foremost back into our businesses to drive great results for years to come. And so that's the virtuous cycle that you see. So that's step one, put money back in the business. Two, keep a strong balance sheet. We get asked a lot about that. But I think, when you look at the environment we're in, I think we're happy to have what I would say is the best strongest balance sheet in the business period. So, I think that's piece two. And then piece three and I'm very happy with the results Brian talked about $9.5 billion of buybacks year-to-date, $5 billion-ish run rate of dividends for the year. We were asked the questions over the last several years, are we committed? And when we got back to leverage targets would we be able to -- would we be committed, are we committed to returning capital to shareholders? And we said all along that it was our highest priority to get back to that place, but to do it in the context of the formula I just described. So, I think, hopefully, everybody has confidence that we understand that formula and you all understand that formula. So as you look ahead on capital return, I think, we're going to be guided as we've been in the recent past by our leverage. We'll stay around 2.4 times leverage while doing all the things I just described and that will dictate ample amount of return to shareholders. So that's that. And then, I think, on the M&A side of things, it's -- we like the business we have. With all the opportunities we have in the businesses and the stock where it is, I see us very focused on the opportunities in the business and as I just described. So I'll give Dave -- over to Dave for DOCSIS 4.0. Thanks Doug. I'll let Dave really chime in. It's his team that's doing amazing work to get the network back up in Southwest Florida those are our markets. They were -- like Brian said earlier, our plant was the one hit hardest. It will be in the tens of thousands, but we're still working on the numbers in terms of homes that -- residences that won't turn back on, but we'll tell you what the number is when we get through it during the course of this quarter. And you can look back at some hurricane experiences, it's typically tens and tens of thousands."

Our financial results were very strong across the board once again this quarter. We grew second quarter consolidated revenue by 5%, adjusted EBITDA by 10%, and adjusted EPS by 20%. We accomplished this while continuing to invest in our businesses and returned significant capital to shareholders. Specifically we bought back $3 billion worth of our stock in the quarter, bringing our total to $6 billion year-to-date. And we continue to have a healthy dividend and one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. Our prudent financial management and long-term innovation-based strategy are paying off in Cable which posted 5% growth in EBITDA and 70 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion. In fact, our EBITDA margin reached a record high of nearly 45% this quarter. While we\u2019ve added nearly 800,000 broadband subscribers in the past 12 months, more recently that pace has slowed and we posted flat broadband subscriber additions in the second quarter. I\u2019d like to dig into what we are seeing in that area. Broadband additions of course are basically a function of churn and connect activity. While churn remains well below 2019, connect activity was also lower than what we generally see in the second quarter. We believe this is primarily the result of three factors. The first category is move activity. As we\u2019ve discussed for some time now, there\u2019s been a dramatic slowdown in moves across our footprint with the second quarter below 2019 by 12% and the lowest we\u2019ve experienced since the pandemic began. Our win share of new customer acquisition opportunities remains high, but the slowdown in moves has resulted in fewer of these jump balls and this had had the largest impact on our gross connects. The second category is a reversal of some pandemic trends. During the pandemic, many customers, particularly at lower income levels sought to optimize home based solutions by adding broadband. This presented us with significant opportunity to take more share in residential broadband. In fact, in the first year of the pandemic, we added nearly 50% or 600,000 more customers than our prior annual average growth. At this stage in the pandemic, those opportunities have waned as consumer behavior has begun to return to pre-pandemic patterns. We\u2019ve also seen some give back to a normalization of mobile substitution. In addition during the pandemic, seasonality patterns were very different than what we had seen historically and this really began to also normalize in this second quarter, causing more seasonal disconnects that did not occur at typical levels in the prior two years. The last bucket is increased competition. Fixed wireless is a new entrant in the marketplace and while there are likely to be significant long-term limitations, today\u2019s excess capacity in wireless networks is creating what we believe to be a temporary opportunity targeted at value-oriented customers. We are not seeing fixed wireless have any discernible impact on our churn, but its early growth appears to be another contributor to our lower connect activity. In addition, we continue to compete against fiber in an increasing percentage of our footprint. Notwithstanding these industry and mostly macro-related factors, we remain extremely confident. We have spent decades investing and innovating to build a business that is well-positioned to succeed in the environment were seeing and we certainly expect a return to residential broadband subscriber additions. How do we plan to do that? Well we\u2019re working hard to expand our footprint, taking advantage of growth in housing and businesses in our current markets, accelerating edge outs into new areas and we are playing offense when it comes to government subsidies.\nDOCSIS 4.0,: I\u2019m also confident and frankly more excited in our ability to drive revenue and EBITDA growth even through our existing subscriber base alone. We\u2019ve had a history of generating strong and steady ARPU growth as we continue to add tremendous value and improvement to the customer experience. Our margins are some of the highest in the industry which highlights the stability and operating leverage of our business, the diversification of our revenue streams, and the strength of our other important growth drivers in Cable. In particular, business services and wireless have been two substantial contributors to Cable\u2019s financial strength and each still has lots of runway ahead. Business Services had another strong quarter of revenue growth and in just over a decade we\u2019ve grown this to nearly $10 billion in high-margin annual revenue including the addition of almost $1 billion in the last 12 months alone. In Wireless, we added 317,000 customers this quarter and similarly have added over $700 million in incremental revenue in the past 12 months and we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of the opportunity here at only 8% penetration of our residential broadband customers. Wrapping up on Cable, we are in a unique environment with some headwinds, but move activity should return to some level of normalcy. Mobile substitution will eventually stabilize and we believe fixed wireless has inherent performance and capacity limitations that sharply limit the number of people on a network using a given amount of spectrum, which should provide a natural cap on their overall industry penetration. Moreover, we believe that our path to deliver multi-gigabit speeds together with the other features and functionality we offer will make our broadband experience superior to any of our competitors over the long-term. In the meantime we will maintain the discipline we\u2019ve always had and I am confident that we will strike the right balance between subscriber acquisition, our long-term profitability, and we all believe we have a very bright future in this business. Moving to NBCUniversal, we had a very strong quarter with EBITDA growth of 20% year-over-year. Our Parks segment continued its momentum generating record EBITDA for the second quarter and this is without much contribution from Beijing which was closed for nearly two months. Domestic park attendance and per caps continue to be above pre-pandemic levels and we are moving full steam ahead in building Epic Universe. I cannot be more excited for how this park will bring new experiences to our visitors and additional runway for growth. NBCU Media remains a very healthy business. We just completed the highest-grossing upfront in our history, a testament to our content and a superb team, and the unique data and technology innovation we deliver through one platform. This year we secured more than $7 billion in commitments including $1 billion at Peacock, double what we did in the 2021, 2022 season along with strong pricing.\nPhone,: For Peacock, early access to premium universal films is a proven driver of subscriber acquisition and engagement. As we discussed during our last call, Peacock had a very strong first quarter, driven by a variety of extraordinary programming including the Super Bowl and Olympics.\nHulu: At Sky we are operating well in an increasingly difficult macro environment reporting our highest ever second quarter EBITDA. We grew revenue and EBITDA in the UK, which is our largest European market and the primary driver of our future growth. Calling out a couple of highlights, we are particularly pleased with the consumer response to Glass which resulted in Sky being the third largest ultra-high definition television selling brand in the second quarter. And we also recorded our highest ever Premier League final day viewership, taking 30% audience share. In addition, we're seeing the benefit of our disciplined approach to sports rights in both Italy and Germany, where EBITDA also improved year-over-year. In reflecting on the last 24 months, which has been wrought with uncertainty, we have performed extremely well and continued to make progress against key initiatives. Our Cable business has achieved some of the highest margins in the industry while also delivering healthy top line growth. At NBCUniversal and Sky, they've shown resilience and continue to recover despite unique challenges from the pandemic. Together, we've generated nearly $30 billion in free cash flow. We're returning a record amount of capital to shareholders and our balance sheet is in a great place. We have also continued to invest in strategically important growth opportunities, including enhancing our world class broadband network, scaling Xfinity mobile, increasing our capabilities at Business Services, launching Peacock, completing Universal Beijing and starting construction at Epic, just to name a few. With substantial cash flow generation and a strong foundation for innovation, Comcast is in a wonderful position. Mike, over to you.\nMichael Cavanagh: Thanks Brian and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 4 with our second quarter consolidated 2022 financial results. Revenue increased 5.1% to $30 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased to 10% to $9.8 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 20% to a $1.01 per share. And finally we generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow. Now let's turn to our business segment results starting with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable revenue increased 3.7% to $16.6 billion. EBITDA increased 5.3% to $7.4 billion. Cable EBITDA margins improved 70 basis points year-over-year reaching a record high margin of 44.9% and net cash flow grew 4.4% to $5.3 billion. Customer relationships are up 591,000 compared to last year and down 28,000 sequentially in the second quarter, reflecting lower levels of new customer connections given the current operating environment partially offset by low levels of churn, which remains well below 2019 levels. We are focused on delivering an excellent customer experience and monetizing our customer relationships over their lifetime and in in that regard, EBITDA per customer relationship grew by 3% in the quarter. Now let's discuss Cable financials in more detail. Cable revenue growth of 3.7% was driven by broadband business services, wireless and advertising revenue, partially offset by lower video and voice revenue. Broadband revenue increased 6.8% reflecting an increase of 3.6% in ARPU and growth in our residential customer base compared to last year. Net residential and business customers increased by 775,000 over the past 12 months with flat results in the second quarter. The trends that we saw through the second quarter have largely continued into the early parts of the third quarter with connects remaining soft while churn is still near all-time lows. This has resulted in a quarter-to-date loss of roughly 30,000 customers. July is typically the weakest month of the quarter and the vast majority of quarterly connect activity is weighted towards August and September, which is helped by back-to-school activity. While we're optimistic that we will have a healthy back-to-school season, short term visibility remains low and more importantly, beyond this temporary period, we are confident that our broadband speeds, reliability, coverage and control features continue to position us as the best-in-class product for our customers, allowing us to protect and grow our 32 million broadband customer base over time. Business Services, revenue increased 10% or approximately 6% excluding the acquisition of Masergy which closed at the beginning of last year's fourth quarter. This healthy organic growth was driven by increases in average rates per customer and in our customer base, which grew by 54,000 compared to last year with 10,000 additions in the second quarter. Moving to Wireless, revenue increased 30% mainly driven by service revenue, which was fueled by growth in customer lines. Overall, we added 1.2 million lines compared to last year, including 317,000 lines in the quarter, which was our highest net additions for any second quarter on record. Advertising revenue increased 10%, mainly fueled by political revenue as well as strong growth at both our advanced advertising business free will [ph] and at our streaming business Zumo, which was partially offset by decline in our local core advertising business. As a reminder, Zumo, which contributed about 20% of our advertising growth this quarter is now part of our Charter JV and beginning of the third quarter will no longer be reported in our Cable results. For Video revenue declined 2.4% driven by customer net losses totaling $1.8 million compared to last year, including $521,000 net losses in the quarter, partially offset by 7% ARPU growth due to residential rate increase at the beginning of this year. Last Voice revenue declined 12% primarily reflecting customer losses totaling $902,000 compared to last year, including $286,000 net losses in the quarter and reflects our shift in focus to bundling broadband with wireless. Turning to expenses, Cable Communications second quarter expenses increased 2.5%. Programming expenses decreased 1.6% reflecting the year-over-year decline in Video customers partially offset by higher contractual rates. Non-programming expenses increased 5.2% driven by growth in our Wireless business, expenses related to our recent acquisition of Masergy and an increase in bad debt as we returned to more normalized levels and compared to lower levels last year. These higher costs were partially offset by decline in customer service expenses, reflecting lower activity levels in the business, as well as improvement in customer experience initiatives. Wrapping up on Cable, we are very pleased with the 5.3% increase in EBITDA and record EBITDA margins. Even as we prioritize increasing investment in our network with CapEx intensity at nearly 11%, we generated a significant level of net cash flow, and we believe our ability to continue to generate strong and growing net cash flow out of the Cable business is sustainable. Now let's turn to Slide 6 for NBCUniversal. Starting with total NBCUniversal results, revenue increased 19% to $9.4 billion and EBITDA increased 19.5% to $1.9 billion. Media revenue increased 3.6% to $5.3 billion, driven by Peacock with revenue up $444 million, which is more than three and a half times higher compared to last year. Distribution revenue increased 8.4% reflecting growth at Peacock, driven by increases in paid subscribers compared to last year and growth at our networks as higher contractual rates were only partially offset by linear subscriber declines. Advertising revenue decreased 1.3% due to linear rating declines and a difficult comparison to last year when we had a higher number of sporting events and NHL, which we no longer have rights to, partially offset by a growing contribution from Peacock and higher pricing. Excluding the impact of sports timing and NHL advertising would have grown low single digits. Media EBITDA decreased 2.9% to $1.3 billion in the second quarter, including a $467 million EBITDA loss at Peacock. Excluding Peacock, Media EBITDA increased nearly 4% driven by a decrease in sports costs associated with a lower number of events compared to last year and the absence of the NHL. We continue to expect Peacock's EBITDA loss will be roughly $2.5 billion for the year; however, taking into consideration the timing of content launches, we expect losses to be higher in the second half, especially in the fourth quarter. Moving next to Studios, revenue increased 33% to $3 billion driven by higher theatrical and content licensing revenue. Theatrical revenue nearly tripled compared to last year's results, driven by an increase in a number of releases, as well as the success of these films, including the outstanding results of Jurassic World: Dominion. Content licensing revenue was up 19%, mainly driven by growth in TV licensing as production has returned to pre pandemic levels. EBITDA decreased $155 million to break even for the quarter, driven by an increase in programming and production costs associated with the higher content licensing and theatrical revenue in the current quarter, as well as an increase in marketing costs ahead of several film releases in late June and in July, including the very successful release of Minions: The Rise of Gru, Black Phone, and Nope. Last at Theme Parks revenue increased 65% to $1.8 billion and we generated EBITDA of $632 million, which was a record level for any second quarter, even though Universal Beijing was closed for most of the quarter due to COVID-related restrictions. These results show strong improvement compared to last year when Hollywood was operating at limited capacity and Japan was closed for part of the quarter. We continue to see strong demand and EBITDA growth at our US parks, where attendance and guest spending has been above 2019 levels, with Orlando delivering its highest level of EBITDA for any quarter and Hollywood experiencing its best second quarter EBITDA on record. Universal Japan has shown a nice rebound since capacity restrictions were lifted at the end of March with attendance having its strongest improvement since the pandemic and we expect momentum will build over the long-term. Universal Beijing was closed for about two months and reopened at the end of June, resulting in an EBITDA loss at that part of this quarter. However, this was still a financial improvement compared to the level of pre-opening costs we incurred in the same period last year. Since reopening the parks, the trends have been positive, despite capacity restrictions and testing requirements. While COVID remains a risk, we must manage, particularly in Asia, we remain bullish on the Parks business, both in the near and long-term. Now let's turn to Slide 7 for Sky, which I will speak to on a constant currency basis. For the second quarter, Sky revenue decreased 3.5% to $4.5 billion as low single digit growth in the UK was more than offset by our results in Italy and Germany, where we continued to transition through resets in our sports rights. Direct-to-consumer revenue decreased to 2.4% reflecting consistent average revenue for customer relationship and a decline in customer relationships compared to last year, including customer losses in the quarter of $255,000, which partially reflects normal customer churn associated with the end of the football season, as well as an increasingly challenging macroeconomic environment for consumers across Europe. Direct-to-consumer revenue in the UK increased low single digits in the quarter due to an increase in video revenue, primarily driven by higher revenue from pubs and clubs as they recover from the pandemic, as well as increases in wireless and broadband revenue. This growth in the UK was more than offset primarily by a decrease in revenue in Italy, due to the reset in our Syria broadcast rights. Rounding out the rest of revenue at Sky content revenue declined 16% driven by the reset in sports licensing agreements in Italy and Germany, and advertising revenue decreased 3.1% with growth in the UK and Germany, despite a difficult macro environment, more than offset by decline in Italy. Turning to EBITDA, Sky\u2019s EBITDA increased 71% to $863 million reflecting our strong growth in the UK and improved results in Germany and Italy, mainly driven by lower sports programming and production costs due to resets in our sports rights. As a reminder, the upcoming World Cup will take place in the fourth quarter, which is the first time this event has taken place during National League\u2019s regular season schedules. To accommodate this national soccer leagues, including the EPL, we\u2019ll start the new season one to two weeks earlier in the third quarter, and then take a pause for a period of four game weeks in the fourth quarter while the World Cup is played. As a result, compared to last year, we will incur higher sports programming amortization in the third quarter with lower levels in the fourth quarter and higher again in the first half of next year. Now I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 8. We generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow this quarter. Cash taxes of $2.75 billion included some items that drove us above the normal run rate by roughly $600 million. Consolidated total capital increased 12% reflecting significant progress in building Epic Universe in Orlando, higher capital spending at Cable driven by investments in line extensions and scalable infrastructure, partially offset by a decrease at Sky. For the year we continue to expect Cable CapEx intensity to stay around 11% as we work towards enhancing and transitioning our broadband network to DOCSIS 4.0 in the next several years, and NBCUniversal CapEx to be up around $1 billion dollars year-over-year, driven by the construction of Epic. Based on what we reported in the first six months of the year, that means total capital should be about $2.5 billion higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half. Working capital was $1.7 billion for the first half of 2022 and is likely to be slightly below this amount in the second half of the year, reflecting the continued ramp in content creation and the timing of annual sports rights payments. Turning to capital allocation, we repurchased $3 billion worth of our shares in the quarter. In addition, dividend payments totaled $1.2 billion for a total return of capital in the second quarter of $4.2 billion. We ended the quarter with net leverage at 2.3 times in line with our expectations for leverage to remain around 2.4 times going forward. So with that, thanks for joining us on the call this morning. I'll turn it back to Marci who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks Mike. Operator, let's open the call for Q&A please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thank you, good morning. Maybe this is a strategic question for Brian, and then I wanted to ask a follow up to Jeff. Brian, your balance sheet and cash flow generation is a real asset in markets that are tough and creates opportunity for the company. And obviously in the backdrop of broadband slowing and concerns around the future of streaming, and also some press reports about Comcast considering different strategic structures, just wondering if you could talk about the portfolio and how -- your level of confidence that you've got growth opportunities and the opportunity to create value. And if you're thinking about ways to deploy that balance sheet and capacity to change things or take advantage of opportunities in the market that may be there for you now that weren't there maybe over the last few years? And then Jeff, just on the Parks business, I guess with the GDP result this morning, we're officially in a recession, but it doesn't sound like that's the case at the Theme Park business. So can you talk a little bit about your visibility into the second half of the year and into next year, both in the U.S. and overseas and whether you have confidence you can continue to kind of deliver these record results at the Theme Park business despite what seems to be a weakening macro? Thank you, guys.\nBrian Roberts: Thanks Ben. I think what I was trying to say at the end of my remarks was cutting right at your point. I think we are in a fabulous place. We have kind of unprecedented cash flow and scale by our -- what we've got as one company. We're working really well together. We always think about, whether this is the competitive right set for the company and I feel it is. If you look at all the broad diversified growth drivers that came out here again in the second quarter, whether it's Wireless net adds at a record near record levels, or the Business Service growth back to high single digits, the new attendance records to your question about Theme Parks, domestically the last couple of years in broadband, you know, obviously we\u2019ve talked I\u2019m sure some more here about that, but having almost 3 million customers going from zero to 13 million paid subs in a of couple years at Peacock is a great achievement and the highest rated broadcast network. I think all parts of the company are really doing a great job in some interesting times. By the way, our treasury department went out while interest rates were low and we've basically repriced the whole balance sheet for something on the order of 18 years average maturity at record low rates. So I feel we are able to return capital to shareholders. I think that's been a real focus and I think we did it again this quarter. Our bar is therefore very high to -- as we look at things from that -- through that strategic lens of our cash flow and scale. So I think we feel really strong. I think we have so many diversified businesses that are -- each has its own game plan and we'll talk I\u2019m sure a little bit about some of them today, but the biggest ones are really, well run. We've got some new leadership in a number of cases and I'm really pleased with the company that could post 10% EBITDA growth.\nJeffrey Shell: Thanks, Brian. Ben, I'll just take the Parks one really quickly. So, obviously the Parks business historically has been subject to macro trends and there's no reason to think that that won't be the case in the future. When we look at our business we\u2019re just not seeing it yet in our numbers and our performance. And if you kind of look at the -- we're putting up these numbers despite the fact that our international visitation domestically is about half of what it has historically been. So we expect that to increase over time back to where it should be. We have a lot of attractions. We continued building attractions during the pandemic. Brian talked about Epic in the opening. We have those attractions continuing. Internationally Japan has been steadily improving quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter, still not back to where it was pre-pandemic, but the trend line is really good. And Beijing, which was closed two of the three months of this quarter opened in the third month and is doing really well, much better than we expected despite COVID constraints still on capacity. So, and all that international performance is subject obviously to the strong dollar and that is a headwind for us. So I think we feel really good about the Parks and feel like there's a lot of growth ahead of us despite what could be macro challenges that we could or might face. We're just not seeing it yet.\nJeffrey Shell: Thank you, Ben.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Ben. Operator, next question please?\nOperator: And our next question will come from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nPhilip Cusick: Hi guys, thank you. I wonder if we can dig in to the level of your promotion and competition in the Cable business. We've anecdotally seen some pretty aggressive promotions. It's hard to tell whether those are sort of limited or widespread. Are you pushing harder on average than you were a year ago? And when you compete with wireless, since you expect to fixed wireless to have a cap on penetration, does it make sense to push back with that on price or do you sort of just let it come in and take those customers? How do you address that? Thank you.\nDavid Watson: Hey Phil, this is Dave. Let me go into both of that, the competitive landscape and the promotional intensity. So let me start with the drivers very quickly, because I think that sets it up. And Brian mentioned, since March of 2020, we've added the 3 million broadband customers to this point. And so, you look at, things like the move activity, June being the lowest level, you know, this all happened, mobile substitution, really driving that 3 million with the surge and in seasonality places like Florida, that in 2021, we actually gained customers, which we normally don't and this quarter we were negative in Florida. So you put all that together. We have to, I think put that in perspective and that determines, a lot of the competitive planning, but we've always approached competition with a tremendous sense of urgency. We have local competition. We have large national scaled competition and most certainly fixed wireless is the newest one. And you go through a launch phase that typically adds pressure and we are seeing that on the front end. As Brian said, it's impacting the Connects. We do not see it in churn. So our approach is to segment the marketplace, go after each segment, provide great value, really lean into the network benefits that we have and compete fiercely for each segment. We've always done that and we'll continue to do that. Mobile is an area where we really can continue to be aggressive. We have been doing that. I think the were very strong in the second quarter in terms of mobile. I think there's more that we can do as we integrate mobile into every single sales channel. So look for us to continue to be aggressive in regards to how we package each segment and leverage mobile. What we won't do is chase pricing down to the bottom. So we're going to have a good balanced approach towards competing fiercely for each segment, but we have a great network. We have great innovation. We have the best WiFi gateway device that's out there. We're going to leverage our strengths in every part of what we do. And so, with all of those things, you manage the promotional intensity for the long run, but we continue to evolve our competitive playbook all the time. But you won't see us, go down and chase discounting. Mobile is a great addition, adding value and look for us to continue to do that. And I think, you know, one of the unusual moments part of this is with the mobile surge with wireless only coming back, look for us to continue to leverage the best broadband network with the best mobile. And by the way, for those that are paying attention to the Ookla stuff, we have the data from Ookla in terms of mobile service and Xfinity mobile is the fastest overall mobile service provider, so look for us to leverage that. We'll combine the best network with best mobile service and we'll continue to do that, but there won't be a dramatic shift in promotional intensity.\nPhilip Cusick: Thanks, Dave.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Phil. Operator, next question please?\nOperator: And our next question will come from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nCraig Moffett: Yes, hi. I wonder if you could let's stay with the topic of broadband for a minute, if you could dive into the patterns that you're seeing geographically, you talked about fixed wireless, the companies that are selling it primarily T-Mobile and Verizon are skewing rural. Where are you seeing the competition from fixed wireless most strongly and where are you seeing the competition from fiber more strongly and what does that fiber competition look like?\nBrian Roberts: Well, actually let me start with fiber Craig. And, there we've been at it for a long period of time. You know, we've gone from zero to over 15-year period from 0% to 40% overbuild. And so that is we have good visibility to where fiber is and that's all over the place, at this point between multiple fiber providers. And important to note whether it's fiber or any other form of competition, we\u2019re growing in every single geographic area. With fixed wireless, you're right in that, there appears to be two things. One, they are adding some small business, new, maybe even expanding the marketplace a bit with small business, watching that closely. They're a little bit more rural which we have been watching, but it's kind of across the board. When you have again, this launch phase of somebody doing it at scale like this, you see it a little bit all over. But again, the difference here is our churn versus fiber back in the day where we saw churn go up. We\u2019re not seeing that here. We are seeing a little bit of pressure on connects, and it's kind of all over, which points towards more of the main drivers being what I mentioned earlier. It's the move activity plus the mobile search. So that is really the key thing, but we watch it. One of our great strengths is local competition. We stay on it in a very granular basis. We watch this very closely. So your point is a good one.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Craig. Operator, next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nDouglas Mitchelson: Thank you so much. I'm just curious if anyone on the team has any other thoughts on what they're seeing in terms of macro trends, whether it's advertising or days outstanding or bad debt or sort of across all the businesses. But also, Dave for you, as we look forward in Cable, if you're going through a sustained period of slower broadband growth due to the factors you've outlined, that potentially means a little bit slower revenue growth. Are you -- as you budget this business on a go-forward basis, are you budgeted to hit a particular margin goal, so investment OpEx levels would come down as revenue comes down or how do you think about managing the business on a go-forward basis if there is a little bit of a revenue slowdown given the slower broadband growth? Thank you.\nMichael Cavanagh: So Mike, it\u2019s Doug. I'll jump in. I think across the board we're generally -- we're not seeing slowdown. Dave can comment or add on payments on the consumer side and I'll let Jeff comment on advertising, but versus some of the commentary you've seen, I think we're able to deal with some of the macro stuff impact on consumer and impact on cost in our expense base. Brian already mentioned the interest rate side of it, and 85% fixed at the grade levels we -- he mentioned. And then on our expense base, very small part of it is energy related through fuel rolling trucks. Others -- other areas, labor and the like, we have pressures like all others. But I think we know how to manage our way through these kind of challenges. So I wouldn't call out as we look to the second half of the year that macro is a particularly big issue. I'll let Jeff jump in.\nJeffrey Shell: Yes. So I just -- thanks, Mike. I would just add, Doug, that in the advertising market, the advertising market is choppy. I mean, I think we said that last time. It continues to be choppy, down year-on-year in the scatter market. It's really segment by segment-based though some segments are doing better. Some segments are doing worse. And we just finished the upfront, as Brian said in his opening and the upfront was way better than we expected. So definitely some, as I said choppiness, but nothing really that dramatic.\nMichael Cavanagh: And I'll just jump in one more time, and Dave can follow up. But I mean, when we -- across all the businesses, budget exercise and the like, I mean, our job and the way we think about it is to really think about optimizing for the long-term. So last thing you're going to see us doing is -- and it goes back to the strength of balance sheet, strength of cash flow, we won't be cutting muscle. We're very focused on in tougher times trimming some fat, but it will be very, very long-term minded in how we think about investment priorities, which are substantial to drive future growth and so fortunately, we're in a position where we don't have to sacrifice that. That doesn't mean there won't be tactical adjustments and belt tightening, but I'll throw it over to Dave.\nDavid Watson: Thanks, Mike. Hey, Doug. So on looking forward, almost certainly where we're at right now, I think, points towards the game plan. We had -- in broadband alone, we had really healthy ARPU growth, 3.6%, half being rate-driven, the other half just how we manage tier mix. So I think there's \u2013 if you look at the overall strength of the total relationships, 32 million broadband relationships that we have and the ability to manage through that and focusing on the strengths of the network, the strengths of the product, we'll continue to do that. We have a lot of levers that we'll focus on. And again, we talked about promotional intensity, but we're going to put customers in the right segment. We always segment the marketplace. We'll continue to do that. And so you also look at multiple growth areas that we have in Cable where Business Services, Brian talked about that, is a growth opportunity. Mobile is a growth opportunity. The platform even for Video, I feel, is a growth opportunity. So we will consistently manage and be competitive with the broadband relationships. But I think we'll continue to focus on our network and the product advantages that we have and that will help us focus on being able to the pricing approach that we have in the marketplace.\nDouglas Mitchelson: Thank you.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Doug. Operator next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from BofA Securities. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. I just wanted to drill down, if possible, on advertising. Jeff, I'm not sure what choppy means. Could you give us any color on kind of magnitude up or down in scatter, outlook for political? And then on Cable, if anyone can comment what's going on in advertising there? But more importantly, Peacock came out of the gate with a differentiated strategy on AVOD, and now you're seeing a slew of other companies following. Obviously, inventory will go up, but is that positive or negative? Meaning will more advertisers come in? And if they do, are you taking share from digital or is it a share shift from linear? Just any color you can give us on AVOD would be great.\nJeffrey Shell: Yes. Hi, Jessica, thanks. So what I mean by choppy is that there is -- it's not a broad decline or increase. So if you look at our business, first of all in the quarter, as Mike said in the opening, if you take out the NHL playouts from last year, we were actually up in the quarter, which I think is better than some of the other companies that have reported so far. So up year-on-year is a pretty good thing. And if you look at kind of what we're seeing in the scatter market, what we saw in the upfront, you have things like auto, which is down, but that's related to the fact that -- saw in GM's earnings yesterday, you just don't have a lot of cars on lots, therefore, they're not advertising. So that's why their advertising is down there. And then pharma and the upfront was up significantly as you have a backlog of drugs that weren't approved in the last couple of years by the FDA are expected to be approved. So what I mean by choppy is just segment by segment different things are going on, both up and down and there's no kind of macro overall ups and downs. On Peacock, look, we had the benefit of studying the market before we came in and we think we picked the right business strategy, which is kind of an extension of our existing business, not a new business based on dual revenue stream of subscription and advertising. And I think everybody kind of moving in that direction is the validation of that business model. And as far as advertising in general, our business, linear and Peacock, we're one of the largest advertisers out there, over $10 billion of advertising. So people coming in at the levels that are coming in, we don't expect it to have any material impact on what we sell and how we do it. If anything, our scale gives us an increasing advantage. And then you mentioned political in the next one we do, we don't want to count our chickens before they hatch, but we expect a pretty strong political, kind of season coming up. And I think our company, speaking now broadly, the entire company, not just our linear businesses, but our local TV stations and Dave's business and Cable, we're kind of uniquely positioned and now with Peacock to take advantage of whatever a candidate wants to advertise and where. So we expect some pretty strong results from Peacock in the coming fall in addition to the advertising across our whole company. Dave, if you want to add anything?\nDavid Watson: No, I totally agree with that.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Jessica. Operator next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks. I'm going to follow up on one of the questions that was asked earlier. You always kind of get these questions around capital allocation and M&A and it seems like those discussions always seem to focus on what you may or may not want to do in the media space. But you still generate the large majority of your earnings and cash flow out of your Cable Communications segment, and a harder backdrop may make asset values in that sector come down. We've already seen that. What is your appetite for maybe increasing your discretionary capital into telecom? Meaning would you be interested in buying more cable assets if they were available or fiber assets if they were available or things that would support your mobile business from an infrastructure standpoint? I just feel like it's been a while since we've taken your temperature on whether that could be something you'd be interested in doing opportunistically. And then just a question on the Parks. Obviously, the strength in per caps was an important part of what contributed to the outstanding financial performance in the quarter. But beginning of 2Q and the end of 2Q, I think, were a very different economic environments. I'm just curious whether you've seen any notable shifts in spending patterns at the parks in the more recent weeks? Thanks.\nBrian Roberts: Yes. Mike, you may want to jump in on this or Dave. This is Brian. The -- absolutely like the communications business that we're in, that\u2019s certainly my roots in life. And the most recent acquisition we made, we call these kind of tuck-in acquisitions, would be Masergy. And that's in the Business Services Group, and it's off to a really good start and allows us, just like you said, more capabilities. I think that's probably more what our focus is, how do we look for new revenue sources and new growth avenues and do people who've either started a company or built a company have something that we can then scale faster and that's been a good pattern. So Dave's team looks at that all the time, Mike and the business development team. So you guys want to add to that? I think it's pretty...\nMichael Cavanagh: Nothing. It's all in balance, but I think as Brian said, the bar is always high. But I think we look at smaller stuff and like Masergy and even smaller, and there's a steady diet of trying to add capability, innovation and scale it up across the whole footprint of Cable. And a lot of it is inclusive of, remember, the road map for tech, video aggregation, broadband and the like is shared with Sky. And so when we look at that question, we're really looking across both of those businesses together.\nDavid Watson: I think two things. One, just following on Masergy, it is a great example. It's an opportunity to grow. It's one of our most important areas, mid-market and enterprise just an example of making the right kind of bet on that and it's off to a really good start. The teams are working really well together. Masergy, our business services teams, and doing exactly what we'd hoped for in the early days of integration. Second point is APCO in a joint venture with Charter, another great example of an opportunity to grow. And having a scaled platform like that, investing in that future, I think, is the right kind of bet to make. We'll continue to look for those opportunities.\nJeffrey Shell: Yes. But just following up on the last thing you said, the per cap. So I think one of the surprises coming out of the pandemic for us has been the strength of per cap spending. Normally, people who come in from international spend more on Harry Potter wands and so forth than people domestically. And we've seen domestic per cap speed just tremendous coming out of the pandemic. And we've seen no weakness in that coming out of the quarter into the next quarter.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Brett. Operator next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks for taking the questions. So you've been willing to run leverage higher than 2.4 times in the past. It feels like at this point the market isn't giving you full credit for the strength that you see longer term in the Cable business and in this combination of assets and I'm wondering if now is a great time to sort of take advantage of that. Was the reason for not pushing leverage higher and buying back more of your stock just be the macro environment? Is that what's sort of holding you back on leverage is macro uncertainty?\nMichael Cavanagh: More or less, yes, Jonathan. It's Mike. So I mean, I think we think about the long-term cycles that are around our businesses and the economy. And I mean, it's been our view that having a strong balance sheet defined by the leverage or the ratings we've chosen to seek is the right way to run the balance sheet. And I think Brian talked about and others have observed that together with the ability to invest heavily in our businesses, maintain a strong balance sheet, return lots of capital to shareholders and keep driving future growth by investing back in the businesses is a formula that in times like these with uncertain markets, I think there's a lot of companies out there that wish they had those characteristics. So it's not lost on us. But nonetheless, we've been active in capital return, $6 billion of buybacks in the year-to-date, 14th year in a row of raising the dividend. That's on the back of really strong financials in the first half of the year. And I think, hopefully, the takeaway from this call is, our feeling comes through that we feel very good about the EBITDA strength coming into the second half of the year. So -- but that's how we think about it. I wouldn't be reacting to change our leverage and balance sheet design because it's really designed to take us through many different kinds of cycles.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Jonathan. Operator we\u2019ll take our last question please.\nOperator: And that last question will come from John Hodulik from UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Great, thank you. Just following up on some of the commentary on high-speed data competition, maybe for Dave. Can you give us a sense of what the fiber overlap is these days and maybe how that's changed over the last 12 months? And then on the ARPU, I thought there was some good commentary about rate and tier mix. Are you seeing any -- I mean, I know, Dave, you said you wouldn't chase rate to reaccelerate growth on the sub side, but do you still think you have the same pricing power that you've had, given the changes in competition? That's A. And then B, on the tier mix, have you seen any -- especially given the pressure that the consumer is seeing, have you seen any change in trends in terms of up-tiering and potential signs that consumers may look to save money on broadband and down tier? Thanks.\nDavid Watson: Yes. Hey so, Dave here John. On the overall approach towards the marketplace and pricing, really we've always segmented the marketplace. So we've done that over a long period of time, so there's not a dramatic shift in the current environment. There certainly is with mobile substitution, and I think that skews more lower end, and so, but we've always participated and had great programs like Internet Essentials, and so we don't see a real shift. We've always gone in and out in terms of our approaches towards offers and have different competitive answers. And when you look at the fiber, we've gone -- we're at 40%. That's where we are at right now. It's been the steady build they surged early on. We're quite used to it and compete very aggressively against all of the fiber group and don't really see a change. You look at the telco results, not -- it speaks for themselves. So we're -- that competitive area, we've had a consistent approach and won't change our aggressiveness, which has always been segment-based, best network, best products and let that be the main driver of our competitive playbook.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, John. That will end our call and thank you everyone for joining us.\nBrian Roberts: Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: We have no further questions at this time. There will be a replay available of today's call starting at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time. It will run through Thursday, August 4, at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.

            "content": "Thanks, Brian. Ben, I'll just take the Parks one really quickly. So, obviously the Parks business historically has been subject to macro trends and there's no reason to think that that won't be the case in the future. When we look at our business we're just not seeing it yet in our numbers and our performance. And if you kind of look at the -- we're putting up these numbers despite the fact that our international visitation domestically is about half of what it has historically been. So we expect that to increase over time back to where it should be. We have a lot of attractions. We continued building attractions during the pandemic. Brian talked about Epic in the opening. We have those attractions continuing. Internationally Japan has been steadily improving quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter, still not back to where it was pre-pandemic, but the trend line is really good. And Beijing, which was closed two of the three months of this quarter opened in the third month and is doing really well, much better than we expected despite COVID constraints still on capacity. So, and all that international performance is subject obviously to the strong dollar and that is a headwind for us. So I think we feel really good about the Parks and feel like there's a lot of growth ahead of us despite what could be macro challenges that we could or might face. We're just not seeing it yet. Thank you, Ben. Yes. So I just -- thanks, Mike. I would just add, Doug, that in the advertising market, the advertising market is choppy. I mean, I think we said that last time. It continues to be choppy, down year-on-year in the scatter market. It's really segment by segment-based though some segments are doing better. Some segments are doing worse. And we just finished the upfront, as Brian said in his opening and the upfront was way better than we expected. So definitely some, as I said choppiness, but nothing really that dramatic. Yes. Hi, Jessica, thanks. So what I mean by choppy is that there is -- it's not a broad decline or increase. So if you look at our business, first of all in the quarter, as Mike said in the opening, if you take out the NHL playouts from last year, we were actually up in the quarter, which I think is better than some of the other companies that have reported so far. So up year-on-year is a pretty good thing. And if you look at kind of what we're seeing in the scatter market, what we saw in the upfront, you have things like auto, which is down, but that's related to the fact that -- saw in GM's earnings yesterday, you just don't have a lot of cars on lots, therefore, they're not advertising. So that's why their advertising is down there. And then pharma and the upfront was up significantly as you have a backlog of drugs that weren't approved in the last couple of years by the FDA are expected to be approved. So what I mean by choppy is just segment by segment different things are going on, both up and down and there's no kind of macro overall ups and downs. On Peacock, look, we had the benefit of studying the market before we came in and we think we picked the right business strategy, which is kind of an extension of our existing business, not a new business based on dual revenue stream of subscription and advertising. And I think everybody kind of moving in that direction is the validation of that business model. And as far as advertising in general, our business, linear and Peacock, we're one of the largest advertisers out there, over $10 billion of advertising. So people coming in at the levels that are coming in, we don't expect it to have any material impact on what we sell and how we do it. If anything, our scale gives us an increasing advantage. And then you mentioned political in the next one we do, we don't want to count our chickens before they hatch, but we expect a pretty strong political, kind of season coming up.

Normally, people who come in from international spend more on Harry Potter wands and so forth than people domestically. And we've seen domestic per cap speed just tremendous coming out of the pandemic. And we've seen no weakness in that coming out of the quarter into the next quarter."

            "name": "David Watson",
            "content": "Hey Phil, this is Dave. Let me go into both of that, the competitive landscape and the promotional intensity. So let me start with the drivers very quickly, because I think that sets it up. And Brian mentioned, since March of 2020, we've added the 3 million broadband customers to this point. And so, you look at, things like the move activity, June being the lowest level, you know, this all happened, mobile substitution, really driving that 3 million with the surge and in seasonality places like Florida, that in 2021, we actually gained customers, which we normally don't and this quarter we were negative in Florida. So you put all that together. We have to, I think put that in perspective and that determines, a lot of the competitive planning, but we've always approached competition with a tremendous sense of urgency. We have local competition. We have large national scaled competition and most certainly fixed wireless is the newest one. And you go through a launch phase that typically adds pressure and we are seeing that on the front end. As Brian said, it's impacting the Connects. We do not see it in churn. So our approach is to segment the marketplace, go after each segment, provide great value, really lean into the network benefits that we have and compete fiercely for each segment. We've always done that and we'll continue to do that. Mobile is an area where we really can continue to be aggressive. We have been doing that. I think the were very strong in the second quarter in terms of mobile. I think there's more that we can do as we integrate mobile into every single sales channel. So look for us to continue to be aggressive in regards to how we package each segment and leverage mobile. What we won't do is chase pricing down to the bottom. So we're going to have a good balanced approach towards competing fiercely for each segment, but we have a great network. We have great innovation. We have the best WiFi gateway device that's out there. We're going to leverage our strengths in every part of what we do. And so, with all of those things, you manage the promotional intensity for the long run, but we continue to evolve our competitive playbook all the time. But you won't see us, go down and chase discounting. Mobile is a great addition, adding value and look for us to continue to do that. And I think, you know, one of the unusual moments part of this is with the mobile surge with wireless only coming back, look for us to continue to leverage the best broadband network with the best mobile. And by the way, for those that are paying attention to the Ookla stuff, we have the data from Ookla in terms of mobile service and Xfinity mobile is the fastest overall mobile service provider, so look for us to leverage that. We'll combine the best network with best mobile service and we'll continue to do that, but there won't be a dramatic shift in promotional intensity. Thanks, Mike. Hey, Doug. So on looking forward, almost certainly where we're at right now, I think, points towards the game plan. We had -- in broadband alone, we had really healthy ARPU growth, 3.6%, half being rate-driven, the other half just how we manage tier mix. So I think there's \u2013 if you look at the overall strength of the total relationships, 32 million broadband relationships that we have and the ability to manage through that and focusing on the strengths of the network, the strengths of the product, we'll continue to do that. We have a lot of levers that we'll focus on. And again, we talked about promotional intensity, but we're going to put customers in the right segment. We always segment the marketplace. We'll continue to do that. And so you also look at multiple growth areas that we have in Cable where Business Services, Brian talked about that, is a growth opportunity. Mobile is a growth opportunity. The platform even for Video, I feel, is a growth opportunity. So we will consistently manage and be competitive with the broadband relationships. But I think we'll continue to focus on our network and the product advantages that we have and that will help us focus on being able to the pricing approach that we have in the marketplace. No, I totally agree with that. I think two things. One, just following on Masergy, it is a great example. It's an opportunity to grow. It's one of our most important areas, mid-market and enterprise just an example of making the right kind of bet on that and it's off to a really good start. The teams are working really well together. Masergy, our business services teams, and doing exactly what we'd hoped for in the early days of integration.

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Brian Roberts",
            "content": "Thanks, Marci, and hello everyone. Our financial results were very strong across the board once again this quarter. We grew second quarter consolidated revenue by 5%, adjusted EBITDA by 10%, and adjusted EPS by 20%. We accomplished this while continuing to invest in our businesses and returned significant capital to shareholders. Specifically we bought back $3 billion worth of our stock in the quarter, bringing our total to $6 billion year-to-date. And we continue to have a healthy dividend and one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. Our prudent financial management and long-term innovation-based strategy are paying off in Cable which posted 5% growth in EBITDA and 70 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion. In fact, our EBITDA margin reached a record high of nearly 45% this quarter. While we've added nearly 800,000 broadband subscribers in the past 12 months, more recently that pace has slowed and we posted flat broadband subscriber additions in the second quarter. I'd like to dig into what we are seeing in that area. Broadband additions of course are basically a function of churn and connect activity. While churn remains well below 2019, connect activity was also lower than what we generally see in the second quarter. We believe this is primarily the result of three factors. The first category is move activity. As we've discussed for some time now, there's been a dramatic slowdown in moves across our footprint with the second quarter below 2019 by 12% and the lowest we've experienced since the pandemic began. Our win share of new customer acquisition opportunities remains high, but the slowdown in moves has resulted in fewer of these jump balls and this had had the largest impact on our gross connects. The second category is a reversal of some pandemic trends. During the pandemic, many customers, particularly at lower income levels sought to optimize home based solutions by adding broadband. This presented us with significant opportunity to take more share in residential broadband. In fact, in the first year of the pandemic, we added nearly 50% or 600,000 more customers than our prior annual average growth. At this stage in the pandemic, those opportunities have waned as consumer behavior has begun to return to pre-pandemic patterns. We've also seen some give back to a normalization of mobile substitution. In addition during the pandemic, seasonality patterns were very different than what we had seen historically and this really began to also normalize in this second quarter, causing more seasonal disconnects that did not occur at typical levels in the prior two years. The last bucket is increased competition. Fixed wireless is a new entrant in the marketplace and while there are likely to be significant long-term limitations, today's excess capacity in wireless networks is creating what we believe to be a temporary opportunity targeted at value-oriented customers. We are not seeing fixed wireless have any discernible impact on our churn, but its early growth appears to be another contributor to our lower connect activity. In addition, we continue to compete against fiber in an increasing percentage of our footprint. Notwithstanding these industry and mostly macro-related factors, we remain extremely confident. We have spent decades investing and innovating to build a business that is well-positioned to succeed in the environment were seeing and we certainly expect a return to residential broadband subscriber additions. How do we plan to do that? Well we're working hard to expand our footprint, taking advantage of growth in housing and businesses in our current markets, accelerating edge outs into new areas and we are playing offense when it comes to government subsidies. Thanks Ben. I think what I was trying to say at the end of my remarks was cutting right at your point. I think we are in a fabulous place. We have kind of unprecedented cash flow and scale by our -- what we've got as one company. We're working really well together. We always think about, whether this is the competitive right set for the company and I feel it is. If you look at all the broad diversified growth drivers that came out here again in the second quarter, whether it's Wireless net adds at a record near record levels, or the Business Service growth back to high single digits, the new attendance records to your question about Theme Parks, domestically the last couple of years in broadband, you know, obviously we've talked I'm sure some more here about that, but having almost 3 million customers going from zero to 13 million paid subs in a of couple years at Peacock is a great achievement and the highest rated broadcast network. I think all parts of the company are really doing a great job in some interesting times. By the way, our treasury department went out while interest rates were low and we've basically repriced the whole balance sheet for something on the order of 18 years average maturity at record low rates. So I feel we are able to return capital to shareholders. I think that's been a real focus and I think we did it again this quarter. Our bar is therefore very high to -- as we look at things from that -- through that strategic lens of our cash flow and scale. So I think we feel really strong. I think we have so many diversified businesses that are -- each has its own game plan and we'll talk I'm sure a little bit about some of them today, but the biggest ones are really, well run. We've got some new leadership in a number of cases and I'm really pleased with the company that could post 10% EBITDA growth. Well, actually let me start with fiber Craig. And, there we've been at it for a long period of time. You know, we've gone from zero to over 15-year period from 0% to 40% overbuild. And so that is we have good visibility to where fiber is and that's all over the place, at this point between multiple fiber providers. And important to note whether it's fiber or any other form of competition, we're growing in every single geographic area. With fixed wireless, you're right in that, there appears to be two things. One, they are adding some small business, new, maybe even expanding the marketplace a bit with small business, watching that closely. They're a little bit more rural which we have been watching, but it's kind of across the board. When you have again, this launch phase of somebody doing it at scale like this, you see it a little bit all over. But again, the difference here is our churn versus fiber back in the day where we saw churn go up. We're not seeing that here. We are seeing a little bit of pressure on connects, and it's kind of all over, which points towards more of the main drivers being what I mentioned earlier. It's the move activity plus the mobile search. So that is really the key thing, but we watch it. One of our great strengths is local competition. We stay on it in a very granular basis. We watch this very closely. So your point is a good one. Yes. Mike, you may want to jump in on this or Dave. This is Brian. The -- absolutely like the communications business that we're in, that's certainly my roots in life. And the most recent acquisition we made, we call these kind of tuck-in acquisitions, would be Masergy. And that's in the Business Services Group, and it's off to a really good start and allows us, just like you said, more capabilities. I think that's probably more what our focus is, how do we look for new revenue sources and new growth avenues and do people who've either started a company or built a company have something that we can then scale faster and that's been a good pattern. So Dave's team looks at that all the time, Mike and the business development team. So you guys want to add to that? I think it's pretty... Thanks, everybody."

            "name": "Michael Cavanagh",
            "content": "Thanks Brian and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 4 with our second quarter consolidated 2022 financial results. Revenue increased 5.1% to $30 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased to 10% to $9.8 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 20% to a $1.01 per share. And finally we generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow. Now let's turn to our business segment results starting with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable revenue increased 3.7% to $16.6 billion. EBITDA increased 5.3% to $7.4 billion. Cable EBITDA margins improved 70 basis points year-over-year reaching a record high margin of 44.9% and net cash flow grew 4.4% to $5.3 billion. Customer relationships are up 591,000 compared to last year and down 28,000 sequentially in the second quarter, reflecting lower levels of new customer connections given the current operating environment partially offset by low levels of churn, which remains well below 2019 levels. We are focused on delivering an excellent customer experience and monetizing our customer relationships over their lifetime and in in that regard, EBITDA per customer relationship grew by 3% in the quarter. Now let's discuss Cable financials in more detail. Cable revenue growth of 3.7% was driven by broadband business services, wireless and advertising revenue, partially offset by lower video and voice revenue. Broadband revenue increased 6.8% reflecting an increase of 3.6% in ARPU and growth in our residential customer base compared to last year. Net residential and business customers increased by 775,000 over the past 12 months with flat results in the second quarter. The trends that we saw through the second quarter have largely continued into the early parts of the third quarter with connects remaining soft while churn is still near all-time lows. This has resulted in a quarter-to-date loss of roughly 30,000 customers. July is typically the weakest month of the quarter and the vast majority of quarterly connect activity is weighted towards August and September, which is helped by back-to-school activity. While we're optimistic that we will have a healthy back-to-school season, short term visibility remains low and more importantly, beyond this temporary period, we are confident that our broadband speeds, reliability, coverage and control features continue to position us as the best-in-class product for our customers, allowing us to protect and grow our 32 million broadband customer base over time. Business Services, revenue increased 10% or approximately 6% excluding the acquisition of Masergy which closed at the beginning of last year's fourth quarter. This healthy organic growth was driven by increases in average rates per customer and in our customer base, which grew by 54,000 compared to last year with 10,000 additions in the second quarter. Moving to Wireless, revenue increased 30% mainly driven by service revenue, which was fueled by growth in customer lines. Overall, we added 1.2 million lines compared to last year, including 317,000 lines in the quarter, which was our highest net additions for any second quarter on record. Advertising revenue increased 10%, mainly fueled by political revenue as well as strong growth at both our advanced advertising business free will [ph] and at our streaming business Zumo, which was partially offset by decline in our local core advertising business. As a reminder, Zumo, which contributed about 20% of our advertising growth this quarter is now part of our Charter JV and beginning of the third quarter will no longer be reported in our Cable results. For Video revenue declined 2.4% driven by customer net losses totaling $1.8 million compared to last year, including $521,000 net losses in the quarter, partially offset by 7% ARPU growth due to residential rate increase at the beginning of this year. Last Voice revenue declined 12% primarily reflecting customer losses totaling $902,000 compared to last year, including $286,000 net losses in the quarter and reflects our shift in focus to bundling broadband with wireless. Turning to expenses, Cable Communications second quarter expenses increased 2.5%. Programming expenses decreased 1.6% reflecting the year-over-year decline in Video customers partially offset by higher contractual rates. Non-programming expenses increased 5.2% driven by growth in our Wireless business, expenses related to our recent acquisition of Masergy and an increase in bad debt as we returned to more normalized levels and compared to lower levels last year. These higher costs were partially offset by decline in customer service expenses, reflecting lower activity levels in the business, as well as improvement in customer experience initiatives. Wrapping up on Cable, we are very pleased with the 5.3% increase in EBITDA and record EBITDA margins. Even as we prioritize increasing investment in our network with CapEx intensity at nearly 11%, we generated a significant level of net cash flow, and we believe our ability to continue to generate strong and growing net cash flow out of the Cable business is sustainable. Now let's turn to Slide 6 for NBCUniversal. Starting with total NBCUniversal results, revenue increased 19% to $9.4 billion and EBITDA increased 19.5% to $1.9 billion. Media revenue increased 3.6% to $5.3 billion, driven by Peacock with revenue up $444 million, which is more than three and a half times higher compared to last year. Distribution revenue increased 8.4% reflecting growth at Peacock, driven by increases in paid subscribers compared to last year and growth at our networks as higher contractual rates were only partially offset by linear subscriber declines. Advertising revenue decreased 1.3% due to linear rating declines and a difficult comparison to last year when we had a higher number of sporting events and NHL, which we no longer have rights to, partially offset by a growing contribution from Peacock and higher pricing. Excluding the impact of sports timing and NHL advertising would have grown low single digits. Media EBITDA decreased 2.9% to $1.3 billion in the second quarter, including a $467 million EBITDA loss at Peacock. Excluding Peacock, Media EBITDA increased nearly 4% driven by a decrease in sports costs associated with a lower number of events compared to last year and the absence of the NHL. We continue to expect Peacock's EBITDA loss will be roughly $2.5 billion for the year; however, taking into consideration the timing of content launches, we expect losses to be higher in the second half, especially in the fourth quarter. Moving next to Studios, revenue increased 33% to $3 billion driven by higher theatrical and content licensing revenue. Theatrical revenue nearly tripled compared to last year's results, driven by an increase in a number of releases, as well as the success of these films, including the outstanding results of Jurassic World: Dominion. Content licensing revenue was up 19%, mainly driven by growth in TV licensing as production has returned to pre pandemic levels. EBITDA decreased $155 million to break even for the quarter, driven by an increase in programming and production costs associated with the higher content licensing and theatrical revenue in the current quarter, as well as an increase in marketing costs ahead of several film releases in late June and in July, including the very successful release of Minions: The Rise of Gru, Black Phone, and Nope. Last at Theme Parks revenue increased 65% to $1.8 billion and we generated EBITDA of $632 million, which was a record level for any second quarter, even though Universal Beijing was closed for most of the quarter due to COVID-related restrictions. These results show strong improvement compared to last year when Hollywood was operating at limited capacity and Japan was closed for part of the quarter. We continue to see strong demand and EBITDA growth at our US parks, where attendance and guest spending has been above 2019 levels, with Orlando delivering its highest level of EBITDA for any quarter and Hollywood experiencing its best second quarter EBITDA on record. Universal Japan has shown a nice rebound since capacity restrictions were lifted at the end of March with attendance having its strongest improvement since the pandemic and we expect momentum will build over the long-term. Universal Beijing was closed for about two months and reopened at the end of June, resulting in an EBITDA loss at that part of this quarter. However, this was still a financial improvement compared to the level of pre-opening costs we incurred in the same period last year. Since reopening the parks, the trends have been positive, despite capacity restrictions and testing requirements. While COVID remains a risk, we must manage, particularly in Asia, we remain bullish on the Parks business, both in the near and long-term. Now let's turn to Slide 7 for Sky, which I will speak to on a constant currency basis. For the second quarter, Sky revenue decreased 3.5% to $4.5 billion as low single digit growth in the UK was more than offset by our results in Italy and Germany, where we continued to transition through resets in our sports rights. Direct-to-consumer revenue decreased to 2.4% reflecting consistent average revenue for customer relationship and a decline in customer relationships compared to last year, including customer losses in the quarter of $255,000, which partially reflects normal customer churn associated with the end of the football season, as well as an increasingly challenging macroeconomic environment for consumers across Europe. Direct-to-consumer revenue in the UK increased low single digits in the quarter due to an increase in video revenue, primarily driven by higher revenue from pubs and clubs as they recover from the pandemic, as well as increases in wireless and broadband revenue. This growth in the UK was more than offset primarily by a decrease in revenue in Italy, due to the reset in our Syria broadcast rights. Rounding out the rest of revenue at Sky content revenue declined 16% driven by the reset in sports licensing agreements in Italy and Germany, and advertising revenue decreased 3.1% with growth in the UK and Germany, despite a difficult macro environment, more than offset by decline in Italy. Turning to EBITDA, Sky's EBITDA increased 71% to $863 million reflecting our strong growth in the UK and improved results in Germany and Italy, mainly driven by lower sports programming and production costs due to resets in our sports rights. As a reminder, the upcoming World Cup will take place in the fourth quarter, which is the first time this event has taken place during National League's regular season schedules. To accommodate this national soccer leagues, including the EPL, we'll start the new season one to two weeks earlier in the third quarter, and then take a pause for a period of four game weeks in the fourth quarter while the World Cup is played. As a result, compared to last year, we will incur higher sports programming amortization in the third quarter with lower levels in the fourth quarter and higher again in the first half of next year. Now I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 8. We generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow this quarter. Cash taxes of $2.75 billion included some items that drove us above the normal run rate by roughly $600 million. Consolidated total capital increased 12% reflecting significant progress in building Epic Universe in Orlando, higher capital spending at Cable driven by investments in line extensions and scalable infrastructure, partially offset by a decrease at Sky. For the year we continue to expect Cable CapEx intensity to stay around 11% as we work towards enhancing and transitioning our broadband network to DOCSIS 4.0 in the next several years, and NBCUniversal CapEx to be up around $1 billion dollars year-over-year, driven by the construction of Epic. Based on what we reported in the first six months of the year, that means total capital should be about $2.5 billion higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half. Working capital was $1.7 billion for the first half of 2022 and is likely to be slightly below this amount in the second half of the year, reflecting the continued ramp in content creation and the timing of annual sports rights payments. Turning to capital allocation, we repurchased $3 billion worth of our shares in the quarter. In addition, dividend payments totaled $1.2 billion for a total return of capital in the second quarter of $4.2 billion. We ended the quarter with net leverage at 2.3 times in line with our expectations for leverage to remain around 2.4 times going forward. So with that, thanks for joining us on the call this morning. I'll turn it back to Marci who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call. So Mike, it's Doug. I'll jump in. I think across the board we're generally -- we're not seeing slowdown. Dave can comment or add on payments on the consumer side and I'll let Jeff comment on advertising, but versus some of the commentary you've seen, I think we're able to deal with some of the macro stuff impact on consumer and impact on cost in our expense base. Brian already mentioned the interest rate side of it, and 85% fixed at the grade levels we -- he mentioned. And then on our expense base, very small part of it is energy related through fuel rolling trucks. Others -- other areas, labor and the like, we have pressures like all others. But I think we know how to manage our way through these kind of challenges. So I wouldn't call out as we look to the second half of the year that macro is a particularly big issue. I'll let Jeff jump in. And I'll just jump in one more time, and Dave can follow up. But I mean, when we -- across all the businesses, budget exercise and the like, I mean, our job and the way we think about it is to really think about optimizing for the long-term. So last thing you're going to see us doing is -- and it goes back to the strength of balance sheet, strength of cash flow, we won't be cutting muscle. We're very focused on in tougher times trimming some fat, but it will be very, very long-term minded in how we think about investment priorities, which are substantial to drive future growth and so fortunately, we're in a position where we don't have to sacrifice that. That doesn't mean there won't be tactical adjustments and belt tightening, but I'll throw it over to Dave. Nothing. It's all in balance, but I think as Brian said, the bar is always high. But I think we look at smaller stuff and like Masergy and even smaller, and there's a steady diet of trying to add capability, innovation and scale it up across the whole footprint of Cable. And a lot of it is inclusive of, remember, the road map for tech, video aggregation, broadband and the like is shared with Sky. And so when we look at that question, we're really looking across both of those businesses together. More or less, yes, Jonathan. It's Mike. So I mean, I think we think about the long-term cycles that are around our businesses and the economy. And I mean, it's been our view that having a strong balance sheet defined by the leverage or the ratings we've chosen to seek is the right way to run the balance sheet. And I think Brian talked about and others have observed that together with the ability to invest heavily in our businesses, maintain a strong balance sheet, return lots of capital to shareholders and keep driving future growth by investing back in the businesses is a formula that in times like these with uncertain markets, I think there's a lot of companies out there that wish they had those characteristics. So it's not lost on us. But nonetheless, we've been active in capital return, $6 billion of buybacks in the year-to-date, 14th year in a row of raising the dividend. That's on the back of really strong financials in the first half of the year. And I think, hopefully, the takeaway from this call is, our feeling comes through that we feel very good about the EBITDA strength coming into the second half of the year. So -- but that's how we think about it. I wouldn't be reacting to change our leverage and balance sheet design because it's really designed to take us through many different kinds of cycles."

Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Executive Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone. Joining me on this morning's call are Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh, Dave Watson, Jeff Shell and Dana Strong. Brian and Mike will make formal remarks, while Dave, Jeff and Dana will also be available for Q&A.  Let me now refer you to Slide 2, which contains our safe harbor disclaimer and remind you that this conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our 8-K and trending schedules for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.  With that, let me turn the call over to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?\nBrian Roberts: Thanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. 2022 is off to a great start. Each of our businesses posted healthy growth in adjusted EBITDA, contributing to a double-digit increase in adjusted EPS as well as significant free cash flow generation in the quarter. And we achieved all of this while continuing to invest in our businesses for the long term, while also increasing our return of capital to shareholders.  Our company has been at the forefront of innovation in connectivity and also in content. We have built a leading global technology platform, which today delivers 5 billion entertainment streams a week and 40 million voice commands a day across Comcast, Sky and our current syndication partners.  Yesterday's announcement highlights the value of what we've created. As you probably are aware, we formed a joint venture with Charter to offer our award-winning, voice-controlled streaming platform across the United States, starting with Flex and XClass TV, and to further develop this technology. Not only will we bring these products to millions of more customers, but we'll open the door to brand-new revenue opportunities. And when you combine Charter's footprint with our current syndication partners in both the U.S. and Canada, our retail distribution through Walmart and Sky, which essentially runs off the same technology, we now have a truly global platform.  This joint venture is a win-win. Consumers will get our proven world-class user and search experiences, simple content navigation and more choice in the streaming marketplace. App developers, retailers and hardware manufacturers will have access to 1 platform and 1 set of standards to quickly deploy their offerings across the U.S. And we'll be able to share in the investment and innovate alongside a partner we know well.  Comcast and Charter have a track record of coming together to bring new products and technologies to consumers. Most notably, our mobile operating partnership from 2018 enabled both companies to bring greater value and a better experience that people love. The result is a more competitive wireless marketplace, and the service that we provide has been rated #1 in customer satisfaction against all other mobile providers.  Peacock also benefits from this joint venture as it will be deeply integrated into the platform the way it is on X1 and Flex today, which will help expand Peacock's customer base more quickly and drive higher engagement resulting in greater monetization for NBCUniversal. And we are doing all of this in the context of the investments we have already made in our technology and within the guidelines we've provided on our last earnings call with respect to our plans for programming investment.  So let's come back to our achievements in the first quarter. Starting with broadband, we measured our success based on customer and financial metrics. And while we continue to compete aggressively in the current environment, we are striking what I believe to be the right balance between customer acquisition and long-term profitable growth. You can see with our first quarter results, where we added 194,000 customer relationships and 262,000 broadband subscribers, while on the financial side, Cable generated 5% revenue and 6.5% adjusted EBITDA growth, with 44% adjusted EBITDA margins.  Our distinct competitive advantage stems from our network, which has a level of flexibility that enables fast innovation and will be further enhanced through virtualization, an important stepping stone in our ultimate evolution to DOCSIS 4.0. Our path to ubiquitous, multi-gig, symmetrical speed is well underway. And in the next several years, when you collectively include Charter and Cox, the cable industry will be positioned to offer multi-gig, symmetrical speeds to over 100 million homes throughout the United States over essentially the same DOCSIS 4.0 infrastructure. None of our competitors can say the same thing.  For years, we focused on not only having a modern high-capacity network, but importantly, we've also focused on providing our customers with cutting-edge technology in their homes to ensure that they have the best experience, which is a combination of fast speeds, whole home coverage, cybersecurity and control, together with fantastic streaming capabilities.  During the quarter, we performed a number of successful tests on 10G equipment, and we launched our newest and most powerful xFi gateway, which increases bandwidth in the home by 3x and is the only modem that can support multi-gig symmetrical speeds to date.  We're also enhancing the value of Xfinity broadband by bundling with mobile, offering our customers the convenience of one relationship for all their connectivity at a tremendous value. This contributed to even further improvement in broadband retention and our best quarter ever for Xfinity Mobile in terms of line net additions.  We have a great wireless business, an MVNO partner in Verizon and have opportunities to further improve our economics at Xfinity Mobile longer term. For example, our testing of deploying spectrum to potentially offload wireless traffic is progressing nicely. During the quarter, we turned up our first 5G radios, and we'll be launching an employee field test in June. Stepping back, the underlying theme in all of this and the core of our strategy is that we put the customer first, which drives our strong financial results. The investments we have made and continue to make are expressly meant to enhance the experience of every person that is connected to our products and services. To that end, we just had the highest level of customer satisfaction we have ever seen for our first quarter. And we maintained our positive trend in reducing both agent handle interactions and truck rolls, which declined 19% and 17%, respectively.  So let's switch to NBC Universal. We had a lot of exciting things happened during the first quarter. For the first time in our history, we aired both the Super Bowl and the Olympics in the same week, affirming our expertise in production. During that period, I went to our facility in Stanford, Connecticut. I have to say, I was so impressed by the hard work and the entire team working 24/7 around the clock, working with Beijing, while being in Connecticut, providing a seamless broadcast for the Olympics. We sent some of our equipment to China when we thought our broadcast operations would be there. And on the fly, we had to figure out new ways to air this special event and not have a consumer know that was happening. Amazing how well the team managed the complexity, delivered an unbelievably high-quality product to hundreds of millions of viewers. And I think this will help innovate sports productions for years to come.  We learned a lot about streaming from the last Olympics. And so when it came to Beijing, we provided a much improved experience on Peacock, which shared every single event for the first time, driving significant engagement. Really was an exceptional quarter overall for Peacock, with other big sporting events and content launches, including the Super Bowl, the debut of Bel Air, our most successful original to date, and the day and date release of Marry Me. Importantly, retention on our service after airing all of this special content in such a concentrated period of time was well above our expectation. We added 4 million paid subscribers to end the first quarter with over 13 million paid subscribers and 28 million monthly active accounts in the U.S. And we've seen a 25% increase in hours of engagement year-over-year. Given the natural ebbs and flows of our content slate, we do not anticipate seeing this type of growth every quarter. We just expanded our total paid subscribers by over 40%. So we expect more modest subscriber gains until we get to the back half of this year.  Our fourth quarter should be fantastic for sporting events such as Sunday Night Football, Premier League and the World Cup; a pay one availability of top universal titles like Minions, Rise Crew and Jurassic World Dominion; original series such as Vampire Academy; and for the first time, starting this fall, Peacock will be the exclusive home of the next-day NBC broadcast. Our streaming strategy is differentiated, unique, because Peacock is a natural extension of our existing video businesses with 2 revenue streams and full integration across every aspect, whether it's programming, cross-promotion or advertising. Peacock builds audiences, extends our reach and creates new consumer experiences within our ecosystem, which should enable video to be a major long-term growth driver for NBCUniversal.  Finally, the business we haven't talked enough about is Theme Parks, where the recovery continues to be fantastic. I'm particularly excited about the new attractions that we opened during the pandemic, that many of our guests are now able to experience for the first time, like Super Nintendo World in Japan; the amazing VelociCoaster in Orlando; Pets in Hollywood; and of course, Universal Beijing. Our investments are significantly expanding the potential of our Theme Parks business, which will remain an important and exciting growth engine for years to come.  So Comcast is truly in a unique position of growing EBITDA, generating a robust level of free cash flow while making important organic investments in long-term growth initiatives and also increasing our return of capital to shareholders, which totaled $4.2 billion this quarter through a combination of $3 billion in buybacks and $1.2 billion in dividends, the largest return of capital for any quarter in our history.  So off to a great start in the first quarter, and I'd like to now hand it over to Mike.\nMichael Cavanagh: Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 4 with our first quarter consolidated 2022 financial results. Revenue increased 14% to $31 billion; adjusted EBITDA increased 9% to $9.2 billion; adjusted EPS increased 13% to $0.86 per share; and finally, we generated $4.8 billion of free cash flow.  Now let's turn to our business segment results, starting with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable revenue increased 4.7% to $16.5 billion, adjusted EBITDA increased 6.5% to $7.3 billion and net cash flow grew 8.3% to $5.6 billion. We grew customer relationships by 913,000 over the past 12 months with 194,000 net additions in the first quarter. Overall, customer growth was driven by broadband, where we added 1.1 million net new residential and business customers over the past 12 months and 262,000 in the first quarter. This quarter's results reflect continued low move-related activity compared to historical levels as well as an uptick in the level of competitive activity resulting in lower connect volumes. At the same time, we continue to experience very high levels of customer retention, with this quarter's results yielding the lowest churn rate for any quarter on record. In fact, we had fewer customers disconnect this quarter than the first quarter of 2019 despite a customer base that is almost 17% larger.  Throughout the pandemic, we have offered a variety of programs to help our customers stay connected. Some of our customers that participated received our services for free and therefore, were not included in our subscriber totals. At year-end, we ended these COVID-related programs, triggering a benefit in the first quarter. We estimate this change accounted for about 1/3 of our first quarter net additions with such benefit contained to the first quarter.  Moving to the financials. Cable's revenue growth of 4.7% was driven by broadband, business services, wireless and advertising revenue, partially offset by lower video and voice revenue. Broadband revenue increased 8%, driven by strong customer additions over the past 12 months and nearly 4% growth in average revenue per customer in the quarter.  Business Services revenue increased 10.6% or approximately 6%, excluding the acquisition of Masergy, which closed at the beginning of last year's fourth quarter. This healthy organic growth was driven by increases in both average rates per customer and in our customer base, which grew by 61,000 over the past 12 months with 9,000 additions in the first quarter.  Moving to wireless. Revenue increased 32%, mainly driven by service revenue, which was fueled by growth in customer lines. Overall, we added 1.2 million lines over the past 12 months, including 318,000 lines in the quarter, which, for the fifth consecutive quarter, was our best result since launching this business in 2017.  Advertising revenue increased 8.6%, reflecting higher political and double-digit growth in Zumo and advanced advertising. For video, revenue declined 1.5%, driven by customer net losses totaling $1.7 million over the past 12 months, including $512,000 in the quarter, partially offset by higher average revenue per customer due to a residential rate increase at the beginning of this year.  Last, voice revenue declined 9.8%, primarily reflecting customer losses totaling 725,000 over the past 12 months, including 282,000 net losses in the quarter and reflects our shift to more converged broadband mobile offers.  Turning to expenses. Cable Communications' first quarter expenses increased 3.3%. Programming expenses decreased 1.1%, reflecting a decline in video customers, partially offset by higher rates. Nonprogramming expenses increased 6.3%, reflecting investments in our growth businesses, including broadband, wireless and business services; expenses related to our recent acquisition of Masergy; as well as an increase in other expenses, primarily due to bad debt returning to more normalized levels. These higher costs were partially offset by a decline in customer service expenses, reflecting lower activity levels in the business as well as improvement in customer experience initiatives.  Cable Communications' EBITDA increased 6.5% to $7.3 billion for the quarter and Cable EBITDA margin reached 44%, reflecting 80 basis points of year-over-year improvement. We believe we are striking the right balance by continuing to invest in our growth businesses, which are driving the top line and proving to be a great return for us, while at the same time, continuing to increase our operating efficiency and remove unnecessary costs.  Now let's turn to Slide 6 for NBCUniversal. Starting with total NBCUniversal results, revenue increased 47% to $10.3 billion and EBITDA increased 7.4% to $1.6 billion. Media revenue increased 36% to $6.9 billion, including Peacock revenue, which grew more than 5x year-over-year to $472 million in the quarter. As Brian noted earlier, we aired both the Olympics and Super Bowl, which together contributed an incremental $1.5 billion to Media revenue. Excluding these events, Media revenue increased 6.9% driven by both higher distribution and advertising revenue. Distribution revenue, excluding the contribution from the Olympics, increased 8.5%, reflecting growth at Peacock driven by increases in paid subscribers as well as our networks, reflecting higher contractual rates, partially offset by linear subscriber declines.  Advertising revenue, excluding contributions from the Olympics and Super Bowl, increased 4%, reflecting higher pricing and a growing contribution from Peacock, which was partially offset by linear ratings declines.  Media EBITDA decreased 21% to $1.2 billion in the first quarter, including a $456 million EBITDA loss at Peacock. Excluding Peacock, Media EBITDA decreased 7.7%, reflecting higher programming and production costs associated with our broadcast of the Beijing Olympics and Super Bowl as well as higher costs driven by the return of our full primetime schedule compared to last year when our schedule was impacted by COVID-19. We continue to expect Peacock's EBITDA loss will be roughly $2.5 billion for the year. However, taking into consideration the timing of content launches, consistent with what Brian mentioned, we would expect losses to be higher in the second half of the year.  Moving next to Studios. Revenues increased 15% to $2.8 billion, driven by higher content licensing and theatrical revenue, but EBITDA declined 51% to $245 million. The decline in EBITDA primarily reflects a difficult comparison to last year's first quarter, which benefited from a licensing deal with Peacock, including exclusive streaming rights for The Office with an offsetting adjustment reflected in NBCUniversal's eliminations. The remainder of the EBITDA decline reflects higher marketing costs ahead of numerous film releases planned for the second quarter, including Jurassic World Dominion, Ambulance and Bad Guys.  Last, at Theme Parks, revenue increased by $941 million to $1.6 billion, and we generated EBITDA of $451 million, reflecting improved results at each of our parks compared to last year when Orlando and Japan were operating at limited capacity and Hollywood was closed due to COVID-19. We continue to see exceptional demand at our domestic parks, attendance was back to prepandemic levels, and we had strong growth in per caps with Orlando generating its highest EBITDA on record for a first quarter.  COVID impacts in the quarter were more pronounced internationally. Universal Studios Japan's results were impacted by capacity restrictions, which were in place for most of the first quarter. These restrictions were lifted at the end of March. And over the last month, we have seen a very strong rebound with attendance currently above pre-pandemic levels.  At Universal Beijing, which opened in September of last year, demand from our guests was high, but overall attendance was impacted by COVID and related travel restrictions. Despite that, Beijing only contributed a slight EBITDA loss in the quarter.  Now let's turn to Slide 7 for Sky, which I will speak to on a constant currency basis. For the first quarter, Sky revenue of $4.8 billion was consistent with the same period last year as solid growth in the U.K. was offset by our results in Italy, where we continue to transition through the reset in our Syria broadcast rights, which we won't begin to lap until the back half of this year. Direct-to-consumer revenue was also consistent year-over-year, reflecting growth in the U.K., where we continue to have healthy customer additions and grew direct-to-consumer revenue by mid-single digits driven by an increase in video revenue, including higher revenue from pubs and clubs, streaming and premium TV as well as healthy increases in broadband and wireless revenue. This growth in the U.K. was mainly offset by lower revenue in Italy, where we continue to experience both customer losses and lower direct-to-consumer revenue, primarily due to the reset in our Syria broadcast rights.  Rounding out the rest of revenue at Sky, content revenue declined 14%, driven by the reset and sports licensing agreements in Italy and Germany. And advertising revenue increased 7.9% and with healthy growth in the U.K., partially offset by a decline in Italy.  Turning to EBITDA. Sky's EBITDA increased 71% to $622 million driven by our strong performance in the U.K. and improved results in Italy and Germany, where we benefited from lower sports programming costs due to resets in our sports rights.  Next, I'll discuss free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 8. As I mentioned earlier, we generated $4.8 billion in free cash flow this quarter. Consolidated total capital increased 1.1%, reflecting increases at NBCU due to ramping construction at Epic Universe, a decrease at Sky and a relatively flat capital spending at Cable due to timing. For the year, we continue to expect Cable CapEx intensity to stay around 11% as we increase investment in our broadband network, and NBCUniversal CapEx related to the construction of EPIC universe to be up around $1 billion year-over-year.  Turning to capital allocation. As of today, we have repurchased $4 billion worth of our shares year-to-date, including $3 billion in the first quarter. In addition, dividend payments totaled $1.2 billion for a total return of capital in the first quarter of $4.2 billion.  And before I wrap up, I also want to spend a minute on the macro environment since inflation and interest rates are topical right now. There are certain areas of expense across each of our businesses that are impacted by inflation. Like other companies in our space, we're not entirely insulated from that. However, the overall impact to our financials has been limited. Overall energy costs make up about 1% of our total company's operating expenses. Also, we are more than offsetting any pressure on wages and other areas of expense through the continuing efforts to implement operational efficiencies, helping us protect the healthy margins across our businesses.  Lastly, our balance sheet is very well positioned with about 95% of our debt based on fixed rates, a debt portfolio with a weighted average time to maturity of approximately 18 years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.47%. We ended the quarter with net leverage at 2.3x and still expect to remain around 2.4x leverage going forward.  So with that, thanks for joining us on the call this morning. I'll turn it back to Marci, who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call.\nA - Marci Ryvicker: Thanks, Mike. Operator, let's open the call for questions, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Brian, could you talk a little bit about your decision to create this joint venture with Charter versus sort of going at it, just Comcast alone? It seems like aggregation is a huge opportunity, but JVs can be tricky to operate. How do you set it up for success? And is there a way to frame the benefit to Comcast over the next couple of years as this JV sort of goes to market more aggressively next year?  And then, Dave, on broadband, I think this is the first quarter you sort of highlighted incremental competitive pressure on gross adds. Was there a change in the quarter? And can you just talk about sort of how you're thinking about customer segmentation, if there's any change to your appetite to take rate in order to sort of manage through the competitive environment.\nBrian Roberts: So let me start, and thanks, Ben. Look, I think that working with Charter, first of all, they bring terrific markets that we don't operate in. And so taking from the perspective of people who might want to take advantage of our platform that we will together have created, will create and roll out, whether that's a hardware company, a software company or some new creation, they're going to want national scale and frankly, an international platform. That's who the competitive set is, and being able to enable people's businesses to ride on those platforms and create value for our shareholders and Charter shareholders, I think, is the big picture. We've done this work with Charter before. When you go to your question about joint ventures versus doing it alone, obviously, there's pros and cons, but when another party brings something you don't have, that makes it a pro. We've done this successfully, maybe highlight the Mobile business that we both have now jumped started very successfully and was -- is one a real standout this quarter with our best net add quarter.  Business services. As we go upmarket to -- ultimately to the enterprise market and to large organizations, it was important that we find ways to have one-stop shopping for those companies. That's -- we've successfully done that with Charter and others.  Advertising, same thing with local JVs and national JVs to be able to deliver to advertisers. So we have a long history of successfully finding ways to be catalysts for growth.  And then finally, a point that's a little longer than 2 years, but one of the great things about our industry over the last several decades is how we keep reinventing the businesses we're in. And it's pretty important, I think, to continue to find new growth avenues. And so I look at our innovation that we've been doing at Comcast and now with Sky on a global basis to being able to continue to invest to have the reach and to have a continued hope for new revenue sources in the years ahead, these are the kind of steps you have to make now to make -- to see those dividends down the road. Dave?\nDavid Watson: Just a quick comment on that. I think we are -- as Brian said, we're really excited about this partnership and being able to leverage a decade-plus of innovation around the tech platform. And we're already performing very well.  Just to put things in perspective, we do with -- you combine everything that we do with Sky across our entire portfolio, we do 5 billion streams a week of the streaming content. And voice remote commands, we do 40 million voice commands a day. So it's just we have a wonderful platform. Now we have a wonderful partner, as Brian said, being able to pull things off with. And now I think this scale matters. So excited about the future of that.  So to your question on competition and just a couple of things. We have been in a competitive environment, going up against a variety of different service providers for quite a while. We've seen it and anticipate this when they launch. You have good visibility towards new footprint and launches. So there's been multiple cycles that we have competed and gone everywhere from low-end pricing with DSL or DSL-like competitors to fiber launches in over 15 years now of fiber activity. So we think that the main thing that we're dealing with right now in this cycle, while there has definitely been an uptick in competitive activity with launches that have happened over throughout the last couple of years of new footprint, new launches between fiber and fixed wireless, the main thing in this case is our churn is at record lows. And it has been decreasing churn activity for over a long period of time, and it has continued. So this last quarter, it's record low quarter for any quarter.  So -- but having said that, we take it seriously, the competition. When you look at the amount of footprint that has continued over the last year-plus. And with fixed wireless and fiber, we have a real game plan that we've had and added to over time, where we segment the marketplace; we compete at a very granular basis where there's new launches and focus on leveraging every product that we have; and most certainly, we're playing offense with Mobile. So we have great broadband, and it kind of goes towards pricing that when we segment the marketplace, we have granular approaches towards competing and then being able to have multiple tiers of great broadband and really focus on the strength of our network that is ubiquitous.  We compete everywhere and have a multiple -- a variety of broadband packages, and we're not going to have trade-offs in the marketplace where it's a time-of-day trade-offs, geographic trade-offs and where they're at or not at or perhaps even peak-moment trade-offs. So we have a ubiquitous, consistent, great network that we'll go to market with that we have.  And so yes, there's been most certainly an uptick in competitive performance, and we see that. We've anticipated it. But the main issues we believe are the macro issues that or move activities down, that has continued. And we have seen actually, in our footprint, the move activity in March was actually less -- continued to be less move activity change of address in March than it was in February. So we think those are the macro issues are the primary things. And in this cycle, we're well positioned to compete, and we're going to compete aggressively.\nOperator: The next question comes from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse.\nDouglas Mitchelson: I've got one for Dave, one for Jeff. Dave, how do you see wireless pricing and execution evolving? You're offering a pretty good deal for customers, even though your phone subsidies aren't as great as the big 3? But as you scale the business as you start to offload traffic, you're going to have more room, which you either drop to the bottom line or invest in scaling wireless more quickly. And given the broadband pressures you all discussed on the call, I'm just curious whether you think you get more aggressive investing in customer growth? And is there more ways for you to ramp customer growth even from these high levels? Or should we think about it more as driving profitability for the division? And then Jeff, sort of the obvious question, just any streaming strategy, we think, post Netflix.\nDavid Watson: Let me start, Doug, on Mobile. So I start with -- it was a great quarter, it's had another record in terms of mobile lines. So we absolutely believe our strategy and focus on accelerating growth in wireless is indeed working. And so over the last couple of years, we have evolved our approach, including expanding the MVNO agreement, worked on that, and that's been, I think, a boost. And we're fully integrating Mobile and one of the most important things into everything we do at cable. We're leaning in our marketing. We're playing offense with Mobile in terms of how we talk about it, attracting new customers in consideration and with our customer base. So every single sales channel has been activated at this point.  So yes, this year, we're going to continue to make adjustments with Mobile. We're leveraging the -- still the new unlimited pricing. We have a great mix between that and by the gig. And we're converging broadband with Mobile. And when you take both, there's just more value for the customer. And we think that this converged packaging approach, really putting the emphasis in terms of service value, is the key.  We come in and out of offers, and there will be, in any given moment where the new product introduction, a offer, a promotional offer around gift cards and different things that we do on handsets. But the main point for us, and I think it's proven with our results having good success that this works, is not to put the emphasis necessarily on the handset. So leaning in, see it in the results, and we also do a nice job with Bring Your Own Device and just have launched small business and business services. So a lot of runway left, I think, in Mobile.  And in your point on the onload opportunity down the road, we already have a great network. And the great network, combined with the MVNO with Verizon, I think, is working. And for the majority of our footprint, this capital-light approach to wireless is the right approach. We continue to be opportunistic, though, and we're prepared. We're doing technical trials and leveraging our spectrum in the offload traffic in high-dense areas, where that makes financial sense. So we're running trials, optimizing the approach and turned up our first -- as Brian said, first 5G radios at the beginning of February, fully trials are underway. So we'll be ready when and if this makes sense. But we are in a good position, and we'll just be opportunistic as we look at that down the road. So like our position, like the runway, plenty of upside. Jeff?\nJeffrey Shell: Thanks, Dave. Doug. So we've said from the beginning since we launched Peacock that we're taking a different approach than most of the other people in the streaming business. We don't view Peacock really as a separate distinct business. We think it's an extension of our existing TV business, and we manage it that way. That's how we set up our business. That's how we program it. That's how we sell advertising across both linear and Peacock.  And I think that, that strategy is working. We had an exceptional quarter this quarter. We're very pleased with how we're ramping. We're pleased how we're ramping revenue. We're pleased with that. We're ramping paid subs. We're very pleased with engagement, which was up this quarter. It's going to be obviously choppy depending on what programming comes in, what time. But I think our business model is clearly the right business model. Our approach, by the way, internationally, we're taking a different approach too, much more measured approach. We're focusing on Sky markets. And in non-Sky markets, we're looking for partnerships and unique ways to enter the market.  So our business strategy is great for us. It's working. We're happy with the quarter. We're happy with how the business is scaling. And I think the noise in the rest of the streaming business really, if anything, just validates where we're going.  I would also say that we've shown, as we ramp the business, that we're willing to be flexible and change our business model. As we see things evolve, we've shifted more towards a paid AVOD model when we saw that success early on. So obviously, as things change in the streaming market, we'll continue to evaluate and shift. But right now, we're really happy with our business model and how we're performing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.\nPhilip Cusick: A follow-up and a question, if I can. So first, can you talk about anything to help us with recent trends in broadband and your thoughts on seasonality going forward into what used to be a weaker second quarter? I'm curious how many free customers didn't convert at the end of '21? And could that be part of what's been feeding the fixed wireless ecosystem?  And then second on leverage, not to be nitpicky, but leverages has continued down now 2.3x. You said you did $1 billion in April. But at this level on the stock, does it make sense to really accelerate that?\nMichael Cavanagh: Maybe I'll jump in and just Dave just commented on competition and our approach in the market. In terms of the backward-looking stuff, I think we called out that the -- you should think about the normalized level of net adds in the first quarter at about a healthy 180,000. We had a transition impact in the net subs added in the first quarter just as we ended the COVID programs where people would come on, in some cases, free. But you recall what we did during COVID, we wanted to be conservative but appropriate in how we counted subs. So wherever we brought in a sub under some form of COVID relief program with the goal of keeping the population connected, to the extent it was free, we were clear we were not going to count them until they ended being on a free program and then started paying. So consistently throughout COVID, that's the way we did it, and that's the way we ended it. So as the quarter last year ended, we put a stop to those programs. So the only -- the third that came in, in this quarter of folks that were free in the last quarter came on as free but began paying us. So I don't think we have any negative impact going forward. It's simply that there won't be any ongoing roll forward into the second quarter. It's all kind of cleans itself out in this first quarter.  And the point I'd like to make just on the quality of the approach that we took is that you can sort of see that in the conservative way we counted subs throughout allow -- the evidence of that quality is both the record low churn that we've demonstrated that Dave already commented on, together with the growth in ARPU throughout the period pre-, during and post-COVID. So I think really the point was just to make it clear that the COVID promotions came to end, and it just had a positive onetime impact in this quarter as you transition back to recover normal ways of counting subs.\nBrian Roberts: Let me -- and Mike said it perfectly. I think that 1 other point to filter here, thing is that we have consistently segmented the marketplace and that we have had great offers in multiple segments and low-income constrained segments. We've done it for a long period of time. So everything that Mike said, but we're comfortable in terms of working with customers always. We always do that. So if there's -- if we have roll-offs and things like that, we've been doing this for a long period of time.  So the only other thing in seasonality, I think there will be ongoing normalization around things like -- example is Florida. People will leave, what we're seeing just leaving a little bit early. And so that is going to happen over time, won't be a sudden onetime moment in seasonality, but it will just continue, we believe, to get back to some normal trending and student activity as well, so That's it. Mike, do you want to add?\nMichael Cavanagh: And then back on buybacks. So I think we're pleased, as we said as we -- almost a year ago now are coming up on a year ago this quarter, when we got our leverage back where we wanted to the commitments to the rating we like and strength of the balance sheet that we're glad to be back. And so this quarter, between buybacks of $3 billion and dividends of $1.2 billion, we were -- had a record quarter in the company's history in terms of dollars of capital return. So I think we're certainly informed as we go forward by where leverage is. And the fact that we ticked down a touch, I wouldn't put anything into that. It's a big -- there's a lot of moving parts as we forecast. And so we're going to stay around 2.4, but around 2.4, it could be 2.3, it could be 2.5, I would say we're sticking with -- we like leverage around that 2.4x level. And obviously, we're partially informed as well by where the stock is. And so that gives us capacity. We stepped it up a little bit in the tail end of the last quarter. And as I said on the remarks, we continued at that pace doing another $1 billion so far in the second quarter.\nBrian Roberts: So the one thing I would just add, this is Brian, is something that I'm proud of that I think we -- if you look for one of our goals is to grow your businesses. Every one of our businesses just reported that, think about the future by investing. And so we're -- whether it's the JV or the broadband investments, the Peacock investments, things we're doing at Sky, buying back stock, increasing the dividend, we're doing all those things simultaneously. And I think that is something that differentiates us.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with BFA Securities.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Brian, you just said the company needs to -- or yourself or you do reinvent yourself, which you've done consistently over the years. So going back to video, how do you see video evolving for the company? If you take a holistic view, the legacy business is shrinking faster than I believe it ever has and the competitive landscape obviously is changing a lot. How do you think about repositioning your assets, whether it's from Cable to content? Do you need to increase your presence in news, sports, international, et cetera? And then, Jeff, international visitation, I think, is still pretty low. What is it normally and what is it now?\nBrian Roberts: Well, let me start, Jessica. Nice to hear your voice. I think we have a -- we've anticipated the changes in video pretty well. And on the one side, I think part of NBC's media results are that the decline is actually less because there are new ways for people to get video. And from the Cable side, we have our highest margins, our best quarter in EBITDA and revenues, and the companies continue to grow because we pivoted the strategy. So -- and our satisfaction scores are at all-time highs. So we're giving customers choices, and we found a way to get ourselves to a place of unique and in different, so that we're not trying to push something on to a customer that perhaps is a rock up a hill that we don't want to have to do. So that strategy has worked for us. So as I think forward, I think we believe aggregation is a real opportunity on to see customers who have now so many more choices. And there's -- they just want to get to the content they want really fast and in a seamless way and somebody who makes it work for them. And we're seeing viewing patterns change. And we were just talking before the call about one of our shows on NBC at Peacock, something about PAM. Not only that come out of the dateline franchise inside the NBC IP kind of redefined video, if you will, out of the News business and the Dateline franchise. The first airing, if you just went off a traditional television rating, you might have one conclusion. And as you've watched the show grow, now with on-demand, with Peacock and with NBC Dateline Special, and you put all that together, the show's really successful. So having a company that can do all those things across both on all of the platforms NBCUniversal has positioned us. So I think we now take that, those kind of examples and figure out how, in this new partnership with Charter and across the NBC portfolio, and we find a way to continue to innovate and be relevant to the next generation and existing generation of television viewers. So I'm -- and then you put in place what Sky is doing with Sky Glass, and you see how it can be integrated into without any box right into your television, and that's what XClass can be. So I don't know, I think it's a pretty exciting road map ahead, definitely some change, and that's what I think our company has been pretty good at navigating. Jeff?\nJeffrey Shell: Yes, Jessica. So our Theme Park business, as you can see in the numbers, is absolutely performing great. And with that is your question is the international visitation in our domestic parks is less than half of what it would normally be this time of the year for Orlando in California, and even given that our bookings going forward, looking at the summer, are at historic high levels.  And the one thing I would also add is while Japan doesn't have the same international visitation as Orlando, it does have international visitation and is also seeing almost no international visitation, and it is returning to pre-pandemic levels without that international visitation too in Osaka. So we're very excited about our Theme Parks going forward.  And one of the things to note is we've invested in our attractions all during the pandemic. So international visitors who have delayed coming to our parks have a lot to experience when they -- when travel starts picking up. So we could be more confident about it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.\nCraig Moffett: I want to stay with the broadband theme for a moment. you talked about the run rate absent the free customers converting would have been around 1 80. Can you talk about the market growth aspect of that, new household formation and in particular, sort of what you're seeing in your edge-outs and the pace at which you can extend your edge-outs to try to expand the footprint a little faster? And how much sort of -- I guess, how much of a floor you think that can put on your broadband growth rate going forward?\nDavid Watson: Yes. Craig, this is Dave. So yes, on the front end in terms of the real trending of household formations, the thing that we're looking at is literally the change of address data that we stay focused on. And that's what has continued to tick down and even went further down in our footprint in March. So -- and we think there's an impact of household formation as well. So it is a good point in terms of footprint. We're very focused on our opportunities. And I think we've been pretty consistent with one new component to it of the 3 main areas of opportunity.  One is just expanding footprint within our -- the traditional cable areas that we serve, and that's high amounts of residential, single-family MDUs and some commercial within our footprint. There's been some starts and some pauses within that in terms of new construction. But in general, we think over time, that works its way, will continue to pick back up.  And the second thing are proactive builds, we call hyper builds, which is mostly commercial, but will drag in some opportunities in terms of MDUs and some resi.  And the third one is rural edge-outs. And those are the things that we've been focused on. Now there are opportunities to really play offense. And with the -- there are great programs that are available, federal and state, the subsidies that are available. And we're actively evaluating various potential opportunities and submitted a lot of applications where we've determined that this is going to provide a reasonable and economical way for us to serve these new areas. And so it's early, way early on these things, but we're having success, and we're getting some wins on these programs.  So I think, yes, this is going to be a constant focus for us to look for opportunities. We want to be the trusted partner for communities, and I think it will be competitive. A lot of people will be looking for these subsidies. But we're going to edge-out our properties and look to build out. When you look at a number, we did last year in '21, approximately a little over 800,000 new passings that we built. I think a safe way to look at it is we're -- at a minimum, we're going to shoot for that again. And hopefully, we'll have upside on that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.\nBrett Feldman: I'm actually going to follow up on the comments that Jeff was making earlier on the parks. You noted that you're seeing great performance in Orlando and per capture up considerably. First, I was wondering if you might be willing to quantify that, the extent to which your per caps are stronger now relative to where they had been prior to the pandemic. And then bigger picture, Disney has spent a lot of time talking about steps they've taken over the last 2 years to position their parks business to have a higher yield as we fully emerge from the pandemic. I was hoping maybe you could just elaborate a bit on some of the things you've done. You mentioned you've invested in new attractions. But are there other steps you've taken over the last 2 years or so that would lead you to believe that this improvement in per caps has a degree of durability to it, such that you will indeed be operating a higher-yielding business yourself whenever we're fully out of this?\nJeffrey Shell: Yes. Thanks, Brett. So I don't think I mentioned per caps. Our per caps actually are up from before the pandemic, but I was talking about attendance and mix of attendance. But the main thing we've done during the pandemic in our Theme Parks is we've continued to invest in them. So we added major attractions in all of our parks. We didn't really slow it down much during the pandemic. So VelociCoaster, our new rollercoaster in Orlando, has been just phenomenally successful.  We added Nintendo in Japan, which is showing real strength, and we're really excited that we're going to be bringing that to Hollywood next year and then ultimately to Orlando. We added a pet attraction in Hollywood. And of course, the biggest thing we're doing is we're building a new park, Epic Universe, down in Orlando, which is going to continue to add to our length of stay, and it's going to be anchored by that Nintendo land that I mentioned before, but also some of our other key attractions. So yes, our per caps are up. Yes, we cut costs in the business, which we've been pretty open about. But the main thing we did was continue to invest because we see -- we really are optimistic about that growth in that business going forward.\nOperator: And your last question is from John Hodulik with UBS.\nJohn Hodulik: Maybe two quick ones. First for Brian. Obviously, a lot of dislocations in the market and a lot of media stocks have been under pressure, especially in the last couple of weeks. Can you give us a sense of how you're viewing sort of M&A opportunities? As was said in the previous question, you guys have always taken the opportunities to reposition the company as necessary. Do you see accretive value-creating opportunities in the market sort of more so now than maybe 6 months ago? That's number one.  And then for Jeff, on Peacock, I guess, is the slowdown in net adds you guys are calling out just a function of coming off the Super Bowl and the Olympics? And then any impact from -- the strategy I hadn't heard before about putting the NBC broadcast on Peacock next day, any impact to your retransmission agreements as a result of that move?\nBrian Roberts: Thank you, John. No, I don't think there's any new things to report today. I think we're here to really focus on a great quarter and a great start to the year. Obviously, the strategy, I think Jeff said it well, that we employed and goes back a number of years that we just -- we have a company that has a lot of opportunities around the world. And I think we are pretty focused on those opportunities. You're always going to look at new things and changes in the situation, just as Jeff also said. But the main focus, and you take something like your last point on the Olympics, I used the one example on a television show, I just can't emphasize, even though the Olympics were really challenged and maybe weren't what we all had hoped for when we bought years ago with all the political activity around the world, the team, the storytelling, the heroes, athletes, this company can do things no other company can do to present that using new technologies. And I think that's what puts us in a very special place. Jeff?\nJeffrey Shell: Yes. Just adding more color to Peacock. So our 4 big programming areas, and we've said this before, are sports movies; leveraging the strength of our movie studio, which is really strong; linear programming, as Brian talked about, with the thing about PAM leveraging our linear programming on a nonlinear basis; and then originals. And so the first quarter was really the first time we employed some of those. So we had the Super Bowl and Olympics in the same week, as Brian mentioned at the top. And we also took advantage of that audience by putting a movie, Marry Me, on Valentine's Day, right in the middle of that. So we had 3 segments.  What was really encouraging about that is not only did we obviously add the subs we've talked about, the 4 million paid subs, but we -- 2 things. Number one, we didn't churn out of those subs. We maintained those subs as you saw in the quarter end numbers. And the second thing is we used all that audience to promote the first original that we really were high on, which was Bell Air, and we had our first real hit from an original perspective. So the last piece of our programming strategy, which we really haven't employed yet, is the next-day programming from NBC, not just NBC, by the way, but Bravo and our cable networks as well. That programming to your question is currently exists, but it's on Hulu as part of our Hulu deal. And as part of our termination at the end of last year, we're bringing all of that programming from Hulu back to Peacock starting in September. There's no impact on retrans because it's the same programming that's already out there. But instead of going to Hulu and seeing the voice the next day or Real Housewives the next day, now you'll be able to see it exclusively on Peacock starting in September, and we're pretty excited about it.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, John, and that will end our first quarter 2022 earnings call. I want to thank everyone for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. There will be a replay available of today's call starting at 12:00 p.m. Eastern.

So yes, our per caps are up. Yes, we cut costs in the business, which we've been pretty open about. But the main thing we did was continue to invest because we see -- we really are optimistic about that growth in that business going forward. Yes. Just adding more color to Peacock. So our 4 big programming areas, and we've said this before, are sports movies; leveraging the strength of our movie studio, which is really strong; linear programming, as Brian talked about, with the thing about PAM leveraging our linear programming on a nonlinear basis; and then originals. And so the first quarter was really the first time we employed some of those. So we had the Super Bowl and Olympics in the same week, as Brian mentioned at the top. And we also took advantage of that audience by putting a movie, Marry Me, on Valentine's Day, right in the middle of that. So we had 3 segments.  What was really encouraging about that is not only did we obviously add the subs we've talked about, the 4 million paid subs, but we -- 2 things. Number one, we didn't churn out of those subs. We maintained those subs as you saw in the quarter end numbers. And the second thing is we used all that audience to promote the first original that we really were high on, which was Bell Air, and we had our first real hit from an original perspective. So the last piece of our programming strategy, which we really haven't employed yet, is the next-day programming from NBC, not just NBC, by the way, but Bravo and our cable networks as well. That programming to your question is currently exists, but it's on Hulu as part of our Hulu deal. And as part of our termination at the end of last year, we're bringing all of that programming from Hulu back to Peacock starting in September. There's no impact on retrans because it's the same programming that's already out there. But instead of going to Hulu and seeing the voice the next day or Real Housewives the next day, now you'll be able to see it exclusively on Peacock starting in September, and we're pretty excited about it."

            "name": "David Watson",
            "content": "Just a quick comment on that. I think we are -- as Brian said, we're really excited about this partnership and being able to leverage a decade-plus of innovation around the tech platform. And we're already performing very well.  Just to put things in perspective, we do with -- you combine everything that we do with Sky across our entire portfolio, we do 5 billion streams a week of the streaming content. And voice remote commands, we do 40 million voice commands a day. So it's just we have a wonderful platform. Now we have a wonderful partner, as Brian said, being able to pull things off with. And now I think this scale matters. So excited about the future of that.  So to your question on competition and just a couple of things. We have been in a competitive environment, going up against a variety of different service providers for quite a while. We've seen it and anticipate this when they launch. You have good visibility towards new footprint and launches. So there's been multiple cycles that we have competed and gone everywhere from low-end pricing with DSL or DSL-like competitors to fiber launches in over 15 years now of fiber activity. So we think that the main thing that we're dealing with right now in this cycle, while there has definitely been an uptick in competitive activity with launches that have happened over throughout the last couple of years of new footprint, new launches between fiber and fixed wireless, the main thing in this case is our churn is at record lows. And it has been decreasing churn activity for over a long period of time, and it has continued. So this last quarter, it's record low quarter for any quarter.  So -- but having said that, we take it seriously, the competition. When you look at the amount of footprint that has continued over the last year-plus. And with fixed wireless and fiber, we have a real game plan that we've had and added to over time, where we segment the marketplace; we compete at a very granular basis where there's new launches and focus on leveraging every product that we have; and most certainly, we're playing offense with Mobile. So we have great broadband, and it kind of goes towards pricing that when we segment the marketplace, we have granular approaches towards competing and then being able to have multiple tiers of great broadband and really focus on the strength of our network that is ubiquitous.  We compete everywhere and have a multiple -- a variety of broadband packages, and we're not going to have trade-offs in the marketplace where it's a time-of-day trade-offs, geographic trade-offs and where they're at or not at or perhaps even peak-moment trade-offs. So we have a ubiquitous, consistent, great network that we'll go to market with that we have.  And so yes, there's been most certainly an uptick in competitive performance, and we see that. We've anticipated it. But the main issues we believe are the macro issues that or move activities down, that has continued. And we have seen actually, in our footprint, the move activity in March was actually less -- continued to be less move activity change of address in March than it was in February. So we think those are the macro issues are the primary things. And in this cycle, we're well positioned to compete, and we're going to compete aggressively. Let me start, Doug, on Mobile. So I start with -- it was a great quarter, it's had another record in terms of mobile lines. So we absolutely believe our strategy and focus on accelerating growth in wireless is indeed working. And so over the last couple of years, we have evolved our approach, including expanding the MVNO agreement, worked on that, and that's been, I think, a boost. And we're fully integrating Mobile and one of the most important things into everything we do at cable. We're leaning in our marketing. We're playing offense with Mobile in terms of how we talk about it, attracting new customers in consideration and with our customer base. So every single sales channel has been activated at this point.  So yes, this year, we're going to continue to make adjustments with Mobile. We're leveraging the -- still the new unlimited pricing. We have a great mix between that and by the gig. And we're converging broadband with Mobile. And when you take both, there's just more value for the customer. And we think that this converged packaging approach, really putting the emphasis in terms of service value, is the key.  We come in and out of offers, and there will be, in any given moment where the new product introduction, a offer, a promotional offer around gift cards and different things that we do on handsets. But the main point for us, and I think it's proven with our results having good success that this works, is not to put the emphasis necessarily on the handset. So leaning in, see it in the results, and we also do a nice job with Bring Your Own Device and just have launched small business and business services. So a lot of runway left, I think, in Mobile.  And in your point on the onload opportunity down the road, we already have a great network. And the great network, combined with the MVNO with Verizon, I think, is working. And for the majority of our footprint, this capital-light approach to wireless is the right approach. We continue to be opportunistic, though, and we're prepared. We're doing technical trials and leveraging our spectrum in the offload traffic in high-dense areas, where that makes financial sense. So we're running trials, optimizing the approach and turned up our first -- as Brian said, first 5G radios at the beginning of February, fully trials are underway. So we'll be ready when and if this makes sense. But we are in a good position, and we'll just be opportunistic as we look at that down the road. So like our position, like the runway, plenty of upside. Jeff? Yes. Craig, this is Dave. So yes, on the front end in terms of the real trending of household formations, the thing that we're looking at is literally the change of address data that we stay focused on. And that's what has continued to tick down and even went further down in our footprint in March. So -- and we think there's an impact of household formation as well. So it is a good point in terms of footprint. We're very focused on our opportunities. And I think we've been pretty consistent with one new component to it of the 3 main areas of opportunity.  One is just expanding footprint within our -- the traditional cable areas that we serve, and that's high amounts of residential, single-family MDUs and some commercial within our footprint. There's been some starts and some pauses within that in terms of new construction. But in general, we think over time, that works its way, will continue to pick back up.  And the second thing are proactive builds, we call hyper builds, which is mostly commercial, but will drag in some opportunities in terms of MDUs and some resi.  And the third one is rural edge-outs. And those are the things that we've been focused on. Now there are opportunities to really play offense. And with the -- there are great programs that are available, federal and state, the subsidies that are available. And we're actively evaluating various potential opportunities and submitted a lot of applications where we've determined that this is going to provide a reasonable and economical way for us to serve these new areas. And so it's early, way early on these things, but we're having success, and we're getting some wins on these programs.  So I think, yes, this is going to be a constant focus for us to look for opportunities. We want to be the trusted partner for communities, and I think it will be competitive. A lot of people will be looking for these subsidies. But we're going to edge-out our properties and look to build out. When you look at a number, we did last year in '21, approximately a little over 800,000 new passings that we built. I think a safe way to look at it is we're -- at a minimum, we're going to shoot for that again. And hopefully, we'll have upside on that."

            "name": "Brian Roberts",
            "content": "Thanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. 2022 is off to a great start. Each of our businesses posted healthy growth in adjusted EBITDA, contributing to a double-digit increase in adjusted EPS as well as significant free cash flow generation in the quarter. And we achieved all of this while continuing to invest in our businesses for the long term, while also increasing our return of capital to shareholders.  Our company has been at the forefront of innovation in connectivity and also in content. We have built a leading global technology platform, which today delivers 5 billion entertainment streams a week and 40 million voice commands a day across Comcast, Sky and our current syndication partners.  Yesterday's announcement highlights the value of what we've created. As you probably are aware, we formed a joint venture with Charter to offer our award-winning, voice-controlled streaming platform across the United States, starting with Flex and XClass TV, and to further develop this technology. Not only will we bring these products to millions of more customers, but we'll open the door to brand-new revenue opportunities. And when you combine Charter's footprint with our current syndication partners in both the U.S. and Canada, our retail distribution through Walmart and Sky, which essentially runs off the same technology, we now have a truly global platform.  This joint venture is a win-win. Consumers will get our proven world-class user and search experiences, simple content navigation and more choice in the streaming marketplace. App developers, retailers and hardware manufacturers will have access to 1 platform and 1 set of standards to quickly deploy their offerings across the U.S. And we'll be able to share in the investment and innovate alongside a partner we know well.  Comcast and Charter have a track record of coming together to bring new products and technologies to consumers. Most notably, our mobile operating partnership from 2018 enabled both companies to bring greater value and a better experience that people love. The result is a more competitive wireless marketplace, and the service that we provide has been rated #1 in customer satisfaction against all other mobile providers.  Peacock also benefits from this joint venture as it will be deeply integrated into the platform the way it is on X1 and Flex today, which will help expand Peacock's customer base more quickly and drive higher engagement resulting in greater monetization for NBCUniversal. And we are doing all of this in the context of the investments we have already made in our technology and within the guidelines we've provided on our last earnings call with respect to our plans for programming investment.  So let's come back to our achievements in the first quarter. Starting with broadband, we measured our success based on customer and financial metrics. And while we continue to compete aggressively in the current environment, we are striking what I believe to be the right balance between customer acquisition and long-term profitable growth. You can see with our first quarter results, where we added 194,000 customer relationships and 262,000 broadband subscribers, while on the financial side, Cable generated 5% revenue and 6.5% adjusted EBITDA growth, with 44% adjusted EBITDA margins.  Our distinct competitive advantage stems from our network, which has a level of flexibility that enables fast innovation and will be further enhanced through virtualization, an important stepping stone in our ultimate evolution to DOCSIS 4.0. Our path to ubiquitous, multi-gig, symmetrical speed is well underway. And in the next several years, when you collectively include Charter and Cox, the cable industry will be positioned to offer multi-gig, symmetrical speeds to over 100 million homes throughout the United States over essentially the same DOCSIS 4.0 infrastructure. None of our competitors can say the same thing.  For years, we focused on not only having a modern high-capacity network, but importantly, we've also focused on providing our customers with cutting-edge technology in their homes to ensure that they have the best experience, which is a combination of fast speeds, whole home coverage, cybersecurity and control, together with fantastic streaming capabilities.  During the quarter, we performed a number of successful tests on 10G equipment, and we launched our newest and most powerful xFi gateway, which increases bandwidth in the home by 3x and is the only modem that can support multi-gig symmetrical speeds to date.  We're also enhancing the value of Xfinity broadband by bundling with mobile, offering our customers the convenience of one relationship for all their connectivity at a tremendous value. This contributed to even further improvement in broadband retention and our best quarter ever for Xfinity Mobile in terms of line net additions.  We have a great wireless business, an MVNO partner in Verizon and have opportunities to further improve our economics at Xfinity Mobile longer term. For example, our testing of deploying spectrum to potentially offload wireless traffic is progressing nicely. During the quarter, we turned up our first 5G radios, and we'll be launching an employee field test in June. Stepping back, the underlying theme in all of this and the core of our strategy is that we put the customer first, which drives our strong financial results. The investments we have made and continue to make are expressly meant to enhance the experience of every person that is connected to our products and services. To that end, we just had the highest level of customer satisfaction we have ever seen for our first quarter. And we maintained our positive trend in reducing both agent handle interactions and truck rolls, which declined 19% and 17%, respectively.  So let's switch to NBC Universal. We had a lot of exciting things happened during the first quarter. For the first time in our history, we aired both the Super Bowl and the Olympics in the same week, affirming our expertise in production. During that period, I went to our facility in Stanford, Connecticut. I have to say, I was so impressed by the hard work and the entire team working 24/7 around the clock, working with Beijing, while being in Connecticut, providing a seamless broadcast for the Olympics. We sent some of our equipment to China when we thought our broadcast operations would be there. And on the fly, we had to figure out new ways to air this special event and not have a consumer know that was happening. Amazing how well the team managed the complexity, delivered an unbelievably high-quality product to hundreds of millions of viewers. And I think this will help innovate sports productions for years to come.  We learned a lot about streaming from the last Olympics. And so when it came to Beijing, we provided a much improved experience on Peacock, which shared every single event for the first time, driving significant engagement. Really was an exceptional quarter overall for Peacock, with other big sporting events and content launches, including the Super Bowl, the debut of Bel Air, our most successful original to date, and the day and date release of Marry Me. Importantly, retention on our service after airing all of this special content in such a concentrated period of time was well above our expectation. We added 4 million paid subscribers to end the first quarter with over 13 million paid subscribers and 28 million monthly active accounts in the U.S. And we've seen a 25% increase in hours of engagement year-over-year. Given the natural ebbs and flows of our content slate, we do not anticipate seeing this type of growth every quarter. We just expanded our total paid subscribers by over 40%. So we expect more modest subscriber gains until we get to the back half of this year.  Our fourth quarter should be fantastic for sporting events such as Sunday Night Football, Premier League and the World Cup; a pay one availability of top universal titles like Minions, Rise Crew and Jurassic World Dominion; original series such as Vampire Academy; and for the first time, starting this fall, Peacock will be the exclusive home of the next-day NBC broadcast. Our streaming strategy is differentiated, unique, because Peacock is a natural extension of our existing video businesses with 2 revenue streams and full integration across every aspect, whether it's programming, cross-promotion or advertising. Peacock builds audiences, extends our reach and creates new consumer experiences within our ecosystem, which should enable video to be a major long-term growth driver for NBCUniversal.  Finally, the business we haven't talked enough about is Theme Parks, where the recovery continues to be fantastic. I'm particularly excited about the new attractions that we opened during the pandemic, that many of our guests are now able to experience for the first time, like Super Nintendo World in Japan; the amazing VelociCoaster in Orlando; Pets in Hollywood; and of course, Universal Beijing. Our investments are significantly expanding the potential of our Theme Parks business, which will remain an important and exciting growth engine for years to come.  So Comcast is truly in a unique position of growing EBITDA, generating a robust level of free cash flow while making important organic investments in long-term growth initiatives and also increasing our return of capital to shareholders, which totaled $4.2 billion this quarter through a combination of $3 billion in buybacks and $1.2 billion in dividends, the largest return of capital for any quarter in our history.  So off to a great start in the first quarter, and I'd like to now hand it over to Mike. So let me start, and thanks, Ben. Look, I think that working with Charter, first of all, they bring terrific markets that we don't operate in. And so taking from the perspective of people who might want to take advantage of our platform that we will together have created, will create and roll out, whether that's a hardware company, a software company or some new creation, they're going to want national scale and frankly, an international platform. That's who the competitive set is, and being able to enable people's businesses to ride on those platforms and create value for our shareholders and Charter shareholders, I think, is the big picture. We've done this work with Charter before. When you go to your question about joint ventures versus doing it alone, obviously, there's pros and cons, but when another party brings something you don't have, that makes it a pro. We've done this successfully, maybe highlight the Mobile business that we both have now jumped started very successfully and was -- is one a real standout this quarter with our best net add quarter.  Business services. As we go upmarket to -- ultimately to the enterprise market and to large organizations, it was important that we find ways to have one-stop shopping for those companies. That's -- we've successfully done that with Charter and others.  Advertising, same thing with local JVs and national JVs to be able to deliver to advertisers. So we have a long history of successfully finding ways to be catalysts for growth.  And then finally, a point that's a little longer than 2 years, but one of the great things about our industry over the last several decades is how we keep reinventing the businesses we're in. And it's pretty important, I think, to continue to find new growth avenues. And so I look at our innovation that we've been doing at Comcast and now with Sky on a global basis to being able to continue to invest to have the reach and to have a continued hope for new revenue sources in the years ahead, these are the kind of steps you have to make now to make -- to see those dividends down the road. Dave? Let me -- and Mike said it perfectly. I think that 1 other point to filter here, thing is that we have consistently segmented the marketplace and that we have had great offers in multiple segments and low-income constrained segments. We've done it for a long period of time. So everything that Mike said, but we're comfortable in terms of working with customers always. We always do that. So if there's -- if we have roll-offs and things like that, we've been doing this for a long period of time.  So the only other thing in seasonality, I think there will be ongoing normalization around things like -- example is Florida. People will leave, what we're seeing just leaving a little bit early. And so that is going to happen over time, won't be a sudden onetime moment in seasonality, but it will just continue, we believe, to get back to some normal trending and student activity as well, so That's it. Mike, do you want to add? So the one thing I would just add, this is Brian, is something that I'm proud of that I think we -- if you look for one of our goals is to grow your businesses. Every one of our businesses just reported that, think about the future by investing. And so we're -- whether it's the JV or the broadband investments, the Peacock investments, things we're doing at Sky, buying back stock, increasing the dividend, we're doing all those things simultaneously. And I think that is something that differentiates us. Well, let me start, Jessica. Nice to hear your voice. I think we have a -- we've anticipated the changes in video pretty well. And on the one side, I think part of NBC's media results are that the decline is actually less because there are new ways for people to get video. And from the Cable side, we have our highest margins, our best quarter in EBITDA and revenues, and the companies continue to grow because we pivoted the strategy. So -- and our satisfaction scores are at all-time highs. So we're giving customers choices, and we found a way to get ourselves to a place of unique and in different, so that we're not trying to push something on to a customer that perhaps is a rock up a hill that we don't want to have to do. So that strategy has worked for us. So as I think forward, I think we believe aggregation is a real opportunity on to see customers who have now so many more choices. And there's -- they just want to get to the content they want really fast and in a seamless way and somebody who makes it work for them. And we're seeing viewing patterns change. And we were just talking before the call about one of our shows on NBC at Peacock, something about PAM. Not only that come out of the dateline franchise inside the NBC IP kind of redefined video, if you will, out of the News business and the Dateline franchise. The first airing, if you just went off a traditional television rating, you might have one conclusion. And as you've watched the show grow, now with on-demand, with Peacock and with NBC Dateline Special, and you put all that together, the show's really successful. So having a company that can do all those things across both on all of the platforms NBCUniversal has positioned us. So I think we now take that, those kind of examples and figure out how, in this new partnership with Charter and across the NBC portfolio, and we find a way to continue to innovate and be relevant to the next generation and existing generation of television viewers. So I'm -- and then you put in place what Sky is doing with Sky Glass, and you see how it can be integrated into without any box right into your television, and that's what XClass can be. So I don't know, I think it's a pretty exciting road map ahead, definitely some change, and that's what I think our company has been pretty good at navigating. Jeff? Thank you, John. No, I don't think there's any new things to report today. I think we're here to really focus on a great quarter and a great start to the year. Obviously, the strategy, I think Jeff said it well, that we employed and goes back a number of years that we just -- we have a company that has a lot of opportunities around the world. And I think we are pretty focused on those opportunities. You're always going to look at new things and changes in the situation, just as Jeff also said. But the main focus, and you take something like your last point on the Olympics, I used the one example on a television show, I just can't emphasize, even though the Olympics were really challenged and maybe weren't what we all had hoped for when we bought years ago with all the political activity around the world, the team, the storytelling, the heroes, athletes, this company can do things no other company can do to present that using new technologies. And I think that's what puts us in a very special place. Jeff?"

            "name": "Michael Cavanagh",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 4 with our first quarter consolidated 2022 financial results. Revenue increased 14% to $31 billion; adjusted EBITDA increased 9% to $9.2 billion; adjusted EPS increased 13% to $0.86 per share; and finally, we generated $4.8 billion of free cash flow.  Now let's turn to our business segment results, starting with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable revenue increased 4.7% to $16.5 billion, adjusted EBITDA increased 6.5% to $7.3 billion and net cash flow grew 8.3% to $5.6 billion. We grew customer relationships by 913,000 over the past 12 months with 194,000 net additions in the first quarter. Overall, customer growth was driven by broadband, where we added 1.1 million net new residential and business customers over the past 12 months and 262,000 in the first quarter. This quarter's results reflect continued low move-related activity compared to historical levels as well as an uptick in the level of competitive activity resulting in lower connect volumes. At the same time, we continue to experience very high levels of customer retention, with this quarter's results yielding the lowest churn rate for any quarter on record. In fact, we had fewer customers disconnect this quarter than the first quarter of 2019 despite a customer base that is almost 17% larger.  Throughout the pandemic, we have offered a variety of programs to help our customers stay connected. Some of our customers that participated received our services for free and therefore, were not included in our subscriber totals. At year-end, we ended these COVID-related programs, triggering a benefit in the first quarter. We estimate this change accounted for about 1/3 of our first quarter net additions with such benefit contained to the first quarter.  Moving to the financials. Cable's revenue growth of 4.7% was driven by broadband, business services, wireless and advertising revenue, partially offset by lower video and voice revenue. Broadband revenue increased 8%, driven by strong customer additions over the past 12 months and nearly 4% growth in average revenue per customer in the quarter.  Business Services revenue increased 10.6% or approximately 6%, excluding the acquisition of Masergy, which closed at the beginning of last year's fourth quarter. This healthy organic growth was driven by increases in both average rates per customer and in our customer base, which grew by 61,000 over the past 12 months with 9,000 additions in the first quarter.  Moving to wireless. Revenue increased 32%, mainly driven by service revenue, which was fueled by growth in customer lines. Overall, we added 1.2 million lines over the past 12 months, including 318,000 lines in the quarter, which, for the fifth consecutive quarter, was our best result since launching this business in 2017.  Advertising revenue increased 8.6%, reflecting higher political and double-digit growth in Zumo and advanced advertising. For video, revenue declined 1.5%, driven by customer net losses totaling $1.7 million over the past 12 months, including $512,000 in the quarter, partially offset by higher average revenue per customer due to a residential rate increase at the beginning of this year.  Last, voice revenue declined 9.8%, primarily reflecting customer losses totaling 725,000 over the past 12 months, including 282,000 net losses in the quarter and reflects our shift to more converged broadband mobile offers.  Turning to expenses. Cable Communications' first quarter expenses increased 3.3%. Programming expenses decreased 1.1%, reflecting a decline in video customers, partially offset by higher rates. Nonprogramming expenses increased 6.3%, reflecting investments in our growth businesses, including broadband, wireless and business services; expenses related to our recent acquisition of Masergy; as well as an increase in other expenses, primarily due to bad debt returning to more normalized levels. These higher costs were partially offset by a decline in customer service expenses, reflecting lower activity levels in the business as well as improvement in customer experience initiatives.  Cable Communications' EBITDA increased 6.5% to $7.3 billion for the quarter and Cable EBITDA margin reached 44%, reflecting 80 basis points of year-over-year improvement. We believe we are striking the right balance by continuing to invest in our growth businesses, which are driving the top line and proving to be a great return for us, while at the same time, continuing to increase our operating efficiency and remove unnecessary costs.  Now let's turn to Slide 6 for NBCUniversal. Starting with total NBCUniversal results, revenue increased 47% to $10.3 billion and EBITDA increased 7.4% to $1.6 billion. Media revenue increased 36% to $6.9 billion, including Peacock revenue, which grew more than 5x year-over-year to $472 million in the quarter. As Brian noted earlier, we aired both the Olympics and Super Bowl, which together contributed an incremental $1.5 billion to Media revenue. Excluding these events, Media revenue increased 6.9% driven by both higher distribution and advertising revenue. Distribution revenue, excluding the contribution from the Olympics, increased 8.5%, reflecting growth at Peacock driven by increases in paid subscribers as well as our networks, reflecting higher contractual rates, partially offset by linear subscriber declines.  Advertising revenue, excluding contributions from the Olympics and Super Bowl, increased 4%, reflecting higher pricing and a growing contribution from Peacock, which was partially offset by linear ratings declines.  Media EBITDA decreased 21% to $1.2 billion in the first quarter, including a $456 million EBITDA loss at Peacock. Excluding Peacock, Media EBITDA decreased 7.7%, reflecting higher programming and production costs associated with our broadcast of the Beijing Olympics and Super Bowl as well as higher costs driven by the return of our full primetime schedule compared to last year when our schedule was impacted by COVID-19. We continue to expect Peacock's EBITDA loss will be roughly $2.5 billion for the year. However, taking into consideration the timing of content launches, consistent with what Brian mentioned, we would expect losses to be higher in the second half of the year.  Moving next to Studios. Revenues increased 15% to $2.8 billion, driven by higher content licensing and theatrical revenue, but EBITDA declined 51% to $245 million. The decline in EBITDA primarily reflects a difficult comparison to last year's first quarter, which benefited from a licensing deal with Peacock, including exclusive streaming rights for The Office with an offsetting adjustment reflected in NBCUniversal's eliminations. The remainder of the EBITDA decline reflects higher marketing costs ahead of numerous film releases planned for the second quarter, including Jurassic World Dominion, Ambulance and Bad Guys.  Last, at Theme Parks, revenue increased by $941 million to $1.6 billion, and we generated EBITDA of $451 million, reflecting improved results at each of our parks compared to last year when Orlando and Japan were operating at limited capacity and Hollywood was closed due to COVID-19. We continue to see exceptional demand at our domestic parks, attendance was back to prepandemic levels, and we had strong growth in per caps with Orlando generating its highest EBITDA on record for a first quarter.  COVID impacts in the quarter were more pronounced internationally. Universal Studios Japan's results were impacted by capacity restrictions, which were in place for most of the first quarter. These restrictions were lifted at the end of March. And over the last month, we have seen a very strong rebound with attendance currently above pre-pandemic levels.  At Universal Beijing, which opened in September of last year, demand from our guests was high, but overall attendance was impacted by COVID and related travel restrictions. Despite that, Beijing only contributed a slight EBITDA loss in the quarter.  Now let's turn to Slide 7 for Sky, which I will speak to on a constant currency basis. For the first quarter, Sky revenue of $4.8 billion was consistent with the same period last year as solid growth in the U.K. was offset by our results in Italy, where we continue to transition through the reset in our Syria broadcast rights, which we won't begin to lap until the back half of this year. Direct-to-consumer revenue was also consistent year-over-year, reflecting growth in the U.K., where we continue to have healthy customer additions and grew direct-to-consumer revenue by mid-single digits driven by an increase in video revenue, including higher revenue from pubs and clubs, streaming and premium TV as well as healthy increases in broadband and wireless revenue. This growth in the U.K. was mainly offset by lower revenue in Italy, where we continue to experience both customer losses and lower direct-to-consumer revenue, primarily due to the reset in our Syria broadcast rights.  Rounding out the rest of revenue at Sky, content revenue declined 14%, driven by the reset and sports licensing agreements in Italy and Germany. And advertising revenue increased 7.9% and with healthy growth in the U.K., partially offset by a decline in Italy.  Turning to EBITDA. Sky's EBITDA increased 71% to $622 million driven by our strong performance in the U.K. and improved results in Italy and Germany, where we benefited from lower sports programming costs due to resets in our sports rights.  Next, I'll discuss free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 8. As I mentioned earlier, we generated $4.8 billion in free cash flow this quarter. Consolidated total capital increased 1.1%, reflecting increases at NBCU due to ramping construction at Epic Universe, a decrease at Sky and a relatively flat capital spending at Cable due to timing. For the year, we continue to expect Cable CapEx intensity to stay around 11% as we increase investment in our broadband network, and NBCUniversal CapEx related to the construction of EPIC universe to be up around $1 billion year-over-year.  Turning to capital allocation. As of today, we have repurchased $4 billion worth of our shares year-to-date, including $3 billion in the first quarter. In addition, dividend payments totaled $1.2 billion for a total return of capital in the first quarter of $4.2 billion.  And before I wrap up, I also want to spend a minute on the macro environment since inflation and interest rates are topical right now. There are certain areas of expense across each of our businesses that are impacted by inflation. Like other companies in our space, we're not entirely insulated from that. However, the overall impact to our financials has been limited. Overall energy costs make up about 1% of our total company's operating expenses. Also, we are more than offsetting any pressure on wages and other areas of expense through the continuing efforts to implement operational efficiencies, helping us protect the healthy margins across our businesses.  Lastly, our balance sheet is very well positioned with about 95% of our debt based on fixed rates, a debt portfolio with a weighted average time to maturity of approximately 18 years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.47%. We ended the quarter with net leverage at 2.3x and still expect to remain around 2.4x leverage going forward.  So with that, thanks for joining us on the call this morning. I'll turn it back to Marci, who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call. Maybe I'll jump in and just Dave just commented on competition and our approach in the market. In terms of the backward-looking stuff, I think we called out that the -- you should think about the normalized level of net adds in the first quarter at about a healthy 180,000. We had a transition impact in the net subs added in the first quarter just as we ended the COVID programs where people would come on, in some cases, free. But you recall what we did during COVID, we wanted to be conservative but appropriate in how we counted subs. So wherever we brought in a sub under some form of COVID relief program with the goal of keeping the population connected, to the extent it was free, we were clear we were not going to count them until they ended being on a free program and then started paying. So consistently throughout COVID, that's the way we did it, and that's the way we ended it. So as the quarter last year ended, we put a stop to those programs. So the only -- the third that came in, in this quarter of folks that were free in the last quarter came on as free but began paying us. So I don't think we have any negative impact going forward. It's simply that there won't be any ongoing roll forward into the second quarter. It's all kind of cleans itself out in this first quarter.  And the point I'd like to make just on the quality of the approach that we took is that you can sort of see that in the conservative way we counted subs throughout allow -- the evidence of that quality is both the record low churn that we've demonstrated that Dave already commented on, together with the growth in ARPU throughout the period pre-, during and post-COVID. So I think really the point was just to make it clear that the COVID promotions came to end, and it just had a positive onetime impact in this quarter as you transition back to recover normal ways of counting subs. And then back on buybacks. So I think we're pleased, as we said as we -- almost a year ago now are coming up on a year ago this quarter, when we got our leverage back where we wanted to the commitments to the rating we like and strength of the balance sheet that we're glad to be back. And so this quarter, between buybacks of $3 billion and dividends of $1.2 billion, we were -- had a record quarter in the company's history in terms of dollars of capital return. So I think we're certainly informed as we go forward by where leverage is. And the fact that we ticked down a touch, I wouldn't put anything into that. It's a big -- there's a lot of moving parts as we forecast. And so we're going to stay around 2.4, but around 2.4, it could be 2.3, it could be 2.5, I would say we're sticking with -- we like leverage around that 2.4x level. And obviously, we're partially informed as well by where the stock is. And so that gives us capacity. We stepped it up a little bit in the tail end of the last quarter. And as I said on the remarks, we continued at that pace doing another $1 billion so far in the second quarter."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Executive Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thank you Operator, and welcome everyone. Joining us on today\u2019s call are Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh, Jason Armstrong, and Dave Watson. I will now refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation accompanying this call, which can also be found on our Investor Relations website and which contains our Safe Harbor disclaimer.

Please see our 8-K and trending schedule issued earlier this morning for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Cavanagh: Thanks Marci, and good morning everyone. We\u2019re less than a month into the new year and 2024 is already off to a great start. Two weeks ago, our entire company came together to make history, shattering records with the first exclusively streamed NFL Wildcard Game on Peacock. Nearly 23 million viewers watched the Kansas City Chiefs take on the Miami Dolphins, consuming 30% of all internet traffic in the U.S. and setting a new record in total U.S. internet traffic for any night. Our investment in the network and our technology platforms built over decades enabled us to shine, delivering a seamless experience on the internet and Peacock, demonstrating that our company is in an excellent position to win in this era of high bandwidth consumption. Also, Universal Pictures\u2019 Oppenheimer picked up five Golden Globe awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Original Score.  With 2024 off to a terrific start, let\u2019s look back at 2023, where we produced consistently strong financial results and continued to execute against our long term strategy. We\u2019ve positioned our company to benefit from a significant number of scaled and diversified growth opportunities that are margin accretive, namely residential broadband, mobile, business services, theme parks, studios, and Peacock. In aggregate, our revenue in these businesses grew 8% in 2023 and comprised 55% of our total revenue for the year. Our healthy cash flow generation and strong balance sheet have enabled the organic investment that fuels these businesses and at the same time fund substantial capital return, including significant share repurchases. All of this has translated into excellent financial performance. For the third consecutive year, we generated the highest revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS in our company\u2019s history.  Now let\u2019s go deeper on some of the important achievements during the year. I\u2019m really proud of the progress we\u2019ve made in our connectivity businesses. We maintained a strong trajectory in Xfinity Mobile, increasing our subscriber lines by 24% and total domestic wireless revenue by nearly 20%. We also performed well in our business services segment, which grew full year revenue and EBITDA by nearly 5% with margins approaching 60%, and we exceeded our goal of adding over 1 million new homes and businesses passed and expect to do at or above this level in 2024. Our domestic broadband business remains strong. We kept our very large and healthy base of subscribers flat while growing residential ARPU 3.9%, the high end of our historical range, driving solid EBITDA growth in connectivity and platforms and expanding margins to around 40% on an underlying basis. We achieved all of this despite an intensely competitive environment, and as I look back on 2023, I am confident that our strategy combined with excellent execution sets us up extremely well to navigate the road ahead. While the competitive environment is likely to remain at these levels for a period of time, broadband is still a very large, healthy and profitable market, and the consumption trends that we\u2019re seeing are encouraging for the future. Customers are connecting more devices in their homes and are using them for applications that require more capacity, faster speeds and lower latency. Our fiber-deep and capital efficient network is more than ready to meet this demand with 100,000 miles of fiber and a clear path to offering multi-gigabit symmetrical speeds ubiquitously across our entire footprint with DOCSIS 4.0.  I\u2019d like to spend a minute briefly addressing the government\u2019s affordable connectivity program. First, it\u2019s important to note that we\u2019ve built on our decade-long history in digital equity to effectively participate in ACP and have successfully leveraged the national verifier program in the process. While we hope that the White House and Congress renew this funding and keep these important resources available to the many people and households who have relied upon this program to stay digitally connected, we have already begun to communicate with ACP participants and will provide a range of options, including our highly successful internet essentials program, in the event that funding is discontinued. Shifting to content and experiences, we have positioned ourselves to drive long term profitable growth. Over the span of decades, we\u2019ve built a remarkable portfolio of iconic content and strong franchises in both film and television, including live sports, news and entertainment. Our market-leading businesses have tremendous reach and continue to perform and execute collaboratively, playing to our strengths by leveraging our IP and our incredible partners. Let\u2019s start with our studio group, where we hit a major milestone ranking as the number one studio in film by worldwide box office with hits such as Super Mario Bros., Oppenheimer, Fast 10, and Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s. We are proud to work alongside our creative partners like Christopher Nolan, Chris Meledandri, and Jason Blum, who are innovative industry leaders to develop content that continues to delight audiences. And I\u2019m really excited about another fantastic film slate in 2024 with the latest installment of Kung Fu Panda in March, along with Despicable Me and Twisters in July, and Wicked slated for November, which will also benefit Peacock as these films and many others enter the Pay-1 window.  At the same time, our media segment continues to deliver, reaching over 100 million households every quarter with leading sports, news and entertainment. We have the number one most watched news organization in the U.S. and Sunday Night Football is pacing to be the most watched prime time show for an unprecedented 13th consecutive year. Peacock continued to be the fastest growing streamer in the U.S., a result of our holistic business model which leverages all of our brands to serve a broad range of viewers by providing them with options to match their evolving habits. In the short period of time since we launched in 2020, we\u2019ve seen strong momentum, ending the year at 31 million paid subscribers at a $10 ARPU, supported by healthy trends in both engagement and churn, and I\u2019m excited for 2024. We started with the successful Wild Card Game, which will soon be followed by Oppenheimer coming exclusively to Peacock and a full slate of both new and returning originals such as Ted, Peacock\u2019s most watched original title, additional Pay-1 movies, and the Summer Olympics later this year. These next Olympic Games promise to be nothing short of spectacular with the return of fans, this time to Paris, one of the most beautiful cities in the world. With the NBC Broadcast Network airing more content than ever before and Peacock as the streaming home for all games, NBC Universal will be the most comprehensive Olympic destination in U.S. media history with Xfinity once again playing a huge role in delivering each game on our entertainment OS platform, which is now also available to charter customers through Xumo.  At parks, we achieved record-high revenue and EBITDA in 2023 and have exciting new attractions and experiences in the years ahead. We\u2019ll open Donkey Kong, another Nintendo-themed land next year in Osaka, which will expand Super Nintendo World by another 70%. We expect continuation of the strong trends in Hollywood also driven by Super Nintendo World, and we\u2019ll see the completion of Epic Universe, our fourth gate in Orlando, prior to its grand opening in 2025. In summary, we are very pleased with all that we have achieved in 2023. We have incredible teams in each of our businesses and have executed against our plan exceptionally well, delivering very strong EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow. Going forward, our highest priority is to continue our strong operational performance enabled by the investments we are making in our six key growth areas, fueling their growth and further improving the profile of our business mix. The strength and stability of our company, including our balance sheet, enables us to make these investments while also providing our shareholders with substantial capital returns. Since we started buying back stock in late May of 2021, we have repurchased approximately 15% of our total shares outstanding, and with today\u2019s announcement we have now increased our annualized dividend by 150% since I joined the company in 2015. Putting it all together, our strategy is working and we see many years ahead that this formula will continue to deliver for our company and shareholders.  Jason, over to you.\nJason Armstrong: Thanks Mike, and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll begin on Slides 4 and 5 with our consolidated results. Total revenue increased 2% to $31.3 billion for the fourth quarter and was consistent at $121.6 billion for the full year. On a reported basis, EBITDA was consistent at $8 billion for the fourth quarter and up 3% to $37.6 billion for the full year. Our EBITDA results include severance and other in this quarter, as well as in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Excluding these items totaling $527 million this quarter and $638 million in last year\u2019s quarter, adjusted EBITDA decreased 1% in the fourth quarter and remained at 3% growth for the full year. Adjusted EPS was up 2% to $0.84 a share for the fourth quarter and increased 9% to $3.98 for the full year.  We generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow for the quarter and $13 billion for the full year, which translates into $3.13 in free cash flow per share, which was up 10% year-over-year, and we returned over 100% of this to shareholders, with $4.7 billion of capital returned to shareholders in the quarter and $15.8 billion for the full year. Our strong level of free cash flow includes the significant investments we\u2019re making to support and grow our business in six broad and diversified growth categories, including residential broadband, wireless, and business services connectivity, along with theme parks, streaming and premium content at our studios. Taken together, these growth areas generated more than half of our total company revenue and grew at a high single digit rate during the quarter and for the full year. Now let\u2019s turn to our business results, starting on Slide 6 with connectivity and platforms. As a reminder, our largest foreign exchange exposure is to the British pound, which was up nearly 6% year-over-year. As usual, in order to highlight the underlying performance of the connectivity and platforms business, I will refer to year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis. Revenue for total connectivity and platforms was flat at $20.4 billion. Unpacking that, revenue in our core connectivity business - domestic broadband, domestic wireless, international connectivity, and business services connectivity, increased 7% to $11 billion, while video, advertising and other revenue declined 8% to $9 billion. Our strategy is to invest to drive growth in our core connectivity businesses while at the same time carefully managing businesses that are important, but face secular headwinds. On balance, this is a favorable mix shift for the profitability of our overall connectivity and platform segment, as reflected in our results. EBITDA for total connectivity and platforms increased 3% with EBITDA margins improving 130 basis points year-over-year. This includes severance and other of $422 million in the quarter and $456 million of charges in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Excluding these items in both periods, EBITDA increased 2% to $8 billion and EBITDA margins improved by 110 basis points.  Margins for our domestic legacy cable business improved 70 basis points to 46.2%. In terms of how our underlying performance in connectivity and platforms breaks out between residential and business, on the same basis excluding severance and other from both periods, residential EBITDA grew 2% with margins improving 120 basis points, and business services EBITDA increased 5% with margins nearly unchanged at an impressive 57%.  Now let\u2019s get further into the details, starting with our connectivity growth drivers. Residential connectivity revenue grew 7% driven by 4% growth in domestic broadband, 15% growth in domestic wireless and 19% growth in international connectivity, while business services connectivity revenue grew 6%. Domestic broadband was once again driven by very strong ARPU growth of 3.9% for the quarter and for the year, landing at the high end of our historical 3% to 4% range while our base of 32 million broadband subscribers remained stable over the past year, including the 34,000 subscriber loss this quarter. We remain focused on competing aggressively but in a financially balanced way, as evidenced by this quarter and past years\u2019 results. With the broadband marketplace remaining extremely competitive, we will continue to manage this balance and expect ARPU growth will remain strong within our historical range and continue to be the driver of our residential broadband revenue growth in 2024. While we do not expect subscriber trends to improve in the coming quarters, we do expect them to improve over time. At the macro level, customers are consuming more, connecting more devices in their homes, and are using them for applications that collectively require either faster speeds, lower latency, and higher reliability over time. These secular trends are all moving in our favor, and we believe our marginal cost to add capacity to our network is unrivalled. This is why we are investing in our fiber-fed network to further increase capacity and offer multi-gig symmetrical speeds ubiquitously across our footprint and ensure that we stay way ahead of consumer demand with the best broadband offering and experience. We have deployed mid-splits to about 35% of our footprint and expect that to reach around 50% by the end of 2024. On the back of this, we launched our first DOCSIS 4.0 market during the fourth quarter and will continue to launch additional markets this year. We are focused on what we can control - that means segmenting our customer base by offering our customers the right price, including value options at different speed tiers and driving ARPU ahead in an environment where broadband subscriber growth remains challenged, and we\u2019re doing this in the context of aggressive network upgrades and expansion, putting us in a great position to eventually return to subscriber growth. Speaking of network expansion, we exceeded our goal of passing 1 million new homes and businesses in 2023, landing at nearly 1.1 million, and we plan to replicate this in 2024 with this level, or potentially even greater footprint expansion.  Switching to wireless, we hit a great milestone, eclipsing $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time this quarter. With the year-over-year increase due to higher service revenue driven by continued strong momentum in customer lines, which were up 1.3 million or 24% year-over-year to 6.5 million in total. This includes 310,000 lines we just added in the quarter. We\u2019ve had a healthy run rate generating around 300,000 net additional lines per quarter for the last two years, and we\u2019re consistently in the market testing new offers and will continue to do that throughout the coming year, with the goal that some of these offers will translate into accelerated line additions as the year progresses. With only 11% penetration of our domestic residential broadband customer accounts, we still have a big opportunity and a long runway ahead for growth in wireless.  International connectivity revenue increased 19% driven by steady mid-teens growth in broadband along with strong growth in wireless, which had healthy growth in both device sales and service revenue. Finally, business services connectivity revenue increased 6% driven by consistent growth in our small business category as we grew ARPU through rate and higher penetration of additional products like Security Edge, and from strong growth in midmarket and enterprise. The revenue growth in our connectivity businesses was offset by declines in video, advertising, and other revenue. The video revenue decline was driven by continued customer losses. The lower other revenue reflects similar dynamics in wire line voice, and advertising was impacted by a tough comparison to last year, which benefited from higher political revenue in our domestic markets.  As I mentioned earlier, excluding severance and other, connectivity and platforms\u2019 total EBITDA increased 2% with adjusted margin of 110 basis points. To unpack this improvement, the main driver is the mix shift to our high margin connectivity businesses, a transition you\u2019ve seen for the last few years and that we expect to continue. In addition to the mix shift, we are benefiting from ongoing cost discipline. For every quarter this year, including the fourth quarter, five out of six categories of expenses we report have decreased. The only category that grew is direct product costs, which are success-based and directly associated with the significant growth in our connectivity businesses.  In addition, we continue to get more efficient with better tools and technology. Compared to 2017, we reduced our domestic truck rolls by nearly 50% and customer interactions are down nearly 40%, even while we increased our domestic relationships by nearly 5 million over this same time period. The investment we are making in our network, including virtualization and using technology to enhance the customer experience, not only makes us more competitive, it makes us more cost efficient. Together, the mix shift, the cost discipline and the technology advances we\u2019ve made in customer service are all structural, and we expect them to continue, positioning us to drive higher profitability and further margin expansion in 2024 and for the foreseeable future. Now let\u2019s turn to content and experiences on Slide 7. Revenue increased 6% to $11.5 billion and EBITDA increased 2% to $923 million. Excluding severance at $101 million this quarter and $186 million in last year\u2019s fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA decreased 6%, reflecting a decrease in media partially offset by strong growth at studios and record results at parks. Now let\u2019s take a closer look at content and experiences, starting with media. Media revenue increased 3% driven by strong growth at Peacock, which was up 57% and, similar to wireless, crossed the $1 billion in quarterly revenue mark for the first time. Domestic distribution increased 9% driven by Peacock subscription revenue growth of 88% fueled by the continuation of solid growth in our paid subscriber base. We ended the quarter with 31 million Peacock paid subscribers, up 10 million over the past year, including 3 million net additions in the quarter driven by sports, including the NFL and the Big 10, and movies, notably the day and date movie, Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s, and a variety of originals and other entertainment programming.  International networks revenue, which is mainly distribution revenue for Sky Sports, increased 17% primarily due to the increase in sports content this year as well as the positive impact of foreign currency translation. Finally, domestic advertising declined 7% due to a tough comparison to last year, which included a significant incremental contribution in advertising from Telemundo\u2019s broadcast of the FIFA World Cup. Excluding the World Cup, advertising increased nearly 3% driven by strong Peacock advertising and from our strong sports line-up. Peacock advertising increased 50%, again excluding the World Cup, and hit an all-time high.  Media EBITDA decreased 50% mainly due to higher sports costs, reflecting a full quarter of a contractual rate increase in our NFL programming, the addition of Big 10 to our sports programming line-up this year, and higher Premier League costs compared to last year when games were paused for four weeks to accommodate the timing of the World Cup. At Peacock, EBITDA losses continued to moderate in the fourth quarter with nice year-over-year improvement resulting in full year losses for Peacock of $2.7 billion, which was slightly better than the expectation we had previously communicated. 2023 marked the peak in annual losses at Peacock, and for 2024 we expect to show meaningful improvement in losses versus 2023. Turning to studios, revenue increased 4% driven by theatrical revenue growth of 59% due to our performance at the box office this quarter with Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s, Trolls Band Together, The Exorcist, and Migration. In fact, Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s was the highest grossing horror film of 2023 and also set a record on Peacock as the most watched title of all time in the first five days of its release. In addition to the films this quarter, we benefited from prior period titles moving through profitable licensing windows, driving EBITDA growth of 83% to $308 million. At theme parks, revenue increased 12% and EBITDA also increased 12% to $872 million for the quarter. These strong results were again driven by growth at our international parks, especially as Osaka continues to benefit from strong demand from Super Nintendo World driving higher attendance and per-cap spending relative to both last year and pre-pandemic levels. In Hollywood, we also continued to benefit from the positive consumer reaction to Super Nintendo World, which opened earlier in 2023, driving strong attendance and growth in per-caps and resulting in Hollywood\u2019s best fourth quarter EBITDA in its history. In Orlando, our results were also strong with attendance in line with 2019 pre-pandemic levels and revenue substantially ahead. Now I\u2019ll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 8. As I mentioned previously, we generated $1.7 billion in free cash flow this quarter and $13 billion for the year, and we achieved this while absorbing meaningful capital investments to expand our footprint and further strengthen our domestic broadband network, scale our streaming business, and support the continued build of our Epic Universe park ahead of its 2025 opening. As a result, total capital spending increased 13% for the year driven by higher capex. At connectivity and platforms, capex increased 1.5% for the full year, with capex intensity coming in at 10.1% primarily driven by investments to further strengthen and extend our network. In 2024, we expect capex intensity to be in the same range as we continue to transition our U.S. network to DOCSIS 4.0 and accelerate our growth in homes passed.  I\u2019ll just note that while our capex intensity at connectivity and platforms has been around 10% for the past few years, this is not a specific internal target for us, rather it\u2019s an output. Our teams are going as fast as possible; however, if for example we have an opportunity to accelerate further our growth in homes passed at accretive economics, then we\u2019d welcome that opportunity. But right now, the envelope has been right around 10% and we\u2019re very happy with the pace that we are on and the progress we\u2019re making. Content and experiences capex increased by $1.2 billion for the full year, driven by parks with Epic accounting for the majority of the increase in spend. In 2024, we expect parks capex to remain elevated and then decrease in 2025 when we open Epic. Working capital was $2 billion for the year, which was better than we expected, improving a billion over last year\u2019s level. Our 2023 results included benefits from the pause in production during the work stoppages associated with the writers and actors strikes during the year.  Turning to return of capital on our balance sheet, for the full year we returned a total of $15.8 billion to shareholders - this includes share repurchases of $11 billion, including $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter. In addition, dividend payments totaled $4.8 billion. As we announced this morning, we are raising our dividend by $0.08 a share to $1.24 per share - that\u2019s our 16th consecutive annual increase. We ended the year with net leverage of 2.3 times, in line with our target leverage of around 2.4 times, and we expect to remain at this target level in 2024.  Wrapping up, we had a very solid quarter and a great year, and we\u2019re focused on continuing to execute our long term growth strategy supported by our balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation. I\u2019m proud of the steady and consistent framework which guides our decision-making. We\u2019re going to invest aggressively for organic growth across our six key areas. We\u2019ll protect our balance sheet and cash flow position and return capital to shareholders. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian for a few remarks before we turn to Q&A.\nBrian Roberts: Thanks Jason, and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to just emphasize a couple of points. As I think about the year, it\u2019s hard not to be really proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished. 2023 was the best financial year in our 60-year history, and we already have nice momentum in 2024. As Mike and Jason just outlined, we have a unique company that is incredibly well positioned. We always try to think about and invest for the long term, particularly across the six key growth drivers.  What\u2019s also important is that in 2023 alone, we returned $16 billion in capital to our shareholders. As you just heard, it\u2019s the 16th straight year that we just raised our dividend - that\u2019s consistency. When you put this all together, we have a great team - that\u2019s always most important to me, and we\u2019re making the right adjustments to our businesses to position us to win, grow, and continue to return capital to shareholders. While there may be speculation on what we could do next, I\u2019d like you to hear it directly from me: I love the company we have, so the bar continues to be even higher for us to do anything other than the plan you heard today.  I want to thank all our employees for a great 2023 as they continue to execute at the highest level. With that, let me hand it over to Marci to take all your questions.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks Brian. Operator, let\u2019s open the call for Q&A please.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question is coming from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks, good morning. Brian, thanks for those clear comments. I wanted to ask you guys about broadband and separately about Peacock. I guess Jason, you talked about and Mike talked about sort of the consumer trends that you think play to your strengths, but you guys are doing a lot at the network level, including in \u201924 you talked about your converged offers that you\u2019re testing maybe getting more aggressive. I know you\u2019re not going to put a timeline on it, but can you talk a little bit about the opportunity to re-accelerate broadband customer trends, because the product you are bringing to the marketplace is seemingly getting better even this year, and I realize you\u2019re talking long term, but I just wanted to hear more from you on the things you\u2019re doing and the business and product today, and how that may or may not translate into better trends on the customer front over the course of the next 12 to 24 months.  Then on Peacock, I guess maybe for Mike, how much more investment does this business need? I think you guys had talked a while ago about getting to $5 billion of programming investment. If you look at the fourth quarter anyway, you\u2019re basically there now, you\u2019ve got good revenue momentum. I\u2019m trying to think about the path to getting this business to breakeven, so I\u2019d love to hear what you think the business needs in terms of incremental investment from here. Thanks a lot.\nDave Watson: Hey Ben, this is Dave. Let me start with broadband and then hand it over to Mike and Jason. On broadband, as Mike and Jason said, the environment pretty much remains the same - you know, there is still the macro activity, moves are down, but to your point, it is intensely competitive, especially the difference that has been there in this particular competitive cycle, it\u2019s especially in the lower income segment, so the result of it is the main driver, customer activity, continues to be lower connects as churn remains near record lows, and despite this, we\u2019re striking, I think, the right balance between customer growth and ARPU. We kept our sub base relatively flat, grew ARPU 3.9% for the quarter and the year, and so we\u2019re also growing C&P but expanding margins. Competitive cycles like this one, we\u2019ve been through many, and what makes--you know, what happens during some of these cycles, there is new footprint, the competitive footprint, some unique discounting occurs. I think fiber is a pretty good example of one that we went through years ago and continue to have. There is pressure on net adds as you go through the initial phase of the cycle, but we evolved our approach and we have and continue to compete very well against fiber. I think this cycle is headlined by fixed wireless and really the emphasis on more of the lower income segment. They added new footprint, there\u2019s some ARPU pressure, but we have and continue to adapt. The key for us through this cycle is continue to build better products, from the network to the Wi-Fi experience, and the network investments that we\u2019re making are very consistent and we\u2019ve laid it out - mid-splits, we\u2019re pleased with our progress, we\u2019re finishing \u201923 33% upgraded, we\u2019ll be around 50% by year-end \u201924, and we\u2019ve started to deploy 4.0 and our path towards symmetrical service offerings, so this is all due to where we believe strongly the market is going.  The market is going to have more devices that will be used and be hung on the network, and there will be more usage and engagement, so for the long run, we want to be in position to compete as things shift. We\u2019re going to compete in a segmented way for every segment, and we\u2019ll be aggressive in each one; but we don\u2019t expect subscriber trends to improve over the coming quarters but we do expect to grow over time. We will compete aggressively and be in position when the macro environment shifts, and as we see with fixed wireless, there\u2019s an opportunity and will be an opportunity to get more win backs. We want to be in position for that as well. Throughout it all, we\u2019re going to protect the healthy base of 32 million broadband customers, managing rate and volume throughout.\nMike Cavanagh: Hey, it\u2019s Mike, Ben. Thanks for the question on Peacock. I\u2019ll expand a little bit on the question but get to it in terms of where we see programming going in the end. I\u2019ve got to say, we couldn\u2019t be prouder of what we accomplished with Peacock in 2023. To end the year with paying subs at 31 million, up 50% year-over-year, and that\u2019s only three years in, we\u2019re achieving a level of scale with paying subs that\u2019s about 60% of the level of the streamers that have been out there for many years domestically, ex-Netflix. We\u2019re holding a very strong ARPU at $10 per sub, so while it\u2019s not the scale we ultimately plan to get to, I\u2019ve got to say the team has done a fantastic job when lots questioned, could we even get this far. From here, it\u2019s really a matter of continuing to execute against the strategy that\u2019s gotten us here, and that is expected, as we said earlier, to drive improvement in Peacock\u2019s bottom line from the peak losses that we saw in 2023. When you really think about what that strategy is, it\u2019s to manage Peacock and our linear TV businesses as one. The strategy really is to leverage the great relevant content properties we have, both at NBC which is news and sports and entertainment, obviously Bravo and some of the other assets we have in the cable business, and Universal with the Pay-1 window, so when you put it all together, continuing to execute against that. We\u2019re going to look to get more scale, and the things we\u2019re doing are both to drive more scale, more subs, but also get more engagement with the subs we have and drive improvements in churn, which we\u2019ve been pretty pleased with.  To ultimately your question, where are we relative to--you know, leveling off a little bit of the growth rate of programming spend as we get to this level is clearly part of the improvement in Peacock losses standalone, that will be a factor as we see continued strong growth on the revenue side, given the higher level of subs and the expectation for continuing to add. But again, I would just say I\u2019m less focused on what standalone Peacock losses are doing than I am on doing what\u2019s right for the long term, for the totality of the media business, which is linear and streaming. I think we\u2019ve navigated a very good path for us, so really pleased with what we\u2019ve done.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you very much.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks Ben. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Craig Moffet from Moffet Nathanson. You line is now live. \nCraig Moffett: Hi, thank you. I wonder if you could do an early post mortem on the Chiefs-Dolphins playoff game, what kind of subscription growth it drove at Peacock and what kind of early churn impact you\u2019ve had on that. I know there was some chatter that you guys tried to play down about whether that amount of traffic load on the internet would have some impact on fixed wireless, but I\u2019m wondering if you just have any observations about how other platforms handled the kind of the volume that that game drove in terms of traffic.\nMike Cavanagh: Sure Craig, it\u2019s Mike. I\u2019ll start, and Dave can chime in, if he likes. As we said earlier, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the way we performed in the Wild Card Game. It was the biggest live stream event in U.S. history, which is no small feat to have performed so seamlessly, which really highlights what we\u2019ve done in Dave\u2019s business on the broadband side and the technology platforms that we have built and have talked about repeatedly, that are supporting Peacock, Sky and our Xfinity products, and now Xumo, so I think we\u2019ve built tremendous advantage and are always looking for ways to--we\u2019re very happy to see the impact on our broadband usage, regardless of what it means for other ways of getting the platform across. We couldn\u2019t be happier that it worked well and performed really well with that many concurrent streams. But in terms of adding subs, we would expect to see--we\u2019re not going to comment on it today, but we would expect to see an increase in paid subs. We\u2019re focused now on retention of the subs that came in right around the game. What\u2019s important is both the subs that came in during the game and the engagement of the people that were already don the platform, so engagement and retention is really going to be focused on what\u2019s coming next, and we teased a lot of that, including Oppenheimer coming to the platform on February 16. We have the Summer Olympics coming, and now that we\u2019re post strikes, you\u2019ll see a number of Peacock originals and additional movies from the Pay-1 window that we\u2019ve got with Universal. But really, when I think about it, at the scale we\u2019ve gotten to, what\u2019s important is to keep people engaged with the platform and all the content that\u2019s there, not the Wild Card Game unto itself, so the job always is to get more people in the door and get everybody that\u2019s already in the door re-engaged with the platform around that game, and then try to continue to drive engagement afterwards. I\u2019m happy to report that we\u2019ve seen record levels of hours viewed in the days that have followed the Wild Card Game itself, including launching Ted, our new comedy series. That\u2019s been the most watched original series for Peacock in its first seven days yet on the platform, which speaks to the benefit of getting that much engagement at the moment we were launching that, and likewise the second season of the reality show, Traitors, premiered right afterwards, and it\u2019s also the biggest original reality season launch for us through its first four days on the platform. I think that\u2019s the way I look at the total picture there. Brian, I think you want to chime in?\nBrian Roberts: I just want to say that we thank the NFL for having the confidence in picking our total company to carry this out. The entire industry cooperated and participated, and it was a very proud moment for, I think, the U.S. internet industry. It worked flawlessly, and I think it\u2019s just another proof point of all the investments that have been made. Thank you again, we\u2019ll see how the results all turn out, but we\u2019re really, really pleased.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks Craig. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America Securities. Your line is now live.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. Mike, I have a two-parter. As Brian just said, you have a unique mix of assets, so can you talk a little bit about your longer term video strategy from all sides of the company, from both cable and NBC-U, meaning do you have any plans to take Peacock global, your recent Paramount affiliate renewal deal kind of seems like status quo? Then as a separate question, you kind of touched a little bit on Epic. It\u2019s only one year away. Can you give us some color on size and scope and how differentiated the offering will be? Thank you. \nMike Cavanagh: Hey Jessica, thanks. On Peacock in particular, let\u2019s take video in a couple of pieces. On our streaming ambitions, clearly we view it, and we\u2019ve talked about it for a long time, we want our existing media assets to have a strong future in a world where consumer behavior is taking people more to streaming, because that\u2019s the way they want to experience it, so our strength, obviously in video distribution from the NBC side, has been U.S. focused, and I think we are focused--very focused on getting domestic scale. What we\u2019ve done internationally and what we might do one day is a separate story, but for now, we have been focused on making sure through partnerships, JVs, whether it\u2019s Sky Showtime, whether it\u2019s Peacock-type content that makes its way onto Sky platforms, we\u2019ve got a venture partner in MultiChoice in Africa, so we\u2019re looking for ways and a rational approach economically to scale up Peacock domestically while not giving up too much in terms of economics that a lot of people talk about as having global scale. We want to win here first and get to the place we need to go, and that\u2019s really where we\u2019re most focused. In terms of what\u2019s happening on the domestic side through video distribution, I think we continue to be a big player in the space with our own content from NBC, but also I think the best partner given the scale of our reach in broadband for both traditional linear, but at the same time streaming partners. We\u2019ve seen a lot of progress and a lot of collaboration with players and partners that want to reach the kind of customer base we have with our broadband customer base, the natural point of engagement with them, aggregating content and acquiring new content if they don\u2019t have it through Xumo, X1 and the platform that Dave and team have built. I think we\u2019re really well positioned to play a part in that as well. \nDave Watson: And Jessica, this is Dave. I just would add, when you think about the overall video approach, it\u2019s linear, streaming, on-demand, still DVR. It\u2019s all of them that I think we are in a unique position to be able to tie together. Back to the Wild Card Game, it\u2019s an example of great broadband being able to handle it, and at the same time what\u2019s really important in video is the experience matters. The experience getting connected to the overall network performance is so critical, finding what you want easily and simply and being able to engage.  The platforms that we\u2019ve built over time, starting with X1, now Xumo, very important to us in the long run.\nBrian Roberts: One thing I would add - it\u2019s Brian - on Epic, just to touch on that part of the question. It\u2019s completely original. It maybe the most exciting project, I\u2019ve seen since we bought NBC-Universal getting built. I think it\u2019s the first new entire theme park in decades in the U.S., and we\u2019re so excited, we\u2019re taking the board of directors to see the construction in the next couple of weeks, which is something we haven\u2019t ever done before. So, I think you\u2019ll all want to be there. Sometime, I think \u201923 and \u201924, are the peak CapEx years for the construction. We expect to open in \u201925, and I give Mark Woodbury and the entire team at Universal incredible kudos to coordinate something of this scale and magnitude that\u2019s being built.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks Jessica. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from John Hodulik from UBS. Your line is now live.\nJohn Hodulik: Great, thanks. Two questions, if I could.  First on the ACP commentary, I think you guys had to contact ACP subscribers this year. Any way you could quantify the size of the base, or maybe the financial impact, and should we see anything this quarter? Or is it really something, if it doesn\u2019t get renewed, that we could really expect for, say, second quarter? Then over on the media side, it looks like you guys saw some real ad strength, so just any commentary on what you\u2019re seeing in the ad market? It looks like if you sort of look at core advertising, it was actually up this year, and I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s just strength in NFL and maybe Big 10, or just what some of the underlying factors are there would be great. Thanks.\nDave Watson: Hey John, it\u2019s Dave. Let me start with ACP. To specifically answer your question, we have 1.4 million customers that have benefited from this program which we obtained through the national verifier program, so feel good about the credentials of these customers. Most of these customers in this customer base were already our customers prior to the ACP program. We\u2019ve been very consistent on this. We want the program to continue, but I think we\u2019re very well positioned to support these customers if it does not. We have a good business and model in place and a history with knowing how to segment our customer base and have products and packages at a variety of price points to serve our customers well, including well over for a decade and that would include internet essentials. We\u2019ll evaluate this as it plays out. It may be a risk, but one we feel is very manageable for us, given how we work with this program and how we manage our customer base in general.\nMike Cavanagh: John, it\u2019s Mike. On the advertising side, I\u2019d say that the ad market, we have seen it remain stable, and we\u2019re definitely pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter. When you exclude 2022 World Cup and normalize for that, we did grow ad revenue even with the difficult comparison to last year\u2019s political quarter.  We are seeing a few encouraging signs, like stabilization across most categories, CPG and retail too that improved in particular. We\u2019re not seeing any pressure, any real pressure on cancellations from last year\u2019s up-fronts, which is good, and scatter premiums are pretty healthy, double digit increases is what we\u2019ve seen recently.  But I would say that it\u2019s too early to say that there\u2019s a sustainable rebound going on. Too much remains uncertain on the macro side and we\u2019re heading into a period, for us at least, that has less sports programming in the early part of the year. But regardless of the full year ahead, whether the environment macro-wise gets better from here or it doesn\u2019t, we feel like we\u2019re well positioned with our must-see tent poles, which include obviously the Olympics coming up, the elections, and then going back to your earlier point of now being much more scaled at Peacock, we\u2019re seeing nice progress on the capacity and inventory that we have there. So those are the dynamics I think we\u2019re seeing in advertising.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks John. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street Research. Your line is now live.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks. Two for Jason. You mentioned that if you saw opportunities to expand your footprint with good economics, you\u2019d do it in a heartbeat. Are you referring to the opportunity in BEAD, and is that something that you expect could potentially hit later this year, or is that more of a 2025 impact? Then on repurchases, we saw the reauthorization of $15 billion. You\u2019re going at a pace of $3.5 billion a quarter at the moment. Should we expect that to continue through 2024?\nJason Armstrong: Yes, thanks Jonathan. Let me take them in reverse order and then potentially tag team with Dave, if he wants to, on the footprint side. Buybacks, you\u2019re right - we reauthorized or re-upped this morning for $15 billion. Never meant to be guidance when we do this, but nonetheless healthy reauthorization. Saying that, I think the formula that\u2019s been in place for very strong capital returns continues to be in place, so I think we\u2019re comfortably within our leverage range, as I stated, which is right around 2.4 times, continue to generate very strong free cash flow, and if you look at the recent history since mid-\u201921, since we started buying back or restarted the buyback program, we\u2019ve bought back 15% of our stock in that time frame, so very good metric there, so more capital returns to continue, feel very strong about the trajectory into 2024. I think on the footprint side, we\u2019ve been very clear that, to the extent--you know, first and foremost as we talk about capital intensity in Dave\u2019s world, right around 10%, it\u2019s been there for the last couple years. The expectation is that it will be there again in 2024, but we\u2019ve also been very clear, that\u2019s not necessarily a constraint on the business. To the extent we can move faster, we\u2019ll do that, and we\u2019d like to. I think as you look at the past couple years on homes passed, we did 850,000 homes passed in 2022, we were able to accelerate that in 2023 up to 1.1 million, and we gave guidance this morning for 1.1 million or slightly higher next year, so we think we can further accelerate that. Most of that in terms of the guide for 2024 is self-funded, but we have been making our way into the ARPA program and had some success there. To the extent we\u2019re successful with BEAD, and I think we certainly expect to be, that would be more 2025 and beyond.\nDave Watson: This is Dave. I would only add that when you do these programs, and we have started and we are aggressively pursuing opportunities, as Jason said, at this stage mostly self-funded, but we are working with local governments on programs like ARPA and others. We are going for opportunities where it makes sense. The great part, and a little bit what Brian mentioned right from the get go, there\u2019s just been terrific execution as we scaled operationally, getting ready for this, so the 1.1 million that we did this past year, looking to do that or more into \u201924, we are on it and this is a real opportunity for us. Having said that, the nature of these projects, it takes a while to build them up and then driving penetration, and I would look for more of the benefit in \u201925. BEAD, we plan to participate where it is consistent with our business goals, but the process, quite frankly, with BEAD is still in flux.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks Jonathan. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question is coming from Steven Cahall from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nSteven Cahall: Thanks. Maybe first, I was wondering if you could expand on your Xfinity Mobile plans for 2024. One of your peers has been more promotional. I think that\u2019s something you\u2019ve kept an eye on, and we saw you get a bit more promotional last year with the iPhone deal. You also talked about broadband ARPU being the biggest driver of broadband revenue, and I know that can suffer on a GAAP basis if you do lean into mobile, so I\u2019d love to just hear more about how you\u2019re thinking about the broadband and mobile strategies coming together. Then Jason, just the severance that you took in the quarter, the lion\u2019s share fell at connectivity and platforms. How should we think about the benefits to opex in 2024? You said five out of the six buckets decreased last year, so maybe you can give us a bit of a view of what non-programming opex looks like for connectivity and platforms this year. Thank you.\nDave Watson: Steven, this is Dave. Let me start with wireless. I think we\u2019ve been consistent on this one, too - the wireless is one of the key long term growth drivers for us, and pointed out in the six that the team has talked about. It is absolutely a great companion to broadband. It has good standalone economics and a great runway ahead for penetration mobile to the broadband base. You know, it\u2019s performing well - our domestic revenue was up over 15, we have over 6 million lines, including the 310,000 that we added in the quarter, and we\u2019re only at 11% penetration, as Jason said, to the broadband base, so a lot of runway ahead. It is absolutely a key part of all our go-to-market activity, whether it\u2019s acquisition, case management, upgrade activity to the base, as you noted, Steven. We have been very focused on upgrade activity and retention, so our results have been consistent right around 300,000 new lines per quarter - pretty healthy run rate for a considerable period of time.  Having said that, I think we can improve on these results. We are consistently in the market trying new offers, both in terms of broadband and mobile together, and we segment the opportunity, so we do have unique opportunities that we evaluate. We continue to be hopeful that some of these offers will accelerate our line additions over time and as the year progresses. We have a great road map in terms of innovation and offers between Wi-Fi and mobile, and we want to leverage both and continue to build a better product and service. Our mobile service, our core service offering delivers better value day in and day out. We really like, though, our capital-light approach with the MVNO, and I think we\u2019re in a great position to win in convergence, so I think we have a leg up on the competition with this capital-light strategy that doesn\u2019t have to involve customer and/or network trade-offs. We\u2019ll continue to be opportunistic in evaluating progress, but I think there\u2019s upside.\nJason Armstrong: Steven, let me just round that out quickly, because part of the question seemed like, are we governing wireless at all as it relates to broadband ARPU growth and GAAP realization of broadband ARPU growth. The two are not connected. We will do what\u2019s right for the business, first and foremost. To the extent we\u2019re finding ways to accelerate wireless, I think we\u2019ll have opportunity to do that and not be held back by what it means for broadband ARPU, although we do see, and just to reiterate, broadband ARPU growth in both the fourth quarter and for the full year, 3.9%, high end of our historical range of 3% to 4%, and we guided to the coming year to still be in that range of 3% to 4%, so consistent and strong ARPU growth. On the severance question, as we step back, we\u2019re focused on investing capital and resources in our key growth areas, so we\u2019ve identified six key growth areas where investments in opex are being directed while managing carefully businesses that are important to us, but face secular headwinds. I think you saw that in the fourth quarter with severance actions - we took these actions to get ahead and position ourselves for continued transitions in these businesses in 2024 and beyond.  I would point out--you know, you mentioned connectivity and platforms specifically - that\u2019s where the bigger severance charges were. You\u2019re right - five out of six categories of expense were down year-over-year in 2023. These types of actions in transitioning our business and managing the expense base are a big part of that, and if you look at margin expansion, which we\u2019ve seen for a long period of time in the C&P business and gave an outlook that we expect to continue that, this is all part of that, taking action to sort of get ahead of these transitions. I will point of what we also said in the prepared remarks, if you look back in the last six years, we\u2019ve taken 50% of our truck rolls out of the system, so truck rolls versus 2017 are down 50%, so cut in half, and transactional volumes, if you will, or interactions are down 40%, so pretty significant expense opportunities relative to that, that we see continuing as well. \nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks Steve. Operator, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today is from Sebastiano Petti from JP Morgan. Your line is now live. \nSebastiano Petti: Hi, thank you for the question. Just wanted to see if you could provide additional color on perhaps the content and experiences segment capex expectations as we look beyond Epic. I think Jason, you did say in \u201925, capital intensity in content and experiences should tick down as the Epic build finishes, but as we think about your plans for regional parks in the U.S., headlines about a U.K. park construction perhaps over the next several years as well, any color on how we should be thinking about is there a parks capex holiday before a reacceleration? Then just a housekeeping question on Peacock - obviously very strong net adds inside of 2023. Mike, you did say that you do expect sub growth beyond that to kind of continue, but could you perhaps quantify what the benefit of the conversion from Comcast bundle subs from free to paid was within the year and as we\u2019re kind of thinking about organic or underlying growth that will benefit from the NFL playoff game, Oppenheimer, and some of the other stuff you listed? Thank you. \nMike Cavanagh: Sure, hey Sebastiano. On parks, it\u2019s as Jason said - we are going to remain at the elevated level around Epic with the two expansion parks, Hollywood Horror Nights and the Universal Kids in Frisco, Texas underway at this stage, so we\u2019ll remain elevated in 2024 and then as we come to completion of Epic in 2025, rolling into 2025, we\u2019ll ease off from there.  I think the easing off is--I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it a holiday, so much as much like we talked about adding additional passings in cable, if we see these projects pencil out for good return, we\u2019d be excited in the years that follow, I can\u2019t predict when, to continue to give the parks and experiences business whatever capital it requires. But right now with the visibility we have for what\u2019s in the pipeline, what Jason described as the trajectory is the right trajectory. Then on Peacock, I think we did a good job converting our Comcast free subs to paid subs, and they are now rolling into--after a few months at a lower price, are rolling into the full price, so I think we did a great job across the company on executing that.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks Sebastiano. That concludes our call. We appreciate all of you joining us this morning.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the question and answer session and today\u2019s conference call. A replay of the call will be available starting at 11:30 am eastern time today on Comcast\u2019s Investor Relations website.  Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Roberts",
            "content": "Thanks Jason, and good morning everyone. I'd like to just emphasize a couple of points. As I think about the year, it's hard not to be really proud of what we've accomplished. 2023 was the best financial year in our 60-year history, and we already have nice momentum in 2024. As Mike and Jason just outlined, we have a unique company that is incredibly well positioned. We always try to think about and invest for the long term, particularly across the six key growth drivers.  What's also important is that in 2023 alone, we returned $16 billion in capital to our shareholders. As you just heard, it's the 16th straight year that we just raised our dividend - that's consistency. When you put this all together, we have a great team - that's always most important to me, and we're making the right adjustments to our businesses to position us to win, grow, and continue to return capital to shareholders. While there may be speculation on what we could do next, I'd like you to hear it directly from me: I love the company we have, so the bar continues to be even higher for us to do anything other than the plan you heard today.  I want to thank all our employees for a great 2023 as they continue to execute at the highest level. With that, let me hand it over to Marci to take all your questions. I just want to say that we thank the NFL for having the confidence in picking our total company to carry this out. The entire industry cooperated and participated, and it was a very proud moment for, I think, the U.S. internet industry. It worked flawlessly, and I think it's just another proof point of all the investments that have been made. Thank you again, we'll see how the results all turn out, but we're really, really pleased. One thing I would add - it's Brian - on Epic, just to touch on that part of the question. It's completely original. It maybe the most exciting project, I've seen since we bought NBC-Universal getting built. I think it's the first new entire theme park in decades in the U.S., and we're so excited, we're taking the board of directors to see the construction in the next couple of weeks, which is something we haven't ever done before. So, I think you'll all want to be there. Sometime, I think '23 and '24, are the peak CapEx years for the construction. We expect to open in '25, and I give Mark Woodbury and the entire team at Universal incredible kudos to coordinate something of this scale and magnitude that's being built."

            "name": "Dave Watson",
            "content": "Hey Ben, this is Dave. Let me start with broadband and then hand it over to Mike and Jason. On broadband, as Mike and Jason said, the environment pretty much remains the same - you know, there is still the macro activity, moves are down, but to your point, it is intensely competitive, especially the difference that has been there in this particular competitive cycle, it's especially in the lower income segment, so the result of it is the main driver, customer activity, continues to be lower connects as churn remains near record lows, and despite this, we're striking, I think, the right balance between customer growth and ARPU. We kept our sub base relatively flat, grew ARPU 3.9% for the quarter and the year, and so we're also growing C&P but expanding margins. Competitive cycles like this one, we've been through many, and what makes--you know, what happens during some of these cycles, there is new footprint, the competitive footprint, some unique discounting occurs. I think fiber is a pretty good example of one that we went through years ago and continue to have. There is pressure on net adds as you go through the initial phase of the cycle, but we evolved our approach and we have and continue to compete very well against fiber. I think this cycle is headlined by fixed wireless and really the emphasis on more of the lower income segment. They added new footprint, there's some ARPU pressure, but we have and continue to adapt. The key for us through this cycle is continue to build better products, from the network to the Wi-Fi experience, and the network investments that we're making are very consistent and we've laid it out - mid-splits, we're pleased with our progress, we're finishing '23 33% upgraded, we'll be around 50% by year-end '24, and we've started to deploy 4.0 and our path towards symmetrical service offerings, so this is all due to where we believe strongly the market is going.  The market is going to have more devices that will be used and be hung on the network, and there will be more usage and engagement, so for the long run, we want to be in position to compete as things shift. We're going to compete in a segmented way for every segment, and we'll be aggressive in each one; but we don't expect subscriber trends to improve over the coming quarters but we do expect to grow over time. We will compete aggressively and be in position when the macro environment shifts, and as we see with fixed wireless, there's an opportunity and will be an opportunity to get more win backs. We want to be in position for that as well. Throughout it all, we're going to protect the healthy base of 32 million broadband customers, managing rate and volume throughout. And Jessica, this is Dave. I just would add, when you think about the overall video approach, it's linear, streaming, on-demand, still DVR. It's all of them that I think we are in a unique position to be able to tie together. Back to the Wild Card Game, it's an example of great broadband being able to handle it, and at the same time what's really important in video is the experience matters. The experience getting connected to the overall network performance is so critical, finding what you want easily and simply and being able to engage.  The platforms that we've built over time, starting with X1, now Xumo, very important to us in the long run. Hey John, it's Dave. Let me start with ACP. To specifically answer your question, we have 1.4 million customers that have benefited from this program which we obtained through the national verifier program, so feel good about the credentials of these customers. Most of these customers in this customer base were already our customers prior to the ACP program. We've been very consistent on this. We want the program to continue, but I think we're very well positioned to support these customers if it does not. We have a good business and model in place and a history with knowing how to segment our customer base and have products and packages at a variety of price points to serve our customers well, including well over for a decade and that would include internet essentials. We'll evaluate this as it plays out. It may be a risk, but one we feel is very manageable for us, given how we work with this program and how we manage our customer base in general. This is Dave. I would only add that when you do these programs, and we have started and we are aggressively pursuing opportunities, as Jason said, at this stage mostly self-funded, but we are working with local governments on programs like ARPA and others. We are going for opportunities where it makes sense. The great part, and a little bit what Brian mentioned right from the get go, there's just been terrific execution as we scaled operationally, getting ready for this, so the 1.1 million that we did this past year, looking to do that or more into '24, we are on it and this is a real opportunity for us. Having said that, the nature of these projects, it takes a while to build them up and then driving penetration, and I would look for more of the benefit in '25. BEAD, we plan to participate where it is consistent with our business goals, but the process, quite frankly, with BEAD is still in flux. Steven, this is Dave. Let me start with wireless. I think we've been consistent on this one, too - the wireless is one of the key long term growth drivers for us, and pointed out in the six that the team has talked about. It is absolutely a great companion to broadband. It has good standalone economics and a great runway ahead for penetration mobile to the broadband base. You know, it's performing well - our domestic revenue was up over 15, we have over 6 million lines, including the 310,000 that we added in the quarter, and we're only at 11% penetration, as Jason said, to the broadband base, so a lot of runway ahead. It is absolutely a key part of all our go-to-market activity, whether it's acquisition, case management, upgrade activity to the base, as you noted, Steven. We have been very focused on upgrade activity and retention, so our results have been consistent right around 300,000 new lines per quarter - pretty healthy run rate for a considerable period of time.  Having said that, I think we can improve on these results. We are consistently in the market trying new offers, both in terms of broadband and mobile together, and we segment the opportunity, so we do have unique opportunities that we evaluate. We continue to be hopeful that some of these offers will accelerate our line additions over time and as the year progresses. We have a great road map in terms of innovation and offers between Wi-Fi and mobile, and we want to leverage both and continue to build a better product and service. Our mobile service, our core service offering delivers better value day in and day out. We really like, though, our capital-light approach with the MVNO, and I think we're in a great position to win in convergence, so I think we have a leg up on the competition with this capital-light strategy that doesn't have to involve customer and/or network trade-offs. We'll continue to be opportunistic in evaluating progress, but I think there's upside."

            "name": "Mike Cavanagh",
            "content": "Thanks Marci, and good morning everyone. We're less than a month into the new year and 2024 is already off to a great start. Two weeks ago, our entire company came together to make history, shattering records with the first exclusively streamed NFL Wildcard Game on Peacock. Nearly 23 million viewers watched the Kansas City Chiefs take on the Miami Dolphins, consuming 30% of all internet traffic in the U.S. and setting a new record in total U.S. internet traffic for any night. Our investment in the network and our technology platforms built over decades enabled us to shine, delivering a seamless experience on the internet and Peacock, demonstrating that our company is in an excellent position to win in this era of high bandwidth consumption. Also, Universal Pictures' Oppenheimer picked up five Golden Globe awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Original Score.  With 2024 off to a terrific start, let's look back at 2023, where we produced consistently strong financial results and continued to execute against our long term strategy. We've positioned our company to benefit from a significant number of scaled and diversified growth opportunities that are margin accretive, namely residential broadband, mobile, business services, theme parks, studios, and Peacock. In aggregate, our revenue in these businesses grew 8% in 2023 and comprised 55% of our total revenue for the year. Our healthy cash flow generation and strong balance sheet have enabled the organic investment that fuels these businesses and at the same time fund substantial capital return, including significant share repurchases. All of this has translated into excellent financial performance. For the third consecutive year, we generated the highest revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS in our company's history.  Now let's go deeper on some of the important achievements during the year. I'm really proud of the progress we've made in our connectivity businesses. We maintained a strong trajectory in Xfinity Mobile, increasing our subscriber lines by 24% and total domestic wireless revenue by nearly 20%. We also performed well in our business services segment, which grew full year revenue and EBITDA by nearly 5% with margins approaching 60%, and we exceeded our goal of adding over 1 million new homes and businesses passed and expect to do at or above this level in 2024. Our domestic broadband business remains strong. We kept our very large and healthy base of subscribers flat while growing residential ARPU 3.9%, the high end of our historical range, driving solid EBITDA growth in connectivity and platforms and expanding margins to around 40% on an underlying basis. We achieved all of this despite an intensely competitive environment, and as I look back on 2023, I am confident that our strategy combined with excellent execution sets us up extremely well to navigate the road ahead. While the competitive environment is likely to remain at these levels for a period of time, broadband is still a very large, healthy and profitable market, and the consumption trends that we're seeing are encouraging for the future. Customers are connecting more devices in their homes and are using them for applications that require more capacity, faster speeds and lower latency. Our fiber-deep and capital efficient network is more than ready to meet this demand with 100,000 miles of fiber and a clear path to offering multi-gigabit symmetrical speeds ubiquitously across our entire footprint with DOCSIS 4.0.  I'd like to spend a minute briefly addressing the government's affordable connectivity program. First, it's important to note that we've built on our decade-long history in digital equity to effectively participate in ACP and have successfully leveraged the national verifier program in the process. While we hope that the White House and Congress renew this funding and keep these important resources available to the many people and households who have relied upon this program to stay digitally connected, we have already begun to communicate with ACP participants and will provide a range of options, including our highly successful internet essentials program, in the event that funding is discontinued. Shifting to content and experiences, we have positioned ourselves to drive long term profitable growth. Over the span of decades, we've built a remarkable portfolio of iconic content and strong franchises in both film and television, including live sports, news and entertainment. Our market-leading businesses have tremendous reach and continue to perform and execute collaboratively, playing to our strengths by leveraging our IP and our incredible partners. Let's start with our studio group, where we hit a major milestone ranking as the number one studio in film by worldwide box office with hits such as Super Mario Bros., Oppenheimer, Fast 10, and Five Nights at Freddy's. We are proud to work alongside our creative partners like Christopher Nolan, Chris Meledandri, and Jason Blum, who are innovative industry leaders to develop content that continues to delight audiences. And I'm really excited about another fantastic film slate in 2024 with the latest installment of Kung Fu Panda in March, along with Despicable Me and Twisters in July, and Wicked slated for November, which will also benefit Peacock as these films and many others enter the Pay-1 window.  At the same time, our media segment continues to deliver, reaching over 100 million households every quarter with leading sports, news and entertainment. We have the number one most watched news organization in the U.S. and Sunday Night Football is pacing to be the most watched prime time show for an unprecedented 13th consecutive year. Peacock continued to be the fastest growing streamer in the U.S., a result of our holistic business model which leverages all of our brands to serve a broad range of viewers by providing them with options to match their evolving habits. In the short period of time since we launched in 2020, we've seen strong momentum, ending the year at 31 million paid subscribers at a $10 ARPU, supported by healthy trends in both engagement and churn, and I'm excited for 2024. We started with the successful Wild Card Game, which will soon be followed by Oppenheimer coming exclusively to Peacock and a full slate of both new and returning originals such as Ted, Peacock's most watched original title, additional Pay-1 movies, and the Summer Olympics later this year. These next Olympic Games promise to be nothing short of spectacular with the return of fans, this time to Paris, one of the most beautiful cities in the world. With the NBC Broadcast Network airing more content than ever before and Peacock as the streaming home for all games, NBC Universal will be the most comprehensive Olympic destination in U.S. media history with Xfinity once again playing a huge role in delivering each game on our entertainment OS platform, which is now also available to charter customers through Xumo.  At parks, we achieved record-high revenue and EBITDA in 2023 and have exciting new attractions and experiences in the years ahead. We'll open Donkey Kong, another Nintendo-themed land next year in Osaka, which will expand Super Nintendo World by another 70%. We expect continuation of the strong trends in Hollywood also driven by Super Nintendo World, and we'll see the completion of Epic Universe, our fourth gate in Orlando, prior to its grand opening in 2025. In summary, we are very pleased with all that we have achieved in 2023. We have incredible teams in each of our businesses and have executed against our plan exceptionally well, delivering very strong EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow. Going forward, our highest priority is to continue our strong operational performance enabled by the investments we are making in our six key growth areas, fueling their growth and further improving the profile of our business mix. The strength and stability of our company, including our balance sheet, enables us to make these investments while also providing our shareholders with substantial capital returns. Since we started buying back stock in late May of 2021, we have repurchased approximately 15% of our total shares outstanding, and with today's announcement we have now increased our annualized dividend by 150% since I joined the company in 2015. Putting it all together, our strategy is working and we see many years ahead that this formula will continue to deliver for our company and shareholders.  Jason, over to you. Hey, it's Mike, Ben. Thanks for the question on Peacock. I'll expand a little bit on the question but get to it in terms of where we see programming going in the end. I've got to say, we couldn't be prouder of what we accomplished with Peacock in 2023. To end the year with paying subs at 31 million, up 50% year-over-year, and that's only three years in, we're achieving a level of scale with paying subs that's about 60% of the level of the streamers that have been out there for many years domestically, ex-Netflix. We're holding a very strong ARPU at $10 per sub, so while it's not the scale we ultimately plan to get to, I've got to say the team has done a fantastic job when lots questioned, could we even get this far. From here, it's really a matter of continuing to execute against the strategy that's gotten us here, and that is expected, as we said earlier, to drive improvement in Peacock's bottom line from the peak losses that we saw in 2023. When you really think about what that strategy is, it's to manage Peacock and our linear TV businesses as one. The strategy really is to leverage the great relevant content properties we have, both at NBC which is news and sports and entertainment, obviously Bravo and some of the other assets we have in the cable business, and Universal with the Pay-1 window, so when you put it all together, continuing to execute against that. We're going to look to get more scale, and the things we're doing are both to drive more scale, more subs, but also get more engagement with the subs we have and drive improvements in churn, which we've been pretty pleased with.  To ultimately your question, where are we relative to--you know, leveling off a little bit of the growth rate of programming spend as we get to this level is clearly part of the improvement in Peacock losses standalone, that will be a factor as we see continued strong growth on the revenue side, given the higher level of subs and the expectation for continuing to add. But again, I would just say I'm less focused on what standalone Peacock losses are doing than I am on doing what's right for the long term, for the totality of the media business, which is linear and streaming. I think we've navigated a very good path for us, so really pleased with what we've done. Sure Craig, it's Mike. I'll start, and Dave can chime in, if he likes. As we said earlier, we couldn't be more pleased with the way we performed in the Wild Card Game. It was the biggest live stream event in U.S. history, which is no small feat to have performed so seamlessly, which really highlights what we've done in Dave's business on the broadband side and the technology platforms that we have built and have talked about repeatedly, that are supporting Peacock, Sky and our Xfinity products, and now Xumo, so I think we've built tremendous advantage and are always looking for ways to--we're very happy to see the impact on our broadband usage, regardless of what it means for other ways of getting the platform across. We couldn't be happier that it worked well and performed really well with that many concurrent streams. But in terms of adding subs, we would expect to see--we're not going to comment on it today, but we would expect to see an increase in paid subs. We're focused now on retention of the subs that came in right around the game. What's important is both the subs that came in during the game and the engagement of the people that were already don the platform, so engagement and retention is really going to be focused on what's coming next, and we teased a lot of that, including Oppenheimer coming to the platform on February 16. We have the Summer Olympics coming, and now that we're post strikes, you'll see a number of Peacock originals and additional movies from the Pay-1 window that we've got with Universal. But really, when I think about it, at the scale we've gotten to, what's important is to keep people engaged with the platform and all the content that's there, not the Wild Card Game unto itself, so the job always is to get more people in the door and get everybody that's already in the door re-engaged with the platform around that game, and then try to continue to drive engagement afterwards. I'm happy to report that we've seen record levels of hours viewed in the days that have followed the Wild Card Game itself, including launching Ted, our new comedy series. That's been the most watched original series for Peacock in its first seven days yet on the platform, which speaks to the benefit of getting that much engagement at the moment we were launching that, and likewise the second season of the reality show, Traitors, premiered right afterwards, and it's also the biggest original reality season launch for us through its first four days on the platform. I think that's the way I look at the total picture there. Brian, I think you want to chime in? Hey Jessica, thanks. On Peacock in particular, let's take video in a couple of pieces. On our streaming ambitions, clearly we view it, and we've talked about it for a long time, we want our existing media assets to have a strong future in a world where consumer behavior is taking people more to streaming, because that's the way they want to experience it, so our strength, obviously in video distribution from the NBC side, has been U.S. focused, and I think we are focused--very focused on getting domestic scale. What we've done internationally and what we might do one day is a separate story, but for now, we have been focused on making sure through partnerships, JVs, whether it's Sky Showtime, whether it's Peacock-type content that makes its way onto Sky platforms, we've got a venture partner in MultiChoice in Africa, so we're looking for ways and a rational approach economically to scale up Peacock domestically while not giving up too much in terms of economics that a lot of people talk about as having global scale. We want to win here first and get to the place we need to go, and that's really where we're most focused. In terms of what's happening on the domestic side through video distribution, I think we continue to be a big player in the space with our own content from NBC, but also I think the best partner given the scale of our reach in broadband for both traditional linear, but at the same time streaming partners. We've seen a lot of progress and a lot of collaboration with players and partners that want to reach the kind of customer base we have with our broadband customer base, the natural point of engagement with them, aggregating content and acquiring new content if they don't have it through Xumo, X1 and the platform that Dave and team have built. I think we're really well positioned to play a part in that as well. John, it's Mike. On the advertising side, I'd say that the ad market, we have seen it remain stable, and we're definitely pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter. When you exclude 2022 World Cup and normalize for that, we did grow ad revenue even with the difficult comparison to last year's political quarter.  We are seeing a few encouraging signs, like stabilization across most categories, CPG and retail too that improved in particular. We're not seeing any pressure, any real pressure on cancellations from last year's up-fronts, which is good, and scatter premiums are pretty healthy, double digit increases is what we've seen recently.  But I would say that it's too early to say that there's a sustainable rebound going on. Too much remains uncertain on the macro side and we're heading into a period, for us at least, that has less sports programming in the early part of the year. But regardless of the full year ahead, whether the environment macro-wise gets better from here or it doesn't, we feel like we're well positioned with our must-see tent poles, which include obviously the Olympics coming up, the elections, and then going back to your earlier point of now being much more scaled at Peacock, we're seeing nice progress on the capacity and inventory that we have there. So those are the dynamics I think we're seeing in advertising. Sure, hey Sebastiano. On parks, it's as Jason said - we are going to remain at the elevated level around Epic with the two expansion parks, Hollywood Horror Nights and the Universal Kids in Frisco, Texas underway at this stage, so we'll remain elevated in 2024 and then as we come to completion of Epic in 2025, rolling into 2025, we'll ease off from there.  I think the easing off is--I wouldn't necessarily call it a holiday, so much as much like we talked about adding additional passings in cable, if we see these projects pencil out for good return, we'd be excited in the years that follow, I can't predict when, to continue to give the parks and experiences business whatever capital it requires. But right now with the visibility we have for what's in the pipeline, what Jason described as the trajectory is the right trajectory. Then on Peacock, I think we did a good job converting our Comcast free subs to paid subs, and they are now rolling into--after a few months at a lower price, are rolling into the full price, so I think we did a great job across the company on executing that."

            "name": "Jason Armstrong",
            "content": "Thanks Mike, and good morning everyone. I'll begin on Slides 4 and 5 with our consolidated results. Total revenue increased 2% to $31.3 billion for the fourth quarter and was consistent at $121.6 billion for the full year. On a reported basis, EBITDA was consistent at $8 billion for the fourth quarter and up 3% to $37.6 billion for the full year. Our EBITDA results include severance and other in this quarter, as well as in last year's fourth quarter. Excluding these items totaling $527 million this quarter and $638 million in last year's quarter, adjusted EBITDA decreased 1% in the fourth quarter and remained at 3% growth for the full year. Adjusted EPS was up 2% to $0.84 a share for the fourth quarter and increased 9% to $3.98 for the full year.  We generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow for the quarter and $13 billion for the full year, which translates into $3.13 in free cash flow per share, which was up 10% year-over-year, and we returned over 100% of this to shareholders, with $4.7 billion of capital returned to shareholders in the quarter and $15.8 billion for the full year. Our strong level of free cash flow includes the significant investments we're making to support and grow our business in six broad and diversified growth categories, including residential broadband, wireless, and business services connectivity, along with theme parks, streaming and premium content at our studios. Taken together, these growth areas generated more than half of our total company revenue and grew at a high single digit rate during the quarter and for the full year. Now let's turn to our business results, starting on Slide 6 with connectivity and platforms. As a reminder, our largest foreign exchange exposure is to the British pound, which was up nearly 6% year-over-year. As usual, in order to highlight the underlying performance of the connectivity and platforms business, I will refer to year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis. Revenue for total connectivity and platforms was flat at $20.4 billion. Unpacking that, revenue in our core connectivity business - domestic broadband, domestic wireless, international connectivity, and business services connectivity, increased 7% to $11 billion, while video, advertising and other revenue declined 8% to $9 billion. Our strategy is to invest to drive growth in our core connectivity businesses while at the same time carefully managing businesses that are important, but face secular headwinds. On balance, this is a favorable mix shift for the profitability of our overall connectivity and platform segment, as reflected in our results. EBITDA for total connectivity and platforms increased 3% with EBITDA margins improving 130 basis points year-over-year. This includes severance and other of $422 million in the quarter and $456 million of charges in last year's fourth quarter. Excluding these items in both periods, EBITDA increased 2% to $8 billion and EBITDA margins improved by 110 basis points.  Margins for our domestic legacy cable business improved 70 basis points to 46.2%. In terms of how our underlying performance in connectivity and platforms breaks out between residential and business, on the same basis excluding severance and other from both periods, residential EBITDA grew 2% with margins improving 120 basis points, and business services EBITDA increased 5% with margins nearly unchanged at an impressive 57%.  Now let's get further into the details, starting with our connectivity growth drivers. Residential connectivity revenue grew 7% driven by 4% growth in domestic broadband, 15% growth in domestic wireless and 19% growth in international connectivity, while business services connectivity revenue grew 6%. Domestic broadband was once again driven by very strong ARPU growth of 3.9% for the quarter and for the year, landing at the high end of our historical 3% to 4% range while our base of 32 million broadband subscribers remained stable over the past year, including the 34,000 subscriber loss this quarter. We remain focused on competing aggressively but in a financially balanced way, as evidenced by this quarter and past years' results. With the broadband marketplace remaining extremely competitive, we will continue to manage this balance and expect ARPU growth will remain strong within our historical range and continue to be the driver of our residential broadband revenue growth in 2024. While we do not expect subscriber trends to improve in the coming quarters, we do expect them to improve over time. At the macro level, customers are consuming more, connecting more devices in their homes, and are using them for applications that collectively require either faster speeds, lower latency, and higher reliability over time. These secular trends are all moving in our favor, and we believe our marginal cost to add capacity to our network is unrivalled. This is why we are investing in our fiber-fed network to further increase capacity and offer multi-gig symmetrical speeds ubiquitously across our footprint and ensure that we stay way ahead of consumer demand with the best broadband offering and experience. We have deployed mid-splits to about 35% of our footprint and expect that to reach around 50% by the end of 2024. On the back of this, we launched our first DOCSIS 4.0 market during the fourth quarter and will continue to launch additional markets this year. We are focused on what we can control - that means segmenting our customer base by offering our customers the right price, including value options at different speed tiers and driving ARPU ahead in an environment where broadband subscriber growth remains challenged, and we're doing this in the context of aggressive network upgrades and expansion, putting us in a great position to eventually return to subscriber growth. Speaking of network expansion, we exceeded our goal of passing 1 million new homes and businesses in 2023, landing at nearly 1.1 million, and we plan to replicate this in 2024 with this level, or potentially even greater footprint expansion.  Switching to wireless, we hit a great milestone, eclipsing $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time this quarter. With the year-over-year increase due to higher service revenue driven by continued strong momentum in customer lines, which were up 1.3 million or 24% year-over-year to 6.5 million in total. This includes 310,000 lines we just added in the quarter. We've had a healthy run rate generating around 300,000 net additional lines per quarter for the last two years, and we're consistently in the market testing new offers and will continue to do that throughout the coming year, with the goal that some of these offers will translate into accelerated line additions as the year progresses. With only 11% penetration of our domestic residential broadband customer accounts, we still have a big opportunity and a long runway ahead for growth in wireless.  International connectivity revenue increased 19% driven by steady mid-teens growth in broadband along with strong growth in wireless, which had healthy growth in both device sales and service revenue. Finally, business services connectivity revenue increased 6% driven by consistent growth in our small business category as we grew ARPU through rate and higher penetration of additional products like Security Edge, and from strong growth in midmarket and enterprise. The revenue growth in our connectivity businesses was offset by declines in video, advertising, and other revenue. The video revenue decline was driven by continued customer losses. The lower other revenue reflects similar dynamics in wire line voice, and advertising was impacted by a tough comparison to last year, which benefited from higher political revenue in our domestic markets.  As I mentioned earlier, excluding severance and other, connectivity and platforms' total EBITDA increased 2% with adjusted margin of 110 basis points. To unpack this improvement, the main driver is the mix shift to our high margin connectivity businesses, a transition you've seen for the last few years and that we expect to continue. In addition to the mix shift, we are benefiting from ongoing cost discipline. For every quarter this year, including the fourth quarter, five out of six categories of expenses we report have decreased. The only category that grew is direct product costs, which are success-based and directly associated with the significant growth in our connectivity businesses.  In addition, we continue to get more efficient with better tools and technology. Compared to 2017, we reduced our domestic truck rolls by nearly 50% and customer interactions are down nearly 40%, even while we increased our domestic relationships by nearly 5 million over this same time period. The investment we are making in our network, including virtualization and using technology to enhance the customer experience, not only makes us more competitive, it makes us more cost efficient. Together, the mix shift, the cost discipline and the technology advances we've made in customer service are all structural, and we expect them to continue, positioning us to drive higher profitability and further margin expansion in 2024 and for the foreseeable future. Now let's turn to content and experiences on Slide 7. Revenue increased 6% to $11.5 billion and EBITDA increased 2% to $923 million. Excluding severance at $101 million this quarter and $186 million in last year's fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA decreased 6%, reflecting a decrease in media partially offset by strong growth at studios and record results at parks. Now let's take a closer look at content and experiences, starting with media. Media revenue increased 3% driven by strong growth at Peacock, which was up 57% and, similar to wireless, crossed the $1 billion in quarterly revenue mark for the first time. Domestic distribution increased 9% driven by Peacock subscription revenue growth of 88% fueled by the continuation of solid growth in our paid subscriber base. We ended the quarter with 31 million Peacock paid subscribers, up 10 million over the past year, including 3 million net additions in the quarter driven by sports, including the NFL and the Big 10, and movies, notably the day and date movie, Five Nights at Freddy's, and a variety of originals and other entertainment programming.  International networks revenue, which is mainly distribution revenue for Sky Sports, increased 17% primarily due to the increase in sports content this year as well as the positive impact of foreign currency translation. Finally, domestic advertising declined 7% due to a tough comparison to last year, which included a significant incremental contribution in advertising from Telemundo's broadcast of the FIFA World Cup. Excluding the World Cup, advertising increased nearly 3% driven by strong Peacock advertising and from our strong sports line-up. Peacock advertising increased 50%, again excluding the World Cup, and hit an all-time high.  Media EBITDA decreased 50% mainly due to higher sports costs, reflecting a full quarter of a contractual rate increase in our NFL programming, the addition of Big 10 to our sports programming line-up this year, and higher Premier League costs compared to last year when games were paused for four weeks to accommodate the timing of the World Cup. At Peacock, EBITDA losses continued to moderate in the fourth quarter with nice year-over-year improvement resulting in full year losses for Peacock of $2.7 billion, which was slightly better than the expectation we had previously communicated. 2023 marked the peak in annual losses at Peacock, and for 2024 we expect to show meaningful improvement in losses versus 2023. Turning to studios, revenue increased 4% driven by theatrical revenue growth of 59% due to our performance at the box office this quarter with Five Nights at Freddy's, Trolls Band Together, The Exorcist, and Migration. In fact, Five Nights at Freddy's was the highest grossing horror film of 2023 and also set a record on Peacock as the most watched title of all time in the first five days of its release. In addition to the films this quarter, we benefited from prior period titles moving through profitable licensing windows, driving EBITDA growth of 83% to $308 million. At theme parks, revenue increased 12% and EBITDA also increased 12% to $872 million for the quarter. These strong results were again driven by growth at our international parks, especially as Osaka continues to benefit from strong demand from Super Nintendo World driving higher attendance and per-cap spending relative to both last year and pre-pandemic levels. In Hollywood, we also continued to benefit from the positive consumer reaction to Super Nintendo World, which opened earlier in 2023, driving strong attendance and growth in per-caps and resulting in Hollywood's best fourth quarter EBITDA in its history. In Orlando, our results were also strong with attendance in line with 2019 pre-pandemic levels and revenue substantially ahead. Now I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 8. As I mentioned previously, we generated $1.7 billion in free cash flow this quarter and $13 billion for the year, and we achieved this while absorbing meaningful capital investments to expand our footprint and further strengthen our domestic broadband network, scale our streaming business, and support the continued build of our Epic Universe park ahead of its 2025 opening. As a result, total capital spending increased 13% for the year driven by higher capex. At connectivity and platforms, capex increased 1.5% for the full year, with capex intensity coming in at 10.1% primarily driven by investments to further strengthen and extend our network. In 2024, we expect capex intensity to be in the same range as we continue to transition our U.S. network to DOCSIS 4.0 and accelerate our growth in homes passed.  I'll just note that while our capex intensity at connectivity and platforms has been around 10% for the past few years, this is not a specific internal target for us, rather it's an output. Our teams are going as fast as possible; however, if for example we have an opportunity to accelerate further our growth in homes passed at accretive economics, then we'd welcome that opportunity. But right now, the envelope has been right around 10% and we're very happy with the pace that we are on and the progress we're making. Content and experiences capex increased by $1.2 billion for the full year, driven by parks with Epic accounting for the majority of the increase in spend. In 2024, we expect parks capex to remain elevated and then decrease in 2025 when we open Epic. Working capital was $2 billion for the year, which was better than we expected, improving a billion over last year's level. Our 2023 results included benefits from the pause in production during the work stoppages associated with the writers and actors strikes during the year.  Turning to return of capital on our balance sheet, for the full year we returned a total of $15.8 billion to shareholders - this includes share repurchases of $11 billion, including $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter. In addition, dividend payments totaled $4.8 billion. As we announced this morning, we are raising our dividend by $0.08 a share to $1.24 per share - that's our 16th consecutive annual increase. We ended the year with net leverage of 2.3 times, in line with our target leverage of around 2.4 times, and we expect to remain at this target level in 2024.  Wrapping up, we had a very solid quarter and a great year, and we're focused on continuing to execute our long term growth strategy supported by our balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation. I'm proud of the steady and consistent framework which guides our decision-making. We're going to invest aggressively for organic growth across our six key areas. We'll protect our balance sheet and cash flow position and return capital to shareholders. Now I'll turn it over to Brian for a few remarks before we turn to Q&A. Yes, thanks Jonathan. Let me take them in reverse order and then potentially tag team with Dave, if he wants to, on the footprint side. Buybacks, you're right - we reauthorized or re-upped this morning for $15 billion. Never meant to be guidance when we do this, but nonetheless healthy reauthorization. Saying that, I think the formula that's been in place for very strong capital returns continues to be in place, so I think we're comfortably within our leverage range, as I stated, which is right around 2.4 times, continue to generate very strong free cash flow, and if you look at the recent history since mid-'21, since we started buying back or restarted the buyback program, we've bought back 15% of our stock in that time frame, so very good metric there, so more capital returns to continue, feel very strong about the trajectory into 2024. I think on the footprint side, we've been very clear that, to the extent--you know, first and foremost as we talk about capital intensity in Dave's world, right around 10%, it's been there for the last couple years. The expectation is that it will be there again in 2024, but we've also been very clear, that's not necessarily a constraint on the business. To the extent we can move faster, we'll do that, and we'd like to. I think as you look at the past couple years on homes passed, we did 850,000 homes passed in 2022, we were able to accelerate that in 2023 up to 1.1 million, and we gave guidance this morning for 1.1 million or slightly higher next year, so we think we can further accelerate that. Most of that in terms of the guide for 2024 is self-funded, but we have been making our way into the ARPA program and had some success there. To the extent we're successful with BEAD, and I think we certainly expect to be, that would be more 2025 and beyond. Steven, let me just round that out quickly, because part of the question seemed like, are we governing wireless at all as it relates to broadband ARPU growth and GAAP realization of broadband ARPU growth. The two are not connected. We will do what's right for the business, first and foremost. To the extent we're finding ways to accelerate wireless, I think we'll have opportunity to do that and not be held back by what it means for broadband ARPU, although we do see, and just to reiterate, broadband ARPU growth in both the fourth quarter and for the full year, 3.9%, high end of our historical range of 3% to 4%, and we guided to the coming year to still be in that range of 3% to 4%, so consistent and strong ARPU growth. On the severance question, as we step back, we're focused on investing capital and resources in our key growth areas, so we've identified six key growth areas where investments in opex are being directed while managing carefully businesses that are important to us, but face secular headwinds. I think you saw that in the fourth quarter with severance actions - we took these actions to get ahead and position ourselves for continued transitions in these businesses in 2024 and beyond.  I would point out--you know, you mentioned connectivity and platforms specifically - that's where the bigger severance charges were. You're right - five out of six categories of expense were down year-over-year in 2023. These types of actions in transitioning our business and managing the expense base are a big part of that, and if you look at margin expansion, which we've seen for a long period of time in the C&P business and gave an outlook that we expect to continue that, this is all part of that, taking action to sort of get ahead of these transitions. I will point of what we also said in the prepared remarks, if you look back in the last six years, we've taken 50% of our truck rolls out of the system, so truck rolls versus 2017 are down 50%, so cut in half, and transactional volumes, if you will, or interactions are down 40%, so pretty significant expense opportunities relative to that, that we see continuing as well."

        "content": "Operator: Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Comcast's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Executive Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thank you, operator. And welcome, everyone. Joining me on today's call are Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh, Jason Armstrong, and Dave Watson.  I will now refer you to slide 2 of the presentation accompanying this call which can also be found on our Investor Relations website and which contains our Safe Harbor disclaimer. This conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our 8-K and trending schedule issued earlier this morning for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\nMichael Cavanagh: Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining our third quarter earnings call. It was another strong quarter for us, with adjusted EBITDA up 5% and adjusted EPS up 13%. We generated $4 billion in free cash flow, which, combined with our expectation of Hulu proceeds in the near future, contributed to a pick-up in our share repurchases to $3.5 billion in the quarter. Our steady performance has been a direct result of how we've always run our company, which is with a focus on industry-leading performance, both operationally and financially, in each of our businesses, combined with a long-term, customer-centric approach to decision-making that ensures each business is positioned to win in the future. This has all been facilitated by a philosophy of investment in our businesses that has remained consistent through different economic and credit cycles, and particularly through the recent global pandemic. Now, I'd like to highlight four areas in the quarter that show how this strategy is playing out before handing it over to Jason to review this quarter's results in full. The first area I'd like to highlight is residential domestic connectivity, where we are very pleased with our performance and strategy as we navigate a highly competitive broadband marketplace.  The customer experience provided by our broadband network, which has ubiquitously available gig speeds today and is on a path to ubiquitous multi-gigabit symmetrical speeds, combined with our wireless offering through our MVNO with Verizon and our own network of over 20 million Wi-Fi hotspots, enables us to provide world-class connectivity both in and out of the home to all of our customers everywhere in the most cost effective and capital efficient manner versus our competition. Our broadband network and product leadership continue to drive strong residential revenue growth, which was up nearly 4% this quarter, fueled by very strong ARPU growth of 3.9%. We're confident in our ability to drive continued ARPU growth because of our focus on constantly improving the product experience through investment and innovation, thus delivering more value to our customers. Having a truly excellent Internet experience as reflected in speed, reliability, coverage, security, and latency is constantly increasing in importance to all households as a result of the consumer experiences it enables.  One of the biggest catalysts for recent growth in data usage is the accelerating transition of sports viewership to streaming platforms. The switch of a single Thursday night NFL game to streaming moved peak data usage on our broadband network from Sunday night to Thursday night, and that game comprises roughly 25% of all Internet traffic on Thursday nights. Every internet service provider, fixed wireless in particular, will really be put to the test as this transition of sports to streaming continues, especially come January, when for the first time ever, an NFL playoff game will be aired exclusively on a streaming platform which will be our very own Peacock. The second item I'll highlight is Peacock, which added 4 million paying subscribers during the quarter, saw greater than 60% revenue growth versus a year ago, and had the first year-over-year improvement in EBITDA since our launch in 2020.  While we report standalone Peacock metrics given the significance of this initiative, we manage it as part of the broader NBCU media segment which includes the broadcast and cable networks to best leverage the advantages we bring to the streaming landscape. We continue to be pleased with our progress in the few short years since we've pivoted our streaming strategy as a result of the ownership changes at Hulu. Looking ahead, we are sticking to our plans and still expect 2023 to be the peak year of EBITDA losses for Peacock, though we are now expecting 2023 Peacock losses to come in around $2.8 billion versus our original $3 billion loss outlook. And for 2024, we expect to show meaningful EBITDA improvement over 2023. The third area to highlight is our parks business, which generated a record high level of EBITDA, surpassing the previous record that we'd just set in second quarter. The reaction to Nintendo and Hollywood in Japan continues to be fantastic, and we are very excited about bringing the experience to Florida soon.  I was just in Orlando with the parks leadership team last week, reviewing our plans for the new Halloween Horror experience in Las Vegas and kids theme park in Frisco, Texas. I also spent a few hours on a site tour of the Epic Universe park, which is deep in construction and is simply breathtaking.  So thanks to the momentum of our third quarter results and what we have in the pipeline, I could not be more excited about our parks business. The final area to highlight is our studios business, which is having a great year with three of the top five box office hits for the year so far in Super Mario Bros., Fast X, and now Oppenheimer, which grossed more than $900 million in worldwide box office in the third quarter and became the highest grossing biopic of all time. This is a continuation of our solid track record where, since 2020, we've had at least two of the top five movies in worldwide box office. We believe that success in this business is not formulaic. It's a craft rooted in creativity and originality. We've long focused on assembling a team of the most innovative filmmakers, Chris Nolan, Chris Meledandri, Steven Spielberg, Jason Blum, and Jordan Peele, to name a few, which positions us very well for the future in the studios business. More broadly, it is our consistent investment approach through past business cycles and the pandemic that is the reason for much of the success we're experiencing today. We remain steadfast in supporting our businesses, even those that were hit hard during that time period.  For example, in studios, we never stopped believing that people want to experience great films in theaters, and that conviction enabled us to attract new partners like Chris Nolan who made a masterpiece in Oppenheimer.  Similarly, while our parks business was closed or at limited capacity, we continued to invest heavily in our existing parks, including the VelociCoaster in Orlando, Secret Life of Pets in Hollywood, and the Nintendo Lands I had mentioned earlier in Los Angeles and Osaka, and we will be bringing Epic Universe to life in 2025. Our strong investment-grade balance sheet enabled these investments and puts us in strong and enviable position today.  Now the business world must deal with pressures of much higher interest rates, which I believe will asymmetrically advantage us, given our low leverage and the long duration of our debt.  Since the end of 2018, we have refinanced over $40 billion or nearly 40% of our debt obligations, reduced net debt from $108 billion to $88 billion today, lowered net leverage by a full turn from 3.3 times to 2.3 times, increased the average life of our debt by more than four years to 17 years, while reducing the weighted average cost of our debt to 3.6% from 3.8%. Today, 97% of our debt is at fixed rates compared to just 82% at the end of 2018. We accomplished this while at the same time returning $45 billion to shareholders, including $24 billion via share repurchases and $21 billion in dividends. To sum up, we're in a great place, especially given how the competitive dynamics in our industry might evolve in this higher-for-longer interest rate environment. I expect that our focus on building businesses that are market leaders for the long term through strong execution, investment, and innovation will keep us in one of the strongest positions to perform for our customers, employees, and shareholders.  Jason, over to you.\nJason Armstrong: Thanks, Mike. And good morning, everyone. I'll take you through our strong third quarter and we'll begin with our consolidated financials on slide 4. Revenue increased 1% to $30.1 billion, while adjusted EBITDA grew 5% to $10 billion. Our results were driven by six key growth areas we have highlighted this year: our connectivity businesses, including residential broadband, wireless, and business services connectivity; our theme parks; streaming and premium content; and our studios. Together, these growth areas generated more than half of our total company revenue in the quarter and grew at a high-single digit rate over the past 12 months. The growth in these areas, which on the whole are margin accretive, coupled with disciplined cost management drove our EBITDA growth and contributed to our adjusted earnings per share increasing 13% to $1.08.  Last, we generated $4 billion of free cash flow, while returning $4.7 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. Now let's turn to our individual business results, starting on slide 5 with Connectivity & Platforms. As a reminder, our largest foreign exchange exposure is the British pound, which was up nearly 8% year-over-year. So in order to highlight the underlying performance of the business, I will refer to year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis. Revenue for total Connectivity & Platforms was flat at $20.3 billion. Our core connectivity businesses \u2013 domestic broadband, domestic wireless, international connectivity, and business services connectivity \u2013 increased 7% to $11 billion in revenue, while video, advertising, and other revenue declined 6% to $10 billion in revenue.  We're focused on investing in and driving growth in high margin businesses, while protecting profitability in businesses with secular headwinds through disciplined cost management. And it's working, underscored by the 100 basis points of margin expansion for Connectivity & Platforms in the third quarter, while margins for our domestic legacy cable business improved 160 basis points to 46.6%. Getting more into the details, residential connectivity revenue was up 7.5%, reflecting 4% growth in domestic broadband, 16% growth in domestic wireless, and 25% growth in international connectivity. Business services connectivity revenue was up 5%.  Domestic broadband revenue growth continued to be driven by very strong ARPU, which grew 3.9%. Our commitment to network leadership and delivering it ubiquitously across our footprint enables customers to do more on our network. They're using more data and connecting more devices at faster speeds, which provides them with increasing value and underpins our ability to drive ARPU higher this year and beyond. At the same time, our residential broadband base remained stable, both on a year-over-year and sequential basis, with voluntary churn at record low levels for the third quarter. While back-to-school was a tailwind as expected, the broadband market remains highly competitive, particularly at the lower end.  During the quarter, we recalibrated by pulling back on some of our promotional offers targeting this segment to remain consistent with our strategy of competing aggressively, but in a financially disciplined way. This means striking what we believe to be the appropriate balance between broadband subscriber growth and ARPU growth. And as we continue to manage this balance, we expect ARPU growth to remain strong and our primary driver of broadband revenue growth with somewhat higher subscribers losses expected the fourth quarter compared to the 18,000 loss we just reported in the third quarter. We expect subscriber trends to improve over time as we remain focused on network and product leadership and also as we see the benefits of greater footprint expansion. We've grown our homes and businesses passed by 1.5% year-over-year to 62 million and we're on of pace to meet or exceed our goal of 1 million new homes and businesses passed for 2023. This is a material step-up from 2022, and we should accelerate this again in 2024. Domestic wireless revenue increased due to higher service revenue, driven by strong momentum in customer lines which were up 1.3 million or 27% year-over-year to over 6 million in total. This includes 294,000 lines we just added in the quarter. We continue to test some new converged offers, which along with the new iPhone launch should translate into accelerated line additions in the fourth quarter. With still only about 10% penetration of our domestic residential broadband customer accounts, we have a big opportunity and long runway ahead for growth in wireless. International connectivity revenue increased 25% to another record high, driven by steady mid-teens growth in broadband with the remainder driven by wireless, reflecting healthy growth in services and a particularly strong quarter of device sales. The 5% growth in business services connectivity revenue reflects stronger growth in enterprise and mid-market.  The strong revenue growth in our connectivity businesses was offset by declines in video, advertising, and other revenue. Video revenue decline was driven by continued customer losses. The lower other revenue reflects similar dynamics in wireline voice, and advertising was impacted by lower political revenue in our domestic markets, which in the fourth quarter will face an even more challenging comparison to last year. Connectivity & Platforms total EBITDA increased 3% to $8.2 billion, with adjusted margin up 100 basis points, again, driven by the mix shift to our high margin connectivity businesses, coupled with expense management.  Continuing the trends seen in the first half of the year, every line item of expense improved year-over-year except for direct product costs. These are success based and tied to the growth in our connectivity businesses. In terms of the breakout in our Connectivity & Platforms EBITDA results, residential EBITDA grew 2.4%, with margin improving 110 basis points to reach 38.4%, driven by our favorable mix shift. While business EBITDA increased 3.6%, EBITDA margin declined 60 basis points to 57.5%, reflecting investments we're making in sales capacity to drive growth in the mid-market and enterprise segments. Now let's turn to Content & Experiences on slide 6. Content & Experiences revenue increased 1% to $10.6 billion and EBITDA increased 10% to $2 billion, driven by record results at parks as well as an improvement in year-over-year Peacock EBITDA losses.  Looking at the results of each segment. I'll start with media, which combines our TV networks and Peacock, given we manage this as one portfolio. Revenue was slightly higher as strong growth in Peacock offset the challenging performance at our linear networks. Unpacking that further, domestic advertising declined 8%, reflecting softness in the linear market, partially offset by growth at Peacock, which increased nearly 40%. Domestic distribution increased 4%, driven by Peacock subscription revenue growth of nearly 90% as we continue to grow our paid subscriber base. We ended the quarter with 28 million Peacock paid subscribers compared to 16 million a year ago, with 4 million net additions in the quarter. This result was driven by continued success in converting free Comcast bundled subscribers to a paid relationship as well as organic growth driven by programming, including the start of the NFL season and having the Big Ten for the first time as well as Super Mario Bros. landing exclusively on Peacock in our Pay-One window. Media expenses were slightly lower, reflecting effective cost management in our linear networks and the timing of Premier League costs, partially offset by higher Peacock expenses. This resulted in a 6.5% increase in media EBITDA, with consistent EBITDA at our TV networks and improved year-over-year Peacock losses for the first time. As Mike noted, we believe Peacock's financial performance will continue to improve and now expect full year 2023 losses will come in at around $2.8 billion, better than our previous outlook of $3 billion. However, keep in mind that, in the fourth quarter, we expect our overall media EBITDA results to be impacted by higher sports costs, reflecting a full quarter of the contractual rate increase in our NFL programming, the addition of Big Ten to our sports programming lineup, and higher Premier League costs compared to last year when games were paused for four weeks to accommodate the timing of the World Cup. Turning to studios, Oppenheimer had a strong theatrical performance, delivering over $900 million at the box office. This success, coupled with the positive benefits from carryover titles from our strong film slate this year, resulted in EBITDA of $429 million. While this is a tough comparison to last year's third quarter, which was driven by the strong performance of both Minions: The Rise of Gru and Jurassic World: Dominion, it still ranks as one of the highest EBITDA quarters in the history of studios. At theme parks, revenue increased 17% and EBITDA increased 20% to $983 million, our highest level of EBITDA on record. Our international parks continued to experience nice rebounds post-COVID.  Leading this growths was Osaka, which benefited from strong demand from Super Nintendo World, and our park in Beijing achieved another EBITDA record, driven by increases in attendance and per capita spending.  In Hollywood, the positive consumer reaction to Super Nintendo World, which we opened earlier this year, drove strong attendance and per cap growth, helping Hollywood to deliver its best quarterly EBITDA in its history. In Orlando, our results were also strong, with attendance relatively in line with 2019 pre-pandemic levels and revenue substantially ahead.  I'll now wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on slide 7. As I mentioned previously, we generated $4 billion in free cash flow this quarter and achieved this while absorbing meaningful investments, concentrated in our domestic broadband network, footprint expansion, streaming, and theme parks.  Total capital spending increased 16%, driven by higher CapEx, which remains within the envelope of the guidance we gave at the beginning of this year, including Connectivity & Platforms CapEx intensity to remain at around 10% and parks CapEx to increase by around $1.2 billion for the full year compared to 2022. At Connectivity & Platforms, CapEx in the quarter decreased slightly to $2.1 billion, with CapEx intensity coming in at 10.3%. The year-over-year decline was due to lower spending in customer premise equipment and support capital, which more than offset the investments we are making to accelerate our growth in homes passed as well as to transition our US network to DOCSIS 4.0. Content & Experiences' CapEx increased by $270 million, driven by parks, with Epic accounting for the majority of this quarter's increase in spend.  Working capital was fairly neutral in the quarter and improved by nearly $1 billion year-over-year, with more than half of this improvement reflecting the pause in production during the work stoppages associated with the writers and actors strikes. We expect this benefit in working capital to reverse as we ramp up to our normal levels of production in the coming quarters. Turning to return of capital and our balance sheet, we repurchased $3.5 billion worth of our shares in the quarter, a step-up in our quarterly run rate relative to the first half of the year. In addition, dividend payments totaled $1.2 billion in the quarter for a total return of capital in the third quarter of $4.7 billion. We ended the quarter with net leverage of 2.3 times, in line with our target leverage.  With that, let me turn it over to Marci for Q&A.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Jason. Operator, let's open the call for Q&A, please.\nOperator: Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.\nBen Swinburne: Two questions for the team on the cable business or connectivity business. Jason, as you mentioned, expenses continue to be a nice tailwind for growth. I think investors are focused on your ability to sustain that. You've been delivering kind of low to mid-single digit EBITDA growth in connectivity. Can you keep this up with expenses as a driver over the next couple of years or do you need revenue to accelerate? Maybe just talk about the opportunity you see ahead for the company.  And then, I'm just wondering, you teased it a little bit with the iPhone commentary, but what's the thought process around getting more aggressive in wireless? Do you want to avoid pressuring financials at all? Because it would seem like wireless and the ability \u2013 the potential for wireless to bring broadband growth up to higher levels has got to be something you guys are thinking about. So, love to just hear your considerations on that front. Thank you.\nJason Armstrong: It's Jason. Let me start with the margin and expense question on the connectivity side. I think you're right, we've been sort of consistently expanding margins. A large part of that is we had yet another quarter, as we mentioned in the upfront remarks, where every expense line item went backwards or declined year-over-year, which is a positive outside of direct network costs. And just as a reminder, those are costs that directly feed into our key growth businesses like broadband and wireless. So as we look forward, I think the construct is, and you sort of laid this out appropriately, we've got several revenue growth drivers within our connectivity business, namely residential broadband, wireless, and business services, and those are the higher margin businesses within all of Connectivity & Platforms. So the mix shift that we're seeing and undergoing, where those are the businesses that are growing against businesses that are not growing, has been a favorable mix shift for us and we expect it to continue to be a favorable mix shift. So I would look for continued opportunities in both expense and margin.\nMichael Cavanagh: And I would just add \u2013 it's Mike, Ben \u2013 that on the other part \u2013 as Jason has pointed out, the six growth driver businesses, the cable \u2013 components of that are all high incremental margin next dollar revenue, very high incremental margin, but there's also the businesses that are \u2013 as we've talked about, are not in the six growth drivers that are being managed pretty aggressively, frankly, for continued ways to find efficiencies to offset the pressures on the top line. So we've got multiple things going on that I think are the tailwinds for continued ability to drive margins.\nDavid Watson: Ben, this is Dave. So \u2013 and as both Jason and Mike said, it does start when you talk about margins with the top line, and so a real focus around healthy ARPU, total revenue growth in connectivity, so all of those things really I think are sustainable.  And you go through a competitive phase like we are, but you've still got to keep your eye on the ball and we believe that, over time, in addition to driving good, healthy, making financially disciplined calls along the way, we will return to subscriber growth over time. And so, I think you add all that up, it's \u2013 that's the beginning part. Then your question on mobile, it's such an important part of our strategy and it has been. We've built up the business, had consistent performance, and believe strongly we've got a long runway ahead.  And one of the things that we're doing just to showcase kind of the focus for us is we are rolling out a buy one, get one offer. It's scaled up at the very end of Q3. It's really kicking off in earnest in Q4. It's a straightforward, good, solid offer that will be accretive and will drive broadband benefits in doing so. We're starting with the base and that's \u2013 but it's just an example that in both residential and in small business, we'll continue to be very \u2013 I think very aggressive in mobile over time. So a lot more to come on mobile, but we're encouraged and really like the runway ahead. Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson.\nCraig Moffett: I'm going to go to a different place, actually. Xumo, and maybe, Brian, if you could talk a little about this from a high level kind of strategic point of view. There's been a lot of talk about the prospect for streaming services being rebundled into something that maybe is in some ways closer to what we used to have in the video world. I wonder if you could just talk about that a little bit and talk about how Xumo might fit into that and whether you think Xumo has the potential to actually become a meaningful part of your Connectivity & Platforms business.\nBrian Roberts: Great question. We're really excited about Xumo and the progress that we've made \u2013 we're making together now with Charter, and it's an amazing platform that started with X1, but now will be in televisions, it will be in devices, and it will be all over the nation and frankly all over the world.  The heart and soul of it is our entertainment operating system which is global that includes Sky, all of Canada, Cox, and a number of other distributors that we now gradually build up to, all be helping to finance and help the innovation roadmap. So what is that innovation roadmap? It's really like you're suggesting, what do customers really want? They want a great platform, a great pipe. There want world-class content that they customize. And they want someone to make it really simple for them and do the heavy lifting as you bounce in between services, and that is what we really built our company on all these years and this industry on.  So it is somewhat ironic that we've unbundled to rebundle to unbundle to rebundle and everybody has a different version of that and we're at a moment in time, but a lot of it is having one great platform that now the entire industry has and thankfully all of you on this phone who do not live in a Comcast market, which is many, are now soon going to be able to get these products, talk to your voice remote, and see how fantastic the experience is, whether you buy the cable bundle or not. And that's a big point. As most of our sales now are broadband only, we want to make sure we are the best aggregator for streaming. And then a logical next step will be us or others beginning to try to make it even easier for consumers to purchase and to switch packages. So it's an important part of the roadmap and this was a big week in the Charter announcement. And I'm sure, in their call, they'll talk about their commitment to the JV as well. Operator: Next question is coming from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan.\nPhil Cusick: A couple for Dave. Dave, I think you said that you expect to get back to broadband growth over time, and as you expand the number of houses that you're building, as Jason mentioned, I expect that that's probably part of it. But can you talk about the contribution of that low end effort that you started? You mentioned on the first quarter call and the level of reversal that you're doing here as well as recent competition from fiber and fixed wireless.  And then second, if you can just talk about where wireless is right now, how the CBRS trials are going in Philadelphia, and any thoughts on timing to expand that. Thanks very much.\nDavid Watson: You got it, Phil. So as we've said, and it's \u2013 everybody has seen, it's a pretty competitive environment. And so, when you \u2013 we have some continuation of some of the macro issues that we talked about, but we've also \u2013 as you brought up, we've also continued to see the expansion of both fiber and fixed wireless footprint. So we've gone through several competitive cycles where there's \u2013 it's really noted by a lot of new footprint that's been added, and so we did start in the beginning of the year, made some adjustments in terms of offers that were really focused more on the lower end of the market, but part of our game plan is to \u2013 we're going to continue to invest in a better network, better products, and compete aggressively, but we're going to maintain financial discipline, and that means making certain decisions when it comes to balancing rate and volume. And so, after the first half, we did make the decision to pull back on some of our more aggressive offers which resulted in lower connect activity. So that is the changes that we've had. I think our voluntary churn rate is very healthy. A key part of that that's continued and the real issue that we see at this point is, as we manage things, is just lower connect volume. So \u2013 but, net-net, we're growing revenue as we talked about earlier, Jason did and I did, and we're going to focus on multiple drivers of revenue growth. And we'll make our playbook, we make changes throughout.  So \u2013 and then to wireless, your point, we are continuing to test in terms of the CBRS roll-offs where we've picked up the pace on that, staying close to what Charter is doing. We've seen good progress in the ability to off-load traffic and encouraged by the opportunity in terms of just such a small geographic part of your footprint contributes so much volume of wireless traffic. So we are in position, if we so choose to do it, but we like where we're at with that, no new news in terms of scaling up on that point, but we're in a good position.  Operator: Our next question is coming from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America Securities.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: I have two topics. One is sports and one's advertising. On sports, it's such a key differentiator in content. Can you just talk about your longer term sports strategy and how you believe sports will be distributed in the future? You talked about more going direct-to-consumer. What role will linear play as we look ahead three to five years, and how would you respond to the leagues, whether NBA or NFL, et cetera, investing in ESPN?  And then on advertising, there seems to be weakness across the board, cable and media, which is in line I'm sure with the rest of the industry. But there seems to be strength in the industry in digital whether it's Google or Meta. How are you as a company/industry addressing that? How do you get dollars back?\nBrian Roberts: Okay. Well, this is Brian. Let me start and kick it over to Mike because I think your industry question on sports is really profound and important. I think our company has had a long, deep, rich history in sports, both parts of the company. The best way to consume an NFL game or the Olympics is to have our entertainment operating system I just talked about in Craig's question, and you'll see that in the Olympics. There will be nothing like it. The same goes for I think NBC Sports which is the number one show in television on Sunday Night Football. We've got a great team and a culture of big events, whether it goes from the Kentucky Derby, which the ratings are much higher when it's been on NBC than any previous platform, and then on and on.  And with Peacock now, we have the most live sports of any of the streaming services. And I believe that that's a surprise to many people when they learn that and believe that to be the case, and that's a commitment we made when we had things like English Premier League or Tour de France or golf or events that went on for longer periods of time than were typically on a network where you wanted more camera angles or more feeds and more games, and that sets us up for being relevant in the transition that we're all talking about. How do we go from analog to digital in a way that helps the leagues?  And so, yeah, I can't speculate on what might happen to ESPN, but what I could speculate is we meet with the leagues which we do frequently, we think we present a somewhat unique ability to help get the maximum engagement now with broadcast and cable, particularly our broadcast platform, as well as having a robust streaming service and a super quarter here regarding the kind of momentum that we've garnered. A lot of that is driven by sports on Peacock. And that sets you up to answer your advertising question, which I'll let Mike go into a bit, but at the highest level, we're creating the digital capability on Peacock in the most relevant content. That looks like a very winning combination for us as a strategy.\nMichael Cavanagh: And I'll just add on that. It's Mike. I'll just add that the importance and the significance of us being committed to sports in the streaming context of Peacock is for us combined with the ability to bring the big reach that our broadcaster NBC brings to the party, which I think is an important element of \u2013 while sports over the long term I think are going to be experienced significantly through streaming, I think for a long time, the economics of the sports rights that you see is going to be substantially supported by broadcast reach that I think for a long time is going to continue to be a significant part of the picture. In terms of advertising, I'd say, Jessica, that overall it's not a big difference in story than last quarter. I'd say the ad market has remained soft. It hasn't necessarily gotten worse despite a little bit of sequential decline, but it hasn't gotten better at the same time. And we still continue to think it's due to the general uncertainty about economic conditions that are out there. The kind of weakness that we're talking about or the softness is particularly on the linear side, while Peacock has remained very strong. Picking at this quarter a little bit, the deceleration from 5% to 8%, contributing factor there which is a little idiosyncratic is, while the retail and tech sectors were down a little bit, whereas auto and pharma and consumer products were up. The one that was down that's a little unique and idiosyncratic is entertainment where you had streamers spending a little less together with advertisers, given the strikes, looking at what the lineups were in the recent past and putting some money in other places. So some of that will revert we believe once strikes are over. And as we look to the fourth [Technical Difficulty] last year's World Cup as well as political that underlying ad sales will be an improvement in this fourth quarter versus last year's fourth quarter. And as far as digital, I think that's why there is definitely the opportunity that some tech competitors are capturing to get premium video monetized in digital platforms, and I think that speaks to why we consider Peacock to be an important initiative for us. And we're pleased again with the progress we're making in Peacock which is now north of 28 million subs and strong overall 60% revenue growth year-over-year.\nBrian Roberts: One last point I just wanted to add that one of the great things about sports that we're very excited about is streaming sports and what that means for our broadband network strategy that Dave was just talking about. Dave and the team I think have found a great balance in how we're running the operation, but a big part of that is a commitment and a belief that we see all sports finding a way over the next many years or maybe not so many years to be more and more streamed, and that's going to require more bandwidth and that's going to require and create an opportunity for us to have the superior product in the market.  So that's our strategy, and so sports really, back to your first question, Jessica, is at the heart and soul of a lot of what we do. Operator: Our next question is coming from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs.\nBrett Feldman: I've got two questions about your business connectivity segment. The first is you made some comments about investments you're making to better address the enterprise customer demographic. I think the assumption has been, historically, it's not been a focus for you because serving that demo generally requires you to serve customers with locations outside of your footprint. So I was curious to hear a little more about your strategy for scaling up there, and I'm wondering whether that might involve making incremental investments in your connectivity platform outside of your region, either organically or potentially making some acquisitions.  And then second, I was hoping you could give us an update on the extent to which the business segment is contributing to your success in wireless. Is it kind of pacing what you're seeing in the residential space, or do you think you have more opportunity there? Thank you.\nDavid Watson: Hey, Brett, Dave. So let me start. Overall, business services had a very good quarter. Revenue accelerated a little, reflecting stronger growth in enterprise and mid-market, so we've been very focused on growing all categories.  So your point on the sales investment, let me provide some context. We have been for some time working with partners. And most certainly, with the acquisition of Masergy, we've been expanding our capability to go into other areas and now we have global opportunity to be able to handle customers. The key here is to be able to take care of customers' needs wherever they are, so this particular investment is just adding some folks, it's not infrastructure that we're building out there. We will leverage the partnerships that we have, but certainly we'll deliver products that meets the customers' needs out. But it's sales force and adding some people that can drive mid-market and enterprise where the customers' locations are. But we'll continue to partner, we have great partnerships with Charter, Cox, many others, and we'll continue to do that. It's not really an infrastructure moment. And in terms of wireless, it's a very important part of business services and it's \u2013 clearly, this phase is centered on SMB and we're getting going on that. We've picked up the pace on that. It's not a major driver yet in overall mobile activity at this point, but we expect that pace to pick up. That is an important one for us. And let me \u2013 just one last point, if I could, Brett. While you're talking about business services, I'd be remiss if I didn't thank Bill Stemper as he transitions to Chairman Emeritus. Bill has been a spectacular teammate and driver of this business over a long stretch, really. And one of the great things that Bill did is build a world class team. I think they've set the bar in terms of performance. We continue to do that. And part of that team is a wonderful executive, Ed Zimmerman, who has now taken over the \u2013 running business services for us, so congratulations to both. Operator: Our next question is coming from John Hodulik from UBS.\nJohn Hodulik: Two, if I could. First of all, and maybe for Dave, can I just get your thoughts on the Charter approach to the Disney renewal? Do you see Comcast heading in that direction, or do you see benefits for the industry and for linear TV if the industry does move in that direction? And then following up on some of your comments on the broadband side, you guys are rolling out DOCSIS 4.0, you're starting to sign up customers. I guess, one, could you just update us on the timing of that rollout? And two, do you see it more as an ARPU opportunity or a sub opportunity, subscriber growth opportunity?  I guess lastly on that, you said there's more competition at the low end of the broadband market. Is there any way you could quantify either Comcast's exposure to the low end or how big the low end of the market in broadband is? Thanks.\nDavid Watson: I think Mike and Brian talked about Charter Disney, so that to me \u2013 I think that is the \u2013 they provided the point of view. From my perspective, I think every situation is unique. I think we are in a very unique position because of the platform that we have and the fact that we are in the streaming business as a company, that we have great relationships with content providers and we have a way of figuring things out. But it will be case by case as they come up and we'll see \u2013 but a big part of it, one of the things we talked about is value, value of the content and how that model evolves, we'll figure it out. But I think we are in a good position to be a bridge builder as we go, consider each one of these options in the marketplace. In terms of the network and DOCSIS, let me give you a sense, John, where we're at. So we're about 30% in terms of mid-splits and really focused on this seamless integration that connects HFC to fiber. And we'll be at 40% next year.  So \u2013 and then we started \u2013 you've seen the announcement and we talked about the deployment of DOCSIS 4.0 [Technical Difficulty] and so we're going to continue to drive the mid-split upgrade areas. DOCSIS 4.0 follows that mid-split trajectory. And that is our focus, continued focus is just providing leadership of where the market's going.  The reason why, to answer your question, in terms of where do we see the benefits, it's that point, that the market is going to continue, whether it's the sports discussion we talked about earlier, as more and more things start to perhaps go to streaming, there will be more simultaneous contention at peak moments and we're in a great position with the networks. So having that, the ability to have faster speeds, ubiquitous network coverage at scale, the most efficient network and effectively delivering, we've got [Technical Difficulty] customers that are 1 gig today, 70% of our customers are 400 megabits or higher, and we see where things are going. So I think the answer is both. I think, over time, it's customer relationship as it's going to become increasingly harder for some of the competition to keep up in terms of \u2013 they have to make network trade-offs in fixed wireless, in particular, and so that to me is both rate and volume.  And on \u2013 the last point is just on the lower end, it was a lot of activity in the lower end. We did respond in the first quarter but made adjustments for the second half, so that \u2013 I talked about that.\nBrian Roberts: I would just say on the Charter and Disney, what I think it was in sort of the first question I answered, we think there's a \u2013 echo what Dave said, not one size fits all, very glad, happy for both companies that they figured something out. Good for consumers. Each situation is slightly different. What I think is important for us is finding a way to help our customers have a great network, aggregate that content, and have access to the great content, and I think we're really well positioned to do that and we're looking forward to executing upon that. Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street. Your line is now live.\nJonathan Chaplin: Maybe for Dave, just a small question following on from Phil's. In terms of the CBRS trials, is the benefit that you're seeing there that you're sort of more enthusiastic about primarily on the cost side from being able to off-load traffic, or is there a product benefit as well?  And then with the sale of the 600 megahertz spectrum, does that sort of suggest that you're not really interested in owning any spectrum besides 600 megahertz, or was there some sort of something \u2013 sorry, besides CBRS, was there something specific about 600 megahertz in the portfolio that you had that made it non-strategic?  And then if you can give us just a quick update on where your sort of average usage is on broadband, that would be helpful as well. Thanks.\nDavid Watson: So in terms of CBRS, it's what I said before that we're in position \u2013 it's an option for us. We're in a good position and we like our \u2013 where we're at with our current deal, the MVNO, capital light approach, everything that we talked about is consistent.  But we've always been very interested \u2013 and the benefit of CBRS is on the cost side, and that if you have \u2013 again, 3% of your geographic footprint that's delivering 60% of the traffic, that's a good option and if we can figure out how to do that. So we're \u2013 that's what's really driving it. And \u2013 but we've always been very focused on how to build a better overall wireless experience. We have I think great Wi-Fi capability in addition to CBRS if that's something we want to do. But the key for CBRS is that we just want to be in position and doing it without a massive amount of CapEx to be able to deliver that smaller geographic area. And in regards to 600 megahertz, it's just a \u2013 it was an opportunity to get value for areas of the country outside of our areas and it just made sense to \u2013 it was a good transaction for us and not something that we're going to build outside of our footprint. Operator: Our final question today is coming from Steven Cahall from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nSteven Cahall: So just first on the residential broadband ARPU, wondering if you could unpack a little bit of the sequential change? I know the big components are double play going to single play from cord cutting as well as just tiering and pricing, so with a little bit of slowdown sequentially. Should we attribute a lot of that to the slowdown in video losses that you saw, or anything else going on in there?  And then, Brian, you talked a lot about how effectively you've deleveraged the balance sheet, taking down by a full turn over the last couple of years. Also that a lot of your competitors, especially on the media side, are going to be more challenged. So I know you'll be disciplined in anything that you do, but as you look ahead and think about competing against some companies that aren't challenged, like Netflix and Apple and Amazon, how do you think about some of the availability of some of those distressed content creators that might be out there at some future point? Thank you.\nDavid Watson: Let me start, Steven. This is Dave. The biggest driver in terms of ARPU was that, the first half of the year, our focus \u2013 we did make adjustments in that first part of the year about being a little bit more aggressive in the lower end. This resulted in a mix shift among new customers that were coming on and this caused the deceleration in ARPU growth from where we were before at 4.5% to 3.9%. The 3.9% is still very strong ARPU growth and consistent with our planning and what we were talking about. So that was really the biggest driver.  Some certainly benefit over time to a little bit better performance in the video business with NOW TV, which is beginning to pick up the pace. So pleased with that. But it was mostly that refinement of the lower end offers, and you're not going to see that, by the way, that level of deceleration from Q3 to Q4 as we made those adjustments. So that \u2013 it's mostly the tier mix change that I talked about.\nJason Armstrong: Steven, I would add on to that, just if you look at the historical context here, we've typically grown broadband ARPU 3% to 4% in any given year. We've been operating at the very high end of that for the first three-quarters this year. Things that contribute to that over the long term, you mentioned sort of the tactical components of that that really, really \u2013 we want to see broadband usage growth, we want to see customers hanging more devices off their network, we want to see them taking higher speeds, and that's exactly what they're doing. So those are sort of the foundational pillars for driving ARPU growth over time, and that's exactly what we're seeing.\nBrian Roberts: This is Brian. I actually will let Mike answer because he did such a great job in his old job as CFO in helping put our balance sheet in this enviable position that he described in his opening or comments about how long the debt is and some of the interest rates. We have a great business this quarter, another demonstration of it. The start to the year is fantastic. But, Mike, why don't you \u2013 so therefore, the bar is very high to do anything other than the plan we've got and we like the company but, Mike, why don't you go into your thoughts on that content question specifically.\nMichael Cavanagh: So I think if you zoom out, it's much of what I said earlier, Steven, which is I think the strength of our financial position broadly, if you think about across all the businesses we're in, I think of us as having leading positions for the customer but also strong margins benchmarked against any period you can look at, that together with the strong balance sheet, I think the company couldn't be in better shape financially.  And I think on the execution side, Dave and his team and the NBC team that works with me are \u2013 they know what they're doing and I think we're not giving anybody any quarter in terms of operating the businesses we have. Our priorities, though, in how to use that financial strength is very strategic. So I think we think about the businesses we're in and investing in them appropriately for return and growth and drive growth in those businesses over the long term, hence the way Jason talks about the half the company that's got strong revenue growth. We're trying to find ways to put resources into our own businesses. So that's the priority. As Brian said, the bar is really high for us to consider anything inorganic, but it's our job to look at these things. But if you think about \u2013 what you call the potentially distressed media assets, I'm not sure which ones you're referring to, but many of them are pretty small and wouldn't change the arc of what our company's all about. So I think our focus is on the total picture what Comcast looks like and we're proud of the company we have.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Steve. That concludes our call. I want to thank everyone for joining us. Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's question-and-answer session and today's conference call. A replay of the call will be available starting at 11:30 am Eastern Time today on Comcast's Investor Relations website. Thank you for participating. You may now all disconnect.",

So \u2013 and as both Jason and Mike said, it does start when you talk about margins with the top line, and so a real focus around healthy ARPU, total revenue growth in connectivity, so all of those things really I think are sustainable.  And you go through a competitive phase like we are, but you've still got to keep your eye on the ball and we believe that, over time, in addition to driving good, healthy, making financially disciplined calls along the way, we will return to subscriber growth over time. And so, I think you add all that up, it's \u2013 that's the beginning part. Then your question on mobile, it's such an important part of our strategy and it has been.

We're starting with the base and that's \u2013 but it's just an example that in both residential and in small business, we'll continue to be very \u2013 I think very aggressive in mobile over time. So a lot more to come on mobile, but we're encouraged and really like the runway ahead. Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. You got it, Phil. So as we've said, and it's \u2013 everybody has seen, it's a pretty competitive environment. And so, when you \u2013 we have some continuation of some of the macro issues that we talked about, but we've also \u2013 as you brought up, we've also continued to see the expansion of both fiber and fixed wireless footprint. So we've gone through several competitive cycles where there's \u2013 it's really noted by a lot of new footprint that's been added, and so we did start in the beginning of the year, made some adjustments in terms of offers that were really focused more on the lower end of the market, but part of our game plan is to \u2013 we're going to continue to invest in a better network, better products, and compete aggressively, but we're going to maintain financial discipline, and that means making certain decisions when it comes to balancing rate and volume. And so, after the first half, we did make the decision to pull back on some of our more aggressive offers which resulted in lower connect activity. So that is the changes that we've had. I think our voluntary churn rate is very healthy. A key part of that that's continued and the real issue that we see at this point is, as we manage things, is just lower connect volume. So \u2013 but, net-net, we're growing revenue as we talked about earlier, Jason did and I did, and we're going to focus on multiple drivers of revenue growth. And we'll make our playbook, we make changes throughout.  So \u2013 and then to wireless, your point, we are continuing to test in terms of the CBRS roll-offs where we've picked up the pace on that, staying close to what Charter is doing. We've seen good progress in the ability to off-load traffic and encouraged by the opportunity in terms of just such a small geographic part of your footprint contributes so much volume of wireless traffic. So we are in position, if we so choose to do it, but we like where we're at with that, no new news in terms of scaling up on that point, but we're in a good position.  Operator: Our next question is coming from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America Securities. Hey, Brett, Dave. So let me start. Overall, business services had a very good quarter. Revenue accelerated a little, reflecting stronger growth in enterprise and mid-market, so we've been very focused on growing all categories.  So your point on the sales investment, let me provide some context. We have been for some time working with partners. And most certainly, with the acquisition of Masergy, we've been expanding our capability to go into other areas and now we have global opportunity to be able to handle customers. The key here is to be able to take care of customers' needs wherever they are, so this particular investment is just adding some folks, it's not infrastructure that we're building out there. We will leverage the partnerships that we have, but certainly we'll deliver products that meets the customers' needs out. But it's sales force and adding some people that can drive mid-market and enterprise where the customers' locations are. But we'll continue to partner, we have great partnerships with Charter, Cox, many others, and we'll continue to do that. It's not really an infrastructure moment. And in terms of wireless, it's a very important part of business services and it's \u2013 clearly, this phase is centered on SMB and we're getting going on that. We've picked up the pace on that. It's not a major driver yet in overall mobile activity at this point, but we expect that pace to pick up. That is an important one for us. And let me \u2013 just one last point, if I could, Brett. While you're talking about business services, I'd be remiss if I didn't thank Bill Stemper as he transitions to Chairman Emeritus. Bill has been a spectacular teammate and driver of this business over a long stretch, really. And one of the great things that Bill did is build a world class team. I think they've set the bar in terms of performance. We continue to do that. And part of that team is a wonderful executive, Ed Zimmerman, who has now taken over the \u2013 running business services for us, so congratulations to both. Operator: Our next question is coming from John Hodulik from UBS. I think Mike and Brian talked about Charter Disney, so that to me \u2013 I think that is the \u2013 they provided the point of view. From my perspective, I think every situation is unique. I think we are in a very unique position because of the platform that we have and the fact that we are in the streaming business as a company, that we have great relationships with content providers and we have a way of figuring things out. But it will be case by case as they come up and we'll see \u2013 but a big part of it, one of the things we talked about is value, value of the content and how that model evolves, we'll figure it out. But I think we are in a good position to be a bridge builder as we go, consider each one of these options in the marketplace. In terms of the network and DOCSIS, let me give you a sense, John, where we're at. So we're about 30% in terms of mid-splits and really focused on this seamless integration that connects HFC to fiber. And we'll be at 40% next year.  So \u2013 and then we started \u2013 you've seen the announcement and we talked about the deployment of DOCSIS 4.0 [Technical Difficulty] and so we're going to continue to drive the mid-split upgrade areas. DOCSIS 4.0 follows that mid-split trajectory. And that is our focus, continued focus is just providing leadership of where the market's going.  The reason why, to answer your question, in terms of where do we see the benefits, it's that point, that the market is going to continue, whether it's the sports discussion we talked about earlier, as more and more things start to perhaps go to streaming, there will be more simultaneous contention at peak moments and we're in a great position with the networks. So having that, the ability to have faster speeds, ubiquitous network coverage at scale, the most efficient network and effectively delivering, we've got [Technical Difficulty] customers that are 1 gig today, 70% of our customers are 400 megabits or higher, and we see where things are going. So I think the answer is both. I think, over time, it's customer relationship as it's going to become increasingly harder for some of the competition to keep up in terms of \u2013 they have to make network trade-offs in fixed wireless, in particular, and so that to me is both rate and volume.  And on \u2013 the last point is just on the lower end, it was a lot of activity in the lower end. We did respond in the first quarter but made adjustments for the second half, so that \u2013 I talked about that. So in terms of CBRS, it's what I said before that we're in position \u2013 it's an option for us. We're in a good position and we like our \u2013 where we're at with our current deal, the MVNO, capital light approach, everything that we talked about is consistent.  But we've always been very interested \u2013 and the benefit of CBRS is on the cost side, and that if you have \u2013 again, 3% of your geographic footprint that's delivering 60% of the traffic, that's a good option and if we can figure out how to do that. So we're \u2013 that's what's really driving it. And \u2013 but we've always been very focused on how to build a better overall wireless experience. We have I think great Wi-Fi capability in addition to CBRS if that's something we want to do. But the key for CBRS is that we just want to be in position and doing it without a massive amount of CapEx to be able to deliver that smaller geographic area. And in regards to 600 megahertz, it's just a \u2013 it was an opportunity to get value for areas of the country outside of our areas and it just made sense to \u2013 it was a good transaction for us and not something that we're going to build outside of our footprint. Operator: Our final question today is coming from Steven Cahall from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Let me start, Steven. This is Dave. The biggest driver in terms of ARPU was that, the first half of the year, our focus \u2013 we did make adjustments in that first part of the year about being a little bit more aggressive in the lower end. This resulted in a mix shift among new customers that were coming on and this caused the deceleration in ARPU growth from where we were before at 4.5% to 3.9%. The 3.9% is still very strong ARPU growth and consistent with our planning and what we were talking about. So that was really the biggest driver.  Some certainly benefit over time to a little bit better performance in the video business with NOW TV, which is beginning to pick up the pace. So pleased with that. But it was mostly that refinement of the lower end offers, and you're not going to see that, by the way, that level of deceleration from Q3 to Q4 as we made those adjustments. So that \u2013 it's mostly the tier mix change that I talked about."

            "name": "Jason Armstrong",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. And good morning, everyone. I'll take you through our strong third quarter and we'll begin with our consolidated financials on slide 4. Revenue increased 1% to $30.1 billion, while adjusted EBITDA grew 5% to $10 billion. Our results were driven by six key growth areas we have highlighted this year: our connectivity businesses, including residential broadband, wireless, and business services connectivity; our theme parks; streaming and premium content; and our studios. Together, these growth areas generated more than half of our total company revenue in the quarter and grew at a high-single digit rate over the past 12 months. The growth in these areas, which on the whole are margin accretive, coupled with disciplined cost management drove our EBITDA growth and contributed to our adjusted earnings per share increasing 13% to $1.08.  Last, we generated $4 billion of free cash flow, while returning $4.7 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. Now let's turn to our individual business results, starting on slide 5 with Connectivity & Platforms. As a reminder, our largest foreign exchange exposure is the British pound, which was up nearly 8% year-over-year. So in order to highlight the underlying performance of the business, I will refer to year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis. Revenue for total Connectivity & Platforms was flat at $20.3 billion. Our core connectivity businesses \u2013 domestic broadband, domestic wireless, international connectivity, and business services connectivity \u2013 increased 7% to $11 billion in revenue, while video, advertising, and other revenue declined 6% to $10 billion in revenue.  We're focused on investing in and driving growth in high margin businesses, while protecting profitability in businesses with secular headwinds through disciplined cost management. And it's working, underscored by the 100 basis points of margin expansion for Connectivity & Platforms in the third quarter, while margins for our domestic legacy cable business improved 160 basis points to 46.6%. Getting more into the details, residential connectivity revenue was up 7.5%, reflecting 4% growth in domestic broadband, 16% growth in domestic wireless, and 25% growth in international connectivity. Business services connectivity revenue was up 5%.  Domestic broadband revenue growth continued to be driven by very strong ARPU, which grew 3.9%. Our commitment to network leadership and delivering it ubiquitously across our footprint enables customers to do more on our network. They're using more data and connecting more devices at faster speeds, which provides them with increasing value and underpins our ability to drive ARPU higher this year and beyond. At the same time, our residential broadband base remained stable, both on a year-over-year and sequential basis, with voluntary churn at record low levels for the third quarter. While back-to-school was a tailwind as expected, the broadband market remains highly competitive, particularly at the lower end.  During the quarter, we recalibrated by pulling back on some of our promotional offers targeting this segment to remain consistent with our strategy of competing aggressively, but in a financially disciplined way. This means striking what we believe to be the appropriate balance between broadband subscriber growth and ARPU growth. And as we continue to manage this balance, we expect ARPU growth to remain strong and our primary driver of broadband revenue growth with somewhat higher subscribers losses expected the fourth quarter compared to the 18,000 loss we just reported in the third quarter. We expect subscriber trends to improve over time as we remain focused on network and product leadership and also as we see the benefits of greater footprint expansion. We've grown our homes and businesses passed by 1.5% year-over-year to 62 million and we're on of pace to meet or exceed our goal of 1 million new homes and businesses passed for 2023. This is a material step-up from 2022, and we should accelerate this again in 2024. Domestic wireless revenue increased due to higher service revenue, driven by strong momentum in customer lines which were up 1.3 million or 27% year-over-year to over 6 million in total. This includes 294,000 lines we just added in the quarter. We continue to test some new converged offers, which along with the new iPhone launch should translate into accelerated line additions in the fourth quarter. With still only about 10% penetration of our domestic residential broadband customer accounts, we have a big opportunity and long runway ahead for growth in wireless. International connectivity revenue increased 25% to another record high, driven by steady mid-teens growth in broadband with the remainder driven by wireless, reflecting healthy growth in services and a particularly strong quarter of device sales. The 5% growth in business services connectivity revenue reflects stronger growth in enterprise and mid-market.  The strong revenue growth in our connectivity businesses was offset by declines in video, advertising, and other revenue. Video revenue decline was driven by continued customer losses. The lower other revenue reflects similar dynamics in wireline voice, and advertising was impacted by lower political revenue in our domestic markets, which in the fourth quarter will face an even more challenging comparison to last year. Connectivity & Platforms total EBITDA increased 3% to $8.2 billion, with adjusted margin up 100 basis points, again, driven by the mix shift to our high margin connectivity businesses, coupled with expense management.  Continuing the trends seen in the first half of the year, every line item of expense improved year-over-year except for direct product costs. These are success based and tied to the growth in our connectivity businesses. In terms of the breakout in our Connectivity & Platforms EBITDA results, residential EBITDA grew 2.4%, with margin improving 110 basis points to reach 38.4%, driven by our favorable mix shift. While business EBITDA increased 3.6%, EBITDA margin declined 60 basis points to 57.5%, reflecting investments we're making in sales capacity to drive growth in the mid-market and enterprise segments. Now let's turn to Content & Experiences on slide 6. Content & Experiences revenue increased 1% to $10.6 billion and EBITDA increased 10% to $2 billion, driven by record results at parks as well as an improvement in year-over-year Peacock EBITDA losses.  Looking at the results of each segment. I'll start with media, which combines our TV networks and Peacock, given we manage this as one portfolio. Revenue was slightly higher as strong growth in Peacock offset the challenging performance at our linear networks. Unpacking that further, domestic advertising declined 8%, reflecting softness in the linear market, partially offset by growth at Peacock, which increased nearly 40%. Domestic distribution increased 4%, driven by Peacock subscription revenue growth of nearly 90% as we continue to grow our paid subscriber base. We ended the quarter with 28 million Peacock paid subscribers compared to 16 million a year ago, with 4 million net additions in the quarter. This result was driven by continued success in converting free Comcast bundled subscribers to a paid relationship as well as organic growth driven by programming, including the start of the NFL season and having the Big Ten for the first time as well as Super Mario Bros. landing exclusively on Peacock in our Pay-One window. Media expenses were slightly lower, reflecting effective cost management in our linear networks and the timing of Premier League costs, partially offset by higher Peacock expenses. This resulted in a 6.5% increase in media EBITDA, with consistent EBITDA at our TV networks and improved year-over-year Peacock losses for the first time. As Mike noted, we believe Peacock's financial performance will continue to improve and now expect full year 2023 losses will come in at around $2.8 billion, better than our previous outlook of $3 billion. However, keep in mind that, in the fourth quarter, we expect our overall media EBITDA results to be impacted by higher sports costs, reflecting a full quarter of the contractual rate increase in our NFL programming, the addition of Big Ten to our sports programming lineup, and higher Premier League costs compared to last year when games were paused for four weeks to accommodate the timing of the World Cup. Turning to studios, Oppenheimer had a strong theatrical performance, delivering over $900 million at the box office. This success, coupled with the positive benefits from carryover titles from our strong film slate this year, resulted in EBITDA of $429 million. While this is a tough comparison to last year's third quarter, which was driven by the strong performance of both Minions: The Rise of Gru and Jurassic World: Dominion, it still ranks as one of the highest EBITDA quarters in the history of studios. At theme parks, revenue increased 17% and EBITDA increased 20% to $983 million, our highest level of EBITDA on record. Our international parks continued to experience nice rebounds post-COVID.  Leading this growths was Osaka, which benefited from strong demand from Super Nintendo World, and our park in Beijing achieved another EBITDA record, driven by increases in attendance and per capita spending.  In Hollywood, the positive consumer reaction to Super Nintendo World, which we opened earlier this year, drove strong attendance and per cap growth, helping Hollywood to deliver its best quarterly EBITDA in its history. In Orlando, our results were also strong, with attendance relatively in line with 2019 pre-pandemic levels and revenue substantially ahead.  I'll now wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on slide 7. As I mentioned previously, we generated $4 billion in free cash flow this quarter and achieved this while absorbing meaningful investments, concentrated in our domestic broadband network, footprint expansion, streaming, and theme parks.  Total capital spending increased 16%, driven by higher CapEx, which remains within the envelope of the guidance we gave at the beginning of this year, including Connectivity & Platforms CapEx intensity to remain at around 10% and parks CapEx to increase by around $1.2 billion for the full year compared to 2022. At Connectivity & Platforms, CapEx in the quarter decreased slightly to $2.1 billion, with CapEx intensity coming in at 10.3%. The year-over-year decline was due to lower spending in customer premise equipment and support capital, which more than offset the investments we are making to accelerate our growth in homes passed as well as to transition our US network to DOCSIS 4.0. Content & Experiences' CapEx increased by $270 million, driven by parks, with Epic accounting for the majority of this quarter's increase in spend.  Working capital was fairly neutral in the quarter and improved by nearly $1 billion year-over-year, with more than half of this improvement reflecting the pause in production during the work stoppages associated with the writers and actors strikes. We expect this benefit in working capital to reverse as we ramp up to our normal levels of production in the coming quarters. Turning to return of capital and our balance sheet, we repurchased $3.5 billion worth of our shares in the quarter, a step-up in our quarterly run rate relative to the first half of the year. In addition, dividend payments totaled $1.2 billion in the quarter for a total return of capital in the third quarter of $4.7 billion. We ended the quarter with net leverage of 2.3 times, in line with our target leverage.  With that, let me turn it over to Marci for Q&A. It's Jason. Let me start with the margin and expense question on the connectivity side. I think you're right, we've been sort of consistently expanding margins. A large part of that is we had yet another quarter, as we mentioned in the upfront remarks, where every expense line item went backwards or declined year-over-year, which is a positive outside of direct network costs. And just as a reminder, those are costs that directly feed into our key growth businesses like broadband and wireless. So as we look forward, I think the construct is, and you sort of laid this out appropriately, we've got several revenue growth drivers within our connectivity business, namely residential broadband, wireless, and business services, and those are the higher margin businesses within all of Connectivity & Platforms. So the mix shift that we're seeing and undergoing, where those are the businesses that are growing against businesses that are not growing, has been a favorable mix shift for us and we expect it to continue to be a favorable mix shift. So I would look for continued opportunities in both expense and margin. Steven, I would add on to that, just if you look at the historical context here, we've typically grown broadband ARPU 3% to 4% in any given year. We've been operating at the very high end of that for the first three-quarters this year. Things that contribute to that over the long term, you mentioned sort of the tactical components of that that really, really \u2013 we want to see broadband usage growth, we want to see customers hanging more devices off their network, we want to see them taking higher speeds, and that's exactly what they're doing. So those are sort of the foundational pillars for driving ARPU growth over time, and that's exactly what we're seeing."

            "name": "Michael Cavanagh",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining our third quarter earnings call. It was another strong quarter for us, with adjusted EBITDA up 5% and adjusted EPS up 13%. We generated $4 billion in free cash flow, which, combined with our expectation of Hulu proceeds in the near future, contributed to a pick-up in our share repurchases to $3.5 billion in the quarter. Our steady performance has been a direct result of how we've always run our company, which is with a focus on industry-leading performance, both operationally and financially, in each of our businesses, combined with a long-term, customer-centric approach to decision-making that ensures each business is positioned to win in the future. This has all been facilitated by a philosophy of investment in our businesses that has remained consistent through different economic and credit cycles, and particularly through the recent global pandemic. Now, I'd like to highlight four areas in the quarter that show how this strategy is playing out before handing it over to Jason to review this quarter's results in full. The first area I'd like to highlight is residential domestic connectivity, where we are very pleased with our performance and strategy as we navigate a highly competitive broadband marketplace.  The customer experience provided by our broadband network, which has ubiquitously available gig speeds today and is on a path to ubiquitous multi-gigabit symmetrical speeds, combined with our wireless offering through our MVNO with Verizon and our own network of over 20 million Wi-Fi hotspots, enables us to provide world-class connectivity both in and out of the home to all of our customers everywhere in the most cost effective and capital efficient manner versus our competition. Our broadband network and product leadership continue to drive strong residential revenue growth, which was up nearly 4% this quarter, fueled by very strong ARPU growth of 3.9%. We're confident in our ability to drive continued ARPU growth because of our focus on constantly improving the product experience through investment and innovation, thus delivering more value to our customers. Having a truly excellent Internet experience as reflected in speed, reliability, coverage, security, and latency is constantly increasing in importance to all households as a result of the consumer experiences it enables.  One of the biggest catalysts for recent growth in data usage is the accelerating transition of sports viewership to streaming platforms. The switch of a single Thursday night NFL game to streaming moved peak data usage on our broadband network from Sunday night to Thursday night, and that game comprises roughly 25% of all Internet traffic on Thursday nights. Every internet service provider, fixed wireless in particular, will really be put to the test as this transition of sports to streaming continues, especially come January, when for the first time ever, an NFL playoff game will be aired exclusively on a streaming platform which will be our very own Peacock. The second item I'll highlight is Peacock, which added 4 million paying subscribers during the quarter, saw greater than 60% revenue growth versus a year ago, and had the first year-over-year improvement in EBITDA since our launch in 2020.  While we report standalone Peacock metrics given the significance of this initiative, we manage it as part of the broader NBCU media segment which includes the broadcast and cable networks to best leverage the advantages we bring to the streaming landscape. We continue to be pleased with our progress in the few short years since we've pivoted our streaming strategy as a result of the ownership changes at Hulu. Looking ahead, we are sticking to our plans and still expect 2023 to be the peak year of EBITDA losses for Peacock, though we are now expecting 2023 Peacock losses to come in around $2.8 billion versus our original $3 billion loss outlook. And for 2024, we expect to show meaningful EBITDA improvement over 2023. The third area to highlight is our parks business, which generated a record high level of EBITDA, surpassing the previous record that we'd just set in second quarter. The reaction to Nintendo and Hollywood in Japan continues to be fantastic, and we are very excited about bringing the experience to Florida soon.  I was just in Orlando with the parks leadership team last week, reviewing our plans for the new Halloween Horror experience in Las Vegas and kids theme park in Frisco, Texas. I also spent a few hours on a site tour of the Epic Universe park, which is deep in construction and is simply breathtaking.  So thanks to the momentum of our third quarter results and what we have in the pipeline, I could not be more excited about our parks business. The final area to highlight is our studios business, which is having a great year with three of the top five box office hits for the year so far in Super Mario Bros., Fast X, and now Oppenheimer, which grossed more than $900 million in worldwide box office in the third quarter and became the highest grossing biopic of all time. This is a continuation of our solid track record where, since 2020, we've had at least two of the top five movies in worldwide box office. We believe that success in this business is not formulaic. It's a craft rooted in creativity and originality. We've long focused on assembling a team of the most innovative filmmakers, Chris Nolan, Chris Meledandri, Steven Spielberg, Jason Blum, and Jordan Peele, to name a few, which positions us very well for the future in the studios business. More broadly, it is our consistent investment approach through past business cycles and the pandemic that is the reason for much of the success we're experiencing today. We remain steadfast in supporting our businesses, even those that were hit hard during that time period.  For example, in studios, we never stopped believing that people want to experience great films in theaters, and that conviction enabled us to attract new partners like Chris Nolan who made a masterpiece in Oppenheimer.  Similarly, while our parks business was closed or at limited capacity, we continued to invest heavily in our existing parks, including the VelociCoaster in Orlando, Secret Life of Pets in Hollywood, and the Nintendo Lands I had mentioned earlier in Los Angeles and Osaka, and we will be bringing Epic Universe to life in 2025. Our strong investment-grade balance sheet enabled these investments and puts us in strong and enviable position today.  Now the business world must deal with pressures of much higher interest rates, which I believe will asymmetrically advantage us, given our low leverage and the long duration of our debt.  Since the end of 2018, we have refinanced over $40 billion or nearly 40% of our debt obligations, reduced net debt from $108 billion to $88 billion today, lowered net leverage by a full turn from 3.3 times to 2.3 times, increased the average life of our debt by more than four years to 17 years, while reducing the weighted average cost of our debt to 3.6% from 3.8%. Today, 97% of our debt is at fixed rates compared to just 82% at the end of 2018. We accomplished this while at the same time returning $45 billion to shareholders, including $24 billion via share repurchases and $21 billion in dividends. To sum up, we're in a great place, especially given how the competitive dynamics in our industry might evolve in this higher-for-longer interest rate environment. I expect that our focus on building businesses that are market leaders for the long term through strong execution, investment, and innovation will keep us in one of the strongest positions to perform for our customers, employees, and shareholders.  Jason, over to you. And I would just add \u2013 it's Mike, Ben \u2013 that on the other part \u2013 as Jason has pointed out, the six growth driver businesses, the cable \u2013 components of that are all high incremental margin next dollar revenue, very high incremental margin, but there's also the businesses that are \u2013 as we've talked about, are not in the six growth drivers that are being managed pretty aggressively, frankly, for continued ways to find efficiencies to offset the pressures on the top line. So we've got multiple things going on that I think are the tailwinds for continued ability to drive margins. And I'll just add on that. It's Mike. I'll just add that the importance and the significance of us being committed to sports in the streaming context of Peacock is for us combined with the ability to bring the big reach that our broadcaster NBC brings to the party, which I think is an important element of \u2013 while sports over the long term I think are going to be experienced significantly through streaming, I think for a long time, the economics of the sports rights that you see is going to be substantially supported by broadcast reach that I think for a long time is going to continue to be a significant part of the picture. In terms of advertising, I'd say, Jessica, that overall it's not a big difference in story than last quarter. I'd say the ad market has remained soft. It hasn't necessarily gotten worse despite a little bit of sequential decline, but it hasn't gotten better at the same time. And we still continue to think it's due to the general uncertainty about economic conditions that are out there. The kind of weakness that we're talking about or the softness is particularly on the linear side, while Peacock has remained very strong. Picking at this quarter a little bit, the deceleration from 5% to 8%, contributing factor there which is a little idiosyncratic is, while the retail and tech sectors were down a little bit, whereas auto and pharma and consumer products were up. The one that was down that's a little unique and idiosyncratic is entertainment where you had streamers spending a little less together with advertisers, given the strikes, looking at what the lineups were in the recent past and putting some money in other places. So some of that will revert we believe once strikes are over. And as we look to the fourth [Technical Difficulty] last year's World Cup as well as political that underlying ad sales will be an improvement in this fourth quarter versus last year's fourth quarter. And as far as digital, I think that's why there is definitely the opportunity that some tech competitors are capturing to get premium video monetized in digital platforms, and I think that speaks to why we consider Peacock to be an important initiative for us. And we're pleased again with the progress we're making in Peacock which is now north of 28 million subs and strong overall 60% revenue growth year-over-year. So I think if you zoom out, it's much of what I said earlier, Steven, which is I think the strength of our financial position broadly, if you think about across all the businesses we're in, I think of us as having leading positions for the customer but also strong margins benchmarked against any period you can look at, that together with the strong balance sheet, I think the company couldn't be in better shape financially.  And I think on the execution side, Dave and his team and the NBC team that works with me are \u2013 they know what they're doing and I think we're not giving anybody any quarter in terms of operating the businesses we have. Our priorities, though, in how to use that financial strength is very strategic. So I think we think about the businesses we're in and investing in them appropriately for return and growth and drive growth in those businesses over the long term, hence the way Jason talks about the half the company that's got strong revenue growth. We're trying to find ways to put resources into our own businesses. So that's the priority. As Brian said, the bar is really high for us to consider anything inorganic, but it's our job to look at these things. But if you think about \u2013 what you call the potentially distressed media assets, I'm not sure which ones you're referring to, but many of them are pretty small and wouldn't change the arc of what our company's all about. So I think our focus is on the total picture what Comcast looks like and we're proud of the company we have."

Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Executive Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thank you, operator, and welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings call. You'll first hear from Mike Cavanagh and Jason Armstrong. Then Brian Roberts and Dave Watson will join us and be available for Q&A. I will now refer you to slide two of the presentation accompanying this call, which can also be found on our Investor Relations Web site, which contains our Safe Harbor disclaimer. This conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our 8-K and trending schedule issued earlier this morning for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\nMichael Cavanagh: Thanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our second quarter results, which again demonstrate that our focused efforts to invest and innovate in businesses that offer significant revenue growth, while we carefully manage the contiguous areas with structurally lower growth is paying off. Total revenue grew 2%, and the sixth growth priority areas we have outlined: residential broadband, wireless, business services, theme parks, streaming and premium content creation in our studios, grew nearly 10% year-over-year, and now represent 55% of total revenue. This revenue growth combined with careful management of margins across all businesses generated mid single-digit EBITDA growth and double-digit earnings per share growth. Looking farther into the future, we expect to continue to drive significant growth in these areas, and to continue to identify and invest in organic growth opportunities across our strong portfolio of businesses. We are also very clear-eyed about the challenges that we and our competitors face in other business lines, and have established thoughtful plans which will enable these businesses to continue to meaningfully contribute both financially and strategically. Importantly, the net effect of this approach is a path to sustained future revenue growth for the company in total, driving strong earnings and free cash flow growth for, what I expect to be, many years to come. Significantly, we have by far the strongest balance sheet among our core competitors, which allows us to continue to invest for growth while returning substantial capital to shareholders through both dividends and buybacks which will drive excellent free cash flow and earnings per share growth. Now, let me call out a few highlights from the quarter. For the first time in the company's history, we generated over $10 billion in quarterly EBITDA. And while the diversification of our businesses means there were several significant contributors, I would highlight three that stand out to me in the quarter and reflect the consistency of our investments and the resulting durability of our growth profile. The first is broadband ARPU growth of 4.5%. Stepping back, I am confident we have a winning hand in convergence. We are the largest broadband provider with a high-quality ubiquitous network, and the most cost-efficient upgrade path to higher speeds. In addition, we can compete effectively in wireless with a capital-light approach, and a very strong value proposition for our customers. We also have a long history of consistently surrounding our products with industry-leading features and capabilities, ranging from the coverage and control aspects of our WiFi experience, to content aggregation through our X1 and Flex platforms, which is how we have been able to achieve near-record low levels of churn and grow ARPU consistently quarter after quarter. This second quarter's 4.5% growth was no exception, and is a testament to our ability to appropriately balance rate and volume to effectively segment the market and surround our broadband product with industry-leading products and capabilities. The broadband market remains highly competitive, but we have and will continue to invest to sustain our position as a market leader. Second is our parks, which continues to be such a great story for us. Our teams have consistently introduced new and innovative attractions, leveraging both our owned or licensed IP. We opened Super Nintendo World at both Universal Hollywood and Japan, which helped drive the record results in the quarter. Later this summer, we will be opening a new Minion Land in Orlando, and we look forward to Donkey Kong, in Japan, next year, as well as starting the previously announced kid's theme park, in Texas, and the Halloween Horror experience, in Las Vegas. And I couldn't be more excited about the opening of Epic Universe, in Orlando, in 2025. Third is the strength of our film studios and in particular our animation business. Super Mario Bros. crossed over $1.3 billion in worldwide box office to date, making it the second-highest grossing animated film ever. This is another incredible achievement by Illumination and Chris Meledandri. We also invest in successful franchises like Fast, highlighted by the successful launch of the latest installment with Fast X during the quarter. Of course, we just released Oppenheimer, which gross about $180 million this past weekend to tremendous acclaim from critics and moviegoers alike. Oppenheimer is such a powerful and impactful movie, and we at Comcast couldn't be proud to work with Christopher Nolan to bring such an important movie to audiences globally. We have the very best roster of creative partners, and these innovative filmmakers enable us to invest in a strategic slate, which is one of the keys to our continued box office success where we remain number two in box office year-to-date. All of these results and accomplishments, from broadband differentiation, to studio leadership, to our park success are a function of our focused leadership team, commitment to innovation, strong balance sheet, and disciplined approach to capital allocation. As I look at our company, I am extremely bullish on the durability of growth drivers we have invested in so consistently, and in our continued ability to invest and deliver through a variety of businesses and economic cycles. This was also my first quarter with direct responsibility for NBCUniversal. And I observed in a note announcing some organizational changes a few weeks ago, NBCU is a very special place with tremendous opportunities ahead. I could not be more impressed with the depth of talent, and particularly with our leadership team. And I am very confident that the new streamlined organization we have just put in place, and which has been very well received will help us move even faster and make even better decisions. As you know, NBCU operates a diverse array of businesses, each with leading market positions. In addition to film and parks, which I referenced earlier, we have the number one TV portfolio by total audience, and our TV studio is award-winning and prolific. We're the number one most watched news organization in the U.S., and sports continues to be a huge driver, with the NFL, NASCAR, gold, Premier League, the World Cup on Telemundo, including the Women's World Cup going on right now, Big Ten starting this fall, and the Paris Olympics coming up next year. I am also confident that we have the right strategy for the future. We produce premium content through our studios, distributed through our TV networks, Peacock and third parties, and further monetize this content with our theme parks and consumer products. In streaming, we launched Peacock as an ad-supported model that is an extension of our existing business. We set out a plan, which we have adapted as needed, and Peacock is strong and growing. We gained two million paid subscribers in the second quarter, going from 22 million to 24 million paid subscribers. This growth was largely driven by conversion of Comcast subs to paying relationships which started in June. And we're very pleased with the results so far. Without a doubt, consumer trends such as cord-cutting and new competitors, particularly from the technology sector present challenges for us. And we are facing an uncertain macro environment which continues to pressure linear advertising. But I firmly believe that we have the business strategy, management dept, and financial strength to emerge as long-term winners and value creators as the landscape evolves at NBCUniversal, and across the company. Another challenge in the near-term are the writers and actors strikes. We remain committed to reaching a fair deal as soon as possible so we can get back to doing what we do best, which is making great content together. With that, let me turn it over to Jason.\nJason Armstrong: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. We had a really strong second quarter. And to take you through it, I'll start with our consolidated results on slide four. Revenue increased 2% to $30.5 billion, while adjusted EBITDA grew 4% to $10.2 billion, a record level driven by continued operating leverage at our high-margin Connectivity & Platforms business, as well as strong growth at Studios and Theme Parks. We grew adjusted earnings per share by 12% to $1.13, and generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow, while returning $3.2 billion of capital to shareholders. Our healthy level of free cash flow in the quarter includes the significant investments we're making to support and grow our businesses in six key growth areas; our connectivity businesses including Residential Broadband, Wireless, and Business Services Connectivity, Theme Parks, Streaming, and premium content in our studios. Taken together, these areas generated more than half of our total company revenue in the quarter, and grew nearly 10% year-over-year, consistent with the first quarter. Now, let's turn to our individual business results, starting on slide five, with Connectivity & Platforms. As I get into these results, I'll refer to year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis. Revenue for total Connectivity & Platforms was flat at $20.4 billion. Our core connectivity businesses, domestic broadband, domestic wireless, international connectivity, and Business Services Connectivity increased 7% to over $10 billion in revenue, while video, advertising, and other revenue declined 7% to $9.8 billion. Our strategy continues to incorporate a strong focus on investing in and driving growth in high-margin businesses while protecting profitability in businesses with secular headwinds through disciplined cost management. This resulted in 170 basis points of margin expansion for Connectivity & Platforms in the second quarter, while margins for our domestic legacy cable business improved 240 basis points, reaching a record high of 47.3%. Diving deeper into the details, first, I'll unpack connectivity revenue growth. Residential Connectivity revenue grew by 8%, reflecting 4% growth in domestic broadband, 20% growth in wireless, and 26% growth in international, while revenue for Business Services Connectivity grew 4%. Domestic broadband continued to be led by very strong ARPU growth, which increased 4.5% for the second consecutive quarter. As we have said before, our goal is to protect ARPU by retaining the appropriate balance between rate and volume, and to serve our customers' constant demand for more from our network. We continue to see the use cases for better and faster Internet increase. Demand for higher speeds is increasing, as is average network consumption, and our customers are hanging more devices off our network in their homes. The average monthly data usage for a broadband customer that doesn't take video from us is nearly 700 gigabytes, and continues to grow. In fact, this is nearly 70% more than the average usage from the comparable quarter in 2019, pre-pandemic. Additionally, nearly three quarters of our broadband customers are now in speed plans of 400 megs and above. That's up from less than 50% last year and less than 20% in 2020. We plan for our network and product capabilities to stay far ahead of demand, so that we maintain our position as the market leader, delivering the best broadband possible. To that end, our transition to DOCSIS 4.0 is progressing well. We are more than halfway through the year, and have implemented on mid-split technology at 25% of our footprint, and are on target to complete one-third of this build by year-end, with the first commercial launch of DOCSIS 4.0 in just a few short months. We are also hard at work when it comes to expanding our footprint. We've grown our homes and businesses past by 1.5% year-over-year to 61.8 million, and we are on pace to meet or exceed our goal of 1 million new homes and businesses past for 2023, with future footprint expansion remaining a high priority. Growth in domestic wireless revenue was due to higher service revenue, driven by continued strong momentum in customer lines, which were up $1.4 million or 30% year-over-year, to $6 million in total, including the 316,000 lines we just added in the quarter. This marked the seventh consecutive quarter of more than 300,000 line additions. We continue testing some new converged offers in the quarter, and we are encouraged by an increasing mix of new customers to Comcast. And we will continue to experiment with different offers over time. With just 10% of our domestic residential broadband customers taking our mobile offering, we have a big opportunity and long runway ahead for growth in wireless. International connectivity revenue grew to $1 billion, a record high, and demonstrates the strength of the Sky brand and the ability to leverage a leadership position in video, and extend that to connectivity with significant success. Broadband, which accounts for two-thirds of international connectivity revenue continue to grow at a mid-teens level, benefiting from both an increase in customers and ARPU, compared to a year ago. The remainder is wireless revenue, which tends to have more variable growth due to handsets, which contributed to the higher growth this quarter. Finally, on Business Services Connectivity, revenue increased 4%, reflecting stronger growth in enterprise and mid-market and a slight deceleration in growth from small business, where we are seeing a bit of macro economic pressure. The strong revenue growth overall in our connectivity businesses was offset by declines in video, due to customer losses since last year, as well as declines in other revenue, reflecting similar dynamics in wireline voice. And finally, in advertising, which was impacted by lower political revenue in our domestic markets and the macro environment. Connectivity in platforms total EBITDA increased 4% to $8.3 billion, and as I mentioned a moment ago, adjusted margin that expanded 170 basis points. This is driven by the mix shift to our high margin connectivity businesses coupled with very strong expense management. In fact every line of expense was down year-over-year, except direct product costs, which are success-based and directly associated with the significant growth in our connectivity businesses. Further on tacking our connectivity and platform's EBITDA results between residential and business, residential EBITDA grew 4% with margin improving 180 basis points to reach 38.9%, again, highlighting our favorable mix shift, while business EBITDA grew 5% with margin improving 40 basis points to reach 57.7%. Now, let's turn to Content & Experiences on slide six. Content & Experiences revenue increased 4% to $10.9 billion, and EBITDA increased 7.5% to $2.2 billion, driven by record results at parks and strong growth at studios, fueled by the success of Super Mario Brothers. Taking a closer look at the results, our media segment combines our TV networks and Peacock, matching our holistic approach to managing these businesses. As viewership shifts to streaming, our dual revenue strategy at Peacock, where we are growing advertising and distribution revenue, is offsetting declines in linear revenue. At the same time, we are managing costs at our linear networks, and reallocating some of these resources to Peacock, with the goal of maximizing profitability over the long-term across our media portfolio. You see that in our media results this quarter was stable revenue, a strong growth in Peacock offset the performance at our linear networks. Immediate EBITDA decreased 18%, which included a $651 million EBITDA loss at Peacock. To get a little further into details, domestic advertising declined 5% with underlying trends consistent to prior quarters, reflecting continued softness in the overall market, partially offset by strong growth in advertising at Peacock, which increased over 75% driven by strong demand. We expect these overall results in advertising to continue in the third quarter. Domestic distribution increased 2% driven by Peacock distribution revenue growth of nearly 70%. Peacock paid scribers landed at $24 million compared to $30 million a year ago and $22 million at the end of the first quarter. As Mike mentioned, in June we began an effort to transition Comcast bundle scribers who received Peacock for free to a paid relationship. We've made some nice progress to date as the conversion activity drove Peacock second quarter subscriber growth. And we are bullish on further increasing our Peacock subscriber base through the balance of 2023, driven by both our continued conversion efforts as well as strong programming in the second-half. Some highlights included strong line up of movies exclusively on Peacock in our Pay-One window including Super Mario Bros. coming August 3rd; a day & date movie, Blumhouse, Five Nights at Freddy's coming at the end of October. And continued benefit from our next day broadcast Bravo content along with a strong sports lineup including Sunday Night Football, and for the first time, Big Ten. Turning to Studios, we had a great quarter driven by our film business including the latest installment of the Fast franchise and a tremendous success of Super Mario Bros. While theatrical revenue growth was offset by lower content licensing at our television studios due the timing of when we deliver content, the momentum in our film business led by the success of Mario fueled nearly $260 million in year-over-year growth in studio EBITDA. At Theme Parks, revenue increased 22% and EBITDA increased 32% to $833 million, a record level. Our park in Hollywood continued momentum from opening Super Nintendo World last quarter. The positive consumer reaction drove strong attendance and per cap growth, helping Hollywood to deliver its best quarter EBITDA in its history. Our international parks are both experiencing nice rebound post COVID. Our park in Osaka delivered a record level of EBITDA for a second quarter as it continues to benefit from strong demand from Super Nintendo World. And our park in Beijing enjoyed its most profitable quarter to date, resulting in strong improvement compared to last year when the park was largely closed due to COVID. In Orlando, our comparisons were impacted by unprecedented levels of visitation last year. But underlying momentum remains healthy as attendance was relatively in line with 2019 pre-pandemic levels while revenue was substantially ahead of 2019 levels. I'll now wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 7. As I mentioned previously, we generated $3.4 billion in free cash flow this quarter, and achieved this while absorbing meaningful investments in our network and theme parks. These investments drove a 20% increase in total capital spending, primarily driven by higher CapEx which was consistent with the outlook that we provided on our last quarter call. At Connectivity & Platforms, CapEx increased to 11% with CapEx intensity coming in at 10.4%, primarily driven by investments to accelerate our home passed as well as transition our U.S. network to DOCSIS 4.0. Content & Experiences CapEx increased by $344 million, driven by parks, with Epic accounting for the majority of this quarter's increase in spend. Turning to return on capital and our balance sheet, we repurchased $2 billion worth of shares in the quarter. In addition, dividend payments totaled $1.2 billion for a total return on capital in the second quarter of $3.2 billion. We ended the quarter with net leverage of 2.4 times, in line with our target leverage. With that, let me turn it over to Brian for a few words before we turn the call back to Marci.\nBrian Roberts: Thanks, Jason. I am really pleased with our team and this outstanding performance for the first-half of the year. It was a terrific quarter on all the great metrics you've just articulated. So, I would like to just zoom out a bit. And probably what's most exciting is the hopefully recurring and sustainable model that we are able to leverage our faster growing businesses which you laid out to generate revenue growth for the entire company. And then, we convert that all the way free cash flow per share that accelerates with the strength of our company and our balance sheet. I really couldn't be more proud of the team, excited about the future. So, Marci, let's turn it over to you for Q&A.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Brian. Operator, let's open up the call please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you, good morning. Question on broadband, and then one on NBC, maybe for Mike and Dave, when you think about the converged offers you have in the market, I know you've been testing more the investments in the network. Those tailwinds, again the headwinds around competition and housing, fixed wireless, when you put that all together, how are you feeling about the ability for the company to return to consistent broadband customer growth, particularly when you look into maybe the seasonally stronger back-half or into next year? And then, Mike, you mentioned the strikes. There's a lot of different ways that those could impact your business depending on how long it lasts. But I'm particularly interested in free cash flow for the company, and also Peacock, where there's a lot of expectations around Peacock profitability improving or losses coming down, and continued growth. When you put the strike into context for us, how should we be thinking about the impact should this last longer than expected? Thank you.\nDavid Watson: Hey, Ben, this is Dave. Let me started with broadband, and hand it over to Mike. I think talking about this environment; you got to start where the market is and where the customer is going. And the customers continue to be highly engaged in multiple broadband applications, streaming, gaming, all trending up. And you look at the other thing that is happening, just an increasing number of simultaneous device usage that's happening in peak moments. And now we have over a billion connected devices -- WiFi-connected devices to our network. So, from an overall perspective, that's just very encouraging. And you look at the results; non-video broadband customers are doing more than 700 gigabytes per month. And you take one key area, one major streaming part of the business, and that's sports. And it starts with just making it really easy to find the sporting event, so great voice search that we have in our platform, multiple ways to consume sports, in linear, DVR, streaming, all seamlessly connected. And then, of course, comes, when big sports moments happen, you want reliability, fast speeds, great coverage and capacity. And you look at just what happened in Thursday Night Football, Messi in MLS, Peacock has a fantastic sports slate that will be steamed and consumed that way. So, you need great broadband to be able to back all of that up. And so, I think that's a great driver, and over time. But in this environment, we are seeing continued lower move activity. Competition is still increased. And fixed wireless you brought out there, they're still pressing. However, we are seeing some rational promotional activity; it's early, no changes to any trending, but when you see that in the competitive environment that is encouraging. Both voluntary and non-paid churn remain below pre-pandemic levels, and that has continued. So, our game plan in this environment is we're going to invest in our network, we're going to focus on upgrading, and the mid-split, all that activity is on track leading to 4.0 beginning the deployments and trialing activity starting at the end of the year. No change to our game plan. And we're going to segment the base. And we've consistently focused on the starting point high-end broadband activity in tiers, a third of our customers-plus are on 1 gig, and we've launched our new 2-gig service to 25% of our footprint, and overall, 75% of our customers or for 100 megabits or more. So, we're going to continue to leverage mobile, and we're going to press aggressively with mobile, and even new broadband partners, like NOW TV, which is a great streaming video tier that showcases Peacock. And the net of this is a stable base, 32 million residential broadband customers, and while protecting resi broadband ARPU growth. You saw us do that in Q2 at 4.5% ARPU growth. But in this environment, we're still competitive in lower activity superior to flux, and in some quarters, we may report customer losses. That being said, to your question, we believe, over time, we will return to subscriber growth. And certainly we're seeing more normalization. Back-to-school is going to happen in Q3. And most certainly there's some seasonal normalization. But over time, I'm confident that we will be able to balance this formula of ARPU, focus, and over time, getting back to the subscriber growth. Mike?\nMichael Cavanagh: Thanks, Dave, so, hey, good morning, Ben. So, I think I'd just add a point, that if you look back at the first-half of the year, what Dave and his team have been doing and continue to do in terms of setting the broadband business, which is obviously extremely important to the future of the company, up for long-term success by continuing to improve our product, add innovation around it, segment the base, extend the footprint, all the things that you want to see happen, and while protecting pricing are all outstanding work in a competitive moment in time. But I think as you know, we here and Dave and his team, in particular, are thinking what are the implications for the long-term as we think about how to compete in the short-term. Going to your question on the NBC side on strikes, I'll just repeat what I said earlier, which is that we are committed to reaching a fair deal with the guilds as soon as possible. Beyond that, I'd just it's really for all involved in the industry broadly, a prolonged work stoppage and the longer it goes the worse it'll be. It's obviously going to have a negative impact all around. To your question about free cash flow, nothing to quantify in the context of our company, I mean it's all manageable. But it will shift studio working capital out of the near-term and into the future, so probably for 2023 a little bit of lower working capital, higher free cash flow, and the flipside of that in 2024. As you look at Peacock, I wouldn't point out anything in particular related to strikes and its effect in 2023 or second-half of the year. Obviously, the longer the strike the more that could have an affect as you look into 2024 and beyond, and that would be for ourselves and others, obviously. So, it's a level playing field. But to comment on Peacock in particular in the second-half, we've got a lot of strong content coming. So, we've got NFL coming back. Obviously then on top of that we have an exclusive NFL wild-card game. We're going to have Big Ten for the first time, which is fantastic on Saturday nights. In the movie slates, we've got Super Mario Bros. coming to Peacock shortly, we've got Exorcist, Five Nights at Freddy's, as Jason pointed out, coming from Blumhouse. And then on TV side, some originals, including Continental, which is related to the John Wick franchise. So, we feel very good about the strength of what we have coming in the second-half of the year content-wise. And then beyond that, on Peacock, I think there'll be a continuation of the good work that we've done inside the company to convert Comcast subscribers over to a paying subscriber status, which we're not quite halfway through that as we only got started in June on that score. So, over the remainder of the year that will also be happening. So, when you look at the doubling of Peacock subs year-over-year, and I'm optimistic about what the second-half of the year brings, feel pretty good about Peacock.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks so much.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Ben. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nCraig Moffett: Hi. Two questions, if I could, regarding your wireless business. One, there's been some talk in the market, and there was some discussion on the Verizon call yesterday, calling, if not fully into question, at least raising some eyebrows with respect to the permanence of that contract. So, I'm just wondering if there was anything that you can say about the durability of that relationship and your confidence that that is, in fact, an irrevocable contract? And then second, you've obviously now started to subsidize handsets more frequently in line with the way the whole market really operates. I wonder if you could just talk about that a bit and talk about your views on customer lifetime value that you're seeing with new customer acquisitions given the handset subsidies and expected churn?\nDavid Watson: Thanks, Craig. This is Dave. So, let me start with the wireless MVNO question then. So, let me start with we have a great MVNO, and really like our approach towards the business from day one, and continue to feel that way. And definitely think that cable is a material and really strong benefit to our partner. And so, have a good relationship with Verizon. And so, that continues. Really key is we have a perpetual access to all the services that we need from Verizon's network. So, it's just straightforward, that's the way it is. So, let me start with -- then let me go into the handset subsidy point. We go in, and we go out in terms of different offers. So, we've always consistently had promotions. And they come in different forms. It can be the form of gift cards, can be outright promotions that are discounts, and in some cases, a free device, but it's not every day. That's not part of our everyday game plan; we will go in and out with that. And we increasingly focus on higher-end mobile tiers, and we have a great slate there between by-the-gig, unlimited, and premium unlimited. So, we stay very focused on the core service offering, and been very strong in terms of the really consistent performance in terms of wireless growth. We really like the long runway ahead that we have and things, so we're just getting going in small business and wireless. But I think our core wireless pricing provides customers with the savings that help us compete against the telephone companies, like between 30% and 50% savings versus the telecos. And so, we got a strong position partnering mobile with broadband, got great WiFi overlay, and a strong MVNO, as I've said. So, we like our capital-light approach. We like our core service offering approach, and it's been effective.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Craig. Operator, next question please?\nOperator: Certainly. Next question is coming from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBrett Feldman: Yes, thanks for taking the question. Disney has said that they are looking for, potentially, a partner to help them transition ESPN to a more direct-to-consumer model. You have a really big sports franchise as well. How are you thinking about further transitioning NBC Sports to a business that is mostly streaming? Is it something you think you would need a partner for? And maybe broadly speaking, do you think as sports businesses become more streaming-centric, there is an opportunity or need for consolidation among those platforms? Thank you.\nMichael Cavanagh: Thanks, Brett. It's Mike. So, I've been asked about, and read the speculation that in some way we might be interested in swapping businesses as part of what's going on in the sports space. And I would just say that that's very improbable, given the -- as you could imagine, there's tremendous issues around tax, minority shareholders, structuring generally. So, I would put aside the idea that there's anything inorganic that is likely to happen around ESPN in particular, which is what we've been asked about. When I think about our own sports business, I think we've got one of the best portfolios in sports. Saturday Night Football, Bit Ten, EPL, NASCAR, WWE, Olympics next year, PGA, so -- and we've got a very acclaimed group of people in terms of producing excellent content around those sports. So, obviously, it makes us a really strong partner to leagues and around the world, we're known for that. And I think we bring a lot to the table whenever there is a time, and that includes Sky Sports as well, obviously. So, that brings us to the table with more than money when it comes time for discussions around how rights owners want to create value for their participants. And I think we are doing a very good job, in my mind, of continuing to do that in a way that has tremendous reach, obviously through NBC in the broadcast side. We can leverage our cable nets as we've done in various sporting events using our cable nets. But really importantly is Peacock, and we looked at one of the great drivers of Peacock subscriber growth has been sports. And I think it adds to the value of the Peacock subscription, the fact that when we looked at the value of rights that are streamed inside Peacock, where it is and where it goes when you include the value of Olympics next year, it is very substantial, and would alone represent a really good deal for the consumer just sports within Peacock. So, I think that's how we see our evolution where in sports we are going to continue to be in sports and that's the game.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nBrian Roberts: Thank you.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Brett. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Philip Cusick from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nPhilip Cusick: Hi, guys, thank you. Lots to talk about, one follow-up on Brett, do you think that you have the right sports rights next, or can you stretch your lead and Peacock's lead by taking more over time? And then, second, can you dig into the strong Hollywood and the weaker Orlando numbers? It looks like Orlando, just in general is little bit softer year-over-year, but we think you have been taking share, do you agree with that? And how do you see that going forward? Thanks very much.\nJason Armstrong: So, sports rights, going back to that last question, for all the reasons I said, and I will keep it shorter this time, we should -- we are always looking to see if there is ways to add more value to our business, and likewise work with our partners. So, obviously NBA is coming up. That's a fantastic property. We don't necessarily need it, given the portfolio we have, but given, it's strength and our historical involvement in the sports, something I would like to see is take a look at, as if, for instance. But we will see where that goes. And then on theme parks, we have -- you know, I think one of the best quarters we have seen, tremendous momentum in the overall portfolio, we feel very, very good about the parks business overall. Hollywood was a record on the back of Nintendo opening up; Japan doing well and a record as well there for second quarter; and Beijing, highest level of profitability. In Orlando, it is -- really compares very well to pre-pandemic. We are obviously down on attendance, which was kind of unprecedented in the back of coming of COVID, so, not surprised by that softening. That said, we are at levels of attendance and per caps being better, so that overall we feel good about what we are seeing in Orlando. We've had -- you know, with the stronger dollar you still are seeing softness of international attendance, which continues to be about 30% lower than pre-pandemic levels. We expect that to sort of continue. And on the domestic side, it's just been rebalancing with cruise lines back and people, the flipside of the dollar doing some international travel. It's the dynamics that you see in Orlando. We feel very good about what's going on there. And Brian, you can jump in here.\nBrian Roberts: I just want to add that, you know, really bullish on the parks is one of the six areas, Jason mentioned that we feel are the growth driver of the company in the years ahead. We were just down in Orlando recently looking at Epic Universe, progress, and it's spectacular. What's coming in 2025, we have the two parks, the smaller parks in Vegas and outside Dallas. So, we are looking for growth in this area. We are pretty excited about the results that Jason and Mike have talked about, and I just draw your attention that the opportunity in Orlando with Epic is pretty massive, we believe.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Philip.\nPhilip Cusick: Thanks, guys.\nMarci Ryvicker: Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from BofA Securities. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thanks. I have one maybe longer-term and one near-term, first on content, you just announced the restructuring in your content area, and with the current strike, which is kind of reminiscent of the pandemic for whole production and shutdown at least in the U.S., it seems like an opportune time to rethink your entire content strategy. So, are you thinking differently at all about how you produce, what you produce, what your costs are? And just anything you can say about how NBC you may change that approach to content in coming years? And then, on advertising, the upfront I guess is still dragging on, can you talk about what you are seeing, where there is strength and weakness, and where the dollars are being allocated to what platforms, and I think that Jason just said that Q3 advertising will be similar to Q2?\nBrian Roberts: So, in terms of content, I'm really pleased, Jessica, with the elevation of couple of my partners at NBC; one of them being Donna Langley, who is one of the most respected people in Hollywood, along with -- we have great leader, Pearlena Igbokwe, who runs our TV Studios. So, I think giving them a sort of content vertical that's going to work closely with Mark Lazarus on the TV side and platform side, and Cesar Conde, our News and Telemundo, I think is going to really take advantage of the company that we have. We are going to obviously be very much focused on creating great content, but we already do create great content, I think when you look at the movie slates we've had and the TV that we produce for ourselves and others, and I think that strategy is going to continue. We are not going to be creating content exclusively for ourselves, but I think it's a great advantage for our studios to actually have platforms that can take a substantial amount, though not all, of the content that we can create, which puts us in a great position to work with all sorts of talent and creators in Hollywood and elsewhere can come work with our great leadership in our studios, and we help bring their ideas to life. In terms of cost and strategy and so forth, that's a -- we will work in the context of the industry and the buyers, and what they're looking for, and be responsive to that. But I feel very good about the way our studio businesses are set up. In terms of advertising, the ad market softened versus last year, stabilized as it came into this year and has stayed stable, and I think that would be on the back of just uncertainty about economic outlook looking forward. And I think, Jason's comments are, we don't see that condition changing as we are looking into the third quarter and second-half of the year. As you know, I think we feel good about our upfronts, despite those headwinds, our total cash and pricing levels was roughly in line with last year, and really strong related to Peacock in particular. A lot of that comes from the strength of our portfolio, as I have mentioned earlier, where we see strength around Big Ten, Sunday Night Football, Peacock, one platform and alike all things that are helpful us out quite a bit.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Jessica. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Kale from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nStephen Kale: Thank you. Just two on the connectivity side of the business, maybe first on the broadband ARPU really strong at 4.5%, I was wondering if you could help us unpack that a little bit, maybe what in there is price increase, how much do you think you are getting from customers up-tiering to faster speeds, and maybe what might be coming from core cutting some of your double play video subs go to single play Internet or Internet plus mobile bundles? And then, on the international side, where revenue growth is really strong, can you just help us think through what kind of margin contribution you get on international? You talked about more headsets in the quarter, I'm guessing those are little lower margin as is some of the U.K. connectivity stuff, but as we just think about that as a growth driver, how should we think about the margin or EBITDA contribution from international? Thank you.\nBrian Roberts: Got it. So, let me start with ARPU, and you hit on a couple of the key points. First off, pretty strong performance in the quarters we have said and seen 4.5%. And there are multiple drivers. There was a little bit more rate that we took early on, not why we are different, but a little bit more that we did in the beginning of the year. I think a critical one for us is pyramids. And we have third of our base, that said, a gigabit plus and that's 75%, 400 megabits are higher. That definitely impacts the overall ARPU. I think one that maybe not is understood as much is maybe as it should be, but we have a wonderful product called xFi Complete, 25% of our base has that. And let me take one sec and describe what's in it, it's a gateway, it's a great gateway that's included in the tier, with a pass to upgrading the gateway over time, you have an opportunity to do that, and advance security is included in that, unlimited is included in that, and then a coverage plan making sure your whole house is covered. So, xFi Complete is a great tier, good value to customers, and we have 25% of the base. And then, there is the bundled discount that you mentioned that when customers go to HSD-only, you use the bundled discounts, and so, all of those things factor in. So, I think it's a positive, there are multiple drivers that are helping, and the thing, Stephen, that starts with is just where the market is going, and I mentioned that before, and you have this very stable group of customers that are just using more, and over time that continues to trend up, and we have this balance of stable base and healthy ARPU growth. On international connectivity, and the margin side, so this is a great growth area for us. And you look at the -- from a revenue perspective, just starting with that, because that impacts margin. The revenue increased 26% this quarter, as Jason said in the call, and the two-thirds of that revenue comes from broadband, which continues to grow at mid-teen level, and was driven by higher level of customers and ARPU, compared to a year-ago. Remaining third is wireless, which tends to have more variable growth quarter-to-quarter due to handsets. And so, this is a solid quarter growth rate. And it will impact margins. But normalizing for mobile side of things, revenue growth, I think maybe the right level to focus on is more closer to 20% level for international connectivity. So, I think this is a strong part of the portfolio, and a definite contributor towards, as Jason as said, one of the main killers of not only just domestic broadband and mobile, but also the international broadband and mobile. Jason?\nJason Armstrong: Yes, and I think Stephen, important for us as we came into this year with the re-segmentation, how we start to present it out to the world, this was an important category. So, international connectivity, as we think about Sky and taking the brand name and reputation that they sort of earned in video and taking that into other products like broadband and wireless, the way they have, this quarter $1 billion in revenue coming from connectivity international. So, kudos to the team, and I think it's important that we've been able to highlight that at the street.\nStephen Kale: Thank you.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from John Hodulik from UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks, guys. Maybe a couple of questions on profitability, I think maybe for Jason, first, really impressive performance on the cable side 240 bps, 47%, I mean how is the visibility into further margin expansion from here, especially given, you know, you kind of gave a couple of mix shift issues obviously more broadband like video, but also more wireless, so anything you tell us about sort of outlook there? And then, on the Peacock side, doing better in terms of losses there; is $3 billion losses for this year still the right number for Peacock? And anything you say about the sort of path to profitability beyond '23 would be great. Thanks.\nJason Armstrong: Yes, thanks, John; good question. So, on mix and margins in the connectivity business, I think we have had a fairly consistent track record if you look at the last several years of margin expansion. If you look at the core sort of legacy cable business, as we mentioned this quarter, record margin over 47%. And the factors that have contributed to that historically are in place as we look forward. I think Mike's comment upfront about being able to grow revenue, being able to grow margins; that's a key part of it. So, to your question specifically on connectivity, there is a mix shift going on, when we talk about sort of the six key growth drivers across the company, three are sort of core connectivity growth drivers, whether it's residential broadband, business services, or wireless, this is an accretive mix shift for us, as we think about the way the categories are sort of shifting and what's growing versus what's not growing. So, I would look for more of the same. I think also importantly for the team for the second consecutive quarter, every expense line in connectivity and platforms was down year-over-year, except for direct product costs, and those are the costs that directly support the connectivity and platforms, revenue growth and the categories we talked about. So, our outlook for more of the same in continued margin expansion out of the business. I think on Peacock, you are right, we came into the year, and gave guidance for roughly $3 billion in losses, no change to that. And as you see, we are pacing to that over the first couple of quarters. We've got a lot of incremental content as we think in the back-half of the year, as Mike said, so no change to that guidance.\nJohn Hodulik: Great, thanks a lot.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, John. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Vijay Jayant from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.\nVijay Jayant: Good morning. So, I think Jason talked about future expansion of this footprint being a high priority, and the bid dollars by state have been sort of allocated. Can you just talk about, is that really going to be a big opportunity in terms of product stating in that, and driving that footprint? Thanks.\nDavid Watson: Yes, this is Dave. Let me jump into that. So, we operate in 39 states, where they're expected to bid subsidy money, and we are actively engaged both at the federal and state government levels. So, as the framework rules of bid participation are being developed, we are actively looking at it and working I think in a good way at all level. So, assuming satisfactory outcomes on the framework roles, we are going to be full participants in bidding where it is consistent with our business goals. But it's too early in the process for us to comment on where we'll bid. Or, the potential win rate. But we're active right now building out, edge out. So, as Jason's talked about, we are going to build out even before any bid activity. And the bid activity by the way is really going to be more rules will come out and be clarified. This is a '25-'26 kind of an impact once it clears up. But in the meantime, we're actively edging out and looking at opportunities where it's a profitable return and aggressively pursuing it. So, a million homes passed, we expect to build this year alone. So, we are going to be aggressive in the meantime. But considering -- we'll stay closely at it, and assuming the satisfactory outcome, we will be participant.\nMarci Ryvicker:\n. :\nOperator: Our last question today is coming from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks, guys. Just to drill into broadband in little bit more detail. The shift from 1Q to Q2 was quite different from what it has been historically in terms of broadband net ads. I am wondering if you can give just a little bit more color on how much of that was muted seasonality versus some of the initiatives that you guys have been pushing on the competitive front with low end broadband offer, and the wireless bundles? And in that context, you mentioned that wireless is starting to have a bigger pull through impact on your broadband subs. There are more muted Comcast subs taking wireless. I am wondering if you can give us little bit more context around that? And then, sorry to pile on. But one last one on wireless for Jason, when we look at Verizon's wholesale revenue, it seems to have flattened over the course of the last three quarters, which suggest that maybe you are getting some gross margin expansion in the wireless business. I am wondering if that's accurate. Thank you.\nDavid Watson: So, look -- this is David. Let me start on the broadband part and a little bit on wireless. So, as we saw the base is stable 32 million. And this is sequentially and year over year for this quarter. We also flagged -- we talked about this last quarter. We expected more normal seasonal activity so that net ads would be lower than Q1. But we also expected a more muted step down in net ads from Q1 to Q2. This is a combination of lower overall move activity. The overall macro issues that we have experienced over the past year in the market. At the same time, we did as you brought up we go in and out in terms offers. We had some offers really targeted in the multiple segments that we served, more in the lower end. And we had some traction on some of that. So, that did help. And so, we'll continue to be opportunistic throughout the year. And as I mentioned before to your point on wireless, we absolutely aggressively package mobile with broadband. And this is for new and existing customers. So, mobile is a great extension of the relationship and really profitable way to existing customers that are HSD only, so, one of the key things that we do. And I think over time, we've got to continue to stay focused on that. I think this is much of an opportunity to grow the mobile business and really help broadband. It is going to the base as well as attracting new customer. So, it's a double wind from our perspective. Jason?\nJason Armstrong: Yes. Jonathan, thanks for the question on wireless, can't speak to Verizon and their revenue trajectory. I know they have got a few different things in the wholesale revenue category beyond just cable. But I can speak to obviously the economics of our business. We are happy with it. We think it's good business for Verizon. What they said yesterday as they think about traffic and ways to fill up their network. But for us specifically, we've got a revenue stream coming in from customers. We have a wholesale deal with Verizon to accommodate that traffic where there is outflows, but then, we are also trying to offload as much traffic as we can on our own network. We've got a fairly efficient acquisition vehicle. And a lot of this is just marketed to our own broadband subscriber. So, in terms of acquisition cost, I think we are fairly efficient in the market. And then all the way down sort of closer to cash flow, this is a capital-light model, which we like. So, I will leave it there.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thank you, Jonathan, and thank you everyone for joining us on our second quarter call.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer session, and today's conference call. A replay of the call will be available starting at 11:30 AM Eastern Time today on Comcast Investor Relations Web site. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect.",

It was a terrific quarter on all the great metrics you've just articulated. So, I would like to just zoom out a bit. And probably what's most exciting is the hopefully recurring and sustainable model that we are able to leverage our faster growing businesses which you laid out to generate revenue growth for the entire company. And then, we convert that all the way free cash flow per share that accelerates with the strength of our company and our balance sheet. I really couldn't be more proud of the team, excited about the future. So, Marci, let's turn it over to you for Q&A. Thank you. I just want to add that, you know, really bullish on the parks is one of the six areas, Jason mentioned that we feel are the growth driver of the company in the years ahead.

            "name": "David Watson",
            "content": "Hey, Ben, this is Dave. Let me started with broadband, and hand it over to Mike. I think talking about this environment; you got to start where the market is and where the customer is going. And the customers continue to be highly engaged in multiple broadband applications, streaming, gaming, all trending up. And you look at the other thing that is happening, just an increasing number of simultaneous device usage that's happening in peak moments. And now we have over a billion connected devices -- WiFi-connected devices to our network. So, from an overall perspective, that's just very encouraging. And you look at the results; non-video broadband customers are doing more than 700 gigabytes per month. And you take one key area, one major streaming part of the business, and that's sports. And it starts with just making it really easy to find the sporting event, so great voice search that we have in our platform, multiple ways to consume sports, in linear, DVR, streaming, all seamlessly connected. And then, of course, comes, when big sports moments happen, you want reliability, fast speeds, great coverage and capacity. And you look at just what happened in Thursday Night Football, Messi in MLS, Peacock has a fantastic sports slate that will be steamed and consumed that way. So, you need great broadband to be able to back all of that up. And so, I think that's a great driver, and over time. But in this environment, we are seeing continued lower move activity. Competition is still increased. And fixed wireless you brought out there, they're still pressing. However, we are seeing some rational promotional activity; it's early, no changes to any trending, but when you see that in the competitive environment that is encouraging. Both voluntary and non-paid churn remain below pre-pandemic levels, and that has continued. So, our game plan in this environment is we're going to invest in our network, we're going to focus on upgrading, and the mid-split, all that activity is on track leading to 4.0 beginning the deployments and trialing activity starting at the end of the year. No change to our game plan. And we're going to segment the base. And we've consistently focused on the starting point high-end broadband activity in tiers, a third of our customers-plus are on 1 gig, and we've launched our new 2-gig service to 25% of our footprint, and overall, 75% of our customers or for 100 megabits or more. So, we're going to continue to leverage mobile, and we're going to press aggressively with mobile, and even new broadband partners, like NOW TV, which is a great streaming video tier that showcases Peacock. And the net of this is a stable base, 32 million residential broadband customers, and while protecting resi broadband ARPU growth. You saw us do that in Q2 at 4.5% ARPU growth. But in this environment, we're still competitive in lower activity superior to flux, and in some quarters, we may report customer losses. That being said, to your question, we believe, over time, we will return to subscriber growth. And certainly we're seeing more normalization. Back-to-school is going to happen in Q3. And most certainly there's some seasonal normalization. But over time, I'm confident that we will be able to balance this formula of ARPU, focus, and over time, getting back to the subscriber growth. Mike? Thanks, Craig. This is Dave. So, let me start with the wireless MVNO question then. So, let me start with we have a great MVNO, and really like our approach towards the business from day one, and continue to feel that way. And definitely think that cable is a material and really strong benefit to our partner. And so, have a good relationship with Verizon. And so, that continues. Really key is we have a perpetual access to all the services that we need from Verizon's network. So, it's just straightforward, that's the way it is. So, let me start with -- then let me go into the handset subsidy point. We go in, and we go out in terms of different offers. So, we've always consistently had promotions. And they come in different forms. It can be the form of gift cards, can be outright promotions that are discounts, and in some cases, a free device, but it's not every day. That's not part of our everyday game plan; we will go in and out with that. And we increasingly focus on higher-end mobile tiers, and we have a great slate there between by-the-gig, unlimited, and premium unlimited. So, we stay very focused on the core service offering, and been very strong in terms of the really consistent performance in terms of wireless growth. We really like the long runway ahead that we have and things, so we're just getting going in small business and wireless. But I think our core wireless pricing provides customers with the savings that help us compete against the telephone companies, like between 30% and 50% savings versus the telecos. And so, we got a strong position partnering mobile with broadband, got great WiFi overlay, and a strong MVNO, as I've said. So, we like our capital-light approach. We like our core service offering approach, and it's been effective. Yes, this is Dave. Let me jump into that. So, we operate in 39 states, where they're expected to bid subsidy money, and we are actively engaged both at the federal and state government levels. So, as the framework rules of bid participation are being developed, we are actively looking at it and working I think in a good way at all level.

This is a '25-'26 kind of an impact once it clears up. But in the meantime, we're actively edging out and looking at opportunities where it's a profitable return and aggressively pursuing it.

            "name": "Jason Armstrong",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. We had a really strong second quarter. And to take you through it, I'll start with our consolidated results on slide four. Revenue increased 2% to $30.5 billion, while adjusted EBITDA grew 4% to $10.2 billion, a record level driven by continued operating leverage at our high-margin Connectivity & Platforms business, as well as strong growth at Studios and Theme Parks. We grew adjusted earnings per share by 12% to $1.13, and generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow, while returning $3.2 billion of capital to shareholders. Our healthy level of free cash flow in the quarter includes the significant investments we're making to support and grow our businesses in six key growth areas; our connectivity businesses including Residential Broadband, Wireless, and Business Services Connectivity, Theme Parks, Streaming, and premium content in our studios. Taken together, these areas generated more than half of our total company revenue in the quarter, and grew nearly 10% year-over-year, consistent with the first quarter. Now, let's turn to our individual business results, starting on slide five, with Connectivity & Platforms. As I get into these results, I'll refer to year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis. Revenue for total Connectivity & Platforms was flat at $20.4 billion. Our core connectivity businesses, domestic broadband, domestic wireless, international connectivity, and Business Services Connectivity increased 7% to over $10 billion in revenue, while video, advertising, and other revenue declined 7% to $9.8 billion. Our strategy continues to incorporate a strong focus on investing in and driving growth in high-margin businesses while protecting profitability in businesses with secular headwinds through disciplined cost management. This resulted in 170 basis points of margin expansion for Connectivity & Platforms in the second quarter, while margins for our domestic legacy cable business improved 240 basis points, reaching a record high of 47.3%. Diving deeper into the details, first, I'll unpack connectivity revenue growth. Residential Connectivity revenue grew by 8%, reflecting 4% growth in domestic broadband, 20% growth in wireless, and 26% growth in international, while revenue for Business Services Connectivity grew 4%. Domestic broadband continued to be led by very strong ARPU growth, which increased 4.5% for the second consecutive quarter. As we have said before, our goal is to protect ARPU by retaining the appropriate balance between rate and volume, and to serve our customers' constant demand for more from our network. We continue to see the use cases for better and faster Internet increase. Demand for higher speeds is increasing, as is average network consumption, and our customers are hanging more devices off our network in their homes. The average monthly data usage for a broadband customer that doesn't take video from us is nearly 700 gigabytes, and continues to grow. In fact, this is nearly 70% more than the average usage from the comparable quarter in 2019, pre-pandemic. Additionally, nearly three quarters of our broadband customers are now in speed plans of 400 megs and above. That's up from less than 50% last year and less than 20% in 2020. We plan for our network and product capabilities to stay far ahead of demand, so that we maintain our position as the market leader, delivering the best broadband possible. To that end, our transition to DOCSIS 4.0 is progressing well. We are more than halfway through the year, and have implemented on mid-split technology at 25% of our footprint, and are on target to complete one-third of this build by year-end, with the first commercial launch of DOCSIS 4.0 in just a few short months. We are also hard at work when it comes to expanding our footprint. We've grown our homes and businesses past by 1.5% year-over-year to 61.8 million, and we are on pace to meet or exceed our goal of 1 million new homes and businesses past for 2023, with future footprint expansion remaining a high priority. Growth in domestic wireless revenue was due to higher service revenue, driven by continued strong momentum in customer lines, which were up $1.4 million or 30% year-over-year, to $6 million in total, including the 316,000 lines we just added in the quarter. This marked the seventh consecutive quarter of more than 300,000 line additions. We continue testing some new converged offers in the quarter, and we are encouraged by an increasing mix of new customers to Comcast. And we will continue to experiment with different offers over time. With just 10% of our domestic residential broadband customers taking our mobile offering, we have a big opportunity and long runway ahead for growth in wireless. International connectivity revenue grew to $1 billion, a record high, and demonstrates the strength of the Sky brand and the ability to leverage a leadership position in video, and extend that to connectivity with significant success. Broadband, which accounts for two-thirds of international connectivity revenue continue to grow at a mid-teens level, benefiting from both an increase in customers and ARPU, compared to a year ago. The remainder is wireless revenue, which tends to have more variable growth due to handsets, which contributed to the higher growth this quarter. Finally, on Business Services Connectivity, revenue increased 4%, reflecting stronger growth in enterprise and mid-market and a slight deceleration in growth from small business, where we are seeing a bit of macro economic pressure. The strong revenue growth overall in our connectivity businesses was offset by declines in video, due to customer losses since last year, as well as declines in other revenue, reflecting similar dynamics in wireline voice. And finally, in advertising, which was impacted by lower political revenue in our domestic markets and the macro environment. Connectivity in platforms total EBITDA increased 4% to $8.3 billion, and as I mentioned a moment ago, adjusted margin that expanded 170 basis points. This is driven by the mix shift to our high margin connectivity businesses coupled with very strong expense management. In fact every line of expense was down year-over-year, except direct product costs, which are success-based and directly associated with the significant growth in our connectivity businesses. Further on tacking our connectivity and platform's EBITDA results between residential and business, residential EBITDA grew 4% with margin improving 180 basis points to reach 38.9%, again, highlighting our favorable mix shift, while business EBITDA grew 5% with margin improving 40 basis points to reach 57.7%. Now, let's turn to Content & Experiences on slide six. Content & Experiences revenue increased 4% to $10.9 billion, and EBITDA increased 7.5% to $2.2 billion, driven by record results at parks and strong growth at studios, fueled by the success of Super Mario Brothers. Taking a closer look at the results, our media segment combines our TV networks and Peacock, matching our holistic approach to managing these businesses. As viewership shifts to streaming, our dual revenue strategy at Peacock, where we are growing advertising and distribution revenue, is offsetting declines in linear revenue. At the same time, we are managing costs at our linear networks, and reallocating some of these resources to Peacock, with the goal of maximizing profitability over the long-term across our media portfolio. You see that in our media results this quarter was stable revenue, a strong growth in Peacock offset the performance at our linear networks. Immediate EBITDA decreased 18%, which included a $651 million EBITDA loss at Peacock. To get a little further into details, domestic advertising declined 5% with underlying trends consistent to prior quarters, reflecting continued softness in the overall market, partially offset by strong growth in advertising at Peacock, which increased over 75% driven by strong demand. We expect these overall results in advertising to continue in the third quarter. Domestic distribution increased 2% driven by Peacock distribution revenue growth of nearly 70%. Peacock paid scribers landed at $24 million compared to $30 million a year ago and $22 million at the end of the first quarter. As Mike mentioned, in June we began an effort to transition Comcast bundle scribers who received Peacock for free to a paid relationship. We've made some nice progress to date as the conversion activity drove Peacock second quarter subscriber growth. And we are bullish on further increasing our Peacock subscriber base through the balance of 2023, driven by both our continued conversion efforts as well as strong programming in the second-half. Some highlights included strong line up of movies exclusively on Peacock in our Pay-One window including Super Mario Bros. coming August 3rd; a day & date movie, Blumhouse, Five Nights at Freddy's coming at the end of October. And continued benefit from our next day broadcast Bravo content along with a strong sports lineup including Sunday Night Football, and for the first time, Big Ten. Turning to Studios, we had a great quarter driven by our film business including the latest installment of the Fast franchise and a tremendous success of Super Mario Bros. While theatrical revenue growth was offset by lower content licensing at our television studios due the timing of when we deliver content, the momentum in our film business led by the success of Mario fueled nearly $260 million in year-over-year growth in studio EBITDA. At Theme Parks, revenue increased 22% and EBITDA increased 32% to $833 million, a record level. Our park in Hollywood continued momentum from opening Super Nintendo World last quarter. The positive consumer reaction drove strong attendance and per cap growth, helping Hollywood to deliver its best quarter EBITDA in its history. Our international parks are both experiencing nice rebound post COVID. Our park in Osaka delivered a record level of EBITDA for a second quarter as it continues to benefit from strong demand from Super Nintendo World. And our park in Beijing enjoyed its most profitable quarter to date, resulting in strong improvement compared to last year when the park was largely closed due to COVID. In Orlando, our comparisons were impacted by unprecedented levels of visitation last year. But underlying momentum remains healthy as attendance was relatively in line with 2019 pre-pandemic levels while revenue was substantially ahead of 2019 levels. I'll now wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 7. As I mentioned previously, we generated $3.4 billion in free cash flow this quarter, and achieved this while absorbing meaningful investments in our network and theme parks. These investments drove a 20% increase in total capital spending, primarily driven by higher CapEx which was consistent with the outlook that we provided on our last quarter call. At Connectivity & Platforms, CapEx increased to 11% with CapEx intensity coming in at 10.4%, primarily driven by investments to accelerate our home passed as well as transition our U.S. network to DOCSIS 4.0. Content & Experiences CapEx increased by $344 million, driven by parks, with Epic accounting for the majority of this quarter's increase in spend. Turning to return on capital and our balance sheet, we repurchased $2 billion worth of shares in the quarter. In addition, dividend payments totaled $1.2 billion for a total return on capital in the second quarter of $3.2 billion. We ended the quarter with net leverage of 2.4 times, in line with our target leverage. With that, let me turn it over to Brian for a few words before we turn the call back to Marci. So, sports rights, going back to that last question, for all the reasons I said, and I will keep it shorter this time, we should -- we are always looking to see if there is ways to add more value to our business, and likewise work with our partners. So, obviously NBA is coming up. That's a fantastic property. We don't necessarily need it, given the portfolio we have, but given, it's strength and our historical involvement in the sports, something I would like to see is take a look at, as if, for instance. But we will see where that goes. And then on theme parks, we have -- you know, I think one of the best quarters we have seen, tremendous momentum in the overall portfolio, we feel very, very good about the parks business overall. Hollywood was a record on the back of Nintendo opening up; Japan doing well and a record as well there for second quarter; and Beijing, highest level of profitability. In Orlando, it is -- really compares very well to pre-pandemic. We are obviously down on attendance, which was kind of unprecedented in the back of coming of COVID, so, not surprised by that softening. That said, we are at levels of attendance and per caps being better, so that overall we feel good about what we are seeing in Orlando. We've had -- you know, with the stronger dollar you still are seeing softness of international attendance, which continues to be about 30% lower than pre-pandemic levels. We expect that to sort of continue. And on the domestic side, it's just been rebalancing with cruise lines back and people, the flipside of the dollar doing some international travel. It's the dynamics that you see in Orlando. We feel very good about what's going on there. And Brian, you can jump in here. Yes, and I think Stephen, important for us as we came into this year with the re-segmentation, how we start to present it out to the world, this was an important category. So, international connectivity, as we think about Sky and taking the brand name and reputation that they sort of earned in video and taking that into other products like broadband and wireless, the way they have, this quarter $1 billion in revenue coming from connectivity international. So, kudos to the team, and I think it's important that we've been able to highlight that at the street. Yes, thanks, John; good question. So, on mix and margins in the connectivity business, I think we have had a fairly consistent track record if you look at the last several years of margin expansion. If you look at the core sort of legacy cable business, as we mentioned this quarter, record margin over 47%. And the factors that have contributed to that historically are in place as we look forward. I think Mike's comment upfront about being able to grow revenue, being able to grow margins; that's a key part of it. So, to your question specifically on connectivity, there is a mix shift going on, when we talk about sort of the six key growth drivers across the company, three are sort of core connectivity growth drivers, whether it's residential broadband, business services, or wireless, this is an accretive mix shift for us, as we think about the way the categories are sort of shifting and what's growing versus what's not growing. So, I would look for more of the same. I think also importantly for the team for the second consecutive quarter, every expense line in connectivity and platforms was down year-over-year, except for direct product costs, and those are the costs that directly support the connectivity and platforms, revenue growth and the categories we talked about. So, our outlook for more of the same in continued margin expansion out of the business. I think on Peacock, you are right, we came into the year, and gave guidance for roughly $3 billion in losses, no change to that. And as you see, we are pacing to that over the first couple of quarters. We've got a lot of incremental content as we think in the back-half of the year, as Mike said, so no change to that guidance. Yes. Jonathan, thanks for the question on wireless, can't speak to Verizon and their revenue trajectory. I know they have got a few different things in the wholesale revenue category beyond just cable. But I can speak to obviously the economics of our business. We are happy with it. We think it's good business for Verizon. What they said yesterday as they think about traffic and ways to fill up their network. But for us specifically, we've got a revenue stream coming in from customers. We have a wholesale deal with Verizon to accommodate that traffic where there is outflows, but then, we are also trying to offload as much traffic as we can on our own network. We've got a fairly efficient acquisition vehicle. And a lot of this is just marketed to our own broadband subscriber. So, in terms of acquisition cost, I think we are fairly efficient in the market. And then all the way down sort of closer to cash flow, this is a capital-light model, which we like. So, I will leave it there."

            "name": "Michael Cavanagh",
            "content": "Thanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our second quarter results, which again demonstrate that our focused efforts to invest and innovate in businesses that offer significant revenue growth, while we carefully manage the contiguous areas with structurally lower growth is paying off. Total revenue grew 2%, and the sixth growth priority areas we have outlined: residential broadband, wireless, business services, theme parks, streaming and premium content creation in our studios, grew nearly 10% year-over-year, and now represent 55% of total revenue. This revenue growth combined with careful management of margins across all businesses generated mid single-digit EBITDA growth and double-digit earnings per share growth. Looking farther into the future, we expect to continue to drive significant growth in these areas, and to continue to identify and invest in organic growth opportunities across our strong portfolio of businesses. We are also very clear-eyed about the challenges that we and our competitors face in other business lines, and have established thoughtful plans which will enable these businesses to continue to meaningfully contribute both financially and strategically. Importantly, the net effect of this approach is a path to sustained future revenue growth for the company in total, driving strong earnings and free cash flow growth for, what I expect to be, many years to come. Significantly, we have by far the strongest balance sheet among our core competitors, which allows us to continue to invest for growth while returning substantial capital to shareholders through both dividends and buybacks which will drive excellent free cash flow and earnings per share growth. Now, let me call out a few highlights from the quarter. For the first time in the company's history, we generated over $10 billion in quarterly EBITDA. And while the diversification of our businesses means there were several significant contributors, I would highlight three that stand out to me in the quarter and reflect the consistency of our investments and the resulting durability of our growth profile. The first is broadband ARPU growth of 4.5%. Stepping back, I am confident we have a winning hand in convergence. We are the largest broadband provider with a high-quality ubiquitous network, and the most cost-efficient upgrade path to higher speeds. In addition, we can compete effectively in wireless with a capital-light approach, and a very strong value proposition for our customers. We also have a long history of consistently surrounding our products with industry-leading features and capabilities, ranging from the coverage and control aspects of our WiFi experience, to content aggregation through our X1 and Flex platforms, which is how we have been able to achieve near-record low levels of churn and grow ARPU consistently quarter after quarter. This second quarter's 4.5% growth was no exception, and is a testament to our ability to appropriately balance rate and volume to effectively segment the market and surround our broadband product with industry-leading products and capabilities. The broadband market remains highly competitive, but we have and will continue to invest to sustain our position as a market leader. Second is our parks, which continues to be such a great story for us. Our teams have consistently introduced new and innovative attractions, leveraging both our owned or licensed IP. We opened Super Nintendo World at both Universal Hollywood and Japan, which helped drive the record results in the quarter. Later this summer, we will be opening a new Minion Land in Orlando, and we look forward to Donkey Kong, in Japan, next year, as well as starting the previously announced kid's theme park, in Texas, and the Halloween Horror experience, in Las Vegas. And I couldn't be more excited about the opening of Epic Universe, in Orlando, in 2025. Third is the strength of our film studios and in particular our animation business. Super Mario Bros. crossed over $1.3 billion in worldwide box office to date, making it the second-highest grossing animated film ever. This is another incredible achievement by Illumination and Chris Meledandri. We also invest in successful franchises like Fast, highlighted by the successful launch of the latest installment with Fast X during the quarter. Of course, we just released Oppenheimer, which gross about $180 million this past weekend to tremendous acclaim from critics and moviegoers alike. Oppenheimer is such a powerful and impactful movie, and we at Comcast couldn't be proud to work with Christopher Nolan to bring such an important movie to audiences globally. We have the very best roster of creative partners, and these innovative filmmakers enable us to invest in a strategic slate, which is one of the keys to our continued box office success where we remain number two in box office year-to-date. All of these results and accomplishments, from broadband differentiation, to studio leadership, to our park success are a function of our focused leadership team, commitment to innovation, strong balance sheet, and disciplined approach to capital allocation. As I look at our company, I am extremely bullish on the durability of growth drivers we have invested in so consistently, and in our continued ability to invest and deliver through a variety of businesses and economic cycles. This was also my first quarter with direct responsibility for NBCUniversal. And I observed in a note announcing some organizational changes a few weeks ago, NBCU is a very special place with tremendous opportunities ahead. I could not be more impressed with the depth of talent, and particularly with our leadership team. And I am very confident that the new streamlined organization we have just put in place, and which has been very well received will help us move even faster and make even better decisions. As you know, NBCU operates a diverse array of businesses, each with leading market positions. In addition to film and parks, which I referenced earlier, we have the number one TV portfolio by total audience, and our TV studio is award-winning and prolific. We're the number one most watched news organization in the U.S., and sports continues to be a huge driver, with the NFL, NASCAR, gold, Premier League, the World Cup on Telemundo, including the Women's World Cup going on right now, Big Ten starting this fall, and the Paris Olympics coming up next year. I am also confident that we have the right strategy for the future. We produce premium content through our studios, distributed through our TV networks, Peacock and third parties, and further monetize this content with our theme parks and consumer products. In streaming, we launched Peacock as an ad-supported model that is an extension of our existing business. We set out a plan, which we have adapted as needed, and Peacock is strong and growing. We gained two million paid subscribers in the second quarter, going from 22 million to 24 million paid subscribers. This growth was largely driven by conversion of Comcast subs to paying relationships which started in June. And we're very pleased with the results so far. Without a doubt, consumer trends such as cord-cutting and new competitors, particularly from the technology sector present challenges for us. And we are facing an uncertain macro environment which continues to pressure linear advertising. But I firmly believe that we have the business strategy, management dept, and financial strength to emerge as long-term winners and value creators as the landscape evolves at NBCUniversal, and across the company. Another challenge in the near-term are the writers and actors strikes. We remain committed to reaching a fair deal as soon as possible so we can get back to doing what we do best, which is making great content together. With that, let me turn it over to Jason. Thanks, Dave, so, hey, good morning, Ben. So, I think I'd just add a point, that if you look back at the first-half of the year, what Dave and his team have been doing and continue to do in terms of setting the broadband business, which is obviously extremely important to the future of the company, up for long-term success by continuing to improve our product, add innovation around it, segment the base, extend the footprint, all the things that you want to see happen, and while protecting pricing are all outstanding work in a competitive moment in time. But I think as you know, we here and Dave and his team, in particular, are thinking what are the implications for the long-term as we think about how to compete in the short-term. Going to your question on the NBC side on strikes, I'll just repeat what I said earlier, which is that we are committed to reaching a fair deal with the guilds as soon as possible. Beyond that, I'd just it's really for all involved in the industry broadly, a prolonged work stoppage and the longer it goes the worse it'll be. It's obviously going to have a negative impact all around. To your question about free cash flow, nothing to quantify in the context of our company, I mean it's all manageable. But it will shift studio working capital out of the near-term and into the future, so probably for 2023 a little bit of lower working capital, higher free cash flow, and the flipside of that in 2024. As you look at Peacock, I wouldn't point out anything in particular related to strikes and its effect in 2023 or second-half of the year. Obviously, the longer the strike the more that could have an affect as you look into 2024 and beyond, and that would be for ourselves and others, obviously. So, it's a level playing field. But to comment on Peacock in particular in the second-half, we've got a lot of strong content coming. So, we've got NFL coming back. Obviously then on top of that we have an exclusive NFL wild-card game. We're going to have Big Ten for the first time, which is fantastic on Saturday nights. In the movie slates, we've got Super Mario Bros. coming to Peacock shortly, we've got Exorcist, Five Nights at Freddy's, as Jason pointed out, coming from Blumhouse. And then on TV side, some originals, including Continental, which is related to the John Wick franchise. So, we feel very good about the strength of what we have coming in the second-half of the year content-wise. And then beyond that, on Peacock, I think there'll be a continuation of the good work that we've done inside the company to convert Comcast subscribers over to a paying subscriber status, which we're not quite halfway through that as we only got started in June on that score. So, over the remainder of the year that will also be happening. So, when you look at the doubling of Peacock subs year-over-year, and I'm optimistic about what the second-half of the year brings, feel pretty good about Peacock. Thanks, Brett. It's Mike. So, I've been asked about, and read the speculation that in some way we might be interested in swapping businesses as part of what's going on in the sports space. And I would just say that that's very improbable, given the -- as you could imagine, there's tremendous issues around tax, minority shareholders, structuring generally. So, I would put aside the idea that there's anything inorganic that is likely to happen around ESPN in particular, which is what we've been asked about. When I think about our own sports business, I think we've got one of the best portfolios in sports. Saturday Night Football, Bit Ten, EPL, NASCAR, WWE, Olympics next year, PGA, so -- and we've got a very acclaimed group of people in terms of producing excellent content around those sports. So, obviously, it makes us a really strong partner to leagues and around the world, we're known for that. And I think we bring a lot to the table whenever there is a time, and that includes Sky Sports as well, obviously. So, that brings us to the table with more than money when it comes time for discussions around how rights owners want to create value for their participants. And I think we are doing a very good job, in my mind, of continuing to do that in a way that has tremendous reach, obviously through NBC in the broadcast side. We can leverage our cable nets as we've done in various sporting events using our cable nets. But really importantly is Peacock, and we looked at one of the great drivers of Peacock subscriber growth has been sports. And I think it adds to the value of the Peacock subscription, the fact that when we looked at the value of rights that are streamed inside Peacock, where it is and where it goes when you include the value of Olympics next year, it is very substantial, and would alone represent a really good deal for the consumer just sports within Peacock. So, I think that's how we see our evolution where in sports we are going to continue to be in sports and that's the game."

Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Executive Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thank you, operator, and welcome to our first quarter 2023 earnings call. You'll first hear from Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh and Jason Armstrong, then Dave Watson will join us and be available for Q&A. As a reminder, beginning this first quarter we have changed our presentation of segment operating results around two primary businesses; Connectivity & Platforms and Content & Experiences. For additional details please refer to our 8-K issued on March 13, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at www.cmcsa.com. I will now refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation accompanying this call, which can also be found on our investor relations website on which contains our Safe Harbor disclaimer. This conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our 8-K and trending schedule issued earlier this morning for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Roberts: Thanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. Before we get in the quarter, let me just acknowledge the news that you all saw earlier this week, obviously a tough moment. But we are so fortunate to have a fabulous and tenured leadership team at NBCUniversal. If you go down the list, you'll see many of them have been leading their divisions within the company for at least 10 years and are truly the best in the business. We're also lucky to have Mike Cavanagh step in at the helm at NBCUniversal while also remaining President. Mike is a fantastic executive and operator that many of you know well and he'll work closely with each of the management team at NBCUniversal to continue our excellent momentum. Mike, alongside with Jason Armstrong will lead these earnings calls on a go forward basis. Today, you'll hear from them about our strategic focus and drivers of growth now and over the long-term, and Jason will go into much greater details on the first quarter results. Dave Watson and I are here for the Q&A and you'll hear a lot more about the great momentum of our connectivity and platform businesses later in the call. Dave, thanks for getting off to a great start this year. So before I hand it over to Mike, I just want to share my quick perspective on our recent performance. This really was a strong quarter and start to the year, especially within the context of what continues to be a choppy macro environment. We grew adjusted EBITDA by 3% and adjusted EPS by 7%. In addition, we generated $3.8 billion of free cash flow and returned $3.2 billion of capital to shareholders, all while continuing to invest importantly in a number of major initiatives, which is a real testament to our very healthy balance sheet. Two things amongst many highlights in particular that stand out for me and I'm really proud of, one is the animation business. By strengthening and combining our capabilities across DreamWorks and Illumination led by Chris Meledandri, we've had tremendous success creating franchises that people know and love all over the world. Despicable Me, Shrek, Pets, Minions, and more recently Puss in Boots, and now Super Mario Bros., which just broke a number of records including the biggest worldwide opening of any animated film all time. These are the results of the strategic decision we made years ago to become a leader in animation and the conviction we've had to continue to invest in the business even during the depths of the pandemic, which are now clearly paying off. The second is Connectivity & Platforms. The significant margin expansion that we achieved this quarter, coupled with a 4.5% ARPU growth in domestic residential broadband demonstrates successful discipline and excellent management in a challenging competitive environment. We're focused on delivering a superior experience and profitably serving our customers and it shows. And with that, let me now hand the call over to Mike.\nMichael Cavanagh: Thanks Brian. We had a great start to 2023 and have set ourselves up for another strong year. We have amazing talent at all levels of our company and DNA that fosters creativity and collaboration, resulting in operational excellence that is second to none. Couple that with our position as a scaled leader in very large and profitable markets with tens of millions of customers paying us over a $100 per month, as well as hundreds of millions of TV and streaming viewers, and we have an extremely healthy balance sheet enabling us to invest in all of our strategic opportunities and for great returns, while also returning a healthy amount of capital to shareholders. As pleased as we are with our results in the first quarter, any company's performance in a quarter is just a milestone of progress against a longer term strategy and plan. And so before we dive deeper into the details of the last few months, I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about the drivers of our growth over the longer term and where we're focusing most of our time and resources. I put these in four buckets, residential connectivity, business services connectivity, our theme parks and experiences and our premium content creation. I'll start with residential connectivity, which is comprised of domestic broadband, domestic wireless and international connectivity. Broadband is a fantastic business. It's a great product for the consumer and demand continues to rise. People are connecting more and more devices to our network and they're consuming a tremendous amount of data. Right now, the average monthly data usage for a broadband customer that doesn't take video from us is nearly 700 gigabytes, and there is a related increase in the importance of reliability and speed with roughly one third of our customers at one gigabit or higher and nearly three quarters at or above 400 megabits. For us, the consumer's already high and increasing level of expectation for their broadband experience is an important trend. And while the marketplace is competitive, such that adding subs in the near-term is likely to be a challenge. I fully expect we will eventually return to subscriber growth. We have the best handout there to win against all the competing technologies, whether it's fiber or fixed wireless. We view fiber as our long-term competitor. We've been successfully competing against fiber for about 20 years, yet still built a base of 32 million broadband customers over this time period.\nDOCSIS: A more recent competitor is fixed wireless, which we view as a substandard and temporary solution for a certain segment based on their needs at this moment in time. Our approach is to compete rationally. We know how to segment the market. We have packages that cater to customers who want the very fastest speeds and premium features and others that are more targeted to those looking for value-oriented solutions. We trialed a couple of offers targeted to this lower end during the quarter. We were pleased with the results and will continue to remain nimble and respond competitively in each segment. In the meantime, as the residential connectivity market and macroeconomic environment continue to evolve, our focus will be on serving our existing base, growing broadband ARPU, increasing our penetration and wireless and making proactive investments to expand our footprint at the fastest pace in our history. You saw us do this all of last year and in the first quarter, and I expect this trend to continue. Our second major growth opportunity, business services, which is approaching $10 billion in annual revenue, is growing at mid-single digits with newly reported margins just shy of 60% and delivering adjusted EBITDA growth in the high single digit range. Here too our advanced and adaptable network infrastructure is much better suited to serving commercial and government locations compared to the legacy wire line and wireless providers. We move fast and are more capable of reliably and cost effectively meeting our customer's needs. We already have over 2.5 million domestic business customers, more than any other competitor and are targeting a $50 billion market opportunity within our footprint and a $70 billion to $100 billion total market opportunity that we can now go after by leveraging our technology and partners outside of our footprint. Our third major growth opportunity is in creating experiences from our own intellectual property as well as special IP that we license from others and bring to life at our theme parks, like Harry Potter or Nintendo's characters like Mario. Our parks are resonating with our customers and this segment is clearly on a roll. Japan has come roaring back and Beijing returned to profitability following last year, when both were operating under COVID-related restrictions. And on the domestic side, Orlando continues to do well and Hollywood just opened Super Nintendo World with great success. This outstanding performance provides us with even more confidence that the investments we are making in new lands and attractions will also generate strong returns and I'm excited for what's to come. Donkey Kong, another Nintendo land to open in Japan in 2024, Epic Universe in Orlando in 2025, as well as the smaller park concepts that we recently announced, a horror themed experience in Las Vegas, and a new park in Texas that's specifically designed for younger guests and their families. Our fourth growth area is content and especially on the streaming side. We have a decade's deep library of iconic films and television and we spend over $20 billion each year to produce and provide programming that spans every genre; sports, news, entertainment, dramas and film, which has resulted in the broadest reach of any media company. Over 100 million people engage with our content every month. In film we were number two in the worldwide box office last year with Jurassic, Minions and Halloween. And based on the current course we are trending to do even better in 2023. We've started the year off with home runs and terrific momentum, carryover from Puss in Boots, the success from Megan and now Super Mario Bros., which in just three weekends has already crossed $875 million at the global box office. We're really proud of our animation business. We've been in the movie business for a hundred years and it's exciting how we've been able to create and monetize our entire movie slate in animation and beyond and in so many ways, including the innovative changes we've made in movie windowing. We made the strategic decision to put our Pay-One window on Peacock, which really kicked in at the end of last year. We now have one of the most robust movie offerings on streaming. The hits we have at the box office roll onto Peacock, and this is proving to be both a successful acquisition and retention tool. Add to that the strength of content from our TV studio, which powers the content on NBC and helped make us number one for many years from all the Dick Wolf procedurals and SNL coupled with highly popular content on Bravo, this all goes to Peacock the next day. Add to this our originals where we're just getting started. Shows like Poker Face, which launched and immediately landed near the top of Nielsen's U.S. Streaming Original List and we have lots more coming. On top of all this we have an incredible lineup of sports; Sunday Night Football, Premier League, and soon Big 10. We believe we have the right strategy for Peacock and one that's suited to our strengths. Premium content with a dual revenue stream, both advertising and subscription fees, and we're encouraged by our results so far, growing paid subscribers and engagement levels to roughly 20 hours per subscriber per month fueling strong growth in advertising revenues. We're investing, but the results we are seeing give us confidence that we are on the right path for Peacock to break even and grow from there. Looking across our entire organization, I couldn't think of a more advantageous position to be in to monetize the increasing expectations and demand, as well as the changing habits of the global consumer. We're the best broadband company with the best content that can be accessed over the best distribution and aggregation platforms. I'm excited about all of our areas of growth. Together, they represent the majority of our revenue and our businesses with high incremental margins. As a result, these growth areas should become the dominant driver of our financial results for years to come. With that, I'll hand it over to Jason to talk about the quarter.\nJason Armstrong: Thanks Mike and good morning everyone. In late February we announced that starting this quarter we will be reporting our results in two reportable business units; Connectivity & platforms and Content & Experiences, more closely align our like-minded businesses, reflect how we run our company and highlight our opportunities for growth as a globally integrated content distribution company. We're also providing more disclosure around areas that have become increasingly important to our overall results, namely Business Services and Peacock. Let's start with our consolidated first quarter results on Slide 4. Total company revenue of $29.7 billion declined 4% due to the tough comparison to last year's Winter Olympics and Super Bowl, as well as the negative impact of foreign currency. While our total company adjusted EBITDA grew 3% thanks to continued strong operating leverage at our high margin Connectivity & Platforms business. Excluding the impacts of the Winter Olympics and Super Bowl and adjusting for constant currency, total company revenue increased 1.5%. We grew adjusted earnings per share by 7% to $0.92 and generated $3.8 billion of free cash flow while returning $3.2 billion of capital to shareholders in the first quarter. This is in addition to significant investments to support and grow our businesses, including our transition to DOCSIS 4.0 and footprint expansion in broadband, the construction of Epic, as well as consistent flow of new lands and attractions at our theme parks, and content production at our studios, which feeds into Peacock, a robust third party licensing opportunity and a really successful film business. When taken together, these investment areas generated over half of total company revenue in the first quarter with growth of 10% year-over-year. Now let's turn to our business results starting on Slide 5 with Connectivity & Platforms. As a reminder, our largest foreign exchange exposure is the British pound, which was down over 9% year-over-year. So in order to highlight the underlying performance of the business, I'll speak to our results at Connectivity & Platforms on a constant currency basis. Revenue was flat this quarter, but this is worth unpacking. Our core connectivity revenues, residential and business grew over 7% to $10 billion, while video, advertising and other revenues declined 7% to $9.8 billion. Year-over-year we generated 160 basis points of margin expansion for Connectivity & Platforms on a total basis. This is reflective of our strategy of investing in and driving growth in high margin businesses while protecting profitability in businesses with secular headwinds through disciplined cost control. To get into more detail, residential connectivity revenue grew by 8% with 5% growth in domestic broadband, 27% growth in wireless, and 18% growth in international. In business services connectivity revenue continued to grow at a healthy mid-single digit pace. Our domestic residential broadband customer base this quarter remained stable over both the last year and in the quarter with churn remaining below pre-pandemic levels. While we had some success towards the end of the quarter with a couple of offers targeting the lower end of the market, the broadband environment remains highly competitive right now, particularly at the lower end. And as such, our view remains that 2023 will be a challenging period for us to add subs. Our outlook for growth and our strategy has been consistent. We will compete aggressively, but do so in a financially disciplined way. While we expect to return to growth in broadband subscribers over time, during this interim period as well as over the longer-term, we will focus on protecting and growing broadband ARPU and we're pleased with the 4.5% year-over-year increase in ARPU in the quarter. We expect continued strong revenue growth over the course of 2023 and expect ARPU will be the primary driver. Growth in domestic wireless revenue was a function of higher service revenue, driven by continued strong momentum in customer lines, which are up 1.4 million or 32% year-over-year to 5.7 million in total, including the 355,000 lines we just added, which was a record high for a first quarter. There is clearly demand for a converged offering that delivers reliable and fast speeds both in and out of the home. We are extremely well positioned to take advantage of this trend and have a long runway for growth as less than 10% of our broadband accounts currently take our mobile offering. A new disclosure category for us is international connectivity. Roughly two two-thirds of international connectivity revenue is broadband growing at mid-teens levels. The remaining one-third is wireless, of which a big portion comes from device sales and therefore tends to fluctuate with the timing of device launches. The rest of wireless is service revenue, which is growing nicely due to additional customer lines and healthy ARPU growth. The strong revenue growth in our connectivity businesses was offset by declines in video due to customer losses relative to last year. In other revenue reflecting similar dynamics in wire line voice and in advertising, which was impacted by a tough macro environment in addition to lower political revenue in our domestic markets. On the expense side, every expense line item declined in the first quarter with the exception of direct product costs, which are success based and directly associated with the significant growth in our connectivity businesses. The strong execution by the team to deliver sustainable operating efficiencies coupled with solid growth in our high margin connectivity businesses, resulted in Connectivity & Platforms EBITDA growth of 4% to $8.1 billion and as I mentioned a moment ago, an adjusted margin expanding 160 basis points year-over-year. And that is despite some temporary margin headwinds in our international business associated with some pressure on revenue due to a challenging macro environment and higher programming costs for sports channels, which were up this year given the timing of events. Margin for our domestic legacy cable business improved 250 basis points reaching a record high of 46.5%. We've added disclosure this quarter and going forward to break down profitability between residential and business services, residential Connectivity & Platforms EBITDA grew 3% with margin improving 140 basis points to reach 37.8% highlighting favorable revenue mix shifts. Business services connectivity EBITDA grew 8% with margin expanding 150 basis points to reach 58.3%. Over the years we've talked about business services as a driver of margin accretive growth, and we're excited to augment our disclosure in this area for the first time. Our results in the quarter and our new reporting structure clearly show that. This is a business that generated over $5 billion of EBITDA in 2022 with substantial growth ahead and should be a material contributor to our growth profile in Connectivity & Platforms and overall. Wrapping up on Connectivity & Platforms, I'm proud of the team successfully navigating a transition in which we're managing businesses that have secular headwinds with an appropriately high level of cost discipline, while investing in others that clearly have strong revenue growth and margin characteristics. Now let's turn to Content & Experiences on Slide 6. Content & Experiences revenue decreased nearly 10%, reflecting the difficult comparison to last year, which included $1.5 billion of revenue from the Winter Olympics and the Super Bowl reported in our Media segment. And EBITDA decreased 1%, as a record first quarter at parks and strong studio growth driven by a successful film slate was offset by the planned increase in our Peacock investment as well as lower linear advertising sales. Unpacking these results further Media revenue decreased 21% on an as reported basis and 2% when excluding the Olympics and Super Bowl, primarily due to 6% decline in domestic advertising reflecting softness in the overall ad market, which appears to have stabilized, offset somewhat by strong growth in Peacock advertising revenue. When you exclude Olympics and Super Bowl, Peacock advertising increased an impressive 90%. Domestic distribution revenue decreased 8%, but was up 4%, excluding the Olympics driven by Peacock with distribution revenue up 83%. In total Peacock revenue increased by 45% to $685 million led by strong growth in paid subscribers, which were up over 60% year-over-year, ending the quarter with nearly 22 million paid subs, which marked another terrific milestone on our path to scaling the service. We're encouraged with the trends we're seeing at Peacock. While we've proven that special content and major events like the World Cup at the end of last year can be significant acquisition drivers, perhaps equally or even more important is sustaining engagement following this type of acquisition content and delivering on retention. We saw that in the first quarter and we look forward to reporting further momentum in the enhanced disclosures we're now providing for Peacock, including the revenue breakdown between advertising and distribution and costs separated by programming and production versus marketing promotion and other. Another new category that we added to our Media disclosure is international networks. This is mainly distribution revenue for Sky Sports and the low single digit revenue increase in the quarter was driven by higher distribution revenue, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Other revenue decreased 21% due to lower content licensing. Media EBITDA decreased 26%, including a $704 million EBITDA loss at Peacock. We view Media as one business, and while we have made cost reductions at our linear networks, we reallocated some of these resources to Peacock with the goal of maximizing profitability over the short and long-term across streaming and linear. We continue to expect Peacock losses for the year to be around $3 billion, which we believe will be peak losses for Peacock and then begin to steadily improve. At Studios, this was a great quarter for our film slate with strong theatrical revenue growth, driven by the successful carryover from Puss in Boots Last Wish, which launched at the end of the fourth quarter, as well as new releases such as Megan and Cocaine Bear. While revenue growth was partially offset by lower content licensing at our television studios, the momentum in our film business drove a 13% increase in Studio EBITDA, which also included marketing and promotion expense associated with the April 5th release of Super Mario Bros., which is fueling a strong start to our second quarter. At Theme Parks, revenue grew 25% and EBITDA 46% to $658 million, thanks to a continued rebound following the lift of COVID restrictions and a testament to the significant investments we've made at our parks. While demand and financial results were strong across the board, our international parks drove most of the growth this quarter. With Japan no longer impacted by COVID restrictions, our park in Osaka continued to rebound and we are seeing significant demand for Super Nintendo World, which we opened in early 2021. But given the COVID-related restrictions that were in place, many people couldn't visit the park. Our park in Beijing was also impacted by COVID-related restrictions last year and is now growing at a very healthy rate. Beijing showed strong year-over-year improvement and was profitable in the quarter despite normal winter seasonal headwinds. On the domestic side Hollywood enjoyed record first quarter results due to the very successful opening of Super Nintendo World, while Orlando continues to trend above pre-pandemic levels. I'll now wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 7. As I mentioned previously, we generated $3.8 billion in free cash flow this quarter and achieved this while absorbing a high level of working capital and making meaningful investments in our network and theme parks. These investments drove a 37% increase in total capital spending, primarily driven by higher CapEx.\nDOCSIS 4.0,: Content & Experiences CapEx increased by $343 million, driven by parks, with Epic accounting for the majority of this quarter's increase in spend. As we noted on our year end call, we expect parks CapEx in 2023 to increase by around $1.2 billion, remain elevated in 2024, and then decrease in 2025 the year we open Epic. Wrapping up, since this is my first quarter as CFO, let me reiterate our capital allocation framework. First is to invest for growth in our businesses. We've talked through many examples today, Epic, our broadband network, streaming and aggregation to name a few. Second is to protect our balance sheet position with targeted leverage of around 2.4 times. This is an optimal level we believe to maintain broad and deep capital markets access through a cycle balanced prudently with the opportunity for enhanced levered equity returns. Third is to return cash to shareholders. I'm proud that we bought back 12 billion of stock in the last 12 months, including 2 billion in this quarter, shrinking our share count by 7% in that timeframe in addition to a healthy and growing dividend, which we just increased by over 7% in January. With that, I'll turn the call back to Marci for Q&A. Marci?\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Jason. Operator, let's open up the call for questions please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thank you. Good morning. Two questions, one on NBC and one on wireless. This is probably for Mike. Mike, when you look at NBCUniversal, you got probably businesses that are doing better than ever when you look at parks and your studio, and obviously there's a lot of disruption in the media business, and I'm just wondering, given the management change and sort of your broader role, is this an opportunity to revisit that business strategically, operationally, from a cost structure point of view, just with fresh eyes? I realize you've been obviously President and watching that business for some time, but just wanted to hear your thoughts just given all that's going on at NBC? And then maybe for Dave, the wireless business is continuing to scale. You talked about demand for current converged offers being clear and strong. What are your ambitions here as you look through the rest of 2023 to continue to accelerate the growth in that business? How do you guys drive that penetration of your broadband base meaningfully higher? Thanks everybody.\nMichael Cavanagh: HeyBen, it's Mike, so I'll jump in. Thanks for the question. So I appreciate the comment. I have been here, it's hard to believe, it's going to be in two weeks, I've been here two or three weeks eight years as partner to Brian and the rest of the leadership team. So it is correct that I've been close to all these things, not just recently as President for the last half year or so, but really since I joined. So in thinking about the strategies of NBC, I would think the way you should think about it is the way we operate across the businesses, including NBC, is that the strategies were developed by the entire leadership team. Brian mentioned how great a team we have across the diverse collection of business parks, studios, TV, streaming services, news, sports. So you can imagine that strategies are put together by those teams of leaders, obviously in conjunction with the ultimate leader and then with Brian and myself. So we've been deeply involved for a long, long time in what those strategies are all about and in tracking how we're doing. So, while it's unfortunate to have an unexpected change in leadership, I would tell you it is not, there is no reason for anyone to think that we're going to be revisiting strategy as a result of that. It's all by itself. Well obviously we act as the environment around us changes, but as you pointed out, the businesses are performing really well right now. So job number one for me is to just settle things down and make sure the businesses and the business leaders at NBCU remain focused on the job at hand. And I feel actually into the first several days of this, that that's well underway and I frankly don't think the business is going to miss a beat. With that, I'll hand it over to Dave.\nDavid Watson: Thank you Mike, and hello Ben. So on wireless, wireless continues to be a key part of our overall strategy. Stepping back for a second, we really like the start to the year in our trajectory. This quarter we set another first quarter record in net line additions of 355,000 and so this puts us at the 5.7 million line. So good start to the year, and we're still less than 10% penetrated to broadband. So it gives us a long runway ahead and to your point of looking out to 2023. But our strategy is to focus very much on our core service offerings of, by the gig which we still have and use, unlimited tiers, and it gives us a strong, real strong value proposition to all segments that we serve. So it's important to note that we leverage mobile in all aspects of how we go to market, in acquisition, base management and retention. And so mobile does very well in all three, but as Connects are a little bit softer through this cycle, base management has been very strong as we go to existing customers and provide a great upgrade opportunity for them. So our pricing focus is our core services, but we do go in and out in terms of promotions with gift cards, some device subsidies that we've historically done, really no different there, but we also had a $50 combined broadband mobile offering that all helped. There was a little bit of a lift there and a great value message to the existing base. So yes, long-term, less than 10 10% penetration. Lot of upside for us in wireless and a large revenue pool that we have that I think a unique position given our broadband network is ubiquitous. Our go-to market mobile opportunity is ubiquitous within our footprint. And so you look at it, there's upside in residential and commercial, there's domestic and international upside with mobile. There's an opportunity for us to consider long-term cost side with offloading traffic.\nMVNO:\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thanks everybody.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Ben. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.\nCraig Moffett: Hi, two questions if I could. First you reported really exceptional margins in what would have been your old domestic cable business. I'm wondering if you could just talk about the contribution to that improvement from wireless. The extent to which wireless is either offsetting the customer acquisition cost or just the gross margin rate and how that's impacting margins overall? And then on the NBCU side, the NBA playoffs have had exceptionally good ratings and there's been a lot of talk about your potential interest in the NBA. I wonder if you could just discuss that a bit and maybe just talk about what role sports might play as you go forward with Peacock and your NBC business.\nJason Armstrong: Hey thanks Craig. It's Jason. Let me start with the margin question and I'll turn it over to Dave after that for some follow up and then over to Mike on the NBA question. So on margins overall, I'm pleased with the quarter. Obviously we grew connectivity margins broadly by 160 basis points year-over-year. We've said in the domestic cable business margins are up 250 basis points to a record 46.5%. So really strong margin performance. I think when we look at the drivers of that, number one, mix shift high margin businesses, i.e. the connectivity businesses, broadband, business services, wireless, sort of in that category, say $10 billion book of business growing at 7% and it's margin accretive. In addition to that really strong expense management by Dave and the team, if you look at every expense category outside of direct product costs, which are the costs that go in to feed the connectivity business growth, every single category down year-over-year. So I think really strong performance on margins in general. As we look at wireless in particular, I put it in the broad bucket of the connectivity category. It obviously supports and augments broadband, which is one of our, if not highest margin products, and so wireless is a contributor to that.\nDavid Watson: Hey, Craig, Dave here. So it does start, if you look at the domestic margins, the 250 basis points and the 46.5%, there's a host of things. This all starts, as Jason said, with the margin accretive connectivity businesses, both residential and commercial. I think that we continue to benefit. There are -- transactional activity is lowered. A lot of this is just constantly being focused on the customer experience and taken out unnecessary transactions that continues. But we also very disciplined and stay focused on fixed costs, so that, we look at every part of the business in terms of opportunities to do a good job, be competitive, be aggressive, but also take out unnecessary costs. And then, there's also, one of the things, I think the great things that Cable does, and we've been focused at Comcast is we leverage our existing network, our great network, and our operational capabilities to do new lines of business. Business services is a great example of that, but wireless is another one of which our existing sales channels, our existing capabilities in an MVNO light way, it just is, it's a big part of the connectivity story. So I think we do well when we can leverage our strength and, and our strength will continue to be our network and our go-to-market approaches that we've done, I think a pretty good job over the years. But everything we do, inbound sales, digital, we leverage wireless.\nMichael Cavanagh: And Craig, it's Mike. On NBA obviously a tremendous product and the playoffs are great. I think the negotiations there, that's ways out, but obviously NBC Sports does a great job partnering with the leagues we partner with, broadcast, streaming and otherwise. So time will tell, but as we look at things we always look at an overall financial envelope what's the right portfolio of overall sports rights we want to have and do that in a way that, as we've said, and Jason said earlier, we manage our linear and broadcast and Peacock as one business. So that's the way we would look at any of the rights that are out there in the future.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Craig. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nDoug Mitchelson: Oh, thanks so much. Two questions for Dave actually, first on broadband. I'm just curious, both from a competition standpoint and health of the consumer viewpoint, how voluntary and involuntary churn are trending, and how the base reacted to the price increase this cycle versus prior cycles? And then, secondly, I know it's relatively recent, but I'm just curious on the plan upgrades with 10 G launched in February and progress in 40 markets, that was highlighted in the slideshow. If there's any kind of practical experience in the marketplace as to, how the network is reacting and how the consumer is reacting post upgrades? Thanks.\nDavid Watson: Well, thanks Doug. So starting with competition and churn, so the overall, the environment is, there's still, as I mentioned, overall transactional activity in general is down and there's two parts of that. One is, as you brought up, there's, it continues to be pretty intense competitively. That's been the case for a while, but also there's just less activity period with less moves. And so the thing that it really stands out, continues to be the case that our churn is near record lows in terms of compared to pre-pandemic period. So we're not seeing in terms of churn, any material spikes when it comes to competition. We are seeing an impact in terms of connects. And so, some of that is the transactional activity, some of it is competitive pressure, but it's more felt on the connect side of things and a little bit more on video as we have less video attachment on that side. But broadband, you look at our broadband base, we have a very stable base, 32 million residential broadband customers, churn, very healthy and certainly lower than pre-pandemic period times. We watch the competitive landscape every day. And so while certain fixed wireless, the fiber group, but we continue to fare well in terms of the kind of all tiers and in terms of churn. So it's not -- we haven't seen a spike in voluntary or the non-pay in regards to the economy.\nDOCSIS 4.0. At the end of the year we'll be testing it and I think next year will be a pretty big year for that.: But every step of the way, we're delivering increased value. And it's where the customer is going in terms of the increased focus, every application of streaming, of gaming. And you look at where the customer is today, the 700 gigabytes in terms of HSD-only consumption, events like the Thursday Night Football that just caused a spike, and then yesterday that Man City against Arsenal, Peacock, having a great Premier League match to see a little bit of a bump in terms of broadband usage. So there's going to be more of that. The customer is going to do more with broadband, not less. And so I think that serves us well long-term competitively, and we'll continue to be a champion of every single broadband great application as they come along.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thank you.\nBrian Roberts: This is Brian. I just want to add one thought. The last point Dave made, I think you did a fabulous job explaining it. I just want to underscore how much I personally believe that, that's what makes us in a great position. If you think about less linear and more streaming, is that trend going to continue? Absolutely. It seems very, very likely. And who is best positioned to provide more and more capacity, and this path to 10G, we have a north star that we -- the team has created. We know what we want to bring to customers over the next several years. And as more and more needs come about, we're going to be the network there to deliver. So we're the provider of all that connectivity is a really special place to be.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks Doug. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with BofA Securities. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Oh, thank you. I have a bigger NBCU question and smaller cable. But Mike, you're the President of Comcast and the Head of NBCU, so two giant jobs. Is this a permanent solution? And in the meantime, obviously, the media landscape has changed drastically since you guys bought NBCU over a decade ago. So can you address the cyclical and secular challenges as well as opportunities, including, but I'm certainly not limiting it to a pending WGA strike, Disney's battle in Florida with Governor DeSantis that might affect Universal theme parks, the scale needed to compete in direct-to-consumer and the range of Hulu outcomes that would significantly affect your business, whether it's scaling up or cash coming in the door? And then the smaller cable question, sorry, is the video loss is accelerating? Do you have a point of view -- does this trend continue or is there a level of stability that you expect?\nMichael Cavanagh: Okay, Jessica, it's Mike. So I'll dive in. I think the short answer to the question is that I think what -- the way me stepping in to oversee NBC is quite sustainable. And why I say that is as President, I was already overseeing all of this and close to the people that run the NBC businesses and the Cable businesses and the corporate areas. And I think what's really important to understand is that we've got high-quality operators and leaders in all of the seats around the company: Philadelphia, L.A., New York, Orlando and so forth. So while I'll have to work a little harder and frankly, I'm energized to do so because I look forward actually to spending time getting closer to the NBCU businesses and spending more time deeper in them and with the leaders there. And frankly, since I'm going to be here for a long time, I actually think that's good for me and good for the company over the long-term. So I would put no timetable at all on -- no time pressure to do anything other than make sure the businesses hum, which they're -- that's what they're doing right now, and that's what I see continuing. And maybe someday, we'll think there's a better way to approach it, but I'll never be moving far away from the businesses no matter what. And I'm going to own the outcome anyway it turns out. So I think -- think of me as being there for a while. In terms of the cyclical versus secular and the laundry list there of all the things we're dealing with, I'd say all that's embedded in the plans that we have. When you think about our Content & Experiences businesses, you think about our Parks business, which is just doing tremendously well, and we've got tremendous growth investments behind that. And it had nothing to do with the challenges for eyeballs and the movement of traditional television to different forms of consumer consumption. So think of parks as \u2013 put it aside, I think, it is an incredibly valuable and growing business. And then I think in the traditional TV businesses, we're -- that's why we're -- exactly why we're doing Peacock. And remember, we're at 22 million subs now. We were 20 when we ended last year. We were at 15 when we ended the third quarter of last year. So I think we're really pleased as we're one quarter into 2023 to have held level of engagement in the product, hours watched and so forth and kept churn very low. As we look ahead, some really good content coming later in the balance of the year. So on track, and then some. We'll have our role to pay and Comcast customers coming over to in more the second half of the year. So I think we feel really good about the strategy of how we're managing on the Media business side. And then really on Studios, you look at -- Brian covered it, but you look at the power of our Studios, both film and television and they're incredibly strong, and leadership is excellent. And the -- Brian mentioned animation, but we've got Fast 10 coming out in a couple of weeks. We've had great hits on the television side and more to come. So I think that's also, I think, a strategy around Studios that is -- and we've stayed, as we've said, agnostic, I guess, to whether it's the word to use, whether things need to necessarily end on our platforms, Peacock or linear or someone else's. So I think there's durable value in that side of things sort of no matter how some of these trends work out. And I'll leave it at that and talk more some other day about some of the details. I'm not going to talk about Hulu. And on strikes, we certainly hope that we find an equitable outcome that avoids a strike, and that's what our team is planning for. Over to you, Dave.\nDavid Watson: You got it. Hey Jessica, Dave here. So on video, we continue to segment the marketplace. We have a lot of options. But the main point that has really developed is the video attachment being down. And so there -- and our rate approach is to not subsidize unprofitable video relationships. And I've shifted some time ago anticipating how things evolve that are focusing on the overall relationship and the connectivity opportunity. So the main -- one of the key points, though, that to make sure that folks understand, we did see certainly an uptick in customers dropping video. But we've also seen these customers that are retaining broadband. And so our full disconnect churn, video and broadband, remains at record low levels and is down nearly 25% since the pre-pandemic period. So we're able to have managed through the cycle and still there's some video packaging that we're going to be very focused on and based on the segment and we'll fight hard, whether it's acquisition, base management or retention. So it's important to us, but we have figured out a way to manage it financially. And if you look at broadband, the net result is broadband is faring well and holding the line in terms of the base. And so as things continue to and evolve more towards streaming, I think we're in a great position there. And we also have invested in our platforms. So we have the platforms of Flex. We have X1 and the new Charter JV with Xumo that we feel great about long-term. So yes, the video losses did a bit of an uptick, but we did offset it with some of these platform relationships that I think long-term are going to be very important.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks Jessica. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBrett Feldman: Yes thanks. It's sort of a two-part question about connectivity CapEx. You seem pretty comfortable that you can continue this pace of footprint expansion within that CapEx profile you previously talked about. You also seem pretty happy with the traction you're having as you broaden the footprint. So I'm curious how you think about the merits of maybe building even faster, whether that's organically or if you would simply be waiting to see whether it makes sense to participate in some of these government subsidy programs. And then I think in the past, you provided some statistics about this enormously high share of your customers' true mobile traffic that happens in a very small portion of your geographic footprint. And that data point alone would imply that there's a very high ROI associated with deploying your own mobile infrastructure and bringing that on net. And you obviously have all the resources you need to do that, including spectrum. I'm curious why that hasn't happened yet? Or what would be the circumstances under which that could become a really attractive use of incremental capital investment in the connectivity business?\nJason Armstrong: Brett, it's Jason. I'll start out with the CapEx question and then tag team with Dave on mobile offloading. So on CapEx, we guided for the year to 10% capital intensity. That's flat year-over-year last year for Connectivity & Platforms. We rounded out the year at 10%, so flat year-over-year. If you think about the big categories that sort of contribute to capital intensity in that business, it's customer premise equipment, scalable infrastructure and line extensions. Customer premise equipment is actually an area we're getting some relief from. Scalable infrastructure, that's where our DOCSIS -- that's basically existing infrastructure where we're augmenting capabilities. That's where DOCSIS 4.0 and our mid-splits. That's an area where, obviously, we're doing a lot more in the next couple of years. And then line extensions, I think you got it right. That's where we're extending our footprint to go serve new geographies, whether it's residential or business services. Within that, we've guided for the year 850,000 new builds last year, goes up to 1 million this year. So that's a 20% increase in what we're doing there, all accommodated for -- with similar capital intensity year-over-year. So I think we're really operating the business at an efficient level, given everything that's going on surrounding the network. I think to your question on doing even more as we look at some of the programs that are coming our way, if you look at prior programs and sort of our distinct advantages in the market, I would step back and say, as you look at product technology, management and cost of capital, those are things that should define an advantage for us in economics of new builds or overbuilds. It was a little bit muted in the prior cycle if you look at sort of the economic cycle we were in and low cost of capital, which created, we think, a pretty frothy capital markets environment, which led a lot of companies to stare at economics that may have been better temporarily than they might be over the longer term as well as newer government programs that were sort of, in our view, unseasoned in terms of the process. So it kept us out of a lot of the prior programs. As we look at this going forward with capital markets activity, cost of capital going up a little bit, I think everything sort of plays to our strengths. So the 850,000 going to 1 million this year, we'd welcome it probably going higher over time.\nMichael Cavanagh: It's Mike. I would just add in that we're not looking to manage within the around 11% as a constraint, but rather to Jason's point, I think we can handle going to the 1 million, which is great. And we see good economics in that, but would welcome it if the day came along that we thought spending more with -- on incremental passings would be good return. So...\nDavid Watson: This is Dave. So Brett, we like the trajectory. Both Jason and Mike mentioned the 1 million. It's early, but off to a good start. I feel good about that. And really, the three buckets, the existing footprint within existing cable footprint and as things pick up in terms of housing and new construction, then we'll be right there, the hyper builds for commercial and then these edge outs, which is where some of the subsidies are there. So we're -- we feel good about it, very focused. And we'll take a disciplined approach, and it's been great, the support that we have in terms of every opportunity, we'll go for it and -- but we'll expect historical returns. On the mobile offload, we think this is a really interesting and good opportunity potentially based on how things are. We've said, I think, 60%, the traffic around 3% of our footprint. And that is -- we're staring at that constantly. So we're testing. We have a -- we go arm in arm with Charter looking at some of these results in terms of how things are going. We do have a fantastic capital light MVNO that serves us very well. I think great for the partner, good for us long-term. But we'll continue to stare at the marginal cost improvements of offloading these dense traffic areas. So we're staying on it, and we'll -- more to come on that, but we will be testing that throughout the year.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thank you, Brett. Operator, we'll take our last question please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.\nPhilip Cusick: Thanks for getting me in guys. Two if I can. May be first following up on broadband, Jason, you mentioned success from a low-end broadband product at the end of the quarter. How do you see the return on that and is it something you plan to sustain? How should we think about the impact in the second quarter versus typical seasonality? And then second, you mentioned that Orlando is trending above pre-COVID. Can you talk about recent trends in the domestic parks? Any indication of attendance shifts or costs? Thanks very much.\nDavid Watson: Phil, Dave. Let me start with kind of the offer approach and then the impact as we go into Q2, just providing overall perspective. But when you take a step back, we are still in the environment that I've mentioned, still the base, overall broadband base very stable in terms of the turn, less the connect pressure that we've seen. So -- but overall, it's tied to a better churn than where we were pre-pandemic. So -- but we take a very disciplined approach. We segment the market, and we go in and out with offers. So we did have an offer that was available in the marketplace where, for broadband only, at $25 and then a $50 combined mobile. And so we saw an uptick. It was positive. And so it's something that we constantly are doing coming in and out in terms of service offerings. We also remain very focused, what we talked about earlier around the high end and never losing sight that there's a mix of tiers that are really important to the base. And so we're just focused on 1 gig, and we do -- with part of the segmentation approach is going to the marketplace and one third of our customers do take that 70 -- almost 75% of our customers take 400 megabits and above. So there's a blend that ends up happening, and that's why you saw a pretty good ARPU growth in terms of broadband. But we'll go in and out with offers in terms of things. We'll be nimble, respond competitively to every single segment. I think there's more action with fixed wireless on the low end and that -- the offer served us well. As you go into seasonality and you look at the second quarter, we are seeing typical seasonality, especially in regions like Florida. So you're going to see a step down in net adds from Q1 to Q2. And -- but I don't think you can extrapolate exact performance from historical levels. But directionally, net adds will be lower in Q2, so just to be clear.\nJason Armstrong: Just to round out the question on broadband, Phil, because it's a good one. In this type of competitive environment, I think one of the key questions for us and the team is can we segment the base appropriately to sort of tactically respond at the low end but without disrupting the broader base. And one of the things I'm most proud of this quarter from the team is 4.5% ARPU growth, which I think really points to that.\nMichael Cavanagh: And it's a nice feel to finish on parks because the business overall is really rocking, as you can tell. It would be -- I'd be remiss in not calling out first the quarter that the international side had. USJ had all-time highs for attendance, per caps revenue and EBITDA. And that's since it opened -- for a first quarter. That's since it opened in 2001. And likewise, in China, we generated significant profitability in a tougher season and the highest ever quarterly attendance despite it being wintertime. So that's the international side. And on the domestic side, things continue to perform really well. Hollywood, we had Super Nintendo World open, so driving really strong attendance and per caps that are way ahead of last year and pre-pandemic levels on the back of excellent guest feedback. And in Orlando, really solid results in the quarter. We had, as you know, unprecedented visitation last year way ahead of 2019 pre-COVID. So as expected, growth rates have slowed down, but performance continues to be solid. And go-forward booking again still looks solid, similar pattern to Q1 of last year. So, so far, things continue to look good as we look ahead in the domestic side.\nPhilip Cusick: Thanks very much.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Phil. That concludes our earnings call, and thank you all for joining us.\nMichael Cavanagh: Thanks, everybody.\nJason Armstrong: Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer session and today's conference call. A replay of the call will be available starting at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time today on Comcast Investor Relations website. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect.",

            "name": "David Watson",
            "content": "Thank you Mike, and hello Ben. So on wireless, wireless continues to be a key part of our overall strategy. Stepping back for a second, we really like the start to the year in our trajectory. This quarter we set another first quarter record in net line additions of 355,000 and so this puts us at the 5.7 million line. So good start to the year, and we're still less than 10% penetrated to broadband. So it gives us a long runway ahead and to your point of looking out to 2023. But our strategy is to focus very much on our core service offerings of, by the gig which we still have and use, unlimited tiers, and it gives us a strong, real strong value proposition to all segments that we serve. So it's important to note that we leverage mobile in all aspects of how we go to market, in acquisition, base management and retention. And so mobile does very well in all three, but as Connects are a little bit softer through this cycle, base management has been very strong as we go to existing customers and provide a great upgrade opportunity for them. So our pricing focus is our core services, but we do go in and out in terms of promotions with gift cards, some device subsidies that we've historically done, really no different there, but we also had a $50 combined broadband mobile offering that all helped. There was a little bit of a lift there and a great value message to the existing base. So yes, long-term, less than 10 10% penetration. Lot of upside for us in wireless and a large revenue pool that we have that I think a unique position given our broadband network is ubiquitous. Our go-to market mobile opportunity is ubiquitous within our footprint. And so you look at it, there's upside in residential and commercial, there's domestic and international upside with mobile. There's an opportunity for us to consider long-term cost side with offloading traffic. Hey, Craig, Dave here. So it does start, if you look at the domestic margins, the 250 basis points and the 46.5%, there's a host of things. This all starts, as Jason said, with the margin accretive connectivity businesses, both residential and commercial. I think that we continue to benefit. There are -- transactional activity is lowered. A lot of this is just constantly being focused on the customer experience and taken out unnecessary transactions that continues. But we also very disciplined and stay focused on fixed costs, so that, we look at every part of the business in terms of opportunities to do a good job, be competitive, be aggressive, but also take out unnecessary costs. And then, there's also, one of the things, I think the great things that Cable does, and we've been focused at Comcast is we leverage our existing network, our great network, and our operational capabilities to do new lines of business. Business services is a great example of that, but wireless is another one of which our existing sales channels, our existing capabilities in an MVNO light way, it just is, it's a big part of the connectivity story. So I think we do well when we can leverage our strength and, and our strength will continue to be our network and our go-to-market approaches that we've done, I think a pretty good job over the years. But everything we do, inbound sales, digital, we leverage wireless. Well, thanks Doug. So starting with competition and churn, so the overall, the environment is, there's still, as I mentioned, overall transactional activity in general is down and there's two parts of that. One is, as you brought up, there's, it continues to be pretty intense competitively. That's been the case for a while, but also there's just less activity period with less moves. And so the thing that it really stands out, continues to be the case that our churn is near record lows in terms of compared to pre-pandemic period. So we're not seeing in terms of churn, any material spikes when it comes to competition. We are seeing an impact in terms of connects. And so, some of that is the transactional activity, some of it is competitive pressure, but it's more felt on the connect side of things and a little bit more on video as we have less video attachment on that side. But broadband, you look at our broadband base, we have a very stable base, 32 million residential broadband customers, churn, very healthy and certainly lower than pre-pandemic period times. We watch the competitive landscape every day. And so while certain fixed wireless, the fiber group, but we continue to fare well in terms of the kind of all tiers and in terms of churn. So it's not -- we haven't seen a spike in voluntary or the non-pay in regards to the economy. You got it. Hey Jessica, Dave here. So on video, we continue to segment the marketplace. We have a lot of options. But the main point that has really developed is the video attachment being down. And so there -- and our rate approach is to not subsidize unprofitable video relationships. And I've shifted some time ago anticipating how things evolve that are focusing on the overall relationship and the connectivity opportunity. So the main -- one of the key points, though, that to make sure that folks understand, we did see certainly an uptick in customers dropping video. But we've also seen these customers that are retaining broadband. And so our full disconnect churn, video and broadband, remains at record low levels and is down nearly 25% since the pre-pandemic period. So we're able to have managed through the cycle and still there's some video packaging that we're going to be very focused on and based on the segment and we'll fight hard, whether it's acquisition, base management or retention. So it's important to us, but we have figured out a way to manage it financially. And if you look at broadband, the net result is broadband is faring well and holding the line in terms of the base.

So yes, the video losses did a bit of an uptick, but we did offset it with some of these platform relationships that I think long-term are going to be very important. This is Dave. So Brett, we like the trajectory. Both Jason and Mike mentioned the 1 million. It's early, but off to a good start. I feel good about that.

            "name": "Brian Roberts",
            "content": "Thanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. Before we get in the quarter, let me just acknowledge the news that you all saw earlier this week, obviously a tough moment. But we are so fortunate to have a fabulous and tenured leadership team at NBCUniversal. If you go down the list, you'll see many of them have been leading their divisions within the company for at least 10 years and are truly the best in the business. We're also lucky to have Mike Cavanagh step in at the helm at NBCUniversal while also remaining President. Mike is a fantastic executive and operator that many of you know well and he'll work closely with each of the management team at NBCUniversal to continue our excellent momentum. Mike, alongside with Jason Armstrong will lead these earnings calls on a go forward basis. Today, you'll hear from them about our strategic focus and drivers of growth now and over the long-term, and Jason will go into much greater details on the first quarter results. Dave Watson and I are here for the Q&A and you'll hear a lot more about the great momentum of our connectivity and platform businesses later in the call. Dave, thanks for getting off to a great start this year. So before I hand it over to Mike, I just want to share my quick perspective on our recent performance. This really was a strong quarter and start to the year, especially within the context of what continues to be a choppy macro environment. We grew adjusted EBITDA by 3% and adjusted EPS by 7%. In addition, we generated $3.8 billion of free cash flow and returned $3.2 billion of capital to shareholders, all while continuing to invest importantly in a number of major initiatives, which is a real testament to our very healthy balance sheet. Two things amongst many highlights in particular that stand out for me and I'm really proud of, one is the animation business. By strengthening and combining our capabilities across DreamWorks and Illumination led by Chris Meledandri, we've had tremendous success creating franchises that people know and love all over the world. Despicable Me, Shrek, Pets, Minions, and more recently Puss in Boots, and now Super Mario Bros., which just broke a number of records including the biggest worldwide opening of any animated film all time. These are the results of the strategic decision we made years ago to become a leader in animation and the conviction we've had to continue to invest in the business even during the depths of the pandemic, which are now clearly paying off. The second is Connectivity & Platforms. The significant margin expansion that we achieved this quarter, coupled with a 4.5% ARPU growth in domestic residential broadband demonstrates successful discipline and excellent management in a challenging competitive environment. We're focused on delivering a superior experience and profitably serving our customers and it shows. And with that, let me now hand the call over to Mike. This is Brian. I just want to add one thought. The last point Dave made, I think you did a fabulous job explaining it. I just want to underscore how much I personally believe that, that's what makes us in a great position. If you think about less linear and more streaming, is that trend going to continue? Absolutely. It seems very, very likely. And who is best positioned to provide more and more capacity, and this path to 10G, we have a north star that we -- the team has created. We know what we want to bring to customers over the next several years. And as more and more needs come about, we're going to be the network there to deliver. So we're the provider of all that connectivity is a really special place to be."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Jason Armstrong",
            "content": "Thanks Mike and good morning everyone. In late February we announced that starting this quarter we will be reporting our results in two reportable business units; Connectivity & platforms and Content & Experiences, more closely align our like-minded businesses, reflect how we run our company and highlight our opportunities for growth as a globally integrated content distribution company. We're also providing more disclosure around areas that have become increasingly important to our overall results, namely Business Services and Peacock. Let's start with our consolidated first quarter results on Slide 4. Total company revenue of $29.7 billion declined 4% due to the tough comparison to last year's Winter Olympics and Super Bowl, as well as the negative impact of foreign currency. While our total company adjusted EBITDA grew 3% thanks to continued strong operating leverage at our high margin Connectivity & Platforms business. Excluding the impacts of the Winter Olympics and Super Bowl and adjusting for constant currency, total company revenue increased 1.5%. We grew adjusted earnings per share by 7% to $0.92 and generated $3.8 billion of free cash flow while returning $3.2 billion of capital to shareholders in the first quarter. This is in addition to significant investments to support and grow our businesses, including our transition to DOCSIS 4.0 and footprint expansion in broadband, the construction of Epic, as well as consistent flow of new lands and attractions at our theme parks, and content production at our studios, which feeds into Peacock, a robust third party licensing opportunity and a really successful film business. When taken together, these investment areas generated over half of total company revenue in the first quarter with growth of 10% year-over-year. Now let's turn to our business results starting on Slide 5 with Connectivity & Platforms. As a reminder, our largest foreign exchange exposure is the British pound, which was down over 9% year-over-year. So in order to highlight the underlying performance of the business, I'll speak to our results at Connectivity & Platforms on a constant currency basis. Revenue was flat this quarter, but this is worth unpacking. Our core connectivity revenues, residential and business grew over 7% to $10 billion, while video, advertising and other revenues declined 7% to $9.8 billion. Year-over-year we generated 160 basis points of margin expansion for Connectivity & Platforms on a total basis. This is reflective of our strategy of investing in and driving growth in high margin businesses while protecting profitability in businesses with secular headwinds through disciplined cost control. To get into more detail, residential connectivity revenue grew by 8% with 5% growth in domestic broadband, 27% growth in wireless, and 18% growth in international. In business services connectivity revenue continued to grow at a healthy mid-single digit pace. Our domestic residential broadband customer base this quarter remained stable over both the last year and in the quarter with churn remaining below pre-pandemic levels. While we had some success towards the end of the quarter with a couple of offers targeting the lower end of the market, the broadband environment remains highly competitive right now, particularly at the lower end. And as such, our view remains that 2023 will be a challenging period for us to add subs. Our outlook for growth and our strategy has been consistent. We will compete aggressively, but do so in a financially disciplined way. While we expect to return to growth in broadband subscribers over time, during this interim period as well as over the longer-term, we will focus on protecting and growing broadband ARPU and we're pleased with the 4.5% year-over-year increase in ARPU in the quarter. We expect continued strong revenue growth over the course of 2023 and expect ARPU will be the primary driver. Growth in domestic wireless revenue was a function of higher service revenue, driven by continued strong momentum in customer lines, which are up 1.4 million or 32% year-over-year to 5.7 million in total, including the 355,000 lines we just added, which was a record high for a first quarter. There is clearly demand for a converged offering that delivers reliable and fast speeds both in and out of the home. We are extremely well positioned to take advantage of this trend and have a long runway for growth as less than 10% of our broadband accounts currently take our mobile offering. A new disclosure category for us is international connectivity. Roughly two two-thirds of international connectivity revenue is broadband growing at mid-teens levels. The remaining one-third is wireless, of which a big portion comes from device sales and therefore tends to fluctuate with the timing of device launches. The rest of wireless is service revenue, which is growing nicely due to additional customer lines and healthy ARPU growth. The strong revenue growth in our connectivity businesses was offset by declines in video due to customer losses relative to last year. In other revenue reflecting similar dynamics in wire line voice and in advertising, which was impacted by a tough macro environment in addition to lower political revenue in our domestic markets. On the expense side, every expense line item declined in the first quarter with the exception of direct product costs, which are success based and directly associated with the significant growth in our connectivity businesses. The strong execution by the team to deliver sustainable operating efficiencies coupled with solid growth in our high margin connectivity businesses, resulted in Connectivity & Platforms EBITDA growth of 4% to $8.1 billion and as I mentioned a moment ago, an adjusted margin expanding 160 basis points year-over-year. And that is despite some temporary margin headwinds in our international business associated with some pressure on revenue due to a challenging macro environment and higher programming costs for sports channels, which were up this year given the timing of events. Margin for our domestic legacy cable business improved 250 basis points reaching a record high of 46.5%. We've added disclosure this quarter and going forward to break down profitability between residential and business services, residential Connectivity & Platforms EBITDA grew 3% with margin improving 140 basis points to reach 37.8% highlighting favorable revenue mix shifts. Business services connectivity EBITDA grew 8% with margin expanding 150 basis points to reach 58.3%. Over the years we've talked about business services as a driver of margin accretive growth, and we're excited to augment our disclosure in this area for the first time. Our results in the quarter and our new reporting structure clearly show that. This is a business that generated over $5 billion of EBITDA in 2022 with substantial growth ahead and should be a material contributor to our growth profile in Connectivity & Platforms and overall. Wrapping up on Connectivity & Platforms, I'm proud of the team successfully navigating a transition in which we're managing businesses that have secular headwinds with an appropriately high level of cost discipline, while investing in others that clearly have strong revenue growth and margin characteristics. Now let's turn to Content & Experiences on Slide 6. Content & Experiences revenue decreased nearly 10%, reflecting the difficult comparison to last year, which included $1.5 billion of revenue from the Winter Olympics and the Super Bowl reported in our Media segment. And EBITDA decreased 1%, as a record first quarter at parks and strong studio growth driven by a successful film slate was offset by the planned increase in our Peacock investment as well as lower linear advertising sales. Unpacking these results further Media revenue decreased 21% on an as reported basis and 2% when excluding the Olympics and Super Bowl, primarily due to 6% decline in domestic advertising reflecting softness in the overall ad market, which appears to have stabilized, offset somewhat by strong growth in Peacock advertising revenue. When you exclude Olympics and Super Bowl, Peacock advertising increased an impressive 90%. Domestic distribution revenue decreased 8%, but was up 4%, excluding the Olympics driven by Peacock with distribution revenue up 83%. In total Peacock revenue increased by 45% to $685 million led by strong growth in paid subscribers, which were up over 60% year-over-year, ending the quarter with nearly 22 million paid subs, which marked another terrific milestone on our path to scaling the service. We're encouraged with the trends we're seeing at Peacock. While we've proven that special content and major events like the World Cup at the end of last year can be significant acquisition drivers, perhaps equally or even more important is sustaining engagement following this type of acquisition content and delivering on retention. We saw that in the first quarter and we look forward to reporting further momentum in the enhanced disclosures we're now providing for Peacock, including the revenue breakdown between advertising and distribution and costs separated by programming and production versus marketing promotion and other. Another new category that we added to our Media disclosure is international networks. This is mainly distribution revenue for Sky Sports and the low single digit revenue increase in the quarter was driven by higher distribution revenue, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Other revenue decreased 21% due to lower content licensing. Media EBITDA decreased 26%, including a $704 million EBITDA loss at Peacock. We view Media as one business, and while we have made cost reductions at our linear networks, we reallocated some of these resources to Peacock with the goal of maximizing profitability over the short and long-term across streaming and linear. We continue to expect Peacock losses for the year to be around $3 billion, which we believe will be peak losses for Peacock and then begin to steadily improve. At Studios, this was a great quarter for our film slate with strong theatrical revenue growth, driven by the successful carryover from Puss in Boots Last Wish, which launched at the end of the fourth quarter, as well as new releases such as Megan and Cocaine Bear. While revenue growth was partially offset by lower content licensing at our television studios, the momentum in our film business drove a 13% increase in Studio EBITDA, which also included marketing and promotion expense associated with the April 5th release of Super Mario Bros., which is fueling a strong start to our second quarter. At Theme Parks, revenue grew 25% and EBITDA 46% to $658 million, thanks to a continued rebound following the lift of COVID restrictions and a testament to the significant investments we've made at our parks. While demand and financial results were strong across the board, our international parks drove most of the growth this quarter. With Japan no longer impacted by COVID restrictions, our park in Osaka continued to rebound and we are seeing significant demand for Super Nintendo World, which we opened in early 2021. But given the COVID-related restrictions that were in place, many people couldn't visit the park. Our park in Beijing was also impacted by COVID-related restrictions last year and is now growing at a very healthy rate. Beijing showed strong year-over-year improvement and was profitable in the quarter despite normal winter seasonal headwinds. On the domestic side Hollywood enjoyed record first quarter results due to the very successful opening of Super Nintendo World, while Orlando continues to trend above pre-pandemic levels. I'll now wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 7. As I mentioned previously, we generated $3.8 billion in free cash flow this quarter and achieved this while absorbing a high level of working capital and making meaningful investments in our network and theme parks. These investments drove a 37% increase in total capital spending, primarily driven by higher CapEx. Hey thanks Craig. It's Jason. Let me start with the margin question and I'll turn it over to Dave after that for some follow up and then over to Mike on the NBA question. So on margins overall, I'm pleased with the quarter. Obviously we grew connectivity margins broadly by 160 basis points year-over-year. We've said in the domestic cable business margins are up 250 basis points to a record 46.5%. So really strong margin performance. I think when we look at the drivers of that, number one, mix shift high margin businesses, i.e. the connectivity businesses, broadband, business services, wireless, sort of in that category, say $10 billion book of business growing at 7% and it's margin accretive. In addition to that really strong expense management by Dave and the team, if you look at every expense category outside of direct product costs, which are the costs that go in to feed the connectivity business growth, every single category down year-over-year. So I think really strong performance on margins in general. As we look at wireless in particular, I put it in the broad bucket of the connectivity category. It obviously supports and augments broadband, which is one of our, if not highest margin products, and so wireless is a contributor to that. Brett, it's Jason. I'll start out with the CapEx question and then tag team with Dave on mobile offloading. So on CapEx, we guided for the year to 10% capital intensity. That's flat year-over-year last year for Connectivity & Platforms. We rounded out the year at 10%, so flat year-over-year. If you think about the big categories that sort of contribute to capital intensity in that business, it's customer premise equipment, scalable infrastructure and line extensions. Customer premise equipment is actually an area we're getting some relief from. Scalable infrastructure, that's where our DOCSIS -- that's basically existing infrastructure where we're augmenting capabilities. That's where DOCSIS 4.0 and our mid-splits. That's an area where, obviously, we're doing a lot more in the next couple of years. And then line extensions, I think you got it right. That's where we're extending our footprint to go serve new geographies, whether it's residential or business services. Within that, we've guided for the year 850,000 new builds last year, goes up to 1 million this year. So that's a 20% increase in what we're doing there, all accommodated for -- with similar capital intensity year-over-year. So I think we're really operating the business at an efficient level, given everything that's going on surrounding the network. I think to your question on doing even more as we look at some of the programs that are coming our way, if you look at prior programs and sort of our distinct advantages in the market, I would step back and say, as you look at product technology, management and cost of capital, those are things that should define an advantage for us in economics of new builds or overbuilds. It was a little bit muted in the prior cycle if you look at sort of the economic cycle we were in and low cost of capital, which created, we think, a pretty frothy capital markets environment, which led a lot of companies to stare at economics that may have been better temporarily than they might be over the longer term as well as newer government programs that were sort of, in our view, unseasoned in terms of the process. So it kept us out of a lot of the prior programs. As we look at this going forward with capital markets activity, cost of capital going up a little bit, I think everything sort of plays to our strengths. So the 850,000 going to 1 million this year, we'd welcome it probably going higher over time. Just to round out the question on broadband, Phil, because it's a good one. In this type of competitive environment, I think one of the key questions for us and the team is can we segment the base appropriately to sort of tactically respond at the low end but without disrupting the broader base. And one of the things I'm most proud of this quarter from the team is 4.5% ARPU growth, which I think really points to that. Thank you."

            "name": "Michael Cavanagh",
            "content": "Thanks Brian. We had a great start to 2023 and have set ourselves up for another strong year. We have amazing talent at all levels of our company and DNA that fosters creativity and collaboration, resulting in operational excellence that is second to none. Couple that with our position as a scaled leader in very large and profitable markets with tens of millions of customers paying us over a $100 per month, as well as hundreds of millions of TV and streaming viewers, and we have an extremely healthy balance sheet enabling us to invest in all of our strategic opportunities and for great returns, while also returning a healthy amount of capital to shareholders. As pleased as we are with our results in the first quarter, any company's performance in a quarter is just a milestone of progress against a longer term strategy and plan. And so before we dive deeper into the details of the last few months, I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about the drivers of our growth over the longer term and where we're focusing most of our time and resources. I put these in four buckets, residential connectivity, business services connectivity, our theme parks and experiences and our premium content creation. I'll start with residential connectivity, which is comprised of domestic broadband, domestic wireless and international connectivity. Broadband is a fantastic business. It's a great product for the consumer and demand continues to rise. People are connecting more and more devices to our network and they're consuming a tremendous amount of data. Right now, the average monthly data usage for a broadband customer that doesn't take video from us is nearly 700 gigabytes, and there is a related increase in the importance of reliability and speed with roughly one third of our customers at one gigabit or higher and nearly three quarters at or above 400 megabits. For us, the consumer's already high and increasing level of expectation for their broadband experience is an important trend. And while the marketplace is competitive, such that adding subs in the near-term is likely to be a challenge. I fully expect we will eventually return to subscriber growth. We have the best handout there to win against all the competing technologies, whether it's fiber or fixed wireless. We view fiber as our long-term competitor. We've been successfully competing against fiber for about 20 years, yet still built a base of 32 million broadband customers over this time period. HeyBen, it's Mike, so I'll jump in. Thanks for the question. So I appreciate the comment. I have been here, it's hard to believe, it's going to be in two weeks, I've been here two or three weeks eight years as partner to Brian and the rest of the leadership team. So it is correct that I've been close to all these things, not just recently as President for the last half year or so, but really since I joined. So in thinking about the strategies of NBC, I would think the way you should think about it is the way we operate across the businesses, including NBC, is that the strategies were developed by the entire leadership team. Brian mentioned how great a team we have across the diverse collection of business parks, studios, TV, streaming services, news, sports. So you can imagine that strategies are put together by those teams of leaders, obviously in conjunction with the ultimate leader and then with Brian and myself. So we've been deeply involved for a long, long time in what those strategies are all about and in tracking how we're doing. So, while it's unfortunate to have an unexpected change in leadership, I would tell you it is not, there is no reason for anyone to think that we're going to be revisiting strategy as a result of that. It's all by itself. Well obviously we act as the environment around us changes, but as you pointed out, the businesses are performing really well right now. So job number one for me is to just settle things down and make sure the businesses and the business leaders at NBCU remain focused on the job at hand. And I feel actually into the first several days of this, that that's well underway and I frankly don't think the business is going to miss a beat. With that, I'll hand it over to Dave. And Craig, it's Mike. On NBA obviously a tremendous product and the playoffs are great. I think the negotiations there, that's ways out, but obviously NBC Sports does a great job partnering with the leagues we partner with, broadcast, streaming and otherwise. So time will tell, but as we look at things we always look at an overall financial envelope what's the right portfolio of overall sports rights we want to have and do that in a way that, as we've said, and Jason said earlier, we manage our linear and broadcast and Peacock as one business. So that's the way we would look at any of the rights that are out there in the future. Okay, Jessica, it's Mike. So I'll dive in. I think the short answer to the question is that I think what -- the way me stepping in to oversee NBC is quite sustainable. And why I say that is as President, I was already overseeing all of this and close to the people that run the NBC businesses and the Cable businesses and the corporate areas. And I think what's really important to understand is that we've got high-quality operators and leaders in all of the seats around the company: Philadelphia, L.A., New York, Orlando and so forth. So while I'll have to work a little harder and frankly, I'm energized to do so because I look forward actually to spending time getting closer to the NBCU businesses and spending more time deeper in them and with the leaders there. And frankly, since I'm going to be here for a long time, I actually think that's good for me and good for the company over the long-term. So I would put no timetable at all on -- no time pressure to do anything other than make sure the businesses hum, which they're -- that's what they're doing right now, and that's what I see continuing. And maybe someday, we'll think there's a better way to approach it, but I'll never be moving far away from the businesses no matter what. And I'm going to own the outcome anyway it turns out. So I think -- think of me as being there for a while. In terms of the cyclical versus secular and the laundry list there of all the things we're dealing with, I'd say all that's embedded in the plans that we have. When you think about our Content & Experiences businesses, you think about our Parks business, which is just doing tremendously well, and we've got tremendous growth investments behind that. And it had nothing to do with the challenges for eyeballs and the movement of traditional television to different forms of consumer consumption. So think of parks as \u2013 put it aside, I think, it is an incredibly valuable and growing business. And then I think in the traditional TV businesses, we're -- that's why we're -- exactly why we're doing Peacock. And remember, we're at 22 million subs now. We were 20 when we ended last year. We were at 15 when we ended the third quarter of last year. So I think we're really pleased as we're one quarter into 2023 to have held level of engagement in the product, hours watched and so forth and kept churn very low. As we look ahead, some really good content coming later in the balance of the year. So on track, and then some. We'll have our role to pay and Comcast customers coming over to in more the second half of the year. So I think we feel really good about the strategy of how we're managing on the Media business side. And then really on Studios, you look at -- Brian covered it, but you look at the power of our Studios, both film and television and they're incredibly strong, and leadership is excellent. And the -- Brian mentioned animation, but we've got Fast 10 coming out in a couple of weeks. We've had great hits on the television side and more to come. So I think that's also, I think, a strategy around Studios that is -- and we've stayed, as we've said, agnostic, I guess, to whether it's the word to use, whether things need to necessarily end on our platforms, Peacock or linear or someone else's. So I think there's durable value in that side of things sort of no matter how some of these trends work out. And I'll leave it at that and talk more some other day about some of the details. I'm not going to talk about Hulu. And on strikes, we certainly hope that we find an equitable outcome that avoids a strike, and that's what our team is planning for. Over to you, Dave. It's Mike. I would just add in that we're not looking to manage within the around 11% as a constraint, but rather to Jason's point, I think we can handle going to the 1 million, which is great. And we see good economics in that, but would welcome it if the day came along that we thought spending more with -- on incremental passings would be good return. So... And it's a nice feel to finish on parks because the business overall is really rocking, as you can tell. It would be -- I'd be remiss in not calling out first the quarter that the international side had. USJ had all-time highs for attendance, per caps revenue and EBITDA. And that's since it opened -- for a first quarter. That's since it opened in 2001. And likewise, in China, we generated significant profitability in a tougher season and the highest ever quarterly attendance despite it being wintertime. So that's the international side. And on the domestic side, things continue to perform really well. Hollywood, we had Super Nintendo World open, so driving really strong attendance and per caps that are way ahead of last year and pre-pandemic levels on the back of excellent guest feedback. And in Orlando, really solid results in the quarter. We had, as you know, unprecedented visitation last year way ahead of 2019 pre-COVID. So as expected, growth rates have slowed down, but performance continues to be solid. And go-forward booking again still looks solid, similar pattern to Q1 of last year. So, so far, things continue to look good as we look ahead in the domestic side. Thanks, everybody."

Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Executive Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone. Joining us on today's call are Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh, Jason Armstrong, and Dave Watson. I will now refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation accompanying this call, which can also be found on our Investor Relations website and which contains our safe harbor disclaimer. This conference call may include forward-looking statements, subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our 8-K and trending schedule issued earlier this morning for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Cavanagh: Thanks, Marcy, and good morning. Before I hand it over to Jason, I'll touch on a few topics that are top of mind for me as we report our third quarter results and head into the home stretch of 2024. First is convergence, second is Epic Universe and third is Media. On convergence, which we define as the combination of ubiquitous high-speed Internet along with wireless phone, by that definition, we are positioned to win. And that is because, today, we have 63 million homes and businesses already able to receive gig-plus broadband speed and we also offer wireless service everywhere we provide broadband. This reach far exceeds the fiber footprints of the largest three telecom companies combined, and our footprint is growing at a rapid pace. In fact, we've extended our network to more than 1.2 million additional homes and businesses over the last 12 months, a 50%-plus increase over what we were able to do just two years ago. So, even accounting for the announced fiber buildout plans of those three wireless companies, we expect to maintain this lead well into the future. Broadband usage is skyrocketing. Our broadband-only customers are heavy data users, averaging 700 gigabytes per month. And we want it that way because our existing network can handle significant increases in bandwidth consumption at a very low marginal cost. In addition, we're on a path over the next few years to being able to deliver multi-gigabit symmetrical speeds, which will be competitive with any technology out there. The other side of our converged offering is Xfinity Mobile, which matches the capabilities of any wireless network in America. We bundle Xfinity Mobile with our best-in-class broadband service everywhere we compete at a price that offers great savings to the consumer. And when combined with broadband, our wireless offering both improves churn and increases overall customer satisfaction. We also look for opportunities to enhance our converged experience. An example being a new feature we are rolling out now called WiFi Boost, which automatically increases Xfinity Mobile customer speeds up to 1 gig on our WiFi network, which is also the largest in the nation. To close out these comments on convergence, it's important to note that our strategy is proving out in financial performance. Our domestic broadband plus wireless revenue has been growing at 5%, which consistently leads the industry when you look across our competitors. The second topic I want to touch on is Epic Universe, which will be the most groundbreaking park ever introduced in the United States. We recently announced that Epic will open on May 22, 2025, and have also started to activate our sales and marketing plans, including the sale of vacation packages that provide the opportunity to visit Epic, which we expect to be in very high demand. This park will offer a level of immersion that is unmatched, transporting guests to expansive worlds featuring more than 50 awe-inspiring attractions, entertainment, dining and shopping experiences. Once Epic opens, Universal Orlando will be transformed into a week's long vacation, offering four theme parks, a CityWalk dining, retail and entertainment district and 11 hotels. Epic will build on everything we've excelled at in the present and in the past and make it even better by infusing iconic storytelling with cutting-edge technology in five fully-themed worlds. Each one telling a fantastic story based on world-renowned movies and literature such as Dark Universe, which capitalizes on our Universal Monster franchise; Isle of Berk, which brings DreamWorks' How to Train Your Dragon to life; there is The Wizarding World of Harry Potter - Ministry of Magic; as well as Super Nintendo World, and all of these are connected by Celestial Park, a world in and of itself. We could not be more excited for what's ahead of us with Epic and our entire Destinations & Experiences business. Finally, let me talk about Media, where the truly outstanding and universally praised production of the Paris Olympics demonstrated the power of NBC broadcast and Peacock. We brought new relevance and excitement to the Olympics by flawlessly presenting the biggest and most complex Olympic Games in history, dominating television, streaming, news and social media for 17 straight days. Daily viewership averaged over 30 million across our platforms, an increase of 80% compared to the prior Summer Olympics in 2021, and Peacock streamed 23.5 billion minutes, up 40% from all prior Summer and Winter Olympics combined. All of this leading to a record high $1.9 billion of incremental Olympics revenue in our Media segment this third quarter. We achieved this result by leaning in with the full symphony of Comcast, NBCUniversal playing together and a big bet on new ideas and innovation that paid off. We are all very grateful to our NBC Sports team and look forward to them bringing the lessons learned and momentum to our entire sports portfolio, especially as we begin to prepare for the relaunch of our partnership with the NBA starting with the 2025-2026 season. The regular and post-season NBA games across both NBC and Peacock, in addition to a number of exclusive Peacock games, will bring in broad and diverse audiences, allowing us to also create new entertainment content that will work beyond the basketball season with exciting opportunities for companion programming and marketing collaborations that tap into the NBA's pop-culture appeal. Before I hand it over to Jason, let me talk about our recent execution against an outlook for our capital allocation priorities, which are threefold: to maintain a very strong balance sheet, which we feel great about given the industry-low leverage we maintain; to return significant capital to our shareholders, which we have done consistently since we reinstated our buyback program in May 2021 and have since returned $50 billion of capital, equaling 100% of our free cash flow and reducing our share count by 20%; and third, to invest in our growth businesses both organically and inorganically. Organically, we've invested heavily in our growth businesses, including the upgrade of our broadband network to ubiquitous 1-gig speeds and counting, the incubation, launch and success of our wireless and business services units, the investment in Peacock and our studios, and the creation of the Epic Universe theme park to name just a few. And while we remain most focused on driving our growth businesses, we also look to maximize the significant legacy value in our portfolio of more mature businesses. As you know, we chose not to participate in the M&A process around Paramount in the earlier part of this year, but we would consider partnerships in streaming despite their complexities. And like many of our peers in media, we are experiencing the effects of the transition in our video businesses and have been studying the best path forward for these assets. To that end, we are now exploring whether creating a new well-capitalized company, owned by our shareholders and comprised of our strong portfolio of cable networks, would position them to take advantage of opportunities in the changing media landscape and create value for our shareholders. We are not ready to talk about any specifics yet, but we'll be back to you as and when we reach firm conclusions. And to sum it up, we are very proud of the job we've done on the capital allocation front over the past few years and we are highly motivated to maintain the same level of discipline. With that, it's over to you Jason.\nJason Armstrong: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with our consolidated results on Slide 3. Total revenue increased 6.5% to $32.1 billion, benefiting from NBCUniversal's highly successful airing of the Paris Olympics. Excluding the Olympics, our revenue was relatively flat year-over-year. Our six major growth drivers, including residential broadband, wireless, business services connectivity, theme parks, streaming and premium content in our studios, generated nearly $18 billion in revenue, well over half of our total company revenue and grew 9% in the quarter and at a mid-single-digit rate over the past 12 months. Total EBITDA decreased 2% to $9.7 billion, while we generated free cash flow of $3.4 billion during the third quarter, and returned $3.2 billion of capital to shareholders, including $2 billion in share repurchases. Over the last 12 months, we've reduced our share count by 6%, contributing to our adjusted EPS growth in the quarter of 3%. Let's dive deeper into our results for the third quarter, starting on Slide 4 with Connectivity & Platforms. As usual, I will refer to our year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis. Revenue for total Connectivity & Platforms was consistent year-over-year at $20.3 billion, reflecting strong growth in our connectivity businesses and political advertising, offset by declines in video and voice revenue, as well as non-political advertising in our domestic and international markets. Residential connectivity revenue grew 5%, comprised of 3% growth in domestic broadband, 19% growth in domestic wireless, and 8% growth in international connectivity. Business services connectivity revenue also grew 5%. In domestic broadband, our revenue growth was driven by ARPU growth of 3.6%, another strong result in the context of a continued competitive backdrop. Our team continues to effectively balance rate and volume through customer segmentation. In terms of broadband subscribers, we reported a net loss of 87,000 in the quarter, which included an estimated net impact of 96,000 associated with the end of ACP. Excluding this ACP-related subscriber loss, we would have reported positive 9,000 broadband net additions in the third quarter. Before I cover ACP in more detail, I want to spend a moment addressing the quarter's underlying results in broadband. Keep in mind that in the third quarter, we typically benefit from seasonal tailwinds due to back-to-school activity, and this year was no different as we performed very well in that category. In addition, we believe we also benefited to some extent from a competitor's work stoppage as well as from leveraging the Olympics by investing in incremental nationwide brand marketing behind our Olympic-related offers. Now, let me cover ACP. As I mentioned, we had 96,000 losses related to ACP in the quarter. That's roughly one-third direct losses we experienced in the quarter and the other two-thirds reflects a reserve we took for the number of subscribers that we predict will churn in the coming months due to a non-pay or delinquency status. Turning to domestic wireless. Revenue growth was mainly driven by service revenue, fueled by strong growth in customer lines, which were up over 1.2 million or 20% year-over-year, reaching 7.5 million in total, including 319,000 line additions this quarter. Importantly, our wireless customers are also broadband customers, and when bundled together, drive overall customer relationship ARPU growth, churn benefits for broadband and higher profitability. With wireless penetration at 12% of our broadband subscriber base, we have a very long runway for growth. We're pleased with our strategy and we'll continue to test new converged offers to capitalize on the significant opportunities we see ahead of us in wireless, including both increasing the penetration of our domestic residential broadband customer base as well as selling additional lines per account. And just to reiterate what Mike mentioned, we have an incredible hand to play in convergence. We currently have an offering for gig-plus speeds and wireless available ubiquitously to our footprint of 63 million homes and businesses today. And by ubiquitous, I mean we are not making any network trade-offs and every customer gets access to the same offerings. We believe we have a leadership position in convergence and we think we can sustain that. We're on a clear path to offer multi-gig symmetrical speeds, and we'll continue to grow our footprint projecting to add over 1.2 million new homes passed this year. International connectivity revenue growth of 8% was driven by broadband, reflecting strong ARPU growth, and in wireless, healthy service revenue growth was offset by lower device revenue. Business services connectivity revenue growth of 5% reflects steady growth in small business and even faster growth in enterprise. In small business, it continues to be a competitive market, but we are growing revenue with ARPU growth driven by higher adoption of a suite of additional products that expand our relationship with our SMB customers. At the enterprise level, we are taking share and continue to scale this business. In advertising, growth of 2% reflects stronger political revenue this quarter, partially offset by lower non-political domestic and international advertising revenue. Finally, video and other revenue declined in the quarter. The 7% decline in our video revenue is a function of continued customer losses, coupled with slower domestic ARPU growth versus last year. And the lower other revenue mainly reflects continued customer losses in wireline voice. Connectivity & Platforms' total EBITDA was consistent year-over-year at $8.3 billion, with margins up 50 basis points, reflecting a decline in overall expenses, driven by the continued mix shift to our higher-margin connectivity businesses and ongoing expense management, partially offset by an increase in marketing and promotion expense, driven by our incremental brand marketing investment during the Paris Olympics. Breaking out our Connectivity & Platforms' EBITDA results further, residential EBITDA was consistent with margins improving 40 basis points to 38.6% and business services EBITDA growth was at a mid-single-digit rate, with margins fairly stable at 57.4%. Rounding out Connectivity & Platforms, I'd note that our business continues to evolve as the mix shifts towards our connectivity growth drivers. As such, you've seen us take some cost reduction actions in our fourth quarter for the past several years. We expect to take similar actions again this fourth quarter at about an equal magnitude to last year. Now, let's turn to Content & Experiences on Slide 5. Revenue increased 19% to $12.6 billion, and EBITDA decreased 9% to $1.8 billion. At theme parks, revenue decreased 5% and EBITDA declined 14% in the quarter compared to last year's all-time record high. The majority of the decline was driven by lower attendance at our domestic parks when compared to last year. As we've highlighted, our view is there was both a pull-forward of demand that we clearly saw in 2022 and 2023, which were record years for the theme parks and beyond our expectations, as well as the new attraction pipeline, which is light this year, but building towards a substantial pipeline next year. We think these factors will likely be in place until the second quarter of next year, which is both when we start to lap the pressure we saw this year and the launch of Epic Universe. Looking ahead, we couldn't be more excited about Epic Universe and how it will transform Universal Orlando into a week-long destination. And as we gear up for the May 2025 opening, we expect to incur pre-opening costs of about $150 million in total over the fourth quarter this year and the first quarter next year. We remain bullish about the long-term trajectory of parks. In addition to Epic Universe, we have a fantastic slate of new attractions and experiences on the horizon. Donkey Kong Country in Osaka and a Fast and Furious roller coaster in Hollywood, as well as Universal Horror Unleashed in Vegas and our Universal Kids Resort coming to Texas. Now, let's turn to Media, where revenue increased 37% to $8.2 billion, including the strong results from the Paris Olympics, which generated $1.9 billion in revenue, a record level for any Olympics. Strength in the Olympics was mainly driven by a record $1.4 billion in advertising revenue, with Peacock contributing over $300 million of that. Excluding the Olympics, total advertising revenue was flat year-over-year as the overall market remained stable, while total media revenue increased 5%, driven by an exceptional quarter for Peacock. Revenue growth for Peacock was 82% and still a very robust greater than 40% excluding the Olympics. This was also a strong quarter for Peacock paid subscribers as we added 3 million net new additions driven not only by the Olympics, but also the return of the NFL, including our Peacock exclusive NFL game from Brazil, the return of the Big Ten, and several entertainment hits during the quarter including Love Island, Bel Air and Fight Night. Looking ahead, we will continue to be focused on strong revenue growth and improving profitability at Peacock in the broader context of expected revenue and profit growth across the entire Media segment. Media EBITDA in the quarter declined 10% to $650 million, but this was largely timing related as a profitable Olympics was offset by higher expenses due to the timing of other sports, including two additional NFL games in the quarter, an additional Sunday Night Football game and Peacock's exclusive game from Brazil. At studios, revenue increased 12% and EBITDA increased 9%, driven by the success of our film slate, including Despicable Me 4 as well as Twisters. Year-to-date, we have three of the top 10 box office titles, including Twisters, Kung Fu Panda 4 and Despicable Me 4, which has already grossed nearly $1 billion and is the first animated franchise in the industry to surpass $5 billion in global box office. Looking to the fourth quarter, Wild Robot debuted in September to terrific reviews and has had nice success at the box office, a great achievement for original animation. And we are particularly excited about Wicked opening in November. I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 6. As I mentioned earlier, we generated $3.4 billion in free cash flow this quarter and achieved this even with significant organic investment. The $3.6 billion in total capital expenditures this quarter reflects spending to bolster our six key growth areas and, most significantly, our efforts in expanding our connectivity footprint through accelerating homes passed and further strengthening our domestic broadband network, and the continued buildout of our Epic Universe theme park ahead of its opening in May of 2025. Turning to return to capital, we returned a total of $3.2 billion to shareholders in the quarter, including share repurchases of $2 billion and dividend payments of $1.2 billion. In fact, our share count has been consistently shrinking mid-single-digits on an annual basis for the past several years. We've been straightforward and consistent in our priorities around investing in our six key growth drivers, protecting our strong balance sheet and returning a significant amount of capital to shareholders. This quarter is yet another example of that. Now, let's turn it back to Marci for Q&A. Marci?\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Jason. Operator, let's open the call for Q&A, please.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks. Good morning. Mike, just coming back to your comments on sort of strategic reviews on the media side, which obviously are quite interesting. Can you talk a little bit about the assets you're looking at in this sort of portfolio review? It sounded like domestic cable networks, but you also mentioned streaming and, in particular, around your point about complexity. Trying to think about the ability or challenges of separating Peacock from your linear networks. Maybe it's not as complex as I'm thinking, but operationally, how do you sort of think through those pieces and do those assets need to travel together or perhaps not? And then, for either Dave or Jason, just would love to hear how you guys are thinking about the fourth quarter broadband subscribers. Do you think you can be -- can grow again in Q4 given kind of normal seasonality and other factors as we move beyond ACP? Thanks so much.\nMike Cavanagh: Hey, thanks, Ben. It's Mike. So, let me be clear and just for everybody that maybe just picking up on this, I want to be clear about what I said is that we're going to commence a study of whether there's a good idea in the idea of creating a new well-capitalized company that would go to our shareholders, existing shareholders, comprised of our cable portfolio networks. So that's the group. I'm not talking about Peacock or broadcast. So that's what I said before. And I think the questions about how to do it are the reason we're announcing here that we want to study it. There are a lot of questions to which we don't have answers, so we want to do the work. And we want to do the work with transparency around it, so that as rumors fly and the like, we expect that, but we want our shareholders to understand what we're willing to look at. That's in the context of broader, we look at a lot of things, and I do think in a moment of a lot of transition in the industries we're a part of. I think we've got a very strong hand given the strength of the businesses. We just went through all of them with third quarter results, and I think I'm proud of every part of it. And I think the idea of playing some offense, when you combine the balance sheet strength that we have, the assets we have, and the management team we have, there may be some smart things to do and we want to study that.\nDave Watson: Okay. Ben, this is Dave. Let me go into broadband. I think before getting to Q4, I think providing just a little bit of context on Q3 is important and starts with the underlying market that remains competitively intense. So that hasn't changed, it continues. But we are pleased with our overall performance in Q3, and was driven at the very top level with very good execution on the fundamentals. But as Jason said, there are three factors that were unique to Q3. One is back-to-school, always a contributor to Q3. We did perform well this Q3 and did around the same level as last year in back-to-school activity. So that's number one. Number two, the Olympics are not only good for NBC, it's good for cable and Connectivity & Platforms. So, we did invest in, I think, a really effective go to market plan, strong offers, good product positioning, and the Olympics provide perhaps the best showcase for us to talk about what's fully capable end-to-end with great content, being easy and simple to access, and people are highly engaged. And so, it was a, overall, good plan, but that drove consideration unique to that timeframe. And the third one was the AT&T labor work stoppage. It was limited to part of their footprint, and it was I think about a 30-day thing. Not a major driver, but it did have an impact. So, if you exclude the incremental benefits of the Olympics and the competitor's work stoppage as well as the ACP impact, while it is tough to completely pinpoint, our best estimate is HSD subs would have been slightly worse than last year's Q3. So, then you shift to Q4 to your question, and let me remind you and everyone, first off, we had two hurricanes impact some of our cable systems. And while we're still assessing the impact. From what we can see today, the potential impact looks like it could be really significantly less than the impact from Hurricane Ian in 2022 in terms of both subscriber and financial impacts. But we don't have an exact number to share at this moment, but there'll be some impact tied to the two hurricanes. Also, in Q4, while the return of seasonals to the southeast usually provides a good tailwind, not like back-to-school, but still a nice impact, we'll have to see what the potential impact we see with this activity due to the hurricanes. So, going to Q4, the underlying environment remains the same, very competitive, but remind you also that we expect churn to continue to remain at low levels as we focus on retention channel management, our segmented approach and leveraging offers and product packaging with mobile being front and center, but leveraging everything, including new video products like NOW TV, NOW Latino and StreamSaver, all surrounding broadband with good value. So -- and at the same time we're introducing, we're excited about AI and what we can do in every single sales channel including retention. So, we're rolling that out. But -- and the last point to remind you, Q4 doesn't have back-to-school. So that's where we're at and perspective in Q4.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks very much.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Ben. Operator, we'll take the next question.\nOperator: Next question is from Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nCraig Moffett: Hi, thank you. Two questions, if I could. Let me start on the theme park side. As you look forward to Epic for next year, first, how do we think about the capacity of Epic? And how do you think about balancing the potential demand in terms of volume versus perhaps trying to more significantly price it so that you get a better experience with lower crowds? I'm just wondering kind of how you think about that balance. And then, a housekeeping question by the way is, are you seeing -- you mentioned $150 million of cost expected in Q4. Should we -- was there anything in Q3 that we should be aware of in terms of Epic anticipation costs? And then, on the cable side, if I could just squeeze in one more, how are you thinking about BEAD at the moment? And at the rate that you're expanding the footprint, should we expect any significant capital intensity changes as you have now a little more insight about the BEAD program and what you might do in rural markets?\nJason Armstrong: Hey, Craig, let me just hit your quick question on just the costs around pre-opening costs around Epic. So, for third quarter, minimal costs there, I'd say in the range of $20 million or so in terms of pre-opening costs. We did say -- just to clarify your comment, you said $150 million for fourth quarter. What I said in my prepared remarks was $150 million in pre-opening costs split between the fourth quarter and the first quarter. I think between the two, it will be more weighted towards the first quarter.\nMike Cavanagh: Yeah, Craig, it's Mike. So, on Epic, like I said, we couldn't be more excited. It is our most ambitious parks experience we've ever put together, right? So, it will warrant a premium and think about ticket pricing at a premium level, but consistent with the market in Orlando. But I think the way to think about how we're going to manage it and we started this with -- we want to drive Orlando. We've got now one of the -- in addition to being what it is, a standalone park that's going to be magnificent, it transforms Universal Orlando into a week's long vacation with the other existing parks. So, I think we'll look at it through the lens of how to optimize the totality of our Orlando footprint, while making sure the park-goer experience is a great experience for Epic, which will be on itself priced at a premium. We are seeing great demand in the early days since we announced that May 22 next year is opening day, and we'll be putting together a lot of Comcast NBCUniversal Symphony effort to now raise awareness of the park as you see in the months and months ahead leading up to opening day.\nDave Watson: Hey, Craig, Dave here. So, on BEAD, obviously the process is ongoing. To the extent, we are successful and we will -- we're looking at it and planning around it. I think we certainly expect to be there. This is more of a 2025-and-beyond opportunity. So, this is active federal -- really the state levels -- a lot of the states have offices of broadband established to look at this. And the rules are being finalized as we speak, and assuming the final state BEAD participation rules allow for rational private sector investment and do not impose price controls or other things that exceed the statute, we will -- we do plan to participate with reasonable conditions, so -- and always -- as long as they're just consistent with our business goals. So, we have tight thresholds. We use a lot of financial discipline around these things. And it's too early to really comment in terms of how much activity, but we do not -- as we anticipate the activity here, we do not anticipate any change to CapEx intensity from what we can see. So, as always, if there are unique opportunities that fit within our financial returns, then we'll always evaluate that.\nJason Armstrong: Hey, Craig, let me broaden that out to footprint expansion in general and just sort of our philosophy there. We've obviously accelerated our footprint expansion couple of years ago. If you rewind the clock, we were at 800,000 homes passed per year. Dave and team has sort of nicely driven that to 1.2 million homes and pacing towards that this year. What underpins that view and how we're underwriting it, because obviously we're putting capital towards it, is a view of sort of structural competitive environment over the long term. And from our perspective as we see it, the two key competitors, as you look at it this past year, fixed wireless has obviously taken its toll. We think that's a market that's going to continue to exist, continue to be around, but it's for the value-conscious consumer. It is carved out a niche in the market that whether it's 10%, 15%, I'm not sure we've got a crystal ball, but it is a niche. Fiber, as we've said, is the real long-term competitor. That's an entity that's been building out against us for almost 20 years at this point. It's been sort of a steady increase in our footprint. Right now, we're about 50% overbuilt. We would tell you that will go higher. Obviously, the carriers have announced plans to take that higher. So, we expect it to go higher and we expect to see competition across the majority of our footprint, including two wires, one of which is ours, which is currently a gig-plus, and we'll go to multi-gig symmetrical through how we're investing, and the others of which is fiber. But the long-term view is we've competed against fiber for almost two decades at this point. And so, we are seasoned in competing against fiber and we know exactly what fiber markets look like. So, if you go back and look at some of the early fiber markets and tenure markets where we've had a chance to sort of see the competitive progression, what you see is initial uptake and then you see the competitive environment sort of leveling out and you see relatively even share between us and fiber. We see ARPUs in those markets that are very consistent with our overall ARPU. So, when you think about sort of a long term, how do you invest against this, are you comfortable taking your footprint expansion to a greater level, these are all things that underpin our current investment and future investment.\nCraig Moffett: Thanks. That's really helpful, Jason.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Craig. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Next is from Michael Ng from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ng: Hi, good morning. Thank you very much for the question. I just have two. One housekeeping one, just on the Olympics. Encouraging to see the record $1.9 billion of revenue. I was just wondering if you could comment on profitability as well. And any way to better think about the potential uplift from Olympics on broadband net adds? And then, second, I wanted to ask about video. You had very good video net adds performance in the quarter as well as on programming costs. Anything that you would call out there that maybe improving the trends within video? Thank you.\nMike Cavanagh: Thanks, Michael. It's Mike. So, just on the Olympics, as I said earlier, we couldn't be more proud of what our teams accomplished across the whole company on the Olympics. So, we were cautiously optimistic going into the games that they would perform well given all the effort we put in in Paris to their backdrop, but viewership, ad sales exceeded our expectations and the games were profitable. I won't go into the level of profitability, but profitable games for us. And so, we walk away from it very excited as we look forward to future Olympics from here, because it was a spell leading up to Paris where prior Olympics, for a variety of reasons, had not performed as well as we had hoped. So, I think there's an incredible amount of energy and excitement as we look ahead to LA and beyond and Milan in between. And so, I don't know if Brian wants to jump in here.\nBrian Roberts: I just want to add, it was probably the proudest moment that I can think of since we've owned NBCUniversal or certainly right up there, just a tremendous team effort technologically what Peacock pulled off and Xfinity with a combination of using just every athlete, every sport, every country you could search it many different ways, the social media impact with celebrity, the quality, the two broadcasts in prime time, and just really bringing the whole country and nation into the drama, the ratings and the ability to use that platform as we said for things such as broadband growth but also awareness for everything from Wicked to Epic to new shows being launched and many other initiatives in the company. So, one of the proudest moments. We really look forward to LA in four years. We've got Milan in between, and then we go on from there. So, it's a great partnership and kudos to Molly Solomon and many, many, many other people who had made that broadcast happen and Rick at NBC Sports and many others. Dave?\nDave Watson: Thank you, Brian. Michael, so two things. One, as Brian just said, it really was a great moment. So -- and again, unique to Q3 with the media investment behind it and just the overall go to market plan. And one of the things that we look at is just the engagement. And we're such a -- we have a unique position of streaming and all the other content of how it's delivered. It was a significant Internet moment, quite frankly, and that we are right there and positioned to be able to deliver it all. So, just in a really simple and easy way, the way the Peacock team did it, it was just great. And so -- but we don't have a specific number in terms of broadband impact, but it was a contributor to Q3 for sure. In video, there are two primary drivers. As we look at videos, obviously, still in the negative terrain, but an improvement. And one that there's churn and that we have seen churn continue to stabilize and has been stabilizing for a while. And we look at things that -- and break it down. Most certainly, when we introduce mobile into the mix, mobile helps, and there's churn reduction there. So, surrounding our broadband with the right package, the right segment, it does help video. So -- and then, when you have engagement levels like you see with the Olympics, then that helps. But churn has been a driver, improvement in churn in video. The second side of it are connects. And we've seen on the connect side, it's the NOW portfolio that has helped NOW TV, NOW Latino, these are products that we segment, use it surgically and have helped video, and it's a nice way to reimagine the platform to be able to deliver good content for the right segment.\nMichael Ng: Excellent. Thank you.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thank you, Mike. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Next is from John Hodulik from UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks. Two, if I could. I guess, first, following up on Jason's comments, we're definitely getting a better picture of what the competitive fiber footprint is going to look like in the US over the next five years. And I think Jason's comments addressed the impact on subs, but maybe for Dave, can you talk a little bit about the impact on ARPU and pricing power when a new fiber provider opens in an Xfinity market? And then secondly, I guess, for Jason, I realize we're probably early in what might be a longer process, but maybe at a high level, can you help us -- can you maybe frame the potential change in the growth rate of sort of the remaining Comcast assets that you may see, if you guys -- if you do move ahead with the spin of the cable nets? What kind of bump in terms of the growth rate are we looking at here? Thanks.\nDave Watson: Hey, John, this is Dave. Let me start with the fiber impact on ARPU, just a general impact. When -- there are two things that we look at and we've been balancing throughout: market share and rate. So, when fiber comes into one of the markets, and been dealing with it for two decades, so we have a pretty good track record in terms of when this happens, how it happens. But we do see that there is an impact on penetration levels, so on the market share side, but we compete aggressively, have a very strong playbook that has evolved over time. And then, share does eventually even out between the two of us. So, when you look at the healthy ARPU levels that are really no different, quite frankly, in terms of fiber versus non-fiber markets, and it goes to our playbook in terms of segmentation. And the focus that Jason talked about with the core network and the fact that we start at the premium levels, job one is delivering the best Internet experience that it's not -- it's speed, multi-gig, but it's everything that we do and how we compete around coverage, capacity, latency, all these things we deliver, and critically, the best WiFi in the marketplace with the great gateway device. And that is how content is really delivered in people's homes and businesses. So, great WiFi has helped, I think. And we look at solid churn rates, but ARPU is really no different as we've seen as things level out.\nMike Cavanagh: John, it's Mike. On the question about the potential for a spin and impact on revenue, I would just say I don't want to get ahead of ourselves. Obviously, we do anything like that, it will have an impact on the consolidated company. But I think the point that we'd make is that it doesn't change the fact that within the business today, we've got six growth drivers that represent more than half of our revenues that are growing this quarter at 9% or so, and on a trailing basis, been in that high-single-digits, sometimes 10%. So, the company is transforming itself to a top-line growing company as our mix changes. Whether we do something like a spin or not, I'd focus everyone on what the underlying is.\nJohn Hodulik: Got it. Thanks, guys.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, John. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. So, of course, one on NBC and one on cable. NBC is actually a multi-parter. There's just a lot going on there in coming years. So, just kind of -- maybe a follow-up on Epic. But can you kind of give us some color on your thoughts on what -- how it will impact the bottom-line over the next three to five years? Obviously, you'll take share in Orlando. It's a big market. But how do you think about it impacting the bottom-line? On NBA, can you talk a little bit about monetization? Obviously, there's a big increased investment, but you mentioned something interesting on the call that there's an opportunity outside of the regular season, and of course, it will be NBC and Peacock. And then finally, one last question on this potential spin-out. Can you just talk about the thought process? Is it -- do you view it as a roll-up vehicle for the industry? And then, on cable, it's kind of a video question, but we see Charter signing agreements with all of the streaming platforms you included. And you've taken a very different approach. Can you just maybe discuss how your video offering will evolve over time? Thank you.\nMike Cavanagh: So, Jessica, it's Mike. I'll hit these quickly. I mean, I think the Epic is, as we said, in the near term, going to have the $150 million of pre-opening costs, and then, it will open midway through the year. So, it will be accretive to the parks' P&L next year. And then obviously, beyond that, we hope it does all the things I said earlier in terms of driving the week's long experience in getting a nice return on the capital put against Epic and the entirety of what we have in the ground in Orlando, period. 11 hotels, the multiple parks, it is something that we feel very confident about in the long term, but I won't give particular guidance on that front. NBA, I think you should think about that as a -- it's a long term. Over the long term, we expect the NBA to be something that adds value to our company broadly, particularly in the Media segment. It's going to help broadcast and benefit from broadcast. We, obviously, saw that during the Olympics, the interplay of broadcast and streaming for sports and the technology for some audiences of what you can do on the streaming side and the reach that broadcast has. So, I think when you think about how it will play into the two audiences, streaming and traditional, which are frankly very different, and there was great viewing of the Olympics on linear despite the unbelievable production in Peacock. So, I think we feel really well-balanced between the broadcast side and the Peacock side. And then, the point for Peacock, NBA makes us -- NBC makes us a year-long sports destination. So, I think that's something that we think is very helpful over the long term as we think about churn as something that needs to be managed a little more carefully, a little differently in the streaming world than the linear world. And then, the point you're really getting at is -- that we've talked about before, is the NBA will bring a younger, more diverse audience. And I think as you bring an audience into a platform like NBC and Peacock, Donna Langley and Pearlena Igbokwe and the team at our studios have the chance to think about how to tap into that audience, together with the talent, frankly, that comes from the NBA themselves. And so, I think that was the point I was making on that. On the spin, really nothing more to say than what I said earlier. These are all the questions that we're going to go off and think about. We think there could be an opportunity to place some offense, like I said, and we'll be back, but that is the thinking. We think we have great assets and a great balance sheet, and that's the thinking. And on Charter, before -- I'll hand it over to Dave on his side, but just a comment for the NBC side on distribution. Obviously, it's a key revenue stream for any media business. And I got to say, we're very pleased that we've now completed 10 renewals in the past 15 months, most recently Charter and Hulu. And it's a mix of both traditional and streaming distributors. And so that just speaks to the power of the content we have and our ability to work with a very important distribution partners, who themselves have different business priorities and objectives from one to the next. So, we're really pleased with that. We're in the middle of -- last one for this year is coming up in a few days, which is DIRECTV. We're in constructive dialogue with folks over there and hope to finish up that negotiation shortly without disruption, just like the rest of the ones we've done in the last bunch of years. And all that adds to just a certain stability and strength of the revenue stream in our business.\nDave Watson: Jessica, this is Dave. So, on the -- in terms of our video strategy, the overall one of the core operating principles that we've had for a long time, we talked about it quite a bit across all of our products, is segmenting the marketplace to give consumers what they want at the right price and the right package. So, no surprise that video follows that. And with a very strong focus on connectivity, how do we surround connectivity with the right package offerings? And that is fundamental to how we look at it. Now having said that, I think the Charter Group does really smart things, and we pay attention to everything that they do. And if there's opportunities, then we always evaluate. But if you break it down further, we all -- we look at the experience that the customer has, we look at choice, and ultimately by segment, the value, those three things. And you look at experience, with our -- because we've invested over a very long period of time and a great platform, we talked about it with the Olympics, but it could be Sunday Night Football, it could be, you name it, Premier League Soccer, we have a unique platform to deliver video content. Then, you have choice, value. A good example of an extension of this is StreamSaver. And StreamSaver for us is an example of choice that we have to try to deliver customers. Could be broadband-only to -- on top of an existing video package. But StreamSaver is a great example of taking the advertising tiers, Netflix, Peacock and obviously, Apple TV, putting it together at a great consumer price point, not subsidizing. It's profitable and it makes a lot of sense. So, I think, it's an example of good video choice, and that is -- look for more of that from us over time.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Jessica. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Next question is from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Chaplin: Good morning, guys. Thanks so much. I'm wondering -- so CapEx year-to-date is running a little bit below the 10% in Connectivity & Platforms that you'd expect at the beginning of the year. Should we anticipate a big catch-up in 4Q? And then, I'm wondering if you can give us a quick update on where you are with the upgrade of the cable plant, where you expect to be at the end of the year. Are you moving through that at the pace that you anticipated, or as you've gained more clarity on the sort of evolution of the competitive dynamics, is that maybe not quite as urgent as initially anticipated? And then, on the footprint expansion, Jason, you mentioned this is sort of part of the -- really your competitive strategy. Are you expanding your footprint? If I think about the difference between the 800,000 that you were at and the 1.2 million that you're at now, is that incremental piece mostly in rural markets where you don't expect to have fiber competition? Thanks.\nJason Armstrong: Thanks, Jonathan. Let me take the first couple and hand it to Dave on footprint. So, on CapEx and capital intensity, yeah, we came into the year and said similar capital intensity to last year. Obviously, the pacing to the first three quarters is sort of on that track, maybe on the low end, but I would point you to -- just stepping back, we're not using capital intensity as sort of a gating factor. We are coming into this saying, what amount do we want to -- what can we upgrade by both in terms of network upgrade and then footprint expansion? What makes logical sense? How fast can the engineers move? And so, that is largely going to dictate our pacing. So, I wouldn't change the guidance for the full year, which implies a little bit of a catch-up in the fourth quarter. On the upgrade of the cable plant, I would say as you step back, our network upgrade is on plan. We think we have a cost-effective strategy that gets us faster speeds across the entire footprint. As I mentioned earlier, we are ubiquitous at a gig now. That's very important from a marketing perspective as you think more broadly about convergence. We've said we think we have the largest convergence footprint, but importantly, we can do things from a ubiquitous perspective, ubiquitous speeds plus ubiquitous wireless on top of it. So, we've got a good path there, gig now and then headed to multi-gig over time. We've got a plan to get there today. Roughly half our footprint is updated with the mid-split technology, which was sort of foundational in that effort. We expect to actually be through the vast majority of that effort by the end of next year. And then, DOCSIS 4.0 sort of rides right on the back of that.\nDave Watson: Yeah. Jonathan, just in terms of the operational planning around it, so as Jason just said and talking about it, we have the fundamental path that's being built, one half and then going to the vast majority by the end of next year in terms of mid-split. And then, on the heels of that will be the DOCSIS 4.0. So, it's a clear path to the strong ubiquitous product offering. And for us, it's an operational, then getting all the components, getting everything ready, everything from SIKs to you name it, we get all these pieces pulled together and then we go. So, we have a really good plan. We are definitely on track and really like the roadmap to where we stand. We're ahead of every single application in terms of broadband capability. And so -- and even, I think, doing a better job in things like WiFi, as I mentioned earlier. So, we're in good position with the network plan.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Jonathan. Operator, we'll take our last question, please.\nOperator: Okay. The last question is from Steven Cahall from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nSteven Cahall: Thank you. A couple of Media questions. So, first, you made the interesting Paramount streaming call out. I was just wondering, since you were both excluded from the [Venu] (ph) initiative, if there's any intentionality there that we can think about in terms of potential bundle that you might have mentioned. It seems like it would be pretty sizable in terms of sports rights, movie and TV library. So, anything you could expand on there in terms of whether you're just looking at a bundle, something that's more of a deeper integration for the customer would be interesting. And then, a related question kind of tying a lot of these themes together, I thought it was how interesting you called out the Olympics as one of the drivers of the broadband strength in the quarter. We don't often think about content as a driver of broadband subscriber acquisitions. Is that something that you think could be happening more in the future? Did that inform your decision on the NBA rights? And is that one of the reasons that you also want to keep the growth media assets together with your connectivity business longer term? Thank you.\nMike Cavanagh: So, Steven, it's Mike. So, on streaming partnerships, I think we are open to having discussions, but as I said, exploring the idea. I think you put it in context. The bar is really high for whole company media type of acquisitions. That's why what I paired together and the answer is streaming partnerships could be interesting. Details matter one to the next to the next. So, my only point is we're open to them, but they are very complicated, and they could vary in form. We like what we've got very much. So, it would just be as and when a good idea comes along, we're just open to it. That's point one. And two, the other side of it, is cable networks, which we talked about earlier. On Olympics and broadband, I think -- and Dave can chime in here, but I think the whole company looks through simply and otherwise to say what makes us unique place and how do we drive value for our company across all swim lanes, especially around something like the Olympics, but not only that. And when you look at what happens through X1 in terms of presentation of content, it's not just ours, but clearly it's ours when it's the Olympics. And we have all the power of the technology to do what we did with them, but it carries over to how we present other streaming services or integrate other content or navigate through that content with the X1 remote. I do think great content does feed into the thinking of why our company is one company, but I'll let Dave and Brian chime in.\nBrian Roberts: I'll just jump in for a second and say that last part you made is what I think makes our company pretty special and different. In the Olympics -- during the Olympics, I believe, and Dave tell me -- correct me if this is not right, in many, many of our Xfinity markets, the viewing of Olympics content in those households was, in many cases, double what the national averages were for the same content. So, the ability for consumers to easily navigate, find what they want, be marketed to, we do it for others, we do it for big moments in the company. And we're getting better at that all the time. And a seamless way to log in once to Peacock and also the Xfinity apps that they had, the stream app, it's all getting better every year. And that platform, which a lot of it we call the entertainment operating system, we now syndicate. We partner with Xumo, Sky all over Canada. So, it's a big strategic asset that you saw a great quarter, and really proud of the company.\nDave Watson: No question, and Brian nailed it. It really -- for us, that experience is so key and look for us to do more, to your question. If there's a big sports moment, I think people want to work with us. We love doing it. We make it simple and easy to find what you want in the moment. And then -- and the Sky team does an excellent job of bringing shows to life. And there's unique shows that they do, and we've taken that playbook to the US. So, where there's a big moment in entertainment in any form, look for us to continue to do it.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Steve. That concludes our call. Thank you all for joining us this morning.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the call. A replay of the call will be available starting at 11:30 am Eastern Time today on Comcast Investor Relations website. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect.",

            "name": "Brian Roberts",
            "content": "I just want to add, it was probably the proudest moment that I can think of since we've owned NBCUniversal or certainly right up there, just a tremendous team effort technologically what Peacock pulled off and Xfinity with a combination of using just every athlete, every sport, every country you could search it many different ways, the social media impact with celebrity, the quality, the two broadcasts in prime time, and just really bringing the whole country and nation into the drama, the ratings and the ability to use that platform as we said for things such as broadband growth but also awareness for everything from Wicked to Epic to new shows being launched and many other initiatives in the company. So, one of the proudest moments. We really look forward to LA in four years. We've got Milan in between, and then we go on from there. So, it's a great partnership and kudos to Molly Solomon and many, many, many other people who had made that broadcast happen and Rick at NBC Sports and many others. Dave? I'll just jump in for a second and say that last part you made is what I think makes our company pretty special and different. In the Olympics -- during the Olympics, I believe, and Dave tell me -- correct me if this is not right, in many, many of our Xfinity markets, the viewing of Olympics content in those households was, in many cases, double what the national averages were for the same content. So, the ability for consumers to easily navigate, find what they want, be marketed to, we do it for others, we do it for big moments in the company. And we're getting better at that all the time. And a seamless way to log in once to Peacock and also the Xfinity apps that they had, the stream app, it's all getting better every year. And that platform, which a lot of it we call the entertainment operating system, we now syndicate. We partner with Xumo, Sky all over Canada. So, it's a big strategic asset that you saw a great quarter, and really proud of the company."

            "name": "Dave Watson",
            "content": "Okay. Ben, this is Dave. Let me go into broadband. I think before getting to Q4, I think providing just a little bit of context on Q3 is important and starts with the underlying market that remains competitively intense. So that hasn't changed, it continues. But we are pleased with our overall performance in Q3, and was driven at the very top level with very good execution on the fundamentals. But as Jason said, there are three factors that were unique to Q3. One is back-to-school, always a contributor to Q3. We did perform well this Q3 and did around the same level as last year in back-to-school activity. So that's number one. Number two, the Olympics are not only good for NBC, it's good for cable and Connectivity & Platforms. So, we did invest in, I think, a really effective go to market plan, strong offers, good product positioning, and the Olympics provide perhaps the best showcase for us to talk about what's fully capable end-to-end with great content, being easy and simple to access, and people are highly engaged. And so, it was a, overall, good plan, but that drove consideration unique to that timeframe. And the third one was the AT&T labor work stoppage. It was limited to part of their footprint, and it was I think about a 30-day thing. Not a major driver, but it did have an impact. So, if you exclude the incremental benefits of the Olympics and the competitor's work stoppage as well as the ACP impact, while it is tough to completely pinpoint, our best estimate is HSD subs would have been slightly worse than last year's Q3. So, then you shift to Q4 to your question, and let me remind you and everyone, first off, we had two hurricanes impact some of our cable systems. And while we're still assessing the impact. From what we can see today, the potential impact looks like it could be really significantly less than the impact from Hurricane Ian in 2022 in terms of both subscriber and financial impacts. But we don't have an exact number to share at this moment, but there'll be some impact tied to the two hurricanes. Also, in Q4, while the return of seasonals to the southeast usually provides a good tailwind, not like back-to-school, but still a nice impact, we'll have to see what the potential impact we see with this activity due to the hurricanes. So, going to Q4, the underlying environment remains the same, very competitive, but remind you also that we expect churn to continue to remain at low levels as we focus on retention channel management, our segmented approach and leveraging offers and product packaging with mobile being front and center, but leveraging everything, including new video products like NOW TV, NOW Latino and StreamSaver, all surrounding broadband with good value. So -- and at the same time we're introducing, we're excited about AI and what we can do in every single sales channel including retention. So, we're rolling that out. But -- and the last point to remind you, Q4 doesn't have back-to-school. So that's where we're at and perspective in Q4. Hey, Craig, Dave here. So, on BEAD, obviously the process is ongoing. To the extent, we are successful and we will -- we're looking at it and planning around it. I think we certainly expect to be there. This is more of a 2025-and-beyond opportunity. So, this is active federal -- really the state levels -- a lot of the states have offices of broadband established to look at this. And the rules are being finalized as we speak, and assuming the final state BEAD participation rules allow for rational private sector investment and do not impose price controls or other things that exceed the statute, we will -- we do plan to participate with reasonable conditions, so -- and always -- as long as they're just consistent with our business goals. So, we have tight thresholds. We use a lot of financial discipline around these things. And it's too early to really comment in terms of how much activity, but we do not -- as we anticipate the activity here, we do not anticipate any change to CapEx intensity from what we can see. So, as always, if there are unique opportunities that fit within our financial returns, then we'll always evaluate that. Thank you, Brian. Michael, so two things. One, as Brian just said, it really was a great moment. So -- and again, unique to Q3 with the media investment behind it and just the overall go to market plan. And one of the things that we look at is just the engagement. And we're such a -- we have a unique position of streaming and all the other content of how it's delivered. It was a significant Internet moment, quite frankly, and that we are right there and positioned to be able to deliver it all. So, just in a really simple and easy way, the way the Peacock team did it, it was just great. And so -- but we don't have a specific number in terms of broadband impact, but it was a contributor to Q3 for sure. In video, there are two primary drivers. As we look at videos, obviously, still in the negative terrain, but an improvement. And one that there's churn and that we have seen churn continue to stabilize and has been stabilizing for a while. And we look at things that -- and break it down. Most certainly, when we introduce mobile into the mix, mobile helps, and there's churn reduction there. So, surrounding our broadband with the right package, the right segment, it does help video. So -- and then, when you have engagement levels like you see with the Olympics, then that helps. But churn has been a driver, improvement in churn in video. The second side of it are connects. And we've seen on the connect side, it's the NOW portfolio that has helped NOW TV, NOW Latino, these are products that we segment, use it surgically and have helped video, and it's a nice way to reimagine the platform to be able to deliver good content for the right segment. Hey, John, this is Dave. Let me start with the fiber impact on ARPU, just a general impact. When -- there are two things that we look at and we've been balancing throughout: market share and rate. So, when fiber comes into one of the markets, and been dealing with it for two decades, so we have a pretty good track record in terms of when this happens, how it happens. But we do see that there is an impact on penetration levels, so on the market share side, but we compete aggressively, have a very strong playbook that has evolved over time. And then, share does eventually even out between the two of us. So, when you look at the healthy ARPU levels that are really no different, quite frankly, in terms of fiber versus non-fiber markets, and it goes to our playbook in terms of segmentation. And the focus that Jason talked about with the core network and the fact that we start at the premium levels, job one is delivering the best Internet experience that it's not -- it's speed, multi-gig, but it's everything that we do and how we compete around coverage, capacity, latency, all these things we deliver, and critically, the best WiFi in the marketplace with the great gateway device. And that is how content is really delivered in people's homes and businesses. So, great WiFi has helped, I think. And we look at solid churn rates, but ARPU is really no different as we've seen as things level out. Jessica, this is Dave. So, on the -- in terms of our video strategy, the overall one of the core operating principles that we've had for a long time, we talked about it quite a bit across all of our products, is segmenting the marketplace to give consumers what they want at the right price and the right package. So, no surprise that video follows that. And with a very strong focus on connectivity, how do we surround connectivity with the right package offerings? And that is fundamental to how we look at it. Now having said that, I think the Charter Group does really smart things, and we pay attention to everything that they do. And if there's opportunities, then we always evaluate. But if you break it down further, we all -- we look at the experience that the customer has, we look at choice, and ultimately by segment, the value, those three things. And you look at experience, with our -- because we've invested over a very long period of time and a great platform, we talked about it with the Olympics, but it could be Sunday Night Football, it could be, you name it, Premier League Soccer, we have a unique platform to deliver video content. Then, you have choice, value. A good example of an extension of this is StreamSaver. And StreamSaver for us is an example of choice that we have to try to deliver customers. Could be broadband-only to -- on top of an existing video package. But StreamSaver is a great example of taking the advertising tiers, Netflix, Peacock and obviously, Apple TV, putting it together at a great consumer price point, not subsidizing. It's profitable and it makes a lot of sense. So, I think, it's an example of good video choice, and that is -- look for more of that from us over time. Yeah. Jonathan, just in terms of the operational planning around it, so as Jason just said and talking about it, we have the fundamental path that's being built, one half and then going to the vast majority by the end of next year in terms of mid-split. And then, on the heels of that will be the DOCSIS 4.0. So, it's a clear path to the strong ubiquitous product offering. And for us, it's an operational, then getting all the components, getting everything ready, everything from SIKs to you name it, we get all these pieces pulled together and then we go. So, we have a really good plan. We are definitely on track and really like the roadmap to where we stand. We're ahead of every single application in terms of broadband capability. And so -- and even, I think, doing a better job in things like WiFi, as I mentioned earlier. So, we're in good position with the network plan. No question, and Brian nailed it. It really -- for us, that experience is so key and look for us to do more, to your question. If there's a big sports moment, I think people want to work with us. We love doing it. We make it simple and easy to find what you want in the moment. And then -- and the Sky team does an excellent job of bringing shows to life. And there's unique shows that they do, and we've taken that playbook to the US. So, where there's a big moment in entertainment in any form, look for us to continue to do it."

            "name": "Mike Cavanagh",
            "content": "Thanks, Marcy, and good morning. Before I hand it over to Jason, I'll touch on a few topics that are top of mind for me as we report our third quarter results and head into the home stretch of 2024. First is convergence, second is Epic Universe and third is Media. On convergence, which we define as the combination of ubiquitous high-speed Internet along with wireless phone, by that definition, we are positioned to win. And that is because, today, we have 63 million homes and businesses already able to receive gig-plus broadband speed and we also offer wireless service everywhere we provide broadband. This reach far exceeds the fiber footprints of the largest three telecom companies combined, and our footprint is growing at a rapid pace. In fact, we've extended our network to more than 1.2 million additional homes and businesses over the last 12 months, a 50%-plus increase over what we were able to do just two years ago. So, even accounting for the announced fiber buildout plans of those three wireless companies, we expect to maintain this lead well into the future. Broadband usage is skyrocketing. Our broadband-only customers are heavy data users, averaging 700 gigabytes per month. And we want it that way because our existing network can handle significant increases in bandwidth consumption at a very low marginal cost. In addition, we're on a path over the next few years to being able to deliver multi-gigabit symmetrical speeds, which will be competitive with any technology out there. The other side of our converged offering is Xfinity Mobile, which matches the capabilities of any wireless network in America. We bundle Xfinity Mobile with our best-in-class broadband service everywhere we compete at a price that offers great savings to the consumer. And when combined with broadband, our wireless offering both improves churn and increases overall customer satisfaction. We also look for opportunities to enhance our converged experience. An example being a new feature we are rolling out now called WiFi Boost, which automatically increases Xfinity Mobile customer speeds up to 1 gig on our WiFi network, which is also the largest in the nation. To close out these comments on convergence, it's important to note that our strategy is proving out in financial performance. Our domestic broadband plus wireless revenue has been growing at 5%, which consistently leads the industry when you look across our competitors. The second topic I want to touch on is Epic Universe, which will be the most groundbreaking park ever introduced in the United States. We recently announced that Epic will open on May 22, 2025, and have also started to activate our sales and marketing plans, including the sale of vacation packages that provide the opportunity to visit Epic, which we expect to be in very high demand. This park will offer a level of immersion that is unmatched, transporting guests to expansive worlds featuring more than 50 awe-inspiring attractions, entertainment, dining and shopping experiences. Once Epic opens, Universal Orlando will be transformed into a week's long vacation, offering four theme parks, a CityWalk dining, retail and entertainment district and 11 hotels. Epic will build on everything we've excelled at in the present and in the past and make it even better by infusing iconic storytelling with cutting-edge technology in five fully-themed worlds. Each one telling a fantastic story based on world-renowned movies and literature such as Dark Universe, which capitalizes on our Universal Monster franchise; Isle of Berk, which brings DreamWorks' How to Train Your Dragon to life; there is The Wizarding World of Harry Potter - Ministry of Magic; as well as Super Nintendo World, and all of these are connected by Celestial Park, a world in and of itself. We could not be more excited for what's ahead of us with Epic and our entire Destinations & Experiences business. Finally, let me talk about Media, where the truly outstanding and universally praised production of the Paris Olympics demonstrated the power of NBC broadcast and Peacock. We brought new relevance and excitement to the Olympics by flawlessly presenting the biggest and most complex Olympic Games in history, dominating television, streaming, news and social media for 17 straight days. Daily viewership averaged over 30 million across our platforms, an increase of 80% compared to the prior Summer Olympics in 2021, and Peacock streamed 23.5 billion minutes, up 40% from all prior Summer and Winter Olympics combined. All of this leading to a record high $1.9 billion of incremental Olympics revenue in our Media segment this third quarter. We achieved this result by leaning in with the full symphony of Comcast, NBCUniversal playing together and a big bet on new ideas and innovation that paid off. We are all very grateful to our NBC Sports team and look forward to them bringing the lessons learned and momentum to our entire sports portfolio, especially as we begin to prepare for the relaunch of our partnership with the NBA starting with the 2025-2026 season. The regular and post-season NBA games across both NBC and Peacock, in addition to a number of exclusive Peacock games, will bring in broad and diverse audiences, allowing us to also create new entertainment content that will work beyond the basketball season with exciting opportunities for companion programming and marketing collaborations that tap into the NBA's pop-culture appeal. Before I hand it over to Jason, let me talk about our recent execution against an outlook for our capital allocation priorities, which are threefold: to maintain a very strong balance sheet, which we feel great about given the industry-low leverage we maintain; to return significant capital to our shareholders, which we have done consistently since we reinstated our buyback program in May 2021 and have since returned $50 billion of capital, equaling 100% of our free cash flow and reducing our share count by 20%; and third, to invest in our growth businesses both organically and inorganically. Organically, we've invested heavily in our growth businesses, including the upgrade of our broadband network to ubiquitous 1-gig speeds and counting, the incubation, launch and success of our wireless and business services units, the investment in Peacock and our studios, and the creation of the Epic Universe theme park to name just a few. And while we remain most focused on driving our growth businesses, we also look to maximize the significant legacy value in our portfolio of more mature businesses. As you know, we chose not to participate in the M&A process around Paramount in the earlier part of this year, but we would consider partnerships in streaming despite their complexities. And like many of our peers in media, we are experiencing the effects of the transition in our video businesses and have been studying the best path forward for these assets. To that end, we are now exploring whether creating a new well-capitalized company, owned by our shareholders and comprised of our strong portfolio of cable networks, would position them to take advantage of opportunities in the changing media landscape and create value for our shareholders. We are not ready to talk about any specifics yet, but we'll be back to you as and when we reach firm conclusions. And to sum it up, we are very proud of the job we've done on the capital allocation front over the past few years and we are highly motivated to maintain the same level of discipline. With that, it's over to you Jason. Hey, thanks, Ben. It's Mike. So, let me be clear and just for everybody that maybe just picking up on this, I want to be clear about what I said is that we're going to commence a study of whether there's a good idea in the idea of creating a new well-capitalized company that would go to our shareholders, existing shareholders, comprised of our cable portfolio networks. So that's the group. I'm not talking about Peacock or broadcast. So that's what I said before. And I think the questions about how to do it are the reason we're announcing here that we want to study it. There are a lot of questions to which we don't have answers, so we want to do the work. And we want to do the work with transparency around it, so that as rumors fly and the like, we expect that, but we want our shareholders to understand what we're willing to look at. That's in the context of broader, we look at a lot of things, and I do think in a moment of a lot of transition in the industries we're a part of. I think we've got a very strong hand given the strength of the businesses. We just went through all of them with third quarter results, and I think I'm proud of every part of it. And I think the idea of playing some offense, when you combine the balance sheet strength that we have, the assets we have, and the management team we have, there may be some smart things to do and we want to study that. Yeah, Craig, it's Mike. So, on Epic, like I said, we couldn't be more excited. It is our most ambitious parks experience we've ever put together, right? So, it will warrant a premium and think about ticket pricing at a premium level, but consistent with the market in Orlando. But I think the way to think about how we're going to manage it and we started this with -- we want to drive Orlando. We've got now one of the -- in addition to being what it is, a standalone park that's going to be magnificent, it transforms Universal Orlando into a week's long vacation with the other existing parks. So, I think we'll look at it through the lens of how to optimize the totality of our Orlando footprint, while making sure the park-goer experience is a great experience for Epic, which will be on itself priced at a premium. We are seeing great demand in the early days since we announced that May 22 next year is opening day, and we'll be putting together a lot of Comcast NBCUniversal Symphony effort to now raise awareness of the park as you see in the months and months ahead leading up to opening day. Thanks, Michael. It's Mike. So, just on the Olympics, as I said earlier, we couldn't be more proud of what our teams accomplished across the whole company on the Olympics. So, we were cautiously optimistic going into the games that they would perform well given all the effort we put in in Paris to their backdrop, but viewership, ad sales exceeded our expectations and the games were profitable. I won't go into the level of profitability, but profitable games for us. And so, we walk away from it very excited as we look forward to future Olympics from here, because it was a spell leading up to Paris where prior Olympics, for a variety of reasons, had not performed as well as we had hoped. So, I think there's an incredible amount of energy and excitement as we look ahead to LA and beyond and Milan in between. And so, I don't know if Brian wants to jump in here. John, it's Mike. On the question about the potential for a spin and impact on revenue, I would just say I don't want to get ahead of ourselves. Obviously, we do anything like that, it will have an impact on the consolidated company. But I think the point that we'd make is that it doesn't change the fact that within the business today, we've got six growth drivers that represent more than half of our revenues that are growing this quarter at 9% or so, and on a trailing basis, been in that high-single-digits, sometimes 10%. So, the company is transforming itself to a top-line growing company as our mix changes. Whether we do something like a spin or not, I'd focus everyone on what the underlying is. So, Jessica, it's Mike. I'll hit these quickly. I mean, I think the Epic is, as we said, in the near term, going to have the $150 million of pre-opening costs, and then, it will open midway through the year. So, it will be accretive to the parks' P&L next year. And then obviously, beyond that, we hope it does all the things I said earlier in terms of driving the week's long experience in getting a nice return on the capital put against Epic and the entirety of what we have in the ground in Orlando, period. 11 hotels, the multiple parks, it is something that we feel very confident about in the long term, but I won't give particular guidance on that front. NBA, I think you should think about that as a -- it's a long term. Over the long term, we expect the NBA to be something that adds value to our company broadly, particularly in the Media segment. It's going to help broadcast and benefit from broadcast. We, obviously, saw that during the Olympics, the interplay of broadcast and streaming for sports and the technology for some audiences of what you can do on the streaming side and the reach that broadcast has. So, I think when you think about how it will play into the two audiences, streaming and traditional, which are frankly very different, and there was great viewing of the Olympics on linear despite the unbelievable production in Peacock. So, I think we feel really well-balanced between the broadcast side and the Peacock side. And then, the point for Peacock, NBA makes us -- NBC makes us a year-long sports destination. So, I think that's something that we think is very helpful over the long term as we think about churn as something that needs to be managed a little more carefully, a little differently in the streaming world than the linear world. And then, the point you're really getting at is -- that we've talked about before, is the NBA will bring a younger, more diverse audience. And I think as you bring an audience into a platform like NBC and Peacock, Donna Langley and Pearlena Igbokwe and the team at our studios have the chance to think about how to tap into that audience, together with the talent, frankly, that comes from the NBA themselves. And so, I think that was the point I was making on that. On the spin, really nothing more to say than what I said earlier. These are all the questions that we're going to go off and think about. We think there could be an opportunity to place some offense, like I said, and we'll be back, but that is the thinking. We think we have great assets and a great balance sheet, and that's the thinking. And on Charter, before -- I'll hand it over to Dave on his side, but just a comment for the NBC side on distribution. Obviously, it's a key revenue stream for any media business. And I got to say, we're very pleased that we've now completed 10 renewals in the past 15 months, most recently Charter and Hulu. And it's a mix of both traditional and streaming distributors. And so that just speaks to the power of the content we have and our ability to work with a very important distribution partners, who themselves have different business priorities and objectives from one to the next. So, we're really pleased with that. We're in the middle of -- last one for this year is coming up in a few days, which is DIRECTV. We're in constructive dialogue with folks over there and hope to finish up that negotiation shortly without disruption, just like the rest of the ones we've done in the last bunch of years. And all that adds to just a certain stability and strength of the revenue stream in our business. So, Steven, it's Mike. So, on streaming partnerships, I think we are open to having discussions, but as I said, exploring the idea. I think you put it in context. The bar is really high for whole company media type of acquisitions. That's why what I paired together and the answer is streaming partnerships could be interesting. Details matter one to the next to the next. So, my only point is we're open to them, but they are very complicated, and they could vary in form. We like what we've got very much. So, it would just be as and when a good idea comes along, we're just open to it. That's point one. And two, the other side of it, is cable networks, which we talked about earlier. On Olympics and broadband, I think -- and Dave can chime in here, but I think the whole company looks through simply and otherwise to say what makes us unique place and how do we drive value for our company across all swim lanes, especially around something like the Olympics, but not only that. And when you look at what happens through X1 in terms of presentation of content, it's not just ours, but clearly it's ours when it's the Olympics. And we have all the power of the technology to do what we did with them, but it carries over to how we present other streaming services or integrate other content or navigate through that content with the X1 remote. I do think great content does feed into the thinking of why our company is one company, but I'll let Dave and Brian chime in."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Jason Armstrong",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with our consolidated results on Slide 3. Total revenue increased 6.5% to $32.1 billion, benefiting from NBCUniversal's highly successful airing of the Paris Olympics. Excluding the Olympics, our revenue was relatively flat year-over-year. Our six major growth drivers, including residential broadband, wireless, business services connectivity, theme parks, streaming and premium content in our studios, generated nearly $18 billion in revenue, well over half of our total company revenue and grew 9% in the quarter and at a mid-single-digit rate over the past 12 months. Total EBITDA decreased 2% to $9.7 billion, while we generated free cash flow of $3.4 billion during the third quarter, and returned $3.2 billion of capital to shareholders, including $2 billion in share repurchases. Over the last 12 months, we've reduced our share count by 6%, contributing to our adjusted EPS growth in the quarter of 3%. Let's dive deeper into our results for the third quarter, starting on Slide 4 with Connectivity & Platforms. As usual, I will refer to our year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis. Revenue for total Connectivity & Platforms was consistent year-over-year at $20.3 billion, reflecting strong growth in our connectivity businesses and political advertising, offset by declines in video and voice revenue, as well as non-political advertising in our domestic and international markets. Residential connectivity revenue grew 5%, comprised of 3% growth in domestic broadband, 19% growth in domestic wireless, and 8% growth in international connectivity. Business services connectivity revenue also grew 5%. In domestic broadband, our revenue growth was driven by ARPU growth of 3.6%, another strong result in the context of a continued competitive backdrop. Our team continues to effectively balance rate and volume through customer segmentation. In terms of broadband subscribers, we reported a net loss of 87,000 in the quarter, which included an estimated net impact of 96,000 associated with the end of ACP. Excluding this ACP-related subscriber loss, we would have reported positive 9,000 broadband net additions in the third quarter. Before I cover ACP in more detail, I want to spend a moment addressing the quarter's underlying results in broadband. Keep in mind that in the third quarter, we typically benefit from seasonal tailwinds due to back-to-school activity, and this year was no different as we performed very well in that category. In addition, we believe we also benefited to some extent from a competitor's work stoppage as well as from leveraging the Olympics by investing in incremental nationwide brand marketing behind our Olympic-related offers. Now, let me cover ACP. As I mentioned, we had 96,000 losses related to ACP in the quarter. That's roughly one-third direct losses we experienced in the quarter and the other two-thirds reflects a reserve we took for the number of subscribers that we predict will churn in the coming months due to a non-pay or delinquency status. Turning to domestic wireless. Revenue growth was mainly driven by service revenue, fueled by strong growth in customer lines, which were up over 1.2 million or 20% year-over-year, reaching 7.5 million in total, including 319,000 line additions this quarter. Importantly, our wireless customers are also broadband customers, and when bundled together, drive overall customer relationship ARPU growth, churn benefits for broadband and higher profitability. With wireless penetration at 12% of our broadband subscriber base, we have a very long runway for growth. We're pleased with our strategy and we'll continue to test new converged offers to capitalize on the significant opportunities we see ahead of us in wireless, including both increasing the penetration of our domestic residential broadband customer base as well as selling additional lines per account. And just to reiterate what Mike mentioned, we have an incredible hand to play in convergence. We currently have an offering for gig-plus speeds and wireless available ubiquitously to our footprint of 63 million homes and businesses today. And by ubiquitous, I mean we are not making any network trade-offs and every customer gets access to the same offerings. We believe we have a leadership position in convergence and we think we can sustain that. We're on a clear path to offer multi-gig symmetrical speeds, and we'll continue to grow our footprint projecting to add over 1.2 million new homes passed this year. International connectivity revenue growth of 8% was driven by broadband, reflecting strong ARPU growth, and in wireless, healthy service revenue growth was offset by lower device revenue. Business services connectivity revenue growth of 5% reflects steady growth in small business and even faster growth in enterprise. In small business, it continues to be a competitive market, but we are growing revenue with ARPU growth driven by higher adoption of a suite of additional products that expand our relationship with our SMB customers. At the enterprise level, we are taking share and continue to scale this business. In advertising, growth of 2% reflects stronger political revenue this quarter, partially offset by lower non-political domestic and international advertising revenue. Finally, video and other revenue declined in the quarter. The 7% decline in our video revenue is a function of continued customer losses, coupled with slower domestic ARPU growth versus last year. And the lower other revenue mainly reflects continued customer losses in wireline voice. Connectivity & Platforms' total EBITDA was consistent year-over-year at $8.3 billion, with margins up 50 basis points, reflecting a decline in overall expenses, driven by the continued mix shift to our higher-margin connectivity businesses and ongoing expense management, partially offset by an increase in marketing and promotion expense, driven by our incremental brand marketing investment during the Paris Olympics. Breaking out our Connectivity & Platforms' EBITDA results further, residential EBITDA was consistent with margins improving 40 basis points to 38.6% and business services EBITDA growth was at a mid-single-digit rate, with margins fairly stable at 57.4%. Rounding out Connectivity & Platforms, I'd note that our business continues to evolve as the mix shifts towards our connectivity growth drivers. As such, you've seen us take some cost reduction actions in our fourth quarter for the past several years. We expect to take similar actions again this fourth quarter at about an equal magnitude to last year. Now, let's turn to Content & Experiences on Slide 5. Revenue increased 19% to $12.6 billion, and EBITDA decreased 9% to $1.8 billion. At theme parks, revenue decreased 5% and EBITDA declined 14% in the quarter compared to last year's all-time record high. The majority of the decline was driven by lower attendance at our domestic parks when compared to last year. As we've highlighted, our view is there was both a pull-forward of demand that we clearly saw in 2022 and 2023, which were record years for the theme parks and beyond our expectations, as well as the new attraction pipeline, which is light this year, but building towards a substantial pipeline next year. We think these factors will likely be in place until the second quarter of next year, which is both when we start to lap the pressure we saw this year and the launch of Epic Universe. Looking ahead, we couldn't be more excited about Epic Universe and how it will transform Universal Orlando into a week-long destination. And as we gear up for the May 2025 opening, we expect to incur pre-opening costs of about $150 million in total over the fourth quarter this year and the first quarter next year. We remain bullish about the long-term trajectory of parks. In addition to Epic Universe, we have a fantastic slate of new attractions and experiences on the horizon. Donkey Kong Country in Osaka and a Fast and Furious roller coaster in Hollywood, as well as Universal Horror Unleashed in Vegas and our Universal Kids Resort coming to Texas. Now, let's turn to Media, where revenue increased 37% to $8.2 billion, including the strong results from the Paris Olympics, which generated $1.9 billion in revenue, a record level for any Olympics. Strength in the Olympics was mainly driven by a record $1.4 billion in advertising revenue, with Peacock contributing over $300 million of that. Excluding the Olympics, total advertising revenue was flat year-over-year as the overall market remained stable, while total media revenue increased 5%, driven by an exceptional quarter for Peacock. Revenue growth for Peacock was 82% and still a very robust greater than 40% excluding the Olympics. This was also a strong quarter for Peacock paid subscribers as we added 3 million net new additions driven not only by the Olympics, but also the return of the NFL, including our Peacock exclusive NFL game from Brazil, the return of the Big Ten, and several entertainment hits during the quarter including Love Island, Bel Air and Fight Night. Looking ahead, we will continue to be focused on strong revenue growth and improving profitability at Peacock in the broader context of expected revenue and profit growth across the entire Media segment. Media EBITDA in the quarter declined 10% to $650 million, but this was largely timing related as a profitable Olympics was offset by higher expenses due to the timing of other sports, including two additional NFL games in the quarter, an additional Sunday Night Football game and Peacock's exclusive game from Brazil. At studios, revenue increased 12% and EBITDA increased 9%, driven by the success of our film slate, including Despicable Me 4 as well as Twisters. Year-to-date, we have three of the top 10 box office titles, including Twisters, Kung Fu Panda 4 and Despicable Me 4, which has already grossed nearly $1 billion and is the first animated franchise in the industry to surpass $5 billion in global box office. Looking to the fourth quarter, Wild Robot debuted in September to terrific reviews and has had nice success at the box office, a great achievement for original animation. And we are particularly excited about Wicked opening in November. I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 6. As I mentioned earlier, we generated $3.4 billion in free cash flow this quarter and achieved this even with significant organic investment. The $3.6 billion in total capital expenditures this quarter reflects spending to bolster our six key growth areas and, most significantly, our efforts in expanding our connectivity footprint through accelerating homes passed and further strengthening our domestic broadband network, and the continued buildout of our Epic Universe theme park ahead of its opening in May of 2025. Turning to return to capital, we returned a total of $3.2 billion to shareholders in the quarter, including share repurchases of $2 billion and dividend payments of $1.2 billion. In fact, our share count has been consistently shrinking mid-single-digits on an annual basis for the past several years. We've been straightforward and consistent in our priorities around investing in our six key growth drivers, protecting our strong balance sheet and returning a significant amount of capital to shareholders. This quarter is yet another example of that. Now, let's turn it back to Marci for Q&A. Marci? Hey, Craig, let me just hit your quick question on just the costs around pre-opening costs around Epic. So, for third quarter, minimal costs there, I'd say in the range of $20 million or so in terms of pre-opening costs. We did say -- just to clarify your comment, you said $150 million for fourth quarter. What I said in my prepared remarks was $150 million in pre-opening costs split between the fourth quarter and the first quarter. I think between the two, it will be more weighted towards the first quarter. Hey, Craig, let me broaden that out to footprint expansion in general and just sort of our philosophy there. We've obviously accelerated our footprint expansion couple of years ago. If you rewind the clock, we were at 800,000 homes passed per year. Dave and team has sort of nicely driven that to 1.2 million homes and pacing towards that this year. What underpins that view and how we're underwriting it, because obviously we're putting capital towards it, is a view of sort of structural competitive environment over the long term. And from our perspective as we see it, the two key competitors, as you look at it this past year, fixed wireless has obviously taken its toll. We think that's a market that's going to continue to exist, continue to be around, but it's for the value-conscious consumer. It is carved out a niche in the market that whether it's 10%, 15%, I'm not sure we've got a crystal ball, but it is a niche. Fiber, as we've said, is the real long-term competitor. That's an entity that's been building out against us for almost 20 years at this point. It's been sort of a steady increase in our footprint. Right now, we're about 50% overbuilt. We would tell you that will go higher. Obviously, the carriers have announced plans to take that higher. So, we expect it to go higher and we expect to see competition across the majority of our footprint, including two wires, one of which is ours, which is currently a gig-plus, and we'll go to multi-gig symmetrical through how we're investing, and the others of which is fiber. But the long-term view is we've competed against fiber for almost two decades at this point. And so, we are seasoned in competing against fiber and we know exactly what fiber markets look like. So, if you go back and look at some of the early fiber markets and tenure markets where we've had a chance to sort of see the competitive progression, what you see is initial uptake and then you see the competitive environment sort of leveling out and you see relatively even share between us and fiber. We see ARPUs in those markets that are very consistent with our overall ARPU. So, when you think about sort of a long term, how do you invest against this, are you comfortable taking your footprint expansion to a greater level, these are all things that underpin our current investment and future investment. Thanks, Jonathan. Let me take the first couple and hand it to Dave on footprint. So, on CapEx and capital intensity, yeah, we came into the year and said similar capital intensity to last year. Obviously, the pacing to the first three quarters is sort of on that track, maybe on the low end, but I would point you to -- just stepping back, we're not using capital intensity as sort of a gating factor. We are coming into this saying, what amount do we want to -- what can we upgrade by both in terms of network upgrade and then footprint expansion? What makes logical sense? How fast can the engineers move? And so, that is largely going to dictate our pacing. So, I wouldn't change the guidance for the full year, which implies a little bit of a catch-up in the fourth quarter. On the upgrade of the cable plant, I would say as you step back, our network upgrade is on plan. We think we have a cost-effective strategy that gets us faster speeds across the entire footprint. As I mentioned earlier, we are ubiquitous at a gig now. That's very important from a marketing perspective as you think more broadly about convergence. We've said we think we have the largest convergence footprint, but importantly, we can do things from a ubiquitous perspective, ubiquitous speeds plus ubiquitous wireless on top of it. So, we've got a good path there, gig now and then headed to multi-gig over time. We've got a plan to get there today. Roughly half our footprint is updated with the mid-split technology, which was sort of foundational in that effort. We expect to actually be through the vast majority of that effort by the end of next year. And then, DOCSIS 4.0 sort of rides right on the back of that."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Comcast's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Executive Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone. Joining us on today's call are, Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh, Jason Armstrong, and Dave Watson. I will now refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation accompanying this call, which can also be found on our Investor Relations website, which contains our safe harbor disclaimer. This conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our 8-K and trending schedule issued earlier this morning for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Cavanagh: Thank you, Marci, and good morning, everyone. Before I hand it over to Jason, I'd like to comment on three key elements from the quarter. One, broadband; two, parks; and three, the NBA. So, first is broadband, where the competitive intensity that we've seen for the past several quarters and which is particularly felt in the market for price-conscious consumers remains essentially unchanged, but throughout this period, our broadband strategy has been consistent and we remain confident in our plan. We are focused on generating healthy broadband revenue growth by striking the right balance between rate and volume and relying heavily on market segmentation that I'll speak to in a minute. As a result, in the second quarter, ARPU grew 3.6%, which was within our historical range of 3% to 4%. Despite the competitiveness of the recent past, we've maintained a market-leading base of 32 million broadband customers by refining our go-to-market approach to create options that fit each of our customers' lifestyles and budgets. Providing the best products with flexibility and choice at different value points, has served us extremely well for many years and remains the core of our playbook. Of particular note, this quarter, we launched our suite of NOW products, which are high-quality internet, mobile and streaming TV offerings designed to be incredibly simple with attractive all-in pricing with no contracts or credit checks. These are great options for the price-conscious segment and especially for those impacted by the end of the government's ACP program. While we are pleased with our enhancement to our offerings for the price-conscious segment, the reality is that the vast majority of our customer base subscribes to more premium products, where we feel great about our market position relative to fiber, which is our true long-term competitor. We are investing in additional network capacity, multi-gig speeds and in-home WiFi technology to capitalize on the Internet consumption trends we are seeing. One of the most important metrics we monitor is the magnitude of data traffic flowing across our network. And again, we saw a double-digit year-over-year growth this quarter, with broadband-only households consuming over 700 gigabytes of data each month. And our customers continue to take faster speeds, with around 70% of our residential subscribers receiving speeds of 500 megabits per second or higher and one-third getting a gigabit or more. These positive consumer trends play to our strengths and will only accelerate with the shift of live sports to streaming, which together with entertainment on streaming accounts for nearly 70% of our network traffic today. My final thought on broadband is the importance of bundling with mobile, with 90% of Xfinity Mobile smartphone traffic traveling over our WiFi network. These two products work seamlessly together to benefit our customers from both the products' experience and financial value standpoint. We are very pleased with the momentum we saw in wireless this quarter, where our line additions were again above 300,000 and nicely up year-over-year. Our new converged offers resulted in better overall yield and awareness as well as higher multi-line attach rates and we are excited for some of the new mobile offers tied to the Olympics, which will be introduced to the market in just a few days. Now, let's turn to parks, where our results were down in both revenue and EBITDA when compared to last year's record performance, with two-thirds of the decline driven by lower attendance at our domestic parks. We attribute this to a number of factors. First, is what now appears to be a COVID recovery pull-forward of a magnitude we hadn't previously appreciated. I think it's important to zoom out and look at how this business has trended over the past few years. Going back to 2022 and 2023, parks were clearly the early beneficiaries of substantial rebounds in tourism and travel after the pandemic, resulting in a surge in demand that contributed to us reaching record results for both of those years. More recently, other travel options, including cruises and international tourism, given the strength of the dollar, have experienced their own surge in demand, which caused visitation rates at our parks to normalize. The second factor affecting attendance at our domestic parks is the timing of our investments in new attractions, where we are light in Florida in advance of next year's opening of Epic and our lapping of Super Nintendo World in Hollywood is creating some headwinds for us as well. While the parks results are below our original expectations for the year, we still view parks as a terrific long-term growth business for us. We couldn't be more excited about the opening of Epic Universe in 2025, as we've been releasing new details about Epic's Five Immersive Worlds, the consumer reaction has been tremendous. And recently, we opened an Epic Universe Preview Center in Orlando and the foot traffic and guest enthusiasm have been off the charts. So, we look forward to Epic Universe having a meaningful impact by driving incremental attendance, longer visits and higher per-cap spending once the park opens in 2025. Finally, let me talk about the NBA. Our expectation is that soon an 11-year rights deal between ourselves and the NBA will be announced. We don't believe that the resolution of matching rights will affect the package that we expect to be awarded. This package, which begins with the 2025-2026 season includes: 100 NBA games each regular season across NBC and Peacock, which is more than any other media partner and more regular season games than each existing partner has under the current rights deal; for playoffs, we will have first and second round games each year, exclusively on our national platforms and six NBA conference final series over the course of the term of the deal, which is more playoff games on average each year, than any other media partner; and exclusively for Peacock will be approximately 50 national regular season and post-season games, including National Monday Night games and doubleheaders. Additional elements of the NBA package include the annual NBA All-Star Game and All-Star Saturday Night each season, the season opening NBA tip-off doubleheader each season, a special doubleheader on the MLK holiday, and Select NBA games in every NBA All-Star game on Telemundo. Beyond the NBA itself, we're excited that our package includes WNBA, where starting in the spring of 2026, we'll have more than 50 WNBA regular season and first round playoff games each season across Peacock, NBC and USA, and we'll also have games in seven WNBA Conference semifinals and three WNBA Final series; for USA Basketball, we'll have the rights to USA men's and women's games leading up to the Olympics and FIBA World Cup; Sky Sports will air all of NBCUniversal's NBA and WNBA games in its markets; and finally, Xfinity will be the NBA and WNBA's marketing partner in the video category. Now, I'd like to take a moment to explain why we're so excited to partner with the NBA. First, it brings in a broad, diverse and youthful audience that is culturally relevant and further expands NBCUniversal's tremendous reach across broadcast and streaming. This new fan base will also allow us to create new entertainment content that will work beyond the basketball season with exciting opportunities for companion programming and marketing collaborations that tap into the NBA's pop culture appeal. Second, the nine-month basketball season completes our year-round calendar for sports, which already includes the NFL, Olympics, Premier League, NASCAR, PGA Tour, Big Ten and World Cup, and our NBA package will establish much-watched Sunday, Monday and Tuesday night traditions on NBC and Peacock. Third, we are uniquely able to drive strong value with the NBA in multiple ways: first, by growing ad sales, by selling NBA ad inventory package with the rest of our marquee programming; second, by acquiring and monetizing subscribers both on Linear and Peacock; and third, by optimizing NBCUniversal programming investment across sports, entertainment and news. The NBA's decision to partner with us is a testament to our breadth and reach, our operational excellence in sports and innovation, and our decades of experience delivering world-class content to consumers. Much like our long-standing relationships with the NFL and the Olympics, we look forward to putting the weight of our entire company behind our partnership with the NBA for decades to come. Before I hand it over to Jason, I want to share one final thought. In just a few short days, we have the honor of kicking off the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. This will be NBCUniversal's 18th Olympic Games as a US broadcaster, dating back to 1936 when we first covered the historic event on NBC Radio. It is one of the great moments of pride for our company, and I want to thank the 3,000 people working to bring all of the action, excitement and incredible stories to our viewers across the country. Jason, over to you.\nJason Armstrong: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with our consolidated results on Slide 3. Total revenue decreased 2.7% to $29.7 billion. Within these results, our six major growth drivers, including residential broadband, wireless, business services connectivity, theme parks, streaming and premium content at our studios, generated over $16 billion in revenue, well over half of our total company revenue and grew at a mid-single-digit rate over the past 12 months. Keep in mind that in the second quarter of last year, we had one of our most successful quarterly theatrical results in our history, which included two of 2023's top-five grossing films at the worldwide box office, The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Fast X, and as such created a difficult comparison this quarter. If we exclude our studio results, total revenue would have been consistent with the prior year. Total EBITDA was consistent at $10.2 billion, and free cash flow was $1.3 billion. Free cash flow was impacted this quarter by higher-than-usual cash taxes, which were up $2 billion over last year's level and were impacted by a tax payment associated with our Hulu stake and other tax-related matters. As you'll recall, we received a minimum floor payment for Hulu at the end of last year. During the second quarter, we returned $3.4 billion of capital to shareholders, including $2.2 billion in share repurchases, and over the last 12 months, we have reduced our share count by over 6%, contributing to our adjusted EPS growth of 7%. Now, let's go through our business results, starting on Slide 4, with Connectivity & Platforms. As usual, I will refer to our year-over-year growth on a constant-currency basis. Revenue for total Connectivity & Platforms was consistent at $20.2 billion, as strong growth in our connectivity businesses was offset by declines in video and voice revenue. Residential connectivity revenue grew 6%, comprised of 3% growth in domestic broadband, 17% growth in domestic wireless, and 14% growth in international connectivity. Business services connectivity revenue also grew 6%. In domestic broadband, our revenue growth was again driven by strong ARPU growth, which increased 3.6% this quarter, well within our historical range as our team continues to effectively balance rate and volume through customer segmentation. The environment for broadband subscribers remains intensely competitive, which when combined with traditional negative seasonality in the second quarter, led to 120,000 subscriber losses. Related to this, I would like to spend a minute on ACP. It has been well-documented that the government ended all funding for the ACP program in June. Consistent with our approach to normal promotional roll-offs, we were proactive and prepared for this action early in the quarter, communicating with our ACP customer base and migrating many of these customers to different products and price levels. While this had a bit of an impact on ARPU in the quarter, we still feel very comfortable that we will remain well within our historical 3% to 4% ARPU growth range for the remainder of the year. In terms of subscribers, we saw minimal impact from the end of ACP this quarter. Looking ahead, we expect the bulk of our ACP-related subscriber activity to happen in the third quarter, including losses associated with non-pay churn. While it's too early to assess the full impact, we are encouraged with the response we see from these customers to-date. Outside of ACP, we are seeing the same level of competitive intensity and expect an offset from seasonal tailwinds as the third quarter is typically a seasonally stronger quarter compared to the second. Turning to domestic wireless, revenue growth was mainly driven by service revenue, with some modest growth in equipment revenue this quarter as well. Customer lines increased 20% year-over-year, reaching 7.2 million in total, including 322,000 line additions this quarter. The acceleration in line additions compared to the prior several quarters was driven by some early success with new pricing plans launched in April, targeted at multi-line customers, as well as continued traction with our Buy One, Get One line offer. And you will see us continue to test new ways to capitalize on the significant opportunities we see ahead for us in wireless, in terms of both increasing the penetration of our domestic residential broadband customer base, which currently sits at 12%, as well as selling additional lines per account. Wireless continues to be a key growth area for us and one in which we are striking the right balance in delivering exceptional value to our customers, bundling to enhance our opportunities in broadband, and continuing to drive profitability higher. International connectivity revenue was mainly driven by broadband, which accounts for over two-thirds of our international revenue and grew at a mid-teens rate, reflecting strong ARPU growth. The remainder is wireless, which grew due to both additional lines and ARPU growth, but at a lower rate due to the variability in handset sales. Business services connectivity revenue growth of 6% reflects steady growth in small businesses with even faster growth in mid-market and enterprise. While the SMB market remains competitive, we are competing aggressively by delivering best-in-class products and services and growing revenue through ARPU growth, driven by higher adoption of additional products that expand our relationship with our SMB customers, like Mobile, Security Edge, Connection Pro, and WiFi Pro, as well as through targeted rate opportunities. At the mid-market and enterprise level, our revenue growth is primarily fueled by the increase in our customers, driven by the investments we have made in this space to build sales and fulfillment, as well as expanding our capabilities in managed services, wide area networking, and cyber cybersecurity. Finally, video and other revenue declined in the quarter. The high single-digit decline in our video revenue is a function of continued customer losses, coupled with slower domestic ARPU growth versus last year, and the lower other revenue mainly reflects the continued customer losses in wireline voice. Connectivity & Platform's total EBITDA increased 1.6%, with margin up 90 basis points, reflecting a decline in overall expenses driven by the continued mix-shift to our higher-margin connectivity businesses, coupled with ongoing expense management. As I have previously mentioned in prior quarters and think is worth noting here, is that the only expense line item that had a meaningful increase over last year was direct product costs, which are success-based and tied to growth in our connectivity businesses. Breaking out our Connectivity & Platforms EBITDA results further, residential EBITDA increased 1.1%, with margins improving 100 basis points to 39.9%, and business services EBITDA growth rebounded nicely this quarter, returning to a mid-single-digit rate, while margin declined 70 basis points to 57%, reflecting the investments in sales and fulfillment we are making to scale in the mid-market and enterprise space. Now, let's turn to Content & Experiences on Slide 5. Revenue decreased 7.5% to $10.1 billion, and EBITDA decreased 11% to $1.9 billion. I'll detail these results further, starting with theme parks. Revenue decreased 11% and EBITDA declined 24% in the quarter compared to last year's record level for a second quarter. As Mike highlighted, two-thirds of the decline was driven by our domestic parks, due to lower attendance compared to last year, largely reflecting two factors; normalization in demand post-COVID, combined with the timing of our domestic attractions. This is the first full quarter comparison to the highly successful opening of Super Nintendo World in Hollywood early last year, which drove that park's record results in the second quarter of last year. And we haven't launched a major new attraction in Orlando since VelociCoaster in 2021 in anticipation of Epic Universe, which we originally planned to open this year. On the international side, underlying growth at our park in Osaka continues, partially offset by foreign currency as well as some softness at Universal Beijing due to the local macroeconomic environment. To reiterate, we couldn't be more bullish about the long-term trajectory of parks. In addition to Epic Universe, we have a fantastic slate of new attractions and experiences on the horizon, Donkey Kong Country in Osaka and a Fast and Furious Roller Coaster in Hollywood, as well as the Universal Horror Unleashed in Las Vegas and our Universal Kids Resort coming to Texas. Now let's turn to media, where revenue increased 2% and EBITDA was up 9%, driven by Peacock. Peacock revenue grew 28%, with 9% growth in advertising and 61% growth in distribution, driven by the 38% year-over-year increase in our paid subscriber base to 33 million. On a sequential basis, we held subscribers fairly steady. As we noted, during our last earnings call, our focus in the second quarter was on subscriber retention due to the lack of new tentpole content in the quarter. This timing and content also contributed to some relief in our expenses, which helped drive year-over-year Peacock EBITDA improvement of $300 million. We are pleased with the progress we are making, with media EBITDA for the first half of the year up nearly 3% as the improvement at Peacock outweighed the pressure at our TV networks. As we look to the second half of the year, we expect continued modest growth in overall media EBITDA, but with some variation in the degree of year-over-year improvement between the quarters, driven by the timing of sports, entertainment launches and marketing. Beginning in the third quarter, we are loaded with incremental content, including the Olympics, Sunday Night Football, which will have an additional game fall into the third quarter, as well as Peacock's exclusive NFL game from Brazil and the return of Big Ten. Given the timing of this content, EBITDA growth will be skewed to the fourth quarter. At studios, revenue decreased 27% and EBITDA decreased 51%, reflecting both the timing of our film slate and a tough comparison relative to last year's second quarter, which included the tremendously successful Super Mario Bros. movie as well as Fast X. We have said our film slate is weighted to the back-half of the year, which we believe will drive better year-over-year performance, and we're off to a strong start. Despicable Me 4 had a terrific opening weekend earlier this month, making the Despicable Me series of movies the first animated franchise in history to cross the $5 billion mark. And Twisters is off to a strong start, landing at number one at the box office this past weekend. And we're excited about our upcoming titles, including Wild Robot in September and Wicked in November. I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 6. As I mentioned earlier, we generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow this quarter, which includes a $2 billion increase in cash taxes over last year's level. Total capital spending declined 10% compared to last year with the $3.4 billion in spending reflecting the significant investments we continue to make to support our growth drivers, such as expanding our footprint and further strengthening our domestic broadband network, scaling our streaming business and supporting the continued build of our Epic Universe Theme Park ahead of its opening in 2025. Turning to return of capital. For the quarter, we returned a total of $3.4 billion to shareholders. This includes share repurchases of $2.2 billion and dividend payments of $1.2 billion. Notably, since we restarted our buyback program just three years ago, we have reduced our share count by 16% and returned just under $50 billion to shareholders through a combination of buybacks and dividends, prudently balancing investments we've made in the business around our six core growth drivers, protecting a strong balance sheet and providing strong capital returns to shareholders. Now, let me turn it over to Brian for some closing remarks. Brian?\nBrian Roberts: Thanks. And just to tie everything together what Mike and Jason have just said and as our results continue to show, I really believe we are dealing with the competitive landscape shifts exceptionally well and that's because we have a great team across the company that knows how to execute and innovate. We have the scale, balance sheet and relevancy to compete with anyone. So, if you think about what we're doing to position ourselves for growth, we've expanded our broadband network by 1.2 million new homes passed in the last 12 months, the most in the company's history, and we put plan to continue to do that. We're upbeat about the long-term in parks despite this quarter and are about to finish building the biggest, most technologically advanced theme park to hit the US market in decades with Epic Universe next year. And as you've seen recently, instead of engaging in a process to buy content companies, we have focused primarily on organic opportunities like the NBA, one of the most coveted sports franchises across the globe, which will help drive growth for us well into the future. With that, let's hand it over to Marci to take your questions.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Brian. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions, please.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you. Good morning. And Mike, thanks for all the detail on the NBA contract. Appreciate that. I wanted to ask about parks and broadband. Maybe, Jason, on broadband, you made some comments about ACP and how Dave and the team are managing it, it seems like it's going well. It seems like you were implying third quarter losses might be down from Q2. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but you talked about an offset around seasonality, I was just wondering if maybe you could revisit that in a little bit about how you guys are managing it from a product and marketing point of view in the third quarter. And presumably, that's the end, we can move on beyond 3Q, we can put ACP behind us, so wanted to ask about that. And then, on parks, thank you for all the color. When you guys look at your pacing data, which I imagine you've got months ahead of you that you can see, is there any -- do you see any churn, or should we be thinking about year-on-year pressure on this segment moving at least through the end of the year and into next year as we get ready for Epic? Any more color on sort of what the outlook looks like would be appreciated. Thanks so much.\nDave Watson: Hey, Ben, this is Dave. I'm going to jump in a little bit on the ACP part first. So, on -- I think it's important to just cover a little bit of context and then we'll get to the outlook in view of Q3. Most of the enrolled ACP customers as we said before have been with us and they are on a postpaid basis, so I think that's an important thing to remember. And our strategy has been consistent. We've been looking to help the ACP customers stay connected through a variety of options, starting with Internet Essential. And since 2011, we've connected millions in the largest, most comprehensive private sector Internet adoption program in the country. The good news is that our ACP customers are eligible to switch to our IE, Internet Essential tiers that we have, and we have a couple. In addition, we have Xfinity Mobile and we have good offers through this transition and to help them save money on their monthly bills. The Internet Essential customer, the plus tier, customers could take a free line of Xfinity Mobile for a year and ACP customers who add Xfinity Mobile can get an additional free unlimited line for a year. So -- and then we just started with NOW Internet, NOW Mobile, and so nothing material on that, but I think it puts us in good position as we complete the transition. We spent -- as Jason said, we've spent a lot of time thinking about this, been very proactive, prepared for this, and in many ways, it's similar to the promotional role activity that we've managed for decades, so we're used to that. On the -- from a subscriber viewpoint, also as Jason said, we saw a minimal impact in ACP in Q2. Looking forward, we expect the bulk of the ACP subscriber-related activity to happen in the third quarter, including losses associated with non-paid churn. Very focused on retention. It's early, but the biggest impact I think we're going to see will be on the non-pay side, and as we're just getting into the beginning of the non-pay cycles. Encouragingly, we're not seeing much voluntary churn in this group. So, our goal, we'd like to get through the ACP impact as quickly as possible, and right now we're planning to take a reserve on incremental non-pay activity in the third quarter, but again, it is too early to quantify and we just won't know until we're further through the cycle. So, we have a normal disconnect process that we managed for a long period of time, and again, this is the post-pay universe that we have managed through. So, we'll -- that is our view. I think it will be primarily within Q3, but encouraged by at least the voluntary churn aspect. Jason?\nJason Armstrong: Yeah. I think Dave said it perfectly, as you think about third quarter, Ben, I think unpacking it and similar to what we saw in the second quarter, the competitive environment remains intense, but it's stable. It's sort of no worse, no better than we've seen over the past couple of quarters, I think that's the starting point. Second, as we pointed out, it's a quarter where we do get seasonal tailwinds, the same things that were headwinds in the second quarter largely become tailwinds in the third quarter. And then there's ACP that works against that where we will see an impact. As Dave said, the intention is to be largely through the impact by the end of the third quarter between actions we've seen and then a reserve we will take. And so, that's the thing we have to make sure we're executing very well against, but as Dave said, the early trends on that, whether it's voluntary churn or trends we've seen so far in non-pay and building non-pay and reserves around that are encouraging.\nBen Swinburne: Great.\nMike Cavanagh: And, Ben, it's Mike on parks. So, to hit on that again and appreciate the question, I think we covered a lot in the earlier remarks, but I'll start where Brian last finished, which is, we couldn't be more excited about and confident in the long-term trajectory of the parks business, particularly as we look ahead to next year with Epic Universe, which is truly -- looking truly unbelievable. And then, other attractions coming, Hollywood is going to get a Coaster and Donkey Kong Country into Osaka in the latter part of this year. Timing, TBD on both of those. But in the near term, I think the domestic attendance challenge that was -- what drove two-thirds of the poor comparison, the factors causing that, which is really the COVID pull-forward that we talked about and the timing of attractions, particularly in Hollywood lapping Super Nintendo, and in Florida, the fact that we originally planned to have Epic opened this year, but with COVID pushed it back, and so have a lull in the action. We haven't started a new big attraction since VelociCoaster in 2021. So, as a result of that, I think the factors, even though we're excited about Hollywood Horror Nights in the second half of the year and a little bit of moving past the lapping, I think the trends that we are experiencing likely continue until we get to -- until we get to Epic opening up sometime next year.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you, guys.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Ben. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. Next question is coming from Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now live.\nCraig Moffett: Hi, thank you. Good morning. A little bit more on ACP, if I could. Mike, could you just give us any early insight you've got on the delinquency rate for people that are 30 days or 60 days past due, just so we can sort of get a sense of what non-pays may look like? And then, presumably, there was some impact, certainly, there was in the first quarter, of just lower gross adds in the category because new enrollments were shut off and somebody moving across the street, for example, would lose it at their old address, but not be able to get it at their new one. Do you have any estimate for how much ACP impact there might have been in the gross add category? And then, just two -- one just simple housekeeping question. You typically report cable margins on the conference call, in the script. I didn't hear it, maybe I missed it, but I'm wondering if you could tell us what cable margins were in the quarter.\nMike Cavanagh: I'll let Dave handle the ACP question, Craig. It's Mike.\nDave Watson: Hey, Craig, Dave. So, in terms of delinquency rates, there's nothing. We're watching, it's just -- we have a normal process that we manage through based on due dates and voices and it goes anywhere from two to three months. There's nothing at this point to report on at this stage. We watch it closely. Other than to go back to what I said, been very proactive, and I think it we're helped by experience and promotional roles and the fact that we tried to put customers into packages that made sense for them proactively. So, there's a lot of work that went into that ahead of time, but nothing at this stage and we'll give more as we go. In terms of -- the question in terms of lower gross adds impacts on connects, it was not material that we saw in Q2. So maybe just a little bit in terms of things that we said, but yeah, it wasn't a substantial impact in Q2 and we think the bulk of what we're seeing is really going to be on the non-pay side, which will occur in Q3.\nJason Armstrong: Hey, Craig, let me hit the margin question real quick. So, I would say, the way we're looking at the business is really across Connectivity & Platforms. So, looking at it that way and managing the business that way. But to unpack it, legacy cable margin, if you wanted to look at it that way, the margin was up 110 basis points in the quarter, so really strong operating improvement to up to 48.4%.\nCraig Moffett: Okay. Thanks. Could I squeeze in one more and just [Technical Difficulty] your thinking is right now about BEAD and whether we might see more capital investment on the BEAD side?\nDave Watson: Yeah, this is Dave. BEAD, we're looking at it very closely. It is going to be worked out on a state-by-state basis. We're optimistic in a lot of cases, but we'll have to look for the guidelines and the specifics tied to it. Nothing at this point would suggest we're going to be beyond the capital intensity that we've already given out. I think with all -- I mean, we're optimistic. One of the points that Brian mentioned, the 1.2 million that we've done in the last 12 months is astounding. And the machine is really going. So, we're leaning in, going for it, but BEAD will be on a state-by-state basis.\nMarci Ryvicker: Operator, we are now ready for the next question.\nOperator: Certainly. Next question is coming from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. I have an NBA question and also one on advertising. The benefits, as you outlined, are pretty obvious of getting the NBA, but it does come at a significant price. I was hoping if you could walk us through how you expect to make a positive financial return and maybe elaborate a little more on what role Peacock will play since there's a clear benefit there. But how does it affect -- how does this new deal impact programming spend for other areas including general entertainment? And then, as part of Peacock, maybe you could talk about like the StreamSaver, the bundle with Netflix and Apple TV, and the response you've had? And then, on advertising, the upfront is now done. Maybe you can talk about a little bit about the unique selling position you've had relative to others and what the volume is overall on pricing, et cetera, just what you're seeing in the overall market?\nMike Cavanagh: Sure. Hey, Jessica, it's Mike. So, I think I've essentially covered everything that I wanted to cover and can cover at this stage on NBA in the prepared remarks. Obviously, when the NBA makes its ultimate announcements, we'll -- that will be another moment where we can go deeper. But just to the point generally is that we are looking at the NBA as we all said as some of the premier content that is culturally relevant, excellent audience, widens out the calendar year for us across Peacock and NBC, can do a lot with the demographics that follow the NBA around other programming. So, when you think about the business case for it, when you look at the long-term and as we are managing the media business, broadcast and Peacock as one, I think the unique reach that we have and ability for a sport like the NBA to reach so far with our existing broadcast business and use, as I said earlier, plenty of exclusive games for Peacock to drive excellent acquisition in Peacock and we've talked about before using NBA. And as we've talked about before, sports has been a great source of acquisition for us in Peacock and a great source of value to the consumer. But what's very interesting to us is how significant the viewership is of sports viewers on Peacock of things other than sports. So, when you take a zoom out and think about the total picture of what we're trying to do, which is to bring our excellent TV media assets into the future, I think you can -- we view the NBA as an excellent piece in that puzzle and it will allow us to rebalance programming from other areas. Obviously, we'll fill a few nights on NBC with this content versus other content, and we'll use this to do acquisition spend in Peacock and lighten up in some other places. But the long-term goal for Peacock is to have a service that is a balance of sports, entertainment, and news. And so our content teams are now very focused on that new audience and what we're going to be able to do to drive entertainment content with the advantage of being linked closely to the NBA and to the audience that follows it. And then, on advertising, so second quarter, pretty -- only a slight step down from the first quarter, but clearly we had a much heavier load of sports in the first quarter than the second quarter, and so that -- adjusting for that, I'd say again that the advertising market remains pretty stable, and we feel very well-positioned for the second half of the year with the Olympics coming up starting this Friday, elections, and a great slate of content coming to NBC and Peacock. In terms of the upfront, we're pleased with our results. Total volume for us is going to be basically in line with last year as is linear price. We got well over $1 billion in upfront volume for Peacock again, which -- a nice growth over what we had last year. And so, if you step back, we'd say the overall upfront market was pretty solid. We moved quickly given our strength of our assets to secure the volume that we got. So, we feel we were a success in this more challenging upfront given the arrival of so many of the new players, especially in the AVOD and SVOD space. So that's the report on the upfronts, but we're moving forward and feel like the team did quite a good job.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Jessica. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from John Hodulik from UBS. Your line is now live.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks. Maybe on the cable side, a little bit better trends in both video and wireless. On the video side, what's driving the improvement there? Do you expect it to continue? And are you seeing any effects of the launch of the NOW brand? And then, in wireless, you guys talked about some new pricing and promotion, but do you guys think you're benefiting at all from some of the ACP losses on the prepaid side? I don't know if you guys saw yesterday, Verizon announced they sort of turned off 400,000 subscribers. I think we'll see something similar with the rest of the wireless companies. But do you think this underlying growth is sustainable, or do you think that ACP is somehow boosting the growth at this point? Thanks.\nDave Watson: Hey, John, Dave. So, in terms of video, as Jason said, it's -- our video losses are lower than the ones -- last year, it's tied. We did take a slightly less rate increase this year than last year. And the key for us in video is just positioning video with broadband and that video does help in that regard. We've seen positive churn in terms of video, reimagining video around the NOW TV product and IP and that has been steady. It's still early, but has been helpful. So, video, I think for the right segment, we offer a lot of value and we continue to position it, I think, very well with broadband. But difficult -- and still in terms of some of the fees and things that we have, but I think an important category for us. So on -- in terms of the Mobile side, NOW Mobile is not material at this point, way too early. The acceleration in line adds over Q1 driven by the early success of the new pricing plans, really competitive now in multi-line pricing. Launched in April, we targeted it for a while, now it's scaling, and it's really got traction, as well as the Buy One, Get One line offer to our base. So, wireless is such an important part of our overall strategy and key that it's 12% penetration, we've got great runway ahead. Business Mobile is just getting going and it's a great position for us in terms of convergence. I think, we're uniquely positioned in terms of ubiquitous offers across our entire footprint, and mobile will be front and center as we approach the Olympics and we will have a great offer with broadband, with mobile, being able to tie all this together, so very excited with it. The comment -- just one other part in terms of what happened in terms of Verizon's unpacking that, the only thing I'll say is, I think it's an important distinction that our ACP customers are postpaid versus their prepaid. It's a different group, a different dynamic. And so, not really -- we're just getting going on our NOW products. And so, it's very, very early on. Excited about that. And I think we're introducing it at a very good moment, but it's not material at this stage.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, John. Operator, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Certainly. Next question is coming from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street. Your line is now live.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks, guys. I guess for Jason, two quick ones on content costs in the connectivity business. They came in quite a bit lower than we expected, and I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on what's driving the trend there and how sustainable it is. And then, we're trending a little bit lower than guidance on CapEx so far this year. I'm wondering if that's just timing-related if it picks up in the back half of the year. And then, Mike, I'm not sure if you -- I heard you loud and clear on having sort of said what you can on the NBA deal. I'm wondering if you can just give us a little bit of context around the timing of costs and revenues though. When -- I recognize it's forward-looking, but when should we expect to see the costs from the new contracts start to hit? Thank you.\nJason Armstrong: Thanks, Jonathan. Why don't I start with CapEx, Dave will hit content costs, and then Mike with NBA. So, on CapEx, you're right, we've had some variability this year. I would say, relative to the initial guidance we gave both on the Content & Experiences side, where we talked about this is the final significant year of Epic spending and then we get relief beyond this. And then, on the Connectivity & Platform side, which I think is probably where more of your question was, we gave a capital intensity envelope as we entered the year. We also said intend to do 1.1 million-plus in terms of homes passed. We're obviously trending a little bit above that at this point, but still feel comfortable with the capital intensity envelope that we gave. And so, there are some timing aspects around equipment purchases within the year. I would say, still feel comfortable with the existing capital intensity envelope. And within that, doing more and more homes passed at a really efficient rate, I think that's a testament to how the team is executing here.\nDave Watson: Hey, Jonathan, Dave. So, just on the content cost side of things, that's also timing related. We -- in the sports side, well-known thing in terms of RSNs and -- but there are other timing-related things. Every contract with the programming partner is different, every relationship is different, so won't go into the specifics. But it is key that we focus on, for us flexibility, increasing market choice. We segment the marketplace both video and broadband, and together, and that is important that we're competitive in every segment. And at the end of the day, we're focusing on value. Combining linear streaming considerations on a case-by-case basis, but mostly at this point is timing related.\nMike Cavanagh: And Jonathan, it's Mike. On NBA, I wish it were sooner, but the contract doesn't start till the 2025-2026 season. So, it's fall of 2025 that we would start to bear the expense of the right side of it. And obviously, that is also as we build into that when we would begin to see the benefits of subscriber acquisition around the NBA.\nBrian Roberts: And this is Brian. Just want to -- just to close out perhaps Mike's opening comments on the NBA. Doesn't -- opportunities like this come along very rarely when there's long-term relationships up for grabs. Inside and we'll have -- when it gets all announced, the detail that Mike described, we have probably more content than anybody and it's all, I think, at a value that we'll be able to, as one of the other questions asked, support and demonstrate. And one of our real advantages here is the way we're running the media business, and Mike created one group with our existing assets like NBC and our growing asset like Peacock, and putting that together is very appealing for the reach, for the consumer access, for the innovation that we'll have in the years ahead, and you'll see some of that innovation during the Olympics. There'll be a lot of content on NBC, but way more content on Peacock, and it allows for the trends that we're seeing in viewing behavior. So, it's a very exciting moment and I think we'll have more to say in the weeks ahead.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Jonathan. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. Next question is coming from Michael Ng from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nMichael Ng: Hey, good morning. Thank you for the question. I just have two, one on business services and one on wireless. First on business services, I was just wondering if you could talk about some of the key initiatives or things that might be changing at Comcast business following Ed's appointment as President to more aggressively pursue the mid-market or enterprise? What are you seeing in terms of the competitive side within SMB? Is it just fixed wireless, or is there more to that? And then, on wireless, given the strong potential upgrade cycle on the back of AI smartphones and the iPhone 16, I was just wondering if you could talk about the Xfinity Mobile strategy to capitalize this -- on this from a promotional marketing perspective. What levers are you planning to pull this holiday to potentially lean into wireless to help the broadband business and wireless at large? Thanks.\nDave Watson: Got it. Thank you. This is Dave. So, a couple of things. Let me start with business. As you said, it is competitive in the small business categories, competitive in every category, but in particular, the small business one. There certainly is some fixed wireless that we've seen, and saw it in the Verizon results, pretty high percentage of the fixed wireless that are in the small business thing, and we're -- we look at that closely. We are intensely focused on our competitive playbooks and we're going to constantly compete for share. But we're also focused on revenue per relationship. And so, in the small business area, before getting into mid-market, we're doing a lot of product upgrades, adding value and speed, WiFi, security. And so, we made good progress and revenue focus around in small business. And it's such a huge opportunity for us and still in terms of small business. But Ed has stepped right in. It's a terrific team in the business services group that he's working with. And there really is, I think, a unique opportunity. When you look at the overall addressable market of $60 billion, less than 20% there, and a huge chunk of this will be mid-market and enterprise. And we're -- and you add on top of that international opportunities that we're beginning to coordinate and work well with Dana and the team at Sky. So, yeah, we really are seeing nice relationship growth in mid-market and enterprise. That's the starting point, but in addition to like all of our strategies, we're adding more products and attaching new products on these relationships, and going beyond just connectivity into a full managed relationship basis. So, Ed is driving that, and we're in a good competitive position for growth, and I think we have a good ability to increase ARPU across an increasing higher-end base of customers. So, on the mobile side of upgrade, it is -- every single upgrade moment pay close attention to that one too, and we're optimistic. We're in good position. We have a great trade-in program for mobile that we've had in place now for a while. And then, in addition to that, we go in and out in terms of subsidies on top of that trade-in program. And then, when good upgrade moments happen, we are the switching provider. So, when people -- we have great core rates and we have good handset offers and good position for it. So, being a switching provider, I think we are -- I think in a unique position to really take advantage of that. And when you look at things going into the optimism for Q3, one of the most important programs that we'll do, along with the handset upgrade initiative on mobile will be the Olympics. And the Olympics are such a unique opportunity for us to showcase the best broadband, the best mobile service offering, combining those two things together in such an attractive offer. On top of that is the greatest UI in the marketplace that helps you find whatever you want. So, really excited about that. Look for that in the next couple of days, but mobile will be front and center along with broadband when that happens.\nMichael Ng: Great. Thanks, Dave.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Mike. Operator, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Certainly. Our final question today is coming from Steven Cahall from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nSteven Cahall: Thanks. So, with mid-splits now reaching over 40% of the footprint, I was just wondering if you have an updated outlook on when you think you'll be at DOCSIS 4 for most of your broadband passings. And maybe within this you could just update us on where fiber overlap is, but also as you get through this network investment architecture that you laid out earlier this year, when you think about the capital intensity in C&P coming down and we'll start to see that benefit in growing free cash flow. So, timing on that, I think, would be really interesting. And then, how are you thinking about getting to just breakeven on Peacock? You talked about media EBITDA on a total basis growing in the first half and in the second half, too. It seems like if the Peacock losses keep getting better at this pace, you could be close to breakeven this time next year, but I know you've got NBA coming. So, just wondering if we could think about that benchmark quite yet. Thank you.\nDave Watson: Hey, Steven, this is Dave. Let me start and then hand it over on the Peacock side. So, we're 42% mid-split right now. We expect to be 50% by year-end. And the DOCSIS 4.0 that follows, multiple markets so far, it's early, no specifics in terms of the final rollout on that. But it really is tracking very well on top of the lot of new footprint expansions of 1.2 million over the last 12 months, this upgrade program is moving along very well, and it tracks to where the customers are, and our steady focus around the higher end. And one of the things that we see, we have the most effective and efficient build that's ubiquitous that is addressing speed, capacity, coverage and it helps us because as we're doing this, remember, we're virtualizing huge parts of the network and avoiding future node split. So, it's very efficient in helping us with the -- 70% of our customers are 500 megabits or higher, a third are taking a gig. And it's tracking to maybe one of the biggest tailwinds that is out there and that's the fact that our network consumption is still low double-digits increasing. And that's not stopping. And so, we're putting ourselves in position with a great upgrade program. And so that to me is, I think, a great advantage that we do have. In terms of competition, in terms of fiber, we're now 50% in terms of the overbuilt. We expect by the end of '25, that'll get to 60%. We'll probably go higher than that. We have a long track record of competing against fiber 20 years at this point. So, we do think fiber is quite frankly the longer-term competitor, keeping our eye on, compete fiercely against fixed wireless and every competitor, but we anticipate where they're building, what they're doing and keeping track of all of that. So, like our results -- and encouraged, when you look going into Q3, one of the reasons of optimism is that voluntary churn that continues to perform very well. And I think it's our superior network combined with better products and extreme focus on competition.\nJason Armstrong: Hey, Steven, I would just round that out on the capital intensity question, because I think embedded in that was sort of a long-term capital intensity question. If you look at what we're doing now, the path towards mid-splits, which as Dave mentioned, really good progress there, that kicking off DOCSIS 4.0 and then adding 1.2 million homes passed, which is a record for us in the last 12 months and doing that all within through the existing capital intensity envelope, which is one of, if not, the lowest in the industry. So, very good progress there. As you think about longer term, a lot of people ask this question in the context of is there the next big thing coming in terms of the network upgrade. We feel very comfortable between mid-splits and DOCSIS 4.0, that leading to multi-gig symmetrical speeds that, that is the network for the future. So, we don't see the next big thing coming. The one area that I'd point out, we'd love to do more homes passed. We've accelerated the rate from 800,000 in the past couple of years up to currently 1.2 million. We won't get capital intensity because of that. If those are good returns and things we should be doing, we'd love to do more there.\nMike Cavanagh: Steven, on Peacock and media EBITDA, I think you heard us right anyway, heard me right. I've been talking since I've been doing this that I don't really look at Peacock as standalone. I mean, it's an interesting exercise and I'm happy to share the numbers of what the loss is on Peacock as we're building it. But strategically to not pursue that path would leave the existing media business on a downward trend. So, I think we are thinking about it over multiple years. I'm very confident that what we're doing around Peacock and the media business together, operating together is going to put us on a path to optimize that business. And as you said, I think this is a year where we see the growth in Peacock offsetting the decline in some of our linear businesses, and that's basically a trend I would expect to see carry forward. There's going to be ebbs and flows. As Brian said, something like NBA is once in a generation almost to get an opportunity like that. So obviously, we'll make some adjustments and it might pause our trajectory the year we take it on board, but I think it's part and parcel of the idea that we're bringing the media business to a better future by investing behind Peacock and doing it together with all our assets, entertainment, sports and news as what our media business will look to be in the future. Well, thank you everybody. I think that's it. I stole Marci's line. Go ahead.\nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Steve. This concludes our second quarter earnings call. Thanks for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's question-and-answer session and today's conference call. A replay of the call will be available starting at 11:30 am Eastern Time today on Comcast Investor Relations website. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks. And just to tie everything together what Mike and Jason have just said and as our results continue to show, I really believe we are dealing with the competitive landscape shifts exceptionally well and that's because we have a great team across the company that knows how to execute and innovate. We have the scale, balance sheet and relevancy to compete with anyone. So, if you think about what we're doing to position ourselves for growth, we've expanded our broadband network by 1.2 million new homes passed in the last 12 months, the most in the company's history, and we put plan to continue to do that. We're upbeat about the long-term in parks despite this quarter and are about to finish building the biggest, most technologically advanced theme park to hit the US market in decades with Epic Universe next year. And as you've seen recently, instead of engaging in a process to buy content companies, we have focused primarily on organic opportunities like the NBA, one of the most coveted sports franchises across the globe, which will help drive growth for us well into the future. With that, let's hand it over to Marci to take your questions. And this is Brian. Just want to -- just to close out perhaps Mike's opening comments on the NBA.

Most of the enrolled ACP customers as we said before have been with us and they are on a postpaid basis, so I think that's an important thing to remember. And our strategy has been consistent. We've been looking to help the ACP customers stay connected through a variety of options, starting with Internet Essential. And since 2011, we've connected millions in the largest, most comprehensive private sector Internet adoption program in the country. The good news is that our ACP customers are eligible to switch to our IE, Internet Essential tiers that we have, and we have a couple. In addition, we have Xfinity Mobile and we have good offers through this transition and to help them save money on their monthly bills. The Internet Essential customer, the plus tier, customers could take a free line of Xfinity Mobile for a year and ACP customers who add Xfinity Mobile can get an additional free unlimited line for a year. So -- and then we just started with NOW Internet, NOW Mobile, and so nothing material on that, but I think it puts us in good position as we complete the transition. We spent -- as Jason said, we've spent a lot of time thinking about this, been very proactive, prepared for this, and in many ways, it's similar to the promotional role activity that we've managed for decades, so we're used to that. On the -- from a subscriber viewpoint, also as Jason said, we saw a minimal impact in ACP in Q2. Looking forward, we expect the bulk of the ACP subscriber-related activity to happen in the third quarter, including losses associated with non-paid churn. Very focused on retention. It's early, but the biggest impact I think we're going to see will be on the non-pay side, and as we're just getting into the beginning of the non-pay cycles. Encouragingly, we're not seeing much voluntary churn in this group. So, our goal, we'd like to get through the ACP impact as quickly as possible, and right now we're planning to take a reserve on incremental non-pay activity in the third quarter, but again, it is too early to quantify and we just won't know until we're further through the cycle. So, we have a normal disconnect process that we managed for a long period of time, and again, this is the post-pay universe that we have managed through. So, we'll -- that is our view. I think it will be primarily within Q3, but encouraged by at least the voluntary churn aspect. Jason? Hey, Craig, Dave. So, in terms of delinquency rates, there's nothing. We're watching, it's just -- we have a normal process that we manage through based on due dates and voices and it goes anywhere from two to three months. There's nothing at this point to report on at this stage. We watch it closely. Other than to go back to what I said, been very proactive, and I think it we're helped by experience and promotional roles and the fact that we tried to put customers into packages that made sense for them proactively. So, there's a lot of work that went into that ahead of time, but nothing at this stage and we'll give more as we go. In terms of -- the question in terms of lower gross adds impacts on connects, it was not material that we saw in Q2. So maybe just a little bit in terms of things that we said, but yeah, it wasn't a substantial impact in Q2 and we think the bulk of what we're seeing is really going to be on the non-pay side, which will occur in Q3. Yeah, this is Dave. BEAD, we're looking at it very closely. It is going to be worked out on a state-by-state basis. We're optimistic in a lot of cases, but we'll have to look for the guidelines and the specifics tied to it. Nothing at this point would suggest we're going to be beyond the capital intensity that we've already given out. I think with all -- I mean, we're optimistic. One of the points that Brian mentioned, the 1.2 million that we've done in the last 12 months is astounding. And the machine is really going. So, we're leaning in, going for it, but BEAD will be on a state-by-state basis. Hey, John, Dave. So, in terms of video, as Jason said, it's -- our video losses are lower than the ones -- last year, it's tied. We did take a slightly less rate increase this year than last year. And the key for us in video is just positioning video with broadband and that video does help in that regard. We've seen positive churn in terms of video, reimagining video around the NOW TV product and IP and that has been steady. It's still early, but has been helpful. So, video, I think for the right segment, we offer a lot of value and we continue to position it, I think, very well with broadband. But difficult -- and still in terms of some of the fees and things that we have, but I think an important category for us. So on -- in terms of the Mobile side, NOW Mobile is not material at this point, way too early. The acceleration in line adds over Q1 driven by the early success of the new pricing plans, really competitive now in multi-line pricing. Launched in April, we targeted it for a while, now it's scaling, and it's really got traction, as well as the Buy One, Get One line offer to our base. So, wireless is such an important part of our overall strategy and key that it's 12% penetration, we've got great runway ahead. Business Mobile is just getting going and it's a great position for us in terms of convergence. I think, we're uniquely positioned in terms of ubiquitous offers across our entire footprint, and mobile will be front and center as we approach the Olympics and we will have a great offer with broadband, with mobile, being able to tie all this together, so very excited with it. The comment -- just one other part in terms of what happened in terms of Verizon's unpacking that, the only thing I'll say is, I think it's an important distinction that our ACP customers are postpaid versus their prepaid. It's a different group, a different dynamic. And so, not really -- we're just getting going on our NOW products. And so, it's very, very early on. Excited about that. And I think we're introducing it at a very good moment, but it's not material at this stage. Hey, Jonathan, Dave. So, just on the content cost side of things, that's also timing related. We -- in the sports side, well-known thing in terms of RSNs and -- but there are other timing-related things. Every contract with the programming partner is different, every relationship is different, so won't go into the specifics. But it is key that we focus on, for us flexibility, increasing market choice. We segment the marketplace both video and broadband, and together, and that is important that we're competitive in every segment. And at the end of the day, we're focusing on value. Combining linear streaming considerations on a case-by-case basis, but mostly at this point is timing related. Got it. Thank you. This is Dave. So, a couple of things. Let me start with business. As you said, it is competitive in the small business categories, competitive in every category, but in particular, the small business one. There certainly is some fixed wireless that we've seen, and saw it in the Verizon results, pretty high percentage of the fixed wireless that are in the small business thing, and we're -- we look at that closely. We are intensely focused on our competitive playbooks and we're going to constantly compete for share. But we're also focused on revenue per relationship. And so, in the small business area, before getting into mid-market, we're doing a lot of product upgrades, adding value and speed, WiFi, security. And so, we made good progress and revenue focus around in small business. And it's such a huge opportunity for us and still in terms of small business. But Ed has stepped right in. It's a terrific team in the business services group that he's working with. And there really is, I think, a unique opportunity. When you look at the overall addressable market of $60 billion, less than 20% there, and a huge chunk of this will be mid-market and enterprise. And we're -- and you add on top of that international opportunities that we're beginning to coordinate and work well with Dana and the team at Sky. So, yeah, we really are seeing nice relationship growth in mid-market and enterprise. That's the starting point, but in addition to like all of our strategies, we're adding more products and attaching new products on these relationships, and going beyond just connectivity into a full managed relationship basis. So, Ed is driving that, and we're in a good competitive position for growth, and I think we have a good ability to increase ARPU across an increasing higher-end base of customers. So, on the mobile side of upgrade, it is -- every single upgrade moment pay close attention to that one too, and we're optimistic. We're in good position. We have a great trade-in program for mobile that we've had in place now for a while. And then, in addition to that, we go in and out in terms of subsidies on top of that trade-in program. And then, when good upgrade moments happen, we are the switching provider. So, when people -- we have great core rates and we have good handset offers and good position for it. So, being a switching provider, I think we are -- I think in a unique position to really take advantage of that. And when you look at things going into the optimism for Q3, one of the most important programs that we'll do, along with the handset upgrade initiative on mobile will be the Olympics. And the Olympics are such a unique opportunity for us to showcase the best broadband, the best mobile service offering, combining those two things together in such an attractive offer. On top of that is the greatest UI in the marketplace that helps you find whatever you want. So, really excited about that. Look for that in the next couple of days, but mobile will be front and center along with broadband when that happens. Hey, Steven, this is Dave. Let me start and then hand it over on the Peacock side. So, we're 42% mid-split right now. We expect to be 50% by year-end. And the DOCSIS 4.0 that follows, multiple markets so far, it's early, no specifics in terms of the final rollout on that. But it really is tracking very well on top of the lot of new footprint expansions of 1.2 million over the last 12 months, this upgrade program is moving along very well, and it tracks to where the customers are, and our steady focus around the higher end. And one of the things that we see, we have the most effective and efficient build that's ubiquitous that is addressing speed, capacity, coverage and it helps us because as we're doing this, remember, we're virtualizing huge parts of the network and avoiding future node split. So, it's very efficient in helping us with the -- 70% of our customers are 500 megabits or higher, a third are taking a gig. And it's tracking to maybe one of the biggest tailwinds that is out there and that's the fact that our network consumption is still low double-digits increasing. And that's not stopping. And so, we're putting ourselves in position with a great upgrade program. And so that to me is, I think, a great advantage that we do have. In terms of competition, in terms of fiber, we're now 50% in terms of the overbuilt. We expect by the end of '25, that'll get to 60%. We'll probably go higher than that. We have a long track record of competing against fiber 20 years at this point. So, we do think fiber is quite frankly the longer-term competitor, keeping our eye on, compete fiercely against fixed wireless and every competitor, but we anticipate where they're building, what they're doing and keeping track of all of that. So, like our results -- and encouraged, when you look going into Q3, one of the reasons of optimism is that voluntary churn that continues to perform very well. And I think it's our superior network combined with better products and extreme focus on competition."

            "name": "Mike Cavanagh",
            "content": "Thank you, Marci, and good morning, everyone. Before I hand it over to Jason, I'd like to comment on three key elements from the quarter. One, broadband; two, parks; and three, the NBA. So, first is broadband, where the competitive intensity that we've seen for the past several quarters and which is particularly felt in the market for price-conscious consumers remains essentially unchanged, but throughout this period, our broadband strategy has been consistent and we remain confident in our plan. We are focused on generating healthy broadband revenue growth by striking the right balance between rate and volume and relying heavily on market segmentation that I'll speak to in a minute. As a result, in the second quarter, ARPU grew 3.6%, which was within our historical range of 3% to 4%. Despite the competitiveness of the recent past, we've maintained a market-leading base of 32 million broadband customers by refining our go-to-market approach to create options that fit each of our customers' lifestyles and budgets. Providing the best products with flexibility and choice at different value points, has served us extremely well for many years and remains the core of our playbook. Of particular note, this quarter, we launched our suite of NOW products, which are high-quality internet, mobile and streaming TV offerings designed to be incredibly simple with attractive all-in pricing with no contracts or credit checks. These are great options for the price-conscious segment and especially for those impacted by the end of the government's ACP program. While we are pleased with our enhancement to our offerings for the price-conscious segment, the reality is that the vast majority of our customer base subscribes to more premium products, where we feel great about our market position relative to fiber, which is our true long-term competitor. We are investing in additional network capacity, multi-gig speeds and in-home WiFi technology to capitalize on the Internet consumption trends we are seeing. One of the most important metrics we monitor is the magnitude of data traffic flowing across our network. And again, we saw a double-digit year-over-year growth this quarter, with broadband-only households consuming over 700 gigabytes of data each month. And our customers continue to take faster speeds, with around 70% of our residential subscribers receiving speeds of 500 megabits per second or higher and one-third getting a gigabit or more. These positive consumer trends play to our strengths and will only accelerate with the shift of live sports to streaming, which together with entertainment on streaming accounts for nearly 70% of our network traffic today. My final thought on broadband is the importance of bundling with mobile, with 90% of Xfinity Mobile smartphone traffic traveling over our WiFi network. These two products work seamlessly together to benefit our customers from both the products' experience and financial value standpoint. We are very pleased with the momentum we saw in wireless this quarter, where our line additions were again above 300,000 and nicely up year-over-year. Our new converged offers resulted in better overall yield and awareness as well as higher multi-line attach rates and we are excited for some of the new mobile offers tied to the Olympics, which will be introduced to the market in just a few days. Now, let's turn to parks, where our results were down in both revenue and EBITDA when compared to last year's record performance, with two-thirds of the decline driven by lower attendance at our domestic parks. We attribute this to a number of factors. First, is what now appears to be a COVID recovery pull-forward of a magnitude we hadn't previously appreciated. I think it's important to zoom out and look at how this business has trended over the past few years. Going back to 2022 and 2023, parks were clearly the early beneficiaries of substantial rebounds in tourism and travel after the pandemic, resulting in a surge in demand that contributed to us reaching record results for both of those years. More recently, other travel options, including cruises and international tourism, given the strength of the dollar, have experienced their own surge in demand, which caused visitation rates at our parks to normalize. The second factor affecting attendance at our domestic parks is the timing of our investments in new attractions, where we are light in Florida in advance of next year's opening of Epic and our lapping of Super Nintendo World in Hollywood is creating some headwinds for us as well. While the parks results are below our original expectations for the year, we still view parks as a terrific long-term growth business for us. We couldn't be more excited about the opening of Epic Universe in 2025, as we've been releasing new details about Epic's Five Immersive Worlds, the consumer reaction has been tremendous. And recently, we opened an Epic Universe Preview Center in Orlando and the foot traffic and guest enthusiasm have been off the charts. So, we look forward to Epic Universe having a meaningful impact by driving incremental attendance, longer visits and higher per-cap spending once the park opens in 2025. Finally, let me talk about the NBA. Our expectation is that soon an 11-year rights deal between ourselves and the NBA will be announced. We don't believe that the resolution of matching rights will affect the package that we expect to be awarded. This package, which begins with the 2025-2026 season includes: 100 NBA games each regular season across NBC and Peacock, which is more than any other media partner and more regular season games than each existing partner has under the current rights deal; for playoffs, we will have first and second round games each year, exclusively on our national platforms and six NBA conference final series over the course of the term of the deal, which is more playoff games on average each year, than any other media partner; and exclusively for Peacock will be approximately 50 national regular season and post-season games, including National Monday Night games and doubleheaders. Additional elements of the NBA package include the annual NBA All-Star Game and All-Star Saturday Night each season, the season opening NBA tip-off doubleheader each season, a special doubleheader on the MLK holiday, and Select NBA games in every NBA All-Star game on Telemundo. Beyond the NBA itself, we're excited that our package includes WNBA, where starting in the spring of 2026, we'll have more than 50 WNBA regular season and first round playoff games each season across Peacock, NBC and USA, and we'll also have games in seven WNBA Conference semifinals and three WNBA Final series; for USA Basketball, we'll have the rights to USA men's and women's games leading up to the Olympics and FIBA World Cup; Sky Sports will air all of NBCUniversal's NBA and WNBA games in its markets; and finally, Xfinity will be the NBA and WNBA's marketing partner in the video category. Now, I'd like to take a moment to explain why we're so excited to partner with the NBA. First, it brings in a broad, diverse and youthful audience that is culturally relevant and further expands NBCUniversal's tremendous reach across broadcast and streaming. This new fan base will also allow us to create new entertainment content that will work beyond the basketball season with exciting opportunities for companion programming and marketing collaborations that tap into the NBA's pop culture appeal. Second, the nine-month basketball season completes our year-round calendar for sports, which already includes the NFL, Olympics, Premier League, NASCAR, PGA Tour, Big Ten and World Cup, and our NBA package will establish much-watched Sunday, Monday and Tuesday night traditions on NBC and Peacock. Third, we are uniquely able to drive strong value with the NBA in multiple ways: first, by growing ad sales, by selling NBA ad inventory package with the rest of our marquee programming; second, by acquiring and monetizing subscribers both on Linear and Peacock; and third, by optimizing NBCUniversal programming investment across sports, entertainment and news. The NBA's decision to partner with us is a testament to our breadth and reach, our operational excellence in sports and innovation, and our decades of experience delivering world-class content to consumers. Much like our long-standing relationships with the NFL and the Olympics, we look forward to putting the weight of our entire company behind our partnership with the NBA for decades to come. Before I hand it over to Jason, I want to share one final thought. In just a few short days, we have the honor of kicking off the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. This will be NBCUniversal's 18th Olympic Games as a US broadcaster, dating back to 1936 when we first covered the historic event on NBC Radio. It is one of the great moments of pride for our company, and I want to thank the 3,000 people working to bring all of the action, excitement and incredible stories to our viewers across the country. Jason, over to you. And, Ben, it's Mike on parks. So, to hit on that again and appreciate the question, I think we covered a lot in the earlier remarks, but I'll start where Brian last finished, which is, we couldn't be more excited about and confident in the long-term trajectory of the parks business, particularly as we look ahead to next year with Epic Universe, which is truly -- looking truly unbelievable. And then, other attractions coming, Hollywood is going to get a Coaster and Donkey Kong Country into Osaka in the latter part of this year. Timing, TBD on both of those. But in the near term, I think the domestic attendance challenge that was -- what drove two-thirds of the poor comparison, the factors causing that, which is really the COVID pull-forward that we talked about and the timing of attractions, particularly in Hollywood lapping Super Nintendo, and in Florida, the fact that we originally planned to have Epic opened this year, but with COVID pushed it back, and so have a lull in the action. We haven't started a new big attraction since VelociCoaster in 2021. So, as a result of that, I think the factors, even though we're excited about Hollywood Horror Nights in the second half of the year and a little bit of moving past the lapping, I think the trends that we are experiencing likely continue until we get to -- until we get to Epic opening up sometime next year. I'll let Dave handle the ACP question, Craig. It's Mike. Sure. Hey, Jessica, it's Mike. So, I think I've essentially covered everything that I wanted to cover and can cover at this stage on NBA in the prepared remarks. Obviously, when the NBA makes its ultimate announcements, we'll -- that will be another moment where we can go deeper. But just to the point generally is that we are looking at the NBA as we all said as some of the premier content that is culturally relevant, excellent audience, widens out the calendar year for us across Peacock and NBC, can do a lot with the demographics that follow the NBA around other programming. So, when you think about the business case for it, when you look at the long-term and as we are managing the media business, broadcast and Peacock as one, I think the unique reach that we have and ability for a sport like the NBA to reach so far with our existing broadcast business and use, as I said earlier, plenty of exclusive games for Peacock to drive excellent acquisition in Peacock and we've talked about before using NBA. And as we've talked about before, sports has been a great source of acquisition for us in Peacock and a great source of value to the consumer. But what's very interesting to us is how significant the viewership is of sports viewers on Peacock of things other than sports. So, when you take a zoom out and think about the total picture of what we're trying to do, which is to bring our excellent TV media assets into the future, I think you can -- we view the NBA as an excellent piece in that puzzle and it will allow us to rebalance programming from other areas. Obviously, we'll fill a few nights on NBC with this content versus other content, and we'll use this to do acquisition spend in Peacock and lighten up in some other places. But the long-term goal for Peacock is to have a service that is a balance of sports, entertainment, and news. And so our content teams are now very focused on that new audience and what we're going to be able to do to drive entertainment content with the advantage of being linked closely to the NBA and to the audience that follows it. And then, on advertising, so second quarter, pretty -- only a slight step down from the first quarter, but clearly we had a much heavier load of sports in the first quarter than the second quarter, and so that -- adjusting for that, I'd say again that the advertising market remains pretty stable, and we feel very well-positioned for the second half of the year with the Olympics coming up starting this Friday, elections, and a great slate of content coming to NBC and Peacock. In terms of the upfront, we're pleased with our results. Total volume for us is going to be basically in line with last year as is linear price. We got well over $1 billion in upfront volume for Peacock again, which -- a nice growth over what we had last year. And so, if you step back, we'd say the overall upfront market was pretty solid. We moved quickly given our strength of our assets to secure the volume that we got. So, we feel we were a success in this more challenging upfront given the arrival of so many of the new players, especially in the AVOD and SVOD space. So that's the report on the upfronts, but we're moving forward and feel like the team did quite a good job. And Jonathan, it's Mike. On NBA, I wish it were sooner, but the contract doesn't start till the 2025-2026 season. So, it's fall of 2025 that we would start to bear the expense of the right side of it. And obviously, that is also as we build into that when we would begin to see the benefits of subscriber acquisition around the NBA. Steven, on Peacock and media EBITDA, I think you heard us right anyway, heard me right. I've been talking since I've been doing this that I don't really look at Peacock as standalone. I mean, it's an interesting exercise and I'm happy to share the numbers of what the loss is on Peacock as we're building it. But strategically to not pursue that path would leave the existing media business on a downward trend. So, I think we are thinking about it over multiple years. I'm very confident that what we're doing around Peacock and the media business together, operating together is going to put us on a path to optimize that business. And as you said, I think this is a year where we see the growth in Peacock offsetting the decline in some of our linear businesses, and that's basically a trend I would expect to see carry forward. There's going to be ebbs and flows. As Brian said, something like NBA is once in a generation almost to get an opportunity like that. So obviously, we'll make some adjustments and it might pause our trajectory the year we take it on board, but I think it's part and parcel of the idea that we're bringing the media business to a better future by investing behind Peacock and doing it together with all our assets, entertainment, sports and news as what our media business will look to be in the future. Well, thank you everybody. I think that's it. I stole Marci's line. Go ahead."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Jason Armstrong",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with our consolidated results on Slide 3. Total revenue decreased 2.7% to $29.7 billion. Within these results, our six major growth drivers, including residential broadband, wireless, business services connectivity, theme parks, streaming and premium content at our studios, generated over $16 billion in revenue, well over half of our total company revenue and grew at a mid-single-digit rate over the past 12 months. Keep in mind that in the second quarter of last year, we had one of our most successful quarterly theatrical results in our history, which included two of 2023's top-five grossing films at the worldwide box office, The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Fast X, and as such created a difficult comparison this quarter. If we exclude our studio results, total revenue would have been consistent with the prior year. Total EBITDA was consistent at $10.2 billion, and free cash flow was $1.3 billion. Free cash flow was impacted this quarter by higher-than-usual cash taxes, which were up $2 billion over last year's level and were impacted by a tax payment associated with our Hulu stake and other tax-related matters. As you'll recall, we received a minimum floor payment for Hulu at the end of last year. During the second quarter, we returned $3.4 billion of capital to shareholders, including $2.2 billion in share repurchases, and over the last 12 months, we have reduced our share count by over 6%, contributing to our adjusted EPS growth of 7%. Now, let's go through our business results, starting on Slide 4, with Connectivity & Platforms. As usual, I will refer to our year-over-year growth on a constant-currency basis. Revenue for total Connectivity & Platforms was consistent at $20.2 billion, as strong growth in our connectivity businesses was offset by declines in video and voice revenue. Residential connectivity revenue grew 6%, comprised of 3% growth in domestic broadband, 17% growth in domestic wireless, and 14% growth in international connectivity. Business services connectivity revenue also grew 6%. In domestic broadband, our revenue growth was again driven by strong ARPU growth, which increased 3.6% this quarter, well within our historical range as our team continues to effectively balance rate and volume through customer segmentation. The environment for broadband subscribers remains intensely competitive, which when combined with traditional negative seasonality in the second quarter, led to 120,000 subscriber losses. Related to this, I would like to spend a minute on ACP. It has been well-documented that the government ended all funding for the ACP program in June. Consistent with our approach to normal promotional roll-offs, we were proactive and prepared for this action early in the quarter, communicating with our ACP customer base and migrating many of these customers to different products and price levels. While this had a bit of an impact on ARPU in the quarter, we still feel very comfortable that we will remain well within our historical 3% to 4% ARPU growth range for the remainder of the year. In terms of subscribers, we saw minimal impact from the end of ACP this quarter. Looking ahead, we expect the bulk of our ACP-related subscriber activity to happen in the third quarter, including losses associated with non-pay churn. While it's too early to assess the full impact, we are encouraged with the response we see from these customers to-date. Outside of ACP, we are seeing the same level of competitive intensity and expect an offset from seasonal tailwinds as the third quarter is typically a seasonally stronger quarter compared to the second. Turning to domestic wireless, revenue growth was mainly driven by service revenue, with some modest growth in equipment revenue this quarter as well. Customer lines increased 20% year-over-year, reaching 7.2 million in total, including 322,000 line additions this quarter. The acceleration in line additions compared to the prior several quarters was driven by some early success with new pricing plans launched in April, targeted at multi-line customers, as well as continued traction with our Buy One, Get One line offer. And you will see us continue to test new ways to capitalize on the significant opportunities we see ahead for us in wireless, in terms of both increasing the penetration of our domestic residential broadband customer base, which currently sits at 12%, as well as selling additional lines per account. Wireless continues to be a key growth area for us and one in which we are striking the right balance in delivering exceptional value to our customers, bundling to enhance our opportunities in broadband, and continuing to drive profitability higher. International connectivity revenue was mainly driven by broadband, which accounts for over two-thirds of our international revenue and grew at a mid-teens rate, reflecting strong ARPU growth. The remainder is wireless, which grew due to both additional lines and ARPU growth, but at a lower rate due to the variability in handset sales. Business services connectivity revenue growth of 6% reflects steady growth in small businesses with even faster growth in mid-market and enterprise. While the SMB market remains competitive, we are competing aggressively by delivering best-in-class products and services and growing revenue through ARPU growth, driven by higher adoption of additional products that expand our relationship with our SMB customers, like Mobile, Security Edge, Connection Pro, and WiFi Pro, as well as through targeted rate opportunities. At the mid-market and enterprise level, our revenue growth is primarily fueled by the increase in our customers, driven by the investments we have made in this space to build sales and fulfillment, as well as expanding our capabilities in managed services, wide area networking, and cyber cybersecurity. Finally, video and other revenue declined in the quarter. The high single-digit decline in our video revenue is a function of continued customer losses, coupled with slower domestic ARPU growth versus last year, and the lower other revenue mainly reflects the continued customer losses in wireline voice. Connectivity & Platform's total EBITDA increased 1.6%, with margin up 90 basis points, reflecting a decline in overall expenses driven by the continued mix-shift to our higher-margin connectivity businesses, coupled with ongoing expense management. As I have previously mentioned in prior quarters and think is worth noting here, is that the only expense line item that had a meaningful increase over last year was direct product costs, which are success-based and tied to growth in our connectivity businesses. Breaking out our Connectivity & Platforms EBITDA results further, residential EBITDA increased 1.1%, with margins improving 100 basis points to 39.9%, and business services EBITDA growth rebounded nicely this quarter, returning to a mid-single-digit rate, while margin declined 70 basis points to 57%, reflecting the investments in sales and fulfillment we are making to scale in the mid-market and enterprise space. Now, let's turn to Content & Experiences on Slide 5. Revenue decreased 7.5% to $10.1 billion, and EBITDA decreased 11% to $1.9 billion. I'll detail these results further, starting with theme parks. Revenue decreased 11% and EBITDA declined 24% in the quarter compared to last year's record level for a second quarter. As Mike highlighted, two-thirds of the decline was driven by our domestic parks, due to lower attendance compared to last year, largely reflecting two factors; normalization in demand post-COVID, combined with the timing of our domestic attractions. This is the first full quarter comparison to the highly successful opening of Super Nintendo World in Hollywood early last year, which drove that park's record results in the second quarter of last year. And we haven't launched a major new attraction in Orlando since VelociCoaster in 2021 in anticipation of Epic Universe, which we originally planned to open this year. On the international side, underlying growth at our park in Osaka continues, partially offset by foreign currency as well as some softness at Universal Beijing due to the local macroeconomic environment. To reiterate, we couldn't be more bullish about the long-term trajectory of parks. In addition to Epic Universe, we have a fantastic slate of new attractions and experiences on the horizon, Donkey Kong Country in Osaka and a Fast and Furious Roller Coaster in Hollywood, as well as the Universal Horror Unleashed in Las Vegas and our Universal Kids Resort coming to Texas. Now let's turn to media, where revenue increased 2% and EBITDA was up 9%, driven by Peacock. Peacock revenue grew 28%, with 9% growth in advertising and 61% growth in distribution, driven by the 38% year-over-year increase in our paid subscriber base to 33 million. On a sequential basis, we held subscribers fairly steady. As we noted, during our last earnings call, our focus in the second quarter was on subscriber retention due to the lack of new tentpole content in the quarter. This timing and content also contributed to some relief in our expenses, which helped drive year-over-year Peacock EBITDA improvement of $300 million. We are pleased with the progress we are making, with media EBITDA for the first half of the year up nearly 3% as the improvement at Peacock outweighed the pressure at our TV networks. As we look to the second half of the year, we expect continued modest growth in overall media EBITDA, but with some variation in the degree of year-over-year improvement between the quarters, driven by the timing of sports, entertainment launches and marketing. Beginning in the third quarter, we are loaded with incremental content, including the Olympics, Sunday Night Football, which will have an additional game fall into the third quarter, as well as Peacock's exclusive NFL game from Brazil and the return of Big Ten. Given the timing of this content, EBITDA growth will be skewed to the fourth quarter. At studios, revenue decreased 27% and EBITDA decreased 51%, reflecting both the timing of our film slate and a tough comparison relative to last year's second quarter, which included the tremendously successful Super Mario Bros. movie as well as Fast X. We have said our film slate is weighted to the back-half of the year, which we believe will drive better year-over-year performance, and we're off to a strong start. Despicable Me 4 had a terrific opening weekend earlier this month, making the Despicable Me series of movies the first animated franchise in history to cross the $5 billion mark. And Twisters is off to a strong start, landing at number one at the box office this past weekend. And we're excited about our upcoming titles, including Wild Robot in September and Wicked in November. I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 6. As I mentioned earlier, we generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow this quarter, which includes a $2 billion increase in cash taxes over last year's level. Total capital spending declined 10% compared to last year with the $3.4 billion in spending reflecting the significant investments we continue to make to support our growth drivers, such as expanding our footprint and further strengthening our domestic broadband network, scaling our streaming business and supporting the continued build of our Epic Universe Theme Park ahead of its opening in 2025. Turning to return of capital. For the quarter, we returned a total of $3.4 billion to shareholders. This includes share repurchases of $2.2 billion and dividend payments of $1.2 billion. Notably, since we restarted our buyback program just three years ago, we have reduced our share count by 16% and returned just under $50 billion to shareholders through a combination of buybacks and dividends, prudently balancing investments we've made in the business around our six core growth drivers, protecting a strong balance sheet and providing strong capital returns to shareholders. Now, let me turn it over to Brian for some closing remarks. Brian? Yeah. I think Dave said it perfectly, as you think about third quarter, Ben, I think unpacking it and similar to what we saw in the second quarter, the competitive environment remains intense, but it's stable. It's sort of no worse, no better than we've seen over the past couple of quarters, I think that's the starting point. Second, as we pointed out, it's a quarter where we do get seasonal tailwinds, the same things that were headwinds in the second quarter largely become tailwinds in the third quarter. And then there's ACP that works against that where we will see an impact. As Dave said, the intention is to be largely through the impact by the end of the third quarter between actions we've seen and then a reserve we will take. And so, that's the thing we have to make sure we're executing very well against, but as Dave said, the early trends on that, whether it's voluntary churn or trends we've seen so far in non-pay and building non-pay and reserves around that are encouraging. Hey, Craig, let me hit the margin question real quick. So, I would say, the way we're looking at the business is really across Connectivity & Platforms. So, looking at it that way and managing the business that way. But to unpack it, legacy cable margin, if you wanted to look at it that way, the margin was up 110 basis points in the quarter, so really strong operating improvement to up to 48.4%. Thanks, Jonathan. Why don't I start with CapEx, Dave will hit content costs, and then Mike with NBA. So, on CapEx, you're right, we've had some variability this year. I would say, relative to the initial guidance we gave both on the Content & Experiences side, where we talked about this is the final significant year of Epic spending and then we get relief beyond this. And then, on the Connectivity & Platform side, which I think is probably where more of your question was, we gave a capital intensity envelope as we entered the year. We also said intend to do 1.1 million-plus in terms of homes passed. We're obviously trending a little bit above that at this point, but still feel comfortable with the capital intensity envelope that we gave. And so, there are some timing aspects around equipment purchases within the year. I would say, still feel comfortable with the existing capital intensity envelope. And within that, doing more and more homes passed at a really efficient rate, I think that's a testament to how the team is executing here. Hey, Steven, I would just round that out on the capital intensity question, because I think embedded in that was sort of a long-term capital intensity question. If you look at what we're doing now, the path towards mid-splits, which as Dave mentioned, really good progress there, that kicking off DOCSIS 4.0 and then adding 1.2 million homes passed, which is a record for us in the last 12 months and doing that all within through the existing capital intensity envelope, which is one of, if not, the lowest in the industry. So, very good progress there. As you think about longer term, a lot of people ask this question in the context of is there the next big thing coming in terms of the network upgrade. We feel very comfortable between mid-splits and DOCSIS 4.0, that leading to multi-gig symmetrical speeds that, that is the network for the future. So, we don't see the next big thing coming. The one area that I'd point out, we'd love to do more homes passed. We've accelerated the rate from 800,000 in the past couple of years up to currently 1.2 million. We won't get capital intensity because of that. If those are good returns and things we should be doing, we'd love to do more there."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this conference call is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Executive Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker. \nMarci Ryvicker: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone. Joining us on today's call are Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh, Jason Armstrong and Dave Watson. I will now refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation accompanying this call, which can also be found on our Investor Relations website and which contains our safe harbor disclaimer. \n This conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our 8-K and trending schedule issued earlier this morning, for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. \nMichael Cavanagh: Thanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. Across the company, our team is managing extremely well in a highly competitive and evolving marketplace. We have a clear vision for how we are going to compete now and into the future, combined with a sharp focus on execution. Equally important, our disciplined capital allocation strategy, coupled with our strong balance sheet, puts us in an enviable position relative to our peers to invest organically and aggressively in our 6 scaled and diverse growth businesses namely: Residential Broadband, Wireless, Business Services, Theme Parks, Studios and Streaming. These businesses comprise more than 55% of the company's total revenue today, and that proportion will only grow over time. \n In the first quarter, these businesses generated a high single-digit increase in revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. And when combined with our substantial share repurchase activity, enabled us to deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth as well as significant growth in free cash flow per share. In fact, since 2018, we grew adjusted EPS over 50% and free cash flow per share nearly 25%. \n Now for some of the highlights of the first quarter, I'll start with Broadband. The broadband market remains extremely competitive, particularly within the market for more price-conscious consumers. We continue to be intensely focused on segmentation, providing customers with options that meet both their lifestyle and budget. Importantly, we are striking the right balance between ARPU and subscribers, which is clearly reflected in our first quarter results, where despite modest subscriber losses, ARPU grew over 4%, driving mid-single-digit growth in residential broadband revenue to over $6.5 billion. \n We continue to see extremely encouraging broadband consumption trends across our base of 32 million customers. Usage on our network rose double digits year-over-year with broadband-only households consuming over 700 gigabytes of data each month, and our broadband customers continue to value faster speeds. Today, over 70% of our residential subscribers receive speeds of 500 megabits per second or higher and around 1/3 are getting a gig or more. \n We believe that consumers' expectations for their broadband experience in terms of speed, reliability, security and performance will only increase over time. It is extremely important to us that our network upgrades stay well ahead of this demand, our deployment of mid splits doubled year-over-year and now reach 40% of the footprint. The investments we are making to increase capacity and incorporate multi-gigabit symmetrical speeds everywhere we offer service put us in a great position to capitalize on these very favorable consumer trends. And when combined with our rapid footprint expansion, set us up to gain market share and return to broadband subscriber growth over time. \n Turning to wireless. We increased our domestic customer lines by 21% year-over-year to nearly $7 million, yet with wireless penetration of our residential broadband customer base still only 11%, we have plenty of room to grow. We continue to see the benefit of bundling broadband and mobile, which decreases churn and improves customer lifetime value. Our customers also benefit by being connected to our WiFi network, which is the largest in the nation. In fact, 90% of all Xfinity Mobile traffic is delivered over WiFi, not cellular, and we are constantly adding new features to further differentiate the experience. The most recent example is our introduction of WiFi Boost, which enables any Xfinity Mobile customer to experience speeds of up to 1 gig whenever they connect to our 23 million hotspots at no additional cost. \n Across our Connectivity & Platforms business, we're focused on profitably serving each segment of the market from our premium and traditional customers who want fully featured products to more price-driven consumers. With regard to the latter, we are introducing NOW, a new brand and product portfolio targeting the prepaid market that delivers high-quality, low-cost Internet, mobile and streaming TV products with simple all-in pricing. \n NOW Internet and mobile will be particularly helpful to those Americans impacted by the end of ACP, bringing them another option for affordable, reliable connectivity and supplementing our Internet Essentials program, which we offer to eligible households as part of our long-standing commitment to help close the digital divide in America. \n Turning to Content & Experiences. Let's start with parks. We continue to see strong underlying demand in both Hollywood and Japan, where healthy attendance and per cap levels were once again driven by the success of Super Nintendo World. Building on our momentum, later this year, we're opening our newest Nintendo-themed land, Donkey Kong Country, which will increase the size of Super Nintendo World in Japan by 70%. \n Switching gears to Orlando. We started to feel some pressure on attendance levels late in the first quarter, which tends to occur in tandem with the ebbs and flows of new attractions in the market. Right now, we happen to be lapping the multiyear surge in attendance from our opening of new attractions in prior periods, but we remain confident about our longer-term growth opportunities, especially as we look ahead to next year with the opening of Epic Universe. With 3 new hotels and 5 immersive worlds featuring more than 50 attractions, entertainment, dining and shopping experiences, it will be the most technologically advanced park in the world. Together with our 3 current gates in Orlando, Epic will enable us to offer a full week's vacation experience to even more guests. \n Moving to Studios. We're incredibly proud of our film team and our recent ranking as the #1 global studio by worldwide box office and winner of Academy Awards, including Best Picture for Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer. On the back of our fantastic performance in 2023, the power of our studios continued this quarter with the theatrical release of Kung Fu Panda 4, which has grossed over $480 million in worldwide box office to date. And we have an exciting slate still ahead. For the third year in a row, we'll release more movies than any other major studio with The Fall Guy, an action thriller starring Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt coming this May; Despicable Me 4, Illumination's newest installment of this highest grossing animated franchise as well as our adaptation of Twisters, both debuting in July; and Wicked, one of the most highly anticipated movies of 2024 coming in November. \n Finally in media. We are successfully managing the segment as one business across linear and streaming, by providing the tens of millions of traditional pay TV subscribers as well as streamers with choice in how they engage with us, we continue to generate significant audience for our programming. Big events like the Olympics, Sunday Night Football, Big Ten; top entertainment shows like Saturday Night Live and Law & Order, with strong consumer demand for our content, we're well positioned to evolve with the changing market. \n Our exclusively streamed NFL Wild Card game was a big success this past quarter. We added and then retained even more new Peacock subscribers than we expected. Overall, people are staying with us to engage in a broad range of content, spending 90% of their time on the platform viewing nonsports programming. This includes scripted shows like Ted and reality shows like The Traitors, both of which ranked within Nielsen's streaming top 10. And our award-winning collection of films like Oppenheimer, which premiered exclusively on Peacock in February and was the most watched film across all streaming in its first 7 days on the platform. \n Clearly, Peacock has been on a great trajectory since our launch 4 years ago, where 34 million paid subscribers having grown 12 million year-over-year and at a $10 ARPU. Looking ahead, our content offering provides such a great value proposition that we should have some real pricing power over time. \n Of course, sports also play an important role in our media business, and that's especially true this year. Following the Kentucky Derby in May, we'll have the Paris Olympics for 17 nights this summer. With more programming hours on the NBC Broadcast Network than any previous Olympics and over 5,000 hours of live coverage on Peacock, the games are on track to generate the most advertising revenue in history with $1.2 billion in ad sales commitments. \n Right after the Olympics, we have the return of football with Big Ten, Sunday Night Football and the NFL's first-ever Friday night opening game from S\u00e3o Paulo, streaming exclusively on Peacock. \n So wrapping up, I'm really proud of the work that our teams across the company are doing. Together, we're executing at the highest level and positioning ourselves for growth in a challenging and dynamic marketplace. So Jason, over to you. \nJason Armstrong: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our consolidated results on Slide 4. Total revenue increased 1% to $30.1 billion. And within this, our 6 major growth drivers generated nearly $17 billion in revenue, well over half of total company revenue and once again have shown steady and consistent growth at a high single-digit rate over the past 12 months. \n While EBITDA was in line with prior year's level at $9.4 billion, we generated a high level of free cash flow this quarter at $4.5 billion, and we returned $3.6 billion of capital to shareholders, including $2.4 billion in share repurchases. And over the last 12 months, we have reduced our share count by nearly 6%, contributing to our adjusted EPS growth in the quarter of 14%. \n Now let's go through our business results, starting on Slide 5 with Connectivity & Platforms. Note that our largest foreign exchange exposure is to the British pound, which was up 4% year-over-year. So as usual, in order to highlight the underlying performance of the Connectivity & Platforms business, I will refer to year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis. \n Revenue for total Connectivity & Platforms was flat at $20.3 billion, reflecting strong growth in connectivity revenues, offset mainly by declines in video revenue. Residential Connectivity revenue grew 7%, driven by 4% growth in domestic broadband, 13% growth in domestic wireless and 19% growth in international connectivity, while Business Services Connectivity revenue grew 5%. \n In domestic broadband, our revenue growth was driven by very strong ARPU, which increased 4.2% and came in a bit above our historical range. Our team is doing an excellent job of customer segmentation while balancing rate and volume. And we are encouraged by the positive consumer behavior trends we see in our base of 32 million customers. \n Bandwidth requirements and engagement are increasing at a rapid clip while the vast majority of our customers are now on speeds of 500 megabits or higher, and adopting advanced tier as a service like xFi complete at a higher rate. But as Mike mentioned, it continues to be a very competitive environment. And we lost 65,000 subscribers in the first quarter, following a loss of 34,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2023. \n As we sit here right now, we do not see this trend improving in the near term. We expect churn could be elevated given the end of ACP, which is only fully funded through April and partially funded through May. We remain in constant communication with our ACP customers and we'll continue to be diligent in helping this customer segment stay connected through various options. Whether that's our successful Internet Essentials program or our new prepaid NOW offerings, as Mike described. \n In addition, I want to remind you that the second quarter also tends to experience seasonal headwinds. While it's a competitive market, especially for the price-driven segment, we will continue to compete aggressively, yet in a financially balanced way and expect to drive healthy broadband revenue growth through growth in ARPU, which we expect to remain well within our historical range of 3% to 4% growth even as we manage through the ACP transition. \n Turning to domestic wireless. Revenue growth of 13% was due to higher service revenue, driven by a 21% year-over-year increase in our customer lines, ending the quarter at $6.9 million in total, including the 289,000 lines we just added in the quarter. We are consistently in the marketplace testing new offers, including some recent pricing plans targeted at multiline customers, the new NOW Mobile product as well as our Buy 1, Get 1 line offer. \n We continue to see significant opportunity in wireless to increase the penetration of our domestic residential broadband customer base, which currently sits at 11% and to sell additional lines per account. International connectivity revenue reflects strong growth in broadband revenue, driven by solid ARPU growth as well as growth in wireless due to additional customer lines and also higher ARPU. \n For business services connectivity, we generated 5% revenue growth driven by higher ARPU in small business and broader growth in both customers and additional solutions for mid-market and enterprise. The SMB market has gotten more competitive but will aggressively defend our position. And similar to this quarter, we'll grow revenue by increasing ARPU, driven by higher adoption of additional products like Mobile, Security Edge, Connection Pro and WiFi Pro and through targeted rate opportunities. \n Meanwhile, our momentum continues to build in mid-market and enterprise as our expanding capabilities in managed services, wide area networking and cybersecurity have led to increasing customer wins and the expansion of existing relationships. \n The strong growth in our Connectivity businesses was offset by a decline in video and other revenue. The decline in our video revenue was driven by continued customer losses and slower domestic ARPU growth versus last year, and the lower Other revenue reflects continued customer losses in wireline voice. As I mentioned earlier, Connectivity & Platforms total EBITDA increased 1.3% with margin of 50 basis points, reflecting a decline in overall expenses driven by the mix shift to our high-margin connectivity businesses, combined with a continued focus on expense management. \n While margins for our domestic legacy cable business improved even more, our international business was impacted by a reclassification of some expense from capitalized software to operating expenses, creating a tough comparison to last year. We will see a similar trend until we start to lap this change at the end of this year. \n I'll note that absent this change, EBITDA growth in the first quarter would have been about 1 point higher, and our margin improvement would have been about 50 basis points higher. While this change increased our operating expenses this quarter, there was an offsetting decline in Connectivity & Platforms capital, resulting in a neutral impact on net cash flow, which was up 5% this quarter. \n Breaking out our Connectivity & Platforms EBITDA results further. Residential EBITDA grew 1.1% with margins improving 60 basis points to 38.3%. And Business Services EBITDA growth was lower than our typical mid-single-digit level at 2.6% with margins declining 160 basis points to 56.7%. These results include significant investments in the enterprise space, including in sales and fulfillment that we are making to drive future revenue growth. Business Services generates well over $5 billion in annual EBITDA, which is margin accretive, and we expect it to continue to be a material contributor to overall connectivity and platforms growth this year and over the longer term. \n Now let's turn to Content & Experiences on Slide 6. Overall, revenue increased 1% to $10.4 billion and EBITDA decreased 7% to $1.5 billion. Let's take a closer look at the details. Starting with Theme Parks. Revenue increased 2%, while EBITDA decreased 4% for the quarter. These results reflect the negative impact of currency as the Japanese yen is at a 34-year low against the dollar. \n Adjusting the results to exclude the impact of foreign currency, Parks' revenue would have increased 5% and EBITDA would have been flat compared to last year's first quarter. We had strong underlying growth at our park in Osaka, which continues to benefit from demand for Super Nintendo World. We're also seeing growth in Hollywood despite lapping the opening of Super Nintendo World in that park during the quarter. \n Beijing results were relatively flat in what is typically a seasonally light quarter, and Orlando results were below last year, but still roughly in line with pre-pandemic levels. We are seeing some pullback from the unprecedented attendance we realized immediately after the pandemic, which we believe is driven by the timing of new attraction openings and some increased competition from other entertainment venues, notably cruises. \n At Media, which includes our TV Networks and Peacock, revenue increased 4% as Peacock's strong growth of 54% more than offset a low single-digit decline at our linear networks. Distribution revenue growth of 7% was driven by Peacock with subscription revenue growth of 68%, powered by the 55% year-over-year increase in our paid subscriber base to 34 million including 3 million net adds in the first quarter. \n We are really pleased with Peacock's trajectory. We started the year with an incredibly successful NFL Wild Card game, which resulted in a nice lift to paid subs. But even more important was how our broad content offering enabled strong consumer acquisition, retention and engagement. We've had success across a broad range of content during the quarter, including films moving into our Pay-One window like Oppenheimer, the most watched Pay-One film in Peacock's history; and The Holdovers, as well as successful originals, including Apples Never Fall, Ted and the second season of The Traitors. \n Looking ahead, we'll continue to be focused on retention, particularly in the second quarter as we look forward to the second half of the year, we will have a substantial amount of acquisition-oriented content lined up. This is consistent with Peacock's historical trends, and this year is expected to be driven by the Olympics this summer and the NFL and Big Ten returning in the fall, in addition to the steady stream of films landing in our Pay-One window as well as upcoming originals. \n Finally, domestic advertising revenue was flat in the quarter, reflecting a stable overall market with strong advertising growth at Peacock, offset by lower advertising revenue at our linear networks. Media EBITDA decreased 6%, reflecting the revenue pressure on our linear networks, partially offset by continued year-over-year improvement in Peacock EBITDA losses even with the addition of the wildcard rights costs. And we expect to see, on average, even better year-over-year improvement for Peacock in the coming quarters. \n At Studios, the revenue decline of 7% reflects lower content licensing, which was impacted by the timing of deliverables related to our film licensing business, which was partially offset by a modest increase in theatrical revenue, driven by the strong performance of Kung Fu Panda 4 at the box office this quarter. Studio's EBITDA declined 12%, reflecting the difficult comparison to last year's film slate, including the highly successful carryover title, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish and the timing of licensing deals at film. \n Now I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 7. As I mentioned previously, we generated $4.5 billion in free cash flow this quarter, and we achieved this even with the significant investments we continue to make to support our growth drivers. Specifically, our $3.3 billion in total capital spending this quarter incorporates our efforts in expanding our footprint and further strengthening our domestic broadband network, scaling our streaming business and supporting the continued build of our Epic Universe Theme Park ahead of its 2025 opening. And working capital was a $940 million drag for the quarter, a significant improvement over last year, a lot of which is timing related. \n Turning to return on capital. For the quarter, we returned a total of $3.6 billion to shareholders, an increase of 13% year-over-year. This includes share repurchases of $2.4 billion and dividend payments of $1.2 billion. Putting it all together in the last 12 months, we've returned over $16 billion in capital to shareholders between share repurchases and dividends, reducing our share count by nearly 6%. \n At the same time, we invested nearly $17 billion back into our businesses in the form of capital and working capital, carefully and consistently balancing reinvesting in our businesses for growth, returning significant capital to shareholders and doing so with a very strong balance sheet, which facilitates this consistency through a variety of operating environments. \n Now let me turn it over to Marci for Q&A. \nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Jason. Operator, let's open up the call for Q&A, please. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. \nBenjamin Swinburne: Two questions maybe for Dave on the Cable side. Could you talk maybe bigger picture about customer segmentation, particularly some of the new efforts around prepaid and the NOW brand as well as some of the speed boost you've done, and just how you think about that impacting the business over time? And then if you're willing to give us a little more on how you are able to deliver ARPU growth within the historical range through the CP transition, just given, obviously, the subsidies going away. \n And then I think for Jason. We expect EBITDA growth this year, free cash flow growth this year. You guys had a nice free cash flow, first quarter. I guess, I would have expected buybacks to grow as well year-on-year. And as you point out on that last slide, trailing 12 months, $11.5 billion, $2.5 billion in the first quarter. So it looks like it's slowing a bit. So just wondering if you could comment or if there's anything that's changed on sort of the capital allocation leverage math that we should be thinking about with Comcast this year? \nDavid Watson: Ben, Dave. So let me start with segmentation and a little bit more context on NOW. So stepping back, our segmentation strategy is really key. It starts with the beginning point always for us is premium and traditional broadband customers. We've focused there and invested in terms of better network, better products around providing a better service for the premium segment. \n We have consistently competed for all segments. And as we break it down, we've focused where we think the main point is where broadband is going. And broadband is going is the engagement. And so our focus is to continue to deliver multi-gig symmetrical and build towards that point. And do this for a variety of Internet options. And the proof is in the footing in terms of segmentation in that 70% of our HSD-only customers receive speeds of 500 megabits per second or higher and 1/3 of our customers -- resi customers receive gig plus. So it never has been one-size-fits-all. \n [ There is ] start there and the focus of premium. But there is currently a lot of activity at the low end of the market. And we've not been as competitive in this space. We've had great products and several options, but we -- in the prepaid area, in particular, we believe there is an opportunity to improve our effectiveness there. \n And so thus NOW. And NOW, there are 3 components of NOW. One is prepaid broadband, which, by the way we've had prepaid broadband for some time. We've just approved upon the value proposition there. So it's a NEW prepaid broadband update. And second, we have prepaid NOW mobile, which is new and then we feel that it's positioned for an alternative to fixed wireless and just a lot of activity there. The focus there is there are no credit checks. It's easy. \n It's no contract and on an everyday price point. So not a lot of movement in terms of just a competitive value-based price point. At the time we're doing NOW, obviously, it's a good alternative to ACP and where that goes. So early to talk about any progress but we're real pleased with the positioning of the NOW product for the income-constrained segment of the market. We've had NOW TV for some time and traction there. So it's a stand-alone product suite. I feel very good about that. \n On ARPU, this is a strength that we've had. We've been balancing ARPU growth, along with share volume for a very long time. So we feel good about this quarter, came in very strong at 4.2% and a bit above the historical 3% to 4% range. It's a very competitive marketplace, to say the least, and we're just striking the right balance, we think, in volume and rate. And our approach is reasonable rate increase. The teams have managed this well leading to rate yield results that exceeded our expectations a bit. \n But also it goes back to the first point. We're segmenting the marketplace and tailoring product approaches that meet each specific segment. So it starts with the high end that I've talked about and very focused there and the results that I've talked about. So that's the starting point. But when you look at our long-standing approach to pricing and packaging, we're going to compete for every segment. And it's really focused, though, where the market is going and making sure that in the long run as the overall usage goes up. \n And to me, that is the main point. You have double-digit increases in terms of overall broadband consumption. You have lots of customers, a lot of interest in our high end of our portfolio and strength in a ubiquitous, reliable, great network that can stand up for every segment, but power through every application that is there. So I think for us, pleased with ARPU. And I think we can muscle through this ACP thing and feel good about the guidance that we've been giving at 3% to 4% historical range. \nBrian Roberts: This is Brian. I just want to just underscore that last point that Dave was making. As you look with a longer lens, which I -- hopefully, the company tries to do, there's -- and we -- just even yesterday, we're looking at our technology road map internally and seeing some demonstrations of innovation. It's inspiring and exciting to think about what broadband will actually help you do in the next 5, 10 years as a consumer and as a business. And it's kind of in some levels, unimaginable. A lot of discussion about AI but so much happening in the entertainment sector, sports sector and also in the health care sector, and then things we're not even talking about. \n And so our strategy is pretty simple. But having NOW, this NOW strategy to help consumers with are super easy-on, it's all there in a prepaid market. But the main strategy has always been to have the superior product in the market with fantastic service and constant innovation and do it in a capital way where our investment is consistent and within the guidelines that we've previously talked about. \n All that's happening, and we're making great inroads on that. And if I had to pick one number this quarter that excites me, it was a double-digit growth of bits per home, which is showing that usage for whatever it is, gaming, multi streams, whatever. And then the actual high definition becoming even higher definition over time with the quality of the picture. So hopefully, all that's useful, and we're pretty pleased with how the team is executing. Jason? \nJason Armstrong: Yes. Great. Thanks. So just to round that out, Ben, just you think your question specifically on ARPU and how do you go through the ACP cycle and have confidence in ARPU growth. I think all these points are relevant and valid. Number one, we continue to see usage grow at a rapid rate. So the value that the consumer is getting is higher. That's a tailwind in general for ARPU growth. I think number two is segmentation that Dave's talked about. We see a lot of competition in a certain segment of our base, the value-conscious segment of our base. The segmentation allows you to keep that from seeping into other segments of the base. And the team has done a nice job executing there. \n Final thing I'd point out is as we said, ACP customers have got about 1.4 million in our base that we'll need to manage through. This is very similar, though, to -- if you think about how this business is wired, Dave and his team, it's promotional roll-offs. This is something we're dealing with every single quarter, how do you navigate a base of customers that's on promotion and roll them into new rate plans and keep them as customers? So this is very much what the Cable business is wired to do. \n On buyback spend, I would go back and over the last few years. We've had a very consistent capital allocation strategy starting with reinvesting in our business, layered into protecting the balance sheet. We really like our current credit rating and have committed to metrics that are associated with the credit rating as you've seen. And as you point out, very strong free cash flow last year and expectation for similar this year. As you mentioned, allows for substantial share repurchase activity. So since we restarted the buyback in 2021, we bought back over 15% of our share count. If you look at the last year, we bought back over 6% of our share count. So both very strong metrics. \n I would point out the tail end of last year, we were pretty clear in the third quarter that we were going to accelerate the buyback, anticipating minimum floor Hulu proceeds, which came in at the very end of last year. And that's in advance of more full proceeds for full value this year, but we did get a minimum floor payment last year and hence, accelerated the buyback in 3Q and 4Q to $3.5 billion. \nMichael Cavanagh: And Ben, I'll just come in on the back of the question about any changes in how we think about capital allocation. I think Jason and team are carrying on a phenomenal tradition. I've been here now close to 10 years. And I think the idea of taking our well-generated capital across our businesses, and first and foremost, investing them back in the business with a very long-term view of what the future can be, where there's expected return. Whether that's the Parks business, whether that's the broadband network, whether that's streaming, whether it's just broad innovation. \n I think it's in our DNA at this place to try to figure out ways to invest wisely for the future, while at the same time, maintaining a very strong balance sheet and we like the way the balance sheet is set up. When you go through these long  arcs of change across industries with disruption, it allows you to sleep better at night knowing the strength of balance sheet we have and allows us to continue making those earlier investments. And then so to do those 2 things together with the very substantial interest on the part of the management team and the facts that we've done it to just get lots of capital return to shareholders. Not many companies are inclined to manage those 3 priorities as much as we are. And I can commit that that's where our head is as we look forward to the next 10 years ahead. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. \nCraig Moffett: Two questions about broadband, if I could. First, you talked about how your broadband business -- or sorry, your wireless business is helping broadband churn. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about that. How you -- first, can you put some numbers around the churn reduction that you see when a customer bundles broadband and wireless together? \n But more importantly, how do you think about wireless? Is it a stand-alone business to you? Or is it really in service of broadband churn? And then I wonder if you could -- maybe I was just -- I missed it. But Jason, I think you mentioned the margins for this domestic Cable-only business. But I think I may have missed the number. I wonder if you could just repeat that for us. \nDavid Watson: Craig, Dave. Let me start with wireless and then hand it over to Jason and folks. But let me -- wireless is an absolute integral part of our overall strategy. And specifically to your question, we've always thought the main value for us, wireless is connected with broadband. And that it adds -- it surrounds broadband with value. I think we don't give specifics on exactly the churn benefits, but we do see it. And whether it's acquisition-oriented, connected to broadband; whether it's base management upgrading; whether it's retention, wireless plays a role in all of them. \n So it's a key growth opportunity. But it's also -- it's a product where our marginal economics are strong. So it's good to have that, but it's -- the way we go to market, it's connected to broadband and it's connected to packaging. So it's performing well. We like our consistency in the marketplace and love the fact that we have a good runway ahead only about 11% penetrated, now 7 million lines. And so I really like the opportunity in front of us. And for us, we've constantly been evolving our approach towards wireless and how we connect it with broadband and how we use it. \n So we have, for example, new pricing plans. Our new mobile plants that are really targeting multiline customers excited about that. The new mobile product and segmentation. We've already talked about that in the prepaid area. And for that segment, we've had a Buy 1, Get 1 program for the base. So almost every single segment. And then just announced, the WiFi boost for our mobile customers being able to open up the public. The WiFis, hotspots and open it up as fast as devices can go and leveraging WiFi complement to mobile. So I think we've demonstrated that we're in this business, we love this business, and it's -- but it is definitely the core part of our strategy is how it impacts broadband over the long run. Jason? \nJason Armstrong: Craig, so on margins, we said overall connectivity and platforms margins were up 50 basis points and said domestic was an even greater increase. The domestic was up 70 basis year-over-year, sort of continuing the formula of a mix shift in our business to higher-margin businesses. Our connectivity businesses are growing faster than our nongrowth video businesses. So that's a margin favorable trade-off for us as we said historically and then operating efficiencies in the business. I think we gave a stat last call that I'd reiterate, we've taken 50% of our truck rolls out of the system in the last 6 years. We've taken 40% of customer interactions out of the system in the last 6 years. So lot of good progress on expense efficiency. But Craig, the domestic margin's up 70 basis points. \nOperator: Next question is coming from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America Securities. \nJessica Reif Cohen: I have a question on NBCU and also on Comcast Cable. On the Theme Parks, which is clearly one of your growth pillars, can you give us the investment levels you expect over the next 5 years? Obviously, Epic will be in there, so it will be a little elevated. But you have other new parks and you're also investing in the existing parks. And how different is the return on invested capital for Theme Parks versus your other businesses? And then one more on NBCU, are there other areas that NBCU should or you're thinking about investing in like video games? \n And then on Cable, on Comcast Cable. Just a question on your programming expense or programming contracts. Presumably, you have MSMs, I think you've always had them. How should we think about the impact on Comcast Cable programming expenses as some major programming contracts come up with other distributors? \nMichael Cavanagh: Jessica, it's Mike. So on parks, as we've said, this is a year in 2024, where CapEx in parks and at NBCUniversal overall will sustain at the level it was in '23. So it remain elevated. In '25, when we open Epic, it will begin to step down. And then after that, it will return to a more normal level with adjustments for the Hollywood Hard Nights and the Kids park in Frisco, Texas that we've talked about. But those, as we've said, are not of the same size and scale as a large park like Epic but we do have a bigger footprint of parks than we did, say, 5 years ago. \n So you're right, part of the part of the capital equation for parks is to continue to invest in new attractions within existing parks. So again, once we get to '26, you'll see us easing into a new steady state that does include continued experimentation with some of our alternative concepts. And then certainly, we hope over the longer term to come up with some ideas for bigger deployments of capital, but that's what we have in our plans as we sit here right now. But we love the business. \n And to the question of returns, we think the returns are very strong. We take a careful look at that every time we're greenlighting a new park. And I think we like the stability of the long-term nature of the return. It's us and one other great company that are world leaders in that level of park experience. The response to our parks has been phenomenal coming out of COVID. And so we see that being a place, live entertainment at the level we're talking about, being just a strong pillar of the media and entertainment side of the company for a long time ahead. \n And then in terms of other areas. I think the success that we've had across parks and experiences are -- lead us to plenty of opportunities to think about gaming and other areas around live entertainment that go around and cross between our businesses. So we experiment with things and we look, and it's our job to see if there are great opportunities to do that, but nothing to report today. \nDavid Watson: Jessica, Dave. Just so on your question on renewals and our point of view. Yes, look, from our view, there's not a single approach towards -- we handle it on a case-by-case basis. When you step back for a second though, we evaluate each one in 3 primary areas. One, the overall cost relative to the content, flexibility that's required in a very fast-changing environment and the overall consumer value. And so -- and we're going to look at this significant transition that has been going on. We'll continue to go on between linear and streaming. And so that is something that we think we can play a unique role in, in terms of win-win opportunities between the content providers and distribution. \n And for us, we have a unique platform that is positioned well to be able to do -- handle everything that video can handle, linear channels, on-demand, DVR and streaming. We've been doing streaming packaging on the platform for some period of time. So we can build bridges as these things come up. And -- but our goal consistently has been to find win-win opportunities as we examine each and every specific renewal, but that's how we'll evaluate each one. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from John Hodulik from UBS. \nJohn Hodulik: Two, if I could, maybe first for Jason. Just finishing up on ACP. Given the strong start you guys had to the year and the strong ARPU, do you guys think that you can keep domestic cable EBITDA flat to up for the year even with ACP going away? That's first. \n And then maybe for Dave, the wireless companies are definitely talking at sort of bigger game on fixed wireless in the business market. I know you guys had some sort of strong comments in the prepared remarks about the business market. But are you starting to see some increasing competition leak in at the low end because of fixed wireless? \nJason Armstrong: Yes, John, let me hit domestic or Cable EBITDA, C&P EBITDA over the course of the year. So I think as you mentioned, it's competitive market. We've got ACP coming our way. At the same time, the balance, I think about broadband specifically. The balance between rate and volume we've seen, obviously, a little bit of pressure on volume. But 4.2% ARPU growth in the quarter, an outlook for -- we continue to stay at 3% or 4% during the year. So we still think there's tailwinds for broadband revenue growth. We had 3.9% this quarter. \n We're growing business Services, we're growing Wireless, and we're offsetting video and other revenue declines. But at the total level, that's a margin accretive mix shift. I'd go back to what I've said before on some of the expense initiatives across the company and being very disciplined, taking volumes out of the system and that's providing a tailwind as well. So without giving specific guidance for EBITDA growth, I would give you the components and our confidence in them. \nDavid Watson: John, Dave. So just a follow-on to Jason's point in terms of ACP. Remember, I think a really important point. We've been segmenting the marketplace, and I think we've had the industry-leading platform in terms of Internet Essentials for a very long time so a decade-plus. So we are familiar with the segmentation in this area and we're very familiar in terms of promo roles and bigger moments like this. So I -- because of that, in particular, the ARPU point that's connected to it is we feel pretty good about the historical range of 3% to 4%. So -- but we've had a long-standing approach towards this. \n On your question around business services, there's no question, John, that we -- the SMB market has become a bit more competitive and fixed wireless is a part of that. So they are -- you've seen it in the results. We now have 3 fixed wireless competitors that are in it. When you have that much all at once, there's some impact. So we're seeing it in SMB. It's unique to SMB. But our game plan consistently has been to focus on both the share and the overall -- the rate and we have a great slate of products. We have multiple segments within Business Services, mid-market and enterprise that offset a lot of this and great product road maps that have. \n But really important point as you feel competitive pressure, I think it's important to keep in mind, uniquely to SMB that reliability and ubiquity of our products and business services is really key here. For businesses, they get 24/7. They're always on. It has to work. I think over time, we will continue to press that point and have -- we're not going to chase things down to zero in terms of discounting. We're going to offer better products and surround those products with features that make sense for business customers. But we will make sure that customers know the reliability and ubiquity of what we do is unique and different than fixed wireless. \nBrian Roberts: And just -- Brian. One -- just again, just as we talked about in the residential market, the long-term opportunity where we're only just getting started is that large enterprise and medium-sized business. And as you think about cybersecurity and other data reliability and just consumption behavior of businesses and think of your own businesses and where that might lead to the use of new tools and video and everything else, you want to have the best network. And once again, we have a really exciting team and road map on that front. So again, we're battling the reality in one segment with great opportunity in others and long-term love our situation. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Steven Cahall from Wells Fargo. \nSteven Cahall: Maybe first just on broadband trends. I think you've been pursuing a line extension strategy for, at least, 18 months and that will continue. So is it correct to assume that your gross adds on broadband are starting to pick up just as you add more passings in the market? And if that's true, can you give us any color on within the deactivations where they're headed? I think you've always said that you view fiber as the bigger competitive threat. And so does that kind of help us understand what's going on between gross adds and net adds? \n And then separately on Peacock. You talked about retaining subs between some of your big marquee sporting events and you've got a lot of great film on Peacock as well. I'm wondering what your tolerance is for original content and original content spend and how we think about originals on Peacock maybe, vis-a-vis, a long-term breakeven goal. \nDavid Watson: Steven, this is Dave. Let me start with footprint and then go to competition views. So let me -- in terms of overall footprint expansion, the vast majority of our new passings each quarter are fill-ins within our existing footprint. The balance of the growth is mostly from our organic edge-outs into adjacent areas. And so with some government subsidized builds representing a much smaller, albeit increasing portion. So it's really the kind of 3 different components of it that we're looking at. \n And so it's still early and -- but we are very disciplined. We evaluate the risk adjusted returns of each -- one of these network builds on a case-by-case basis. And generally, though the edge outs as that will increase, they're adjacent, sometimes located in between geographic markets that we currently serve. So looking ahead, we expect these edge out projects to continue to contribute to the future growth in our total passings. And we don't give -- to your question, the specific numbers on this. \n I could tell you that we're going to reach very healthy penetration levels in a few years on these edge out projects. So the ramp-ups happen pretty quickly, and we're pleased with the returns though. So pretty disciplined process. We look on the returns. And then as you shift towards the competition, the environment, let me back up and just its overall -- it's a very intense competitive environment that is very consistent the last several years. \n And so it's picked up a bit. And when you have, again, 3 fixed wireless competitors coming in pretty much at the same time and you have the fiber level, about half of our footprint now has fiber competition of some form and it's an intense competitive environment. But we have adjusted. We've been going up against fiber competition now for over 15 years. And it is -- we've made adjustments. We've done, I think, very well in going toe-to-toe for the -- exactly as Brian laided out, that our long-term game plan is to focus on a better network, ubiquitous network, better products. \n Surround it with the full portfolio of better products and not chase units just for the sake of it. And we've had moments going up against fiber where they've gone way down market. They've become rational. We've had different cycles. And so I think we've made adjustments and we have proven that we more than hold our own in that footprint. What we're seeing now is kind of an intense -- more intense competitive focus around the lower end of the market. \n And that's why we're segmenting. That's why we're doing what we're doing, never losing sight though. That we're going to have a better product than anybody in the marketplace. The better network and backing it up with better devices, that can eventually -- as we get to multi-gig symmetrical. And that's the key. Every single application ubiquitously delivered, that's our focus. So it's a tough competitive environment but I think we have a unique differentiated approach. \nMichael Cavanagh: And so on Peacock. I mean we're very pleased as we split -- both Jason and I said earlier, with a quarter where we ended at 33.5 million subs, 3.5 years in. We are at a place now where we really are seeing traction in our approach to providing a service for consumers that is a combination of both entertainment and sports and how those 2 go together. \n Very much a reflection, as we said from the beginning, of our -- a mirror image of what we see as our strengths at NBCUniversal itself. And so when you look at this quarter in particular, you end up with a start with a Wild Card game that brought in a tremendous number of subs ahead of where we expected it to be. And then retention, that was ahead of where we expected it to be. And so that's obviously great and the power of sports to bring audiences together and will stay committed because of our strength in sports. \n But when you really reflect on what then happened in the weeks that followed our viewing was the record highs across all parts of our non-sports portfolio. And in fact in the quarter, we launched our biggest original, Ted, to the greatest success of any of the originals we've ever launched. And Traitors 2, our reality series on Peacock, both of those were in the Nielsen Top 10 streaming in the earlier part of the year. \n So I think we see the 2 -- the parts of the portfolio interplaying well with each other. And obviously, the strength of our movie studio, which we talked about earlier with Oppenheimer and Holdovers and now coming up in future quarters, Kung Fu Panda 4. That is another great source of strength into our portfolio. So I think you can expect to see us having a very broad approach to it' sports, it' originals, it' next-day airing of NBC content, it's our library, and it's our Pay-1 movies. All those things going into a service that we think is one of the best values in streaming and a very distinct place over time in the streaming marketplace for consumers. \n And when you look ahead from where we started the year, we are now in continue to focus hard on retaining the growth in subs we had. Second quarter will be a little lighter in terms of the cadence of our content. But when you look to the middle of the year, we've got Olympics. Right after that, we've got the return of NFL, Big Ten and our exclusive NFL game in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, along with the tremendous movie slate: Fall Guy, Twisters, Despicable Me 4, in addition to Kung Fu Panda 4. \n And so we feel great about what we're doing and the progress we're making, and it's very consistent with the way we've described Peacock as taking advantage of what makes us great at NBCUniversal to begin with, and taking our existing strengths and assets into a digital future. So that's -- and it's one of our 6 big growth drivers, so glad to get a chance to comment on it. \nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Steve. Operator, we have time for one last question. \nOperator: Our final question today is coming from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street. \nJonathan Chaplin: One for Dave and one for Jason. Dave, taking a step back from the sort of the increased competitive intensity you're seeing in the broadband market, I would love your perspectives on how the overall market is trending. As we tally up all the ads from the quarter, it looks like we're sort of trending to somewhere around half of what we normally see for the industry in the first quarter. Everybody's adds are down. And I'm wondering if you've got any thoughts as to what might be driving that? \n And then, Jason, on the segmentation strategy. You hit the low end of the market with some offers last year and then pulled back because you're worried about cannibalization. I'm wondering how the NOW -- you've sort of structured NOW differently so you don't end up seeing that cannibalization impact. \nDavid Watson: Jonathan, Dave. Let me start with the broadband in its entirety, the whole market and a viewpoint. So let me begin with the broadband market as a whole is still growing, maybe at a slower pace than it was last year and the year before, but there's still going to be a pretty healthy amount of net adds in 2024 and likely beyond. The right way, though, in addition to that, I think you got it. Everything we've talked about before, the right way we think to look about it is it's holding our own, growing relationships responsibly, but it's also where the market is going and how broadband is being used. \n And that -- as we've talked about the utility of the broadband product itself is only going up. So when you look at the health of the entire category, it's the relationships, but it's also the overall usage and consumption. And for us, you can see usage is up double digits. Broadband-only subs using over 700 gigabytes of data a month. Over 70% of our subscriber base is on speed tiers of 50 megs or more, nearly 1/3 of our customers are on 1 gig. Those are great trends for us over the long term and gives us the great confidence as we're investing, continuing to invest in a better network and a better customer experience, as Brian has said. \n So when you look at things, I think it's clearly competitive as we've talked about. One other factor that enters into it, in some cases, in certain segments. There are some people that revert back to mobile-only, that can happen. So there's a variety of factors that could enter into it. But overall, as a category and a growth opportunity, quite optimistic about broadband. \nJason Armstrong: Jonathan, let me start on segmentation and Dave probably wants to chime in as well. So on NOW, I think what's interesting and exciting about it is it's a dedicated sort of flanker brand strategy. We've had prepaid offers in the past sort of wedged into our existing portfolio. This is a more dedicated and branded strategy around it. \n By the way, the branding around this has worked very well in our U.K. market for Sky. It's actually where the brand name came from. And so we expect this to have some resonance. I would point out the -- if you look at where it's sort of targeted, we've got 100 meg offer for $30. It's inclusive of taxes, fees and equipment. We've got a $45 offering that's 200 megs and inclusive as well, very competitive versus fixed wireless, right? That is in this range, maybe slightly higher without the same reliability and ubiquity that we have. \nDavid Watson: Yes. Just adding on to that, Jonathan. But again, we've been doing prepaid broadband for a while, years. And it's just we needed to refresh it, needed to update it and put it in a more competitive position. The prepaid mobile is new, and NOW TV is relatively new. But it's a segmented approach. And if you think about -- it's all in pricing, it's very simple. It's really easy. \n There's no contracts, no credit checks, customers can sign up, pause, cancel online, anytime. It's a very straightforward -- but feature-light product as we keep our focus on the high end in terms of fully featured things. We'll continue to do that. But this just gives us a brand, gives us a product suite to be able to clearly and define segmentation in a way that we can manage through. \nMarci Ryvicker: Thanks, Jonathan, and we want to thank everyone on the call for joining us this morning. \nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the question-and-answer session and today's conference call. A replay of the call will be available starting at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time today on Comcast Investor Relations website. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect.",

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "David Watson",
            "content": "Ben, Dave. So let me start with segmentation and a little bit more context on NOW. So stepping back, our segmentation strategy is really key. It starts with the beginning point always for us is premium and traditional broadband customers. We've focused there and invested in terms of better network, better products around providing a better service for the premium segment. \n We have consistently competed for all segments. And as we break it down, we've focused where we think the main point is where broadband is going. And broadband is going is the engagement. And so our focus is to continue to deliver multi-gig symmetrical and build towards that point. And do this for a variety of Internet options. And the proof is in the footing in terms of segmentation in that 70% of our HSD-only customers receive speeds of 500 megabits per second or higher and 1/3 of our customers -- resi customers receive gig plus. So it never has been one-size-fits-all. \n [ There is ] start there and the focus of premium. But there is currently a lot of activity at the low end of the market. And we've not been as competitive in this space. We've had great products and several options, but we -- in the prepaid area, in particular, we believe there is an opportunity to improve our effectiveness there. \n And so thus NOW. And NOW, there are 3 components of NOW. One is prepaid broadband, which, by the way we've had prepaid broadband for some time. We've just approved upon the value proposition there. So it's a NEW prepaid broadband update. And second, we have prepaid NOW mobile, which is new and then we feel that it's positioned for an alternative to fixed wireless and just a lot of activity there. The focus there is there are no credit checks. It's easy. \n It's no contract and on an everyday price point. So not a lot of movement in terms of just a competitive value-based price point. At the time we're doing NOW, obviously, it's a good alternative to ACP and where that goes. So early to talk about any progress but we're real pleased with the positioning of the NOW product for the income-constrained segment of the market. We've had NOW TV for some time and traction there. So it's a stand-alone product suite. I feel very good about that. \n On ARPU, this is a strength that we've had. We've been balancing ARPU growth, along with share volume for a very long time. So we feel good about this quarter, came in very strong at 4.2% and a bit above the historical 3% to 4% range. It's a very competitive marketplace, to say the least, and we're just striking the right balance, we think, in volume and rate. And our approach is reasonable rate increase. The teams have managed this well leading to rate yield results that exceeded our expectations a bit. \n But also it goes back to the first point. We're segmenting the marketplace and tailoring product approaches that meet each specific segment. So it starts with the high end that I've talked about and very focused there and the results that I've talked about. So that's the starting point. But when you look at our long-standing approach to pricing and packaging, we're going to compete for every segment. And it's really focused, though, where the market is going and making sure that in the long run as the overall usage goes up. \n And to me, that is the main point. You have double-digit increases in terms of overall broadband consumption. You have lots of customers, a lot of interest in our high end of our portfolio and strength in a ubiquitous, reliable, great network that can stand up for every segment, but power through every application that is there. So I think for us, pleased with ARPU. And I think we can muscle through this ACP thing and feel good about the guidance that we've been giving at 3% to 4% historical range. Craig, Dave. Let me start with wireless and then hand it over to Jason and folks. But let me -- wireless is an absolute integral part of our overall strategy. And specifically to your question, we've always thought the main value for us, wireless is connected with broadband. And that it adds -- it surrounds broadband with value. I think we don't give specifics on exactly the churn benefits, but we do see it. And whether it's acquisition-oriented, connected to broadband; whether it's base management upgrading; whether it's retention, wireless plays a role in all of them. \n So it's a key growth opportunity. But it's also -- it's a product where our marginal economics are strong. So it's good to have that, but it's -- the way we go to market, it's connected to broadband and it's connected to packaging. So it's performing well. We like our consistency in the marketplace and love the fact that we have a good runway ahead only about 11% penetrated, now 7 million lines. And so I really like the opportunity in front of us. And for us, we've constantly been evolving our approach towards wireless and how we connect it with broadband and how we use it. \n So we have, for example, new pricing plans. Our new mobile plants that are really targeting multiline customers excited about that. The new mobile product and segmentation. We've already talked about that in the prepaid area. And for that segment, we've had a Buy 1, Get 1 program for the base. So almost every single segment. And then just announced, the WiFi boost for our mobile customers being able to open up the public. The WiFis, hotspots and open it up as fast as devices can go and leveraging WiFi complement to mobile. So I think we've demonstrated that we're in this business, we love this business, and it's -- but it is definitely the core part of our strategy is how it impacts broadband over the long run. Jason? Jessica, Dave. Just so on your question on renewals and our point of view. Yes, look, from our view, there's not a single approach towards -- we handle it on a case-by-case basis. When you step back for a second though, we evaluate each one in 3 primary areas. One, the overall cost relative to the content, flexibility that's required in a very fast-changing environment and the overall consumer value. And so -- and we're going to look at this significant transition that has been going on. We'll continue to go on between linear and streaming. And so that is something that we think we can play a unique role in, in terms of win-win opportunities between the content providers and distribution. \n And for us, we have a unique platform that is positioned well to be able to do -- handle everything that video can handle, linear channels, on-demand, DVR and streaming. We've been doing streaming packaging on the platform for some period of time. So we can build bridges as these things come up. And -- but our goal consistently has been to find win-win opportunities as we examine each and every specific renewal, but that's how we'll evaluate each one. John, Dave. So just a follow-on to Jason's point in terms of ACP. Remember, I think a really important point. We've been segmenting the marketplace, and I think we've had the industry-leading platform in terms of Internet Essentials for a very long time so a decade-plus. So we are familiar with the segmentation in this area and we're very familiar in terms of promo roles and bigger moments like this. So I -- because of that, in particular, the ARPU point that's connected to it is we feel pretty good about the historical range of 3% to 4%. So -- but we've had a long-standing approach towards this. \n On your question around business services, there's no question, John, that we -- the SMB market has become a bit more competitive and fixed wireless is a part of that. So they are -- you've seen it in the results. We now have 3 fixed wireless competitors that are in it. When you have that much all at once, there's some impact. So we're seeing it in SMB. It's unique to SMB. But our game plan consistently has been to focus on both the share and the overall -- the rate and we have a great slate of products. We have multiple segments within Business Services, mid-market and enterprise that offset a lot of this and great product road maps that have. \n But really important point as you feel competitive pressure, I think it's important to keep in mind, uniquely to SMB that reliability and ubiquity of our products and business services is really key here. For businesses, they get 24/7. They're always on. It has to work. I think over time, we will continue to press that point and have -- we're not going to chase things down to zero in terms of discounting. We're going to offer better products and surround those products with features that make sense for business customers. But we will make sure that customers know the reliability and ubiquity of what we do is unique and different than fixed wireless. Steven, this is Dave. Let me start with footprint and then go to competition views. So let me -- in terms of overall footprint expansion, the vast majority of our new passings each quarter are fill-ins within our existing footprint. The balance of the growth is mostly from our organic edge-outs into adjacent areas. And so with some government subsidized builds representing a much smaller, albeit increasing portion. So it's really the kind of 3 different components of it that we're looking at. \n And so it's still early and -- but we are very disciplined. We evaluate the risk adjusted returns of each -- one of these network builds on a case-by-case basis. And generally, though the edge outs as that will increase, they're adjacent, sometimes located in between geographic markets that we currently serve. So looking ahead, we expect these edge out projects to continue to contribute to the future growth in our total passings. And we don't give -- to your question, the specific numbers on this. \n I could tell you that we're going to reach very healthy penetration levels in a few years on these edge out projects. So the ramp-ups happen pretty quickly, and we're pleased with the returns though. So pretty disciplined process. We look on the returns. And then as you shift towards the competition, the environment, let me back up and just its overall -- it's a very intense competitive environment that is very consistent the last several years. \n And so it's picked up a bit. And when you have, again, 3 fixed wireless competitors coming in pretty much at the same time and you have the fiber level, about half of our footprint now has fiber competition of some form and it's an intense competitive environment. But we have adjusted. We've been going up against fiber competition now for over 15 years. And it is -- we've made adjustments. We've done, I think, very well in going toe-to-toe for the -- exactly as Brian laided out, that our long-term game plan is to focus on a better network, ubiquitous network, better products. \n Surround it with the full portfolio of better products and not chase units just for the sake of it. And we've had moments going up against fiber where they've gone way down market. They've become rational. We've had different cycles. And so I think we've made adjustments and we have proven that we more than hold our own in that footprint. What we're seeing now is kind of an intense -- more intense competitive focus around the lower end of the market. \n And that's why we're segmenting. That's why we're doing what we're doing, never losing sight though. That we're going to have a better product than anybody in the marketplace. The better network and backing it up with better devices, that can eventually -- as we get to multi-gig symmetrical. And that's the key. Every single application ubiquitously delivered, that's our focus. So it's a tough competitive environment but I think we have a unique differentiated approach. Jonathan, Dave. Let me start with the broadband in its entirety, the whole market and a viewpoint. So let me begin with the broadband market as a whole is still growing, maybe at a slower pace than it was last year and the year before, but there's still going to be a pretty healthy amount of net adds in 2024 and likely beyond. The right way, though, in addition to that, I think you got it. Everything we've talked about before, the right way we think to look about it is it's holding our own, growing relationships responsibly, but it's also where the market is going and how broadband is being used. \n And that -- as we've talked about the utility of the broadband product itself is only going up. So when you look at the health of the entire category, it's the relationships, but it's also the overall usage and consumption. And for us, you can see usage is up double digits. Broadband-only subs using over 700 gigabytes of data a month. Over 70% of our subscriber base is on speed tiers of 50 megs or more, nearly 1/3 of our customers are on 1 gig. Those are great trends for us over the long term and gives us the great confidence as we're investing, continuing to invest in a better network and a better customer experience, as Brian has said. \n So when you look at things, I think it's clearly competitive as we've talked about. One other factor that enters into it, in some cases, in certain segments. There are some people that revert back to mobile-only, that can happen. So there's a variety of factors that could enter into it. But overall, as a category and a growth opportunity, quite optimistic about broadband. Yes. Just adding on to that, Jonathan. But again, we've been doing prepaid broadband for a while, years. And it's just we needed to refresh it, needed to update it and put it in a more competitive position. The prepaid mobile is new, and NOW TV is relatively new. But it's a segmented approach. And if you think about -- it's all in pricing, it's very simple. It's really easy. \n There's no contracts, no credit checks, customers can sign up, pause, cancel online, anytime. It's a very straightforward -- but feature-light product as we keep our focus on the high end in terms of fully featured things. We'll continue to do that. But this just gives us a brand, gives us a product suite to be able to clearly and define segmentation in a way that we can manage through."

            "name": "Jason Armstrong",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our consolidated results on Slide 4. Total revenue increased 1% to $30.1 billion. And within this, our 6 major growth drivers generated nearly $17 billion in revenue, well over half of total company revenue and once again have shown steady and consistent growth at a high single-digit rate over the past 12 months. \n While EBITDA was in line with prior year's level at $9.4 billion, we generated a high level of free cash flow this quarter at $4.5 billion, and we returned $3.6 billion of capital to shareholders, including $2.4 billion in share repurchases. And over the last 12 months, we have reduced our share count by nearly 6%, contributing to our adjusted EPS growth in the quarter of 14%. \n Now let's go through our business results, starting on Slide 5 with Connectivity & Platforms. Note that our largest foreign exchange exposure is to the British pound, which was up 4% year-over-year. So as usual, in order to highlight the underlying performance of the Connectivity & Platforms business, I will refer to year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis. \n Revenue for total Connectivity & Platforms was flat at $20.3 billion, reflecting strong growth in connectivity revenues, offset mainly by declines in video revenue. Residential Connectivity revenue grew 7%, driven by 4% growth in domestic broadband, 13% growth in domestic wireless and 19% growth in international connectivity, while Business Services Connectivity revenue grew 5%. \n In domestic broadband, our revenue growth was driven by very strong ARPU, which increased 4.2% and came in a bit above our historical range. Our team is doing an excellent job of customer segmentation while balancing rate and volume. And we are encouraged by the positive consumer behavior trends we see in our base of 32 million customers. \n Bandwidth requirements and engagement are increasing at a rapid clip while the vast majority of our customers are now on speeds of 500 megabits or higher, and adopting advanced tier as a service like xFi complete at a higher rate. But as Mike mentioned, it continues to be a very competitive environment. And we lost 65,000 subscribers in the first quarter, following a loss of 34,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2023. \n As we sit here right now, we do not see this trend improving in the near term. We expect churn could be elevated given the end of ACP, which is only fully funded through April and partially funded through May. We remain in constant communication with our ACP customers and we'll continue to be diligent in helping this customer segment stay connected through various options. Whether that's our successful Internet Essentials program or our new prepaid NOW offerings, as Mike described. \n In addition, I want to remind you that the second quarter also tends to experience seasonal headwinds. While it's a competitive market, especially for the price-driven segment, we will continue to compete aggressively, yet in a financially balanced way and expect to drive healthy broadband revenue growth through growth in ARPU, which we expect to remain well within our historical range of 3% to 4% growth even as we manage through the ACP transition. \n Turning to domestic wireless. Revenue growth of 13% was due to higher service revenue, driven by a 21% year-over-year increase in our customer lines, ending the quarter at $6.9 million in total, including the 289,000 lines we just added in the quarter. We are consistently in the marketplace testing new offers, including some recent pricing plans targeted at multiline customers, the new NOW Mobile product as well as our Buy 1, Get 1 line offer. \n We continue to see significant opportunity in wireless to increase the penetration of our domestic residential broadband customer base, which currently sits at 11% and to sell additional lines per account. International connectivity revenue reflects strong growth in broadband revenue, driven by solid ARPU growth as well as growth in wireless due to additional customer lines and also higher ARPU. \n For business services connectivity, we generated 5% revenue growth driven by higher ARPU in small business and broader growth in both customers and additional solutions for mid-market and enterprise. The SMB market has gotten more competitive but will aggressively defend our position. And similar to this quarter, we'll grow revenue by increasing ARPU, driven by higher adoption of additional products like Mobile, Security Edge, Connection Pro and WiFi Pro and through targeted rate opportunities. \n Meanwhile, our momentum continues to build in mid-market and enterprise as our expanding capabilities in managed services, wide area networking and cybersecurity have led to increasing customer wins and the expansion of existing relationships. \n The strong growth in our Connectivity businesses was offset by a decline in video and other revenue. The decline in our video revenue was driven by continued customer losses and slower domestic ARPU growth versus last year, and the lower Other revenue reflects continued customer losses in wireline voice. As I mentioned earlier, Connectivity & Platforms total EBITDA increased 1.3% with margin of 50 basis points, reflecting a decline in overall expenses driven by the mix shift to our high-margin connectivity businesses, combined with a continued focus on expense management. \n While margins for our domestic legacy cable business improved even more, our international business was impacted by a reclassification of some expense from capitalized software to operating expenses, creating a tough comparison to last year. We will see a similar trend until we start to lap this change at the end of this year. \n I'll note that absent this change, EBITDA growth in the first quarter would have been about 1 point higher, and our margin improvement would have been about 50 basis points higher. While this change increased our operating expenses this quarter, there was an offsetting decline in Connectivity & Platforms capital, resulting in a neutral impact on net cash flow, which was up 5% this quarter. \n Breaking out our Connectivity & Platforms EBITDA results further. Residential EBITDA grew 1.1% with margins improving 60 basis points to 38.3%. And Business Services EBITDA growth was lower than our typical mid-single-digit level at 2.6% with margins declining 160 basis points to 56.7%. These results include significant investments in the enterprise space, including in sales and fulfillment that we are making to drive future revenue growth. Business Services generates well over $5 billion in annual EBITDA, which is margin accretive, and we expect it to continue to be a material contributor to overall connectivity and platforms growth this year and over the longer term. \n Now let's turn to Content & Experiences on Slide 6. Overall, revenue increased 1% to $10.4 billion and EBITDA decreased 7% to $1.5 billion. Let's take a closer look at the details. Starting with Theme Parks. Revenue increased 2%, while EBITDA decreased 4% for the quarter. These results reflect the negative impact of currency as the Japanese yen is at a 34-year low against the dollar. \n Adjusting the results to exclude the impact of foreign currency, Parks' revenue would have increased 5% and EBITDA would have been flat compared to last year's first quarter. We had strong underlying growth at our park in Osaka, which continues to benefit from demand for Super Nintendo World. We're also seeing growth in Hollywood despite lapping the opening of Super Nintendo World in that park during the quarter. \n Beijing results were relatively flat in what is typically a seasonally light quarter, and Orlando results were below last year, but still roughly in line with pre-pandemic levels. We are seeing some pullback from the unprecedented attendance we realized immediately after the pandemic, which we believe is driven by the timing of new attraction openings and some increased competition from other entertainment venues, notably cruises. \n At Media, which includes our TV Networks and Peacock, revenue increased 4% as Peacock's strong growth of 54% more than offset a low single-digit decline at our linear networks. Distribution revenue growth of 7% was driven by Peacock with subscription revenue growth of 68%, powered by the 55% year-over-year increase in our paid subscriber base to 34 million including 3 million net adds in the first quarter. \n We are really pleased with Peacock's trajectory. We started the year with an incredibly successful NFL Wild Card game, which resulted in a nice lift to paid subs. But even more important was how our broad content offering enabled strong consumer acquisition, retention and engagement. We've had success across a broad range of content during the quarter, including films moving into our Pay-One window like Oppenheimer, the most watched Pay-One film in Peacock's history; and The Holdovers, as well as successful originals, including Apples Never Fall, Ted and the second season of The Traitors. \n Looking ahead, we'll continue to be focused on retention, particularly in the second quarter as we look forward to the second half of the year, we will have a substantial amount of acquisition-oriented content lined up. This is consistent with Peacock's historical trends, and this year is expected to be driven by the Olympics this summer and the NFL and Big Ten returning in the fall, in addition to the steady stream of films landing in our Pay-One window as well as upcoming originals. \n Finally, domestic advertising revenue was flat in the quarter, reflecting a stable overall market with strong advertising growth at Peacock, offset by lower advertising revenue at our linear networks. Media EBITDA decreased 6%, reflecting the revenue pressure on our linear networks, partially offset by continued year-over-year improvement in Peacock EBITDA losses even with the addition of the wildcard rights costs. And we expect to see, on average, even better year-over-year improvement for Peacock in the coming quarters. \n At Studios, the revenue decline of 7% reflects lower content licensing, which was impacted by the timing of deliverables related to our film licensing business, which was partially offset by a modest increase in theatrical revenue, driven by the strong performance of Kung Fu Panda 4 at the box office this quarter. Studio's EBITDA declined 12%, reflecting the difficult comparison to last year's film slate, including the highly successful carryover title, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish and the timing of licensing deals at film. \n Now I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 7. As I mentioned previously, we generated $4.5 billion in free cash flow this quarter, and we achieved this even with the significant investments we continue to make to support our growth drivers. Specifically, our $3.3 billion in total capital spending this quarter incorporates our efforts in expanding our footprint and further strengthening our domestic broadband network, scaling our streaming business and supporting the continued build of our Epic Universe Theme Park ahead of its 2025 opening. And working capital was a $940 million drag for the quarter, a significant improvement over last year, a lot of which is timing related. \n Turning to return on capital. For the quarter, we returned a total of $3.6 billion to shareholders, an increase of 13% year-over-year. This includes share repurchases of $2.4 billion and dividend payments of $1.2 billion. Putting it all together in the last 12 months, we've returned over $16 billion in capital to shareholders between share repurchases and dividends, reducing our share count by nearly 6%. \n At the same time, we invested nearly $17 billion back into our businesses in the form of capital and working capital, carefully and consistently balancing reinvesting in our businesses for growth, returning significant capital to shareholders and doing so with a very strong balance sheet, which facilitates this consistency through a variety of operating environments. \n Now let me turn it over to Marci for Q&A. Yes. Great. Thanks. So just to round that out, Ben, just you think your question specifically on ARPU and how do you go through the ACP cycle and have confidence in ARPU growth. I think all these points are relevant and valid. Number one, we continue to see usage grow at a rapid rate. So the value that the consumer is getting is higher. That's a tailwind in general for ARPU growth. I think number two is segmentation that Dave's talked about. We see a lot of competition in a certain segment of our base, the value-conscious segment of our base. The segmentation allows you to keep that from seeping into other segments of the base. And the team has done a nice job executing there. \n Final thing I'd point out is as we said, ACP customers have got about 1.4 million in our base that we'll need to manage through. This is very similar, though, to -- if you think about how this business is wired, Dave and his team, it's promotional roll-offs. This is something we're dealing with every single quarter, how do you navigate a base of customers that's on promotion and roll them into new rate plans and keep them as customers? So this is very much what the Cable business is wired to do. \n On buyback spend, I would go back and over the last few years. We've had a very consistent capital allocation strategy starting with reinvesting in our business, layered into protecting the balance sheet. We really like our current credit rating and have committed to metrics that are associated with the credit rating as you've seen. And as you point out, very strong free cash flow last year and expectation for similar this year. As you mentioned, allows for substantial share repurchase activity. So since we restarted the buyback in 2021, we bought back over 15% of our share count. If you look at the last year, we bought back over 6% of our share count. So both very strong metrics. \n I would point out the tail end of last year, we were pretty clear in the third quarter that we were going to accelerate the buyback, anticipating minimum floor Hulu proceeds, which came in at the very end of last year. And that's in advance of more full proceeds for full value this year, but we did get a minimum floor payment last year and hence, accelerated the buyback in 3Q and 4Q to $3.5 billion. Craig, so on margins, we said overall connectivity and platforms margins were up 50 basis points and said domestic was an even greater increase. The domestic was up 70 basis year-over-year, sort of continuing the formula of a mix shift in our business to higher-margin businesses. Our connectivity businesses are growing faster than our nongrowth video businesses. So that's a margin favorable trade-off for us as we said historically and then operating efficiencies in the business. I think we gave a stat last call that I'd reiterate, we've taken 50% of our truck rolls out of the system in the last 6 years. We've taken 40% of customer interactions out of the system in the last 6 years. So lot of good progress on expense efficiency. But Craig, the domestic margin's up 70 basis points. Yes, John, let me hit domestic or Cable EBITDA, C&P EBITDA over the course of the year. So I think as you mentioned, it's competitive market. We've got ACP coming our way. At the same time, the balance, I think about broadband specifically. The balance between rate and volume we've seen, obviously, a little bit of pressure on volume. But 4.2% ARPU growth in the quarter, an outlook for -- we continue to stay at 3% or 4% during the year. So we still think there's tailwinds for broadband revenue growth. We had 3.9% this quarter. \n We're growing business Services, we're growing Wireless, and we're offsetting video and other revenue declines. But at the total level, that's a margin accretive mix shift. I'd go back to what I've said before on some of the expense initiatives across the company and being very disciplined, taking volumes out of the system and that's providing a tailwind as well. So without giving specific guidance for EBITDA growth, I would give you the components and our confidence in them. Jonathan, let me start on segmentation and Dave probably wants to chime in as well. So on NOW, I think what's interesting and exciting about it is it's a dedicated sort of flanker brand strategy. We've had prepaid offers in the past sort of wedged into our existing portfolio. This is a more dedicated and branded strategy around it. \n By the way, the branding around this has worked very well in our U.K. market for Sky. It's actually where the brand name came from. And so we expect this to have some resonance. I would point out the -- if you look at where it's sort of targeted, we've got 100 meg offer for $30. It's inclusive of taxes, fees and equipment. We've got a $45 offering that's 200 megs and inclusive as well, very competitive versus fixed wireless, right? That is in this range, maybe slightly higher without the same reliability and ubiquity that we have."

            "name": "Michael Cavanagh",
            "content": "Thanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. Across the company, our team is managing extremely well in a highly competitive and evolving marketplace. We have a clear vision for how we are going to compete now and into the future, combined with a sharp focus on execution. Equally important, our disciplined capital allocation strategy, coupled with our strong balance sheet, puts us in an enviable position relative to our peers to invest organically and aggressively in our 6 scaled and diverse growth businesses namely: Residential Broadband, Wireless, Business Services, Theme Parks, Studios and Streaming. These businesses comprise more than 55% of the company's total revenue today, and that proportion will only grow over time. \n In the first quarter, these businesses generated a high single-digit increase in revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. And when combined with our substantial share repurchase activity, enabled us to deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth as well as significant growth in free cash flow per share. In fact, since 2018, we grew adjusted EPS over 50% and free cash flow per share nearly 25%. \n Now for some of the highlights of the first quarter, I'll start with Broadband. The broadband market remains extremely competitive, particularly within the market for more price-conscious consumers. We continue to be intensely focused on segmentation, providing customers with options that meet both their lifestyle and budget. Importantly, we are striking the right balance between ARPU and subscribers, which is clearly reflected in our first quarter results, where despite modest subscriber losses, ARPU grew over 4%, driving mid-single-digit growth in residential broadband revenue to over $6.5 billion. \n We continue to see extremely encouraging broadband consumption trends across our base of 32 million customers. Usage on our network rose double digits year-over-year with broadband-only households consuming over 700 gigabytes of data each month, and our broadband customers continue to value faster speeds. Today, over 70% of our residential subscribers receive speeds of 500 megabits per second or higher and around 1/3 are getting a gig or more. \n We believe that consumers' expectations for their broadband experience in terms of speed, reliability, security and performance will only increase over time. It is extremely important to us that our network upgrades stay well ahead of this demand, our deployment of mid splits doubled year-over-year and now reach 40% of the footprint. The investments we are making to increase capacity and incorporate multi-gigabit symmetrical speeds everywhere we offer service put us in a great position to capitalize on these very favorable consumer trends. And when combined with our rapid footprint expansion, set us up to gain market share and return to broadband subscriber growth over time. \n Turning to wireless. We increased our domestic customer lines by 21% year-over-year to nearly $7 million, yet with wireless penetration of our residential broadband customer base still only 11%, we have plenty of room to grow. We continue to see the benefit of bundling broadband and mobile, which decreases churn and improves customer lifetime value. Our customers also benefit by being connected to our WiFi network, which is the largest in the nation. In fact, 90% of all Xfinity Mobile traffic is delivered over WiFi, not cellular, and we are constantly adding new features to further differentiate the experience. The most recent example is our introduction of WiFi Boost, which enables any Xfinity Mobile customer to experience speeds of up to 1 gig whenever they connect to our 23 million hotspots at no additional cost. \n Across our Connectivity & Platforms business, we're focused on profitably serving each segment of the market from our premium and traditional customers who want fully featured products to more price-driven consumers. With regard to the latter, we are introducing NOW, a new brand and product portfolio targeting the prepaid market that delivers high-quality, low-cost Internet, mobile and streaming TV products with simple all-in pricing. \n NOW Internet and mobile will be particularly helpful to those Americans impacted by the end of ACP, bringing them another option for affordable, reliable connectivity and supplementing our Internet Essentials program, which we offer to eligible households as part of our long-standing commitment to help close the digital divide in America. \n Turning to Content & Experiences. Let's start with parks. We continue to see strong underlying demand in both Hollywood and Japan, where healthy attendance and per cap levels were once again driven by the success of Super Nintendo World. Building on our momentum, later this year, we're opening our newest Nintendo-themed land, Donkey Kong Country, which will increase the size of Super Nintendo World in Japan by 70%. \n Switching gears to Orlando. We started to feel some pressure on attendance levels late in the first quarter, which tends to occur in tandem with the ebbs and flows of new attractions in the market. Right now, we happen to be lapping the multiyear surge in attendance from our opening of new attractions in prior periods, but we remain confident about our longer-term growth opportunities, especially as we look ahead to next year with the opening of Epic Universe. With 3 new hotels and 5 immersive worlds featuring more than 50 attractions, entertainment, dining and shopping experiences, it will be the most technologically advanced park in the world. Together with our 3 current gates in Orlando, Epic will enable us to offer a full week's vacation experience to even more guests. \n Moving to Studios. We're incredibly proud of our film team and our recent ranking as the #1 global studio by worldwide box office and winner of Academy Awards, including Best Picture for Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer. On the back of our fantastic performance in 2023, the power of our studios continued this quarter with the theatrical release of Kung Fu Panda 4, which has grossed over $480 million in worldwide box office to date. And we have an exciting slate still ahead. For the third year in a row, we'll release more movies than any other major studio with The Fall Guy, an action thriller starring Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt coming this May; Despicable Me 4, Illumination's newest installment of this highest grossing animated franchise as well as our adaptation of Twisters, both debuting in July; and Wicked, one of the most highly anticipated movies of 2024 coming in November. \n Finally in media. We are successfully managing the segment as one business across linear and streaming, by providing the tens of millions of traditional pay TV subscribers as well as streamers with choice in how they engage with us, we continue to generate significant audience for our programming. Big events like the Olympics, Sunday Night Football, Big Ten; top entertainment shows like Saturday Night Live and Law & Order, with strong consumer demand for our content, we're well positioned to evolve with the changing market. \n Our exclusively streamed NFL Wild Card game was a big success this past quarter. We added and then retained even more new Peacock subscribers than we expected. Overall, people are staying with us to engage in a broad range of content, spending 90% of their time on the platform viewing nonsports programming. This includes scripted shows like Ted and reality shows like The Traitors, both of which ranked within Nielsen's streaming top 10. And our award-winning collection of films like Oppenheimer, which premiered exclusively on Peacock in February and was the most watched film across all streaming in its first 7 days on the platform. \n Clearly, Peacock has been on a great trajectory since our launch 4 years ago, where 34 million paid subscribers having grown 12 million year-over-year and at a $10 ARPU. Looking ahead, our content offering provides such a great value proposition that we should have some real pricing power over time. \n Of course, sports also play an important role in our media business, and that's especially true this year. Following the Kentucky Derby in May, we'll have the Paris Olympics for 17 nights this summer. With more programming hours on the NBC Broadcast Network than any previous Olympics and over 5,000 hours of live coverage on Peacock, the games are on track to generate the most advertising revenue in history with $1.2 billion in ad sales commitments. \n Right after the Olympics, we have the return of football with Big Ten, Sunday Night Football and the NFL's first-ever Friday night opening game from Sa\u0303o Paulo, streaming exclusively on Peacock. \n So wrapping up, I'm really proud of the work that our teams across the company are doing. Together, we're executing at the highest level and positioning ourselves for growth in a challenging and dynamic marketplace. So Jason, over to you. And Ben, I'll just come in on the back of the question about any changes in how we think about capital allocation. I think Jason and team are carrying on a phenomenal tradition. I've been here now close to 10 years. And I think the idea of taking our well-generated capital across our businesses, and first and foremost, investing them back in the business with a very long-term view of what the future can be, where there's expected return. Whether that's the Parks business, whether that's the broadband network, whether that's streaming, whether it's just broad innovation. \n I think it's in our DNA at this place to try to figure out ways to invest wisely for the future, while at the same time, maintaining a very strong balance sheet and we like the way the balance sheet is set up. When you go through these long  arcs of change across industries with disruption, it allows you to sleep better at night knowing the strength of balance sheet we have and allows us to continue making those earlier investments. And then so to do those 2 things together with the very substantial interest on the part of the management team and the facts that we've done it to just get lots of capital return to shareholders. Not many companies are inclined to manage those 3 priorities as much as we are. And I can commit that that's where our head is as we look forward to the next 10 years ahead. Jessica, it's Mike. So on parks, as we've said, this is a year in 2024, where CapEx in parks and at NBCUniversal overall will sustain at the level it was in '23. So it remain elevated. In '25, when we open Epic, it will begin to step down. And then after that, it will return to a more normal level with adjustments for the Hollywood Hard Nights and the Kids park in Frisco, Texas that we've talked about. But those, as we've said, are not of the same size and scale as a large park like Epic but we do have a bigger footprint of parks than we did, say, 5 years ago. \n So you're right, part of the part of the capital equation for parks is to continue to invest in new attractions within existing parks. So again, once we get to '26, you'll see us easing into a new steady state that does include continued experimentation with some of our alternative concepts. And then certainly, we hope over the longer term to come up with some ideas for bigger deployments of capital, but that's what we have in our plans as we sit here right now. But we love the business. \n And to the question of returns, we think the returns are very strong. We take a careful look at that every time we're greenlighting a new park. And I think we like the stability of the long-term nature of the return. It's us and one other great company that are world leaders in that level of park experience. The response to our parks has been phenomenal coming out of COVID. And so we see that being a place, live entertainment at the level we're talking about, being just a strong pillar of the media and entertainment side of the company for a long time ahead. \n And then in terms of other areas. I think the success that we've had across parks and experiences are -- lead us to plenty of opportunities to think about gaming and other areas around live entertainment that go around and cross between our businesses. So we experiment with things and we look, and it's our job to see if there are great opportunities to do that, but nothing to report today. And so on Peacock. I mean we're very pleased as we split -- both Jason and I said earlier, with a quarter where we ended at 33.5 million subs, 3.5 years in. We are at a place now where we really are seeing traction in our approach to providing a service for consumers that is a combination of both entertainment and sports and how those 2 go together. \n Very much a reflection, as we said from the beginning, of our -- a mirror image of what we see as our strengths at NBCUniversal itself. And so when you look at this quarter in particular, you end up with a start with a Wild Card game that brought in a tremendous number of subs ahead of where we expected it to be. And then retention, that was ahead of where we expected it to be. And so that's obviously great and the power of sports to bring audiences together and will stay committed because of our strength in sports. \n But when you really reflect on what then happened in the weeks that followed our viewing was the record highs across all parts of our non-sports portfolio. And in fact in the quarter, we launched our biggest original, Ted, to the greatest success of any of the originals we've ever launched. And Traitors 2, our reality series on Peacock, both of those were in the Nielsen Top 10 streaming in the earlier part of the year. \n So I think we see the 2 -- the parts of the portfolio interplaying well with each other. And obviously, the strength of our movie studio, which we talked about earlier with Oppenheimer and Holdovers and now coming up in future quarters, Kung Fu Panda 4. That is another great source of strength into our portfolio. So I think you can expect to see us having a very broad approach to it' sports, it' originals, it' next-day airing of NBC content, it's our library, and it's our Pay-1 movies. All those things going into a service that we think is one of the best values in streaming and a very distinct place over time in the streaming marketplace for consumers. \n And when you look ahead from where we started the year, we are now in continue to focus hard on retaining the growth in subs we had. Second quarter will be a little lighter in terms of the cadence of our content. But when you look to the middle of the year, we've got Olympics. Right after that, we've got the return of NFL, Big Ten and our exclusive NFL game in Sa\u0303o Paulo, Brazil, along with the tremendous movie slate: Fall Guy, Twisters, Despicable Me 4, in addition to Kung Fu Panda 4. \n And so we feel great about what we're doing and the progress we're making, and it's very consistent with the way we've described Peacock as taking advantage of what makes us great at NBCUniversal to begin with, and taking our existing strengths and assets into a digital future. So that's -- and it's one of our 6 big growth drivers, so glad to get a chance to comment on it."
