[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Nate Stubbs, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nNate Stubbs: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us this afternoon to discuss the results of Vivint Smart Home for the three months and fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. Joining me on the conference call this afternoon are Todd Pedersen, Vivint's CEO; and Dale Gerard, Vivint's CFO. I would like to begin by reminding everyone that the discussion today may contain forward-looking statements, including with regards to the company's future performance and prospects. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and are not guarantees of performance. And you should not put undue reliance on these statements. I would direct your attention to the risk factors detailed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2020, which we expect to file within a few days of this earnings call. Please be aware that these risk factors may be updated from time to time in the company's periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and that the realization of any such risk factors could affect our future results and could cause those results or other outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In today's remarks, we will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures for historical periods to the most comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are available in the earnings release and accompanying presentation, which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. I will now turn the call over to Todd.\nTodd Pedersen: Thanks, Nate, and good afternoon to everyone joining the call. I'll start by recapping our terrific results for the fourth quarter and full year. Along with some of the key drivers of that performance, then I'll spend some time outlining some of our future priorities, sharing more of our vision for the smart home and why we think we have unique capabilities to deliver that vision as the premier end-to-end smart home platform company. Starting with the key financial highlights of the business, we had a strong finish to what was a very successful year for Vivint and our first year as a public company. Fourth quarter revenue grew by more than 8% to approximately $333 million. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $147 million up over 17% from the prior year and producing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 44% in the quarter. For the full year, Vivint grew total revenue by over 9% to $1.26 billion and adjusted EBITDA grew by 40% or $589 million. We originated over 343,000 new smart homes subscribers in this past year which was an acceleration from the previous year and the highest we've ever achieved in a year. As of December 31, Vivint had approximately 1.7 million total subscribers, up more than 9% versus the prior year. Dale will provide more specifics on the financials during his remarks, as well as share our outlook for 2021. But I do think it's important to provide some additional context to put our performance in perspective. The fact that we turned in such strong result emits the unprecedented challenges related to COVID-19 pandemic is nothing short are remarkable. We've certainly seen a lot in the 20 years since I founded the company and we performed well through the past economic downturns. But 2020 was altogether different and the challenges we dealt with in maintaining our sales and exceptional customer service, while protecting our employees and customers were profound. Some of these headwinds were self-imposed such as our decision to essentially eliminate retail installment contracts as one of our financing options as well as stopping direct-to-home sales in Canada. But what we could not have foreseen was, having to move our call centers and corporate employees to a work from home environment, and pulling our entire direct-to-home sales team out of their markets, delaying the start of the summer selling season for six weeks during the first wave of the pandemic. Despite all of this we were able to substantially beat our initial guidance for total subscribers and adjusted EBITDA, this attributable to the fact that we were well-positioned as a business heading into the pandemic both operationally and financially. We believe our cloud-based operating platform and the Vivint user experience are better today than ever before. The end-to-end Vivint platform is driven by AI and machine learning. So it's continuously getting smarter and improving. And because each smart home is installed professionally by us, it ensures that those systems work as designed, delivering a delightful and transformational smart home experience to our customers. We believe we have been able to drive significant improvements in our customer experience as well as overall profitability and cash flow. Thanks to our strategic focus in three primary areas. First transforming net service costs through our vertically integrated business model. Second, bringing down net subscriber acquisition costs through Flex Pay and third, scaling overall G&A expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. As a final reflection on 2020, while we were fortunate that we were able to adjust our process to deal with the most challenging sales climate we've ever seen, we're still seeing the impact of COVID-19 on our business in terms of restrictions in certain markets. Additionally, our unaided brand awareness is in the low-single digits. We began the process of fixing that late last year, investing to drive better consumer awareness of the brand on a national scale. Those investments will continue as we tell the story of who we are, what we do and how we can add value to people, delivering the security and peace of mind they desire. But beyond the brand, we also think that now it\u2019s the time to step things up in terms of overall vision to continue pushing new boundaries and delivering transformative smart home experience to every home. Vivint as an end-to-end smart home platform company with the most robust service offering, our vision is to extend the reach of the smart home experience well beyond where it is today by delivering additional services to the home, bridging even further to a truly autonomous home. Our smart home operating system processes over 1.4 billion daily events. And our proprietary platform collects and controls a massive amount of relevant data delivered through the Vivint devices in the home. There are many logical extensions of our end-to-end platform, including insurance, energy management, aging in place, in home healthcare, pet monitoring services, home inventory replenishment and deliberately home maintenance and repair. These initiatives are completely within our wheelhouse, in large part because we have built a platform that allows us to expand the many services homeowners\u2019 wants. Our expertise has always been in redefining the home experience by delivering intelligently designed cloud-enabled solutions directly to every home. Our proprietary cloud-based smart home operating system, along with our well-trained team of smart home professionals makes it possible to create a completely customized smart home. Today we have over 20 million connected devices on the Vivint platform. And we believe the data collected from those devices puts us in a very unique position to deliver many of the additional services I just mentioned. From the very beginning, we are focused on building products and services that are comprehensive, easy-to-use and affordable for the mass market. Delivering a truly integrated smart home experience requires unique proprietary technology. The expertise to customize and install smart devices in a customer's home and importantly, the ability to provide services through the entire lifecycle of the customer via call center professionals or in-home support. That is why our nationwide workforce of over 10,000 dedicated smart home employees is such a critical differentiator to the Vivint model. We took hold of our first-mover opportunity in this emerging category many years ago. And we believe we remain the leader, while others are busy trying to bundle together multiple apps, hardware sets and interactions across different providers. We're focused on extending the lead we feel we enjoy. I will now turn the call over to Dale to go through the specifics of our fourth quarter and full year results, as well as to provide our initial outlook for 2021.\nDale Gerard: Thanks Todd, I'll walk through the financial portion of the presentation that we posted today in conjunction with our earnings release. First on Slide 6, we highlighted a few data points for the subscriber portfolio, which were strong across the board. Despite the economic and social challenges that existed in 2020, total subscribers grew from 1.55 million to 1.70 million or 9.2%. And total monthly revenue grew by 8% year-over-year. On Slide 7, we highlighted the revenue for the fourth quarter and the full year. Fourth quarter revenue grew by 8% to $332.5 million, while revenue for the full year grew by 9.1% to $1.26 billion. The revenue growth was mainly attributable to the aforementioned increase in total subscribers and total monthly revenue. Moving to Slide 8, adjusted EBITDA scaled nicely for both the fourth quarter and the full year. The primary drivers were lower expense, subscriber acquisition costs and scaling of service costs and G&A. For the year, we are proud to have increased adjusted EBITDA margins by another 1,000 basis points to 46.7% of revenue compared to 36.5% in 2019. While we feel we responded well to the challenges brought on by the pandemic, seamlessly transitioned thousands of customer service and corporate employees to our work from home environment. We had already implemented cost reductions even before the full impact of COVID-19 was felt. These actions put the company in a better position as the pandemic gripped the world. On Slide 9, we highlight a few metrics on new subscribers. New subscriber originations were 58,554 for the fourth quarter and 343,434 for the year. Both figures reflect outstanding results from our national inside sales channel and a strong second half of the year from our direct-to-home sales channel, following the multiple week delay at the start of the summer sales season caused by the pandemic. New subscribers grew by 27.7% in the quarter versus the prior year period and for the year we grew new subscribers by more than 8.5%. Furthermore, we reduced the number of Retail Installment Contracts or RICs by 85%. As mentioned on previous calls this has affected our new subscriber growth. But by shifting a greater proportion of our subscribers away from RICs and towards our financing partners, and pay-in-full arrangements, we have increased the cash collected at the point of sale thus reducing our net subscriber acquisition costs and improving our cash flow dynamics. Moving on to the right-hand side of Slide 10, our net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber for the year was $139 versus $1,018 in the prior year period, an 86.3% improvement, as we increased our upfront pricing for the purchase and installation of equipment and nearly eliminated the number of new subscribers that were financed via RICs. On the left-hand side of Slide 10, the improvement in the net service cost per subscriber had a major impact on our earnings for the fiscal year 2020. Our net service cost per subscriber declined from $13.73 in 2019 to $10.50 this past year. The solid improvement is due to the work of Vivint\u2019s vertically integrated smart home platform, which encompasses the software, the hardware, the installation and ongoing customer support. As we continue to make improvements in all of these areas, we're seeing continued positive trends in both customer satisfaction and the cost of service. The result is that our net service margins continued its upper trend moving from 73.8% in 2019 to 78.9% in 2020, the provided net service cost explains a large portion of the improvement in adjusted EBITDA that I cited earlier. It's worth mentioning that service costs were somewhat muted during the year as homeowners either delayed service calls or elected and solved the issues over the phone because of COVID related concerns. Additionally, we saw higher service revenue during the year from upgrades and moves, which had a positive impact on the net service cost metric. We would also note that service margins dipped a bit in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter as expected. Based on how we generally put our new customers particularly in the summer, we tend to see service costs increase in the latter part of the year. Slide 11 depicts our typical subscriber walk, illustrates the changes in total subscribers at year end. One of the areas we were concerned about as the pandemic took hold was its potential impact on the performance of our portfolio. And we were presumably surprised to see our attrition improve year-over-year ending at 12.4%, which was 150 basis points lower year-over-year and an eight quarter low. As we have started 2021, our portfolio continues to perform better than expected in terms of attrition and other leading indicators. While we are very happy with the year-over-year growth in new subscribers, total subscribers, revenue and adjusted EBITDA. The $448 million turnaround in cash flow from operations is our biggest accomplishment in 2020. We stated that our goal was to get the cash flow neutral in 2020, but with the change in upfront pricing reduction of retail installment contracts and improving operating metrics, we will able to generate $226.7 million in net cash flow from operating activities compared to the use of $221.6 million in 2019. We finished 2020 with the very strong liquidity position of approximately $648 million, including $313.8 million of cash on hand. During the quarter we saw approximately 4.1 million warrants exercised, which also had a positive impact on our cash position and increased our public flow as well. Finally moving to our financial outlook for the upcoming year on Slide 12, the fundamental characteristics of our financial model remain highly attractive, particularly in the contractual reoccurring revenue that provides long-term visibility and predictability to our business. We have several initiatives in 2021 that we believe will continue to feel our leadership position in smart home. In terms of guidance for 2021, we expect to end the year with approximately 1.80 million to 1.85 million total subscribers, full-year revenue between $1.38 billion and $1.42 billion and adjusted EBITDA between $640 million and $655 million. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from the line of Paul Coster of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nPaul Coster: Yes, thanks very much for taking my question. Let me start with the outlook for the year ahead. You're talking of some new initiatives in the prepared remarks, the written document Todd sort of points towards something that it sounds like you are expanding the scope of your offering. So brand and scope somewhat, they may be the same to the 2021. Could you comment please?\nTodd Pedersen: Yes, sure. As we had talked about \u2013 and by the way thanks for joining Paul, as we had talked about last year, if we had a clear insight into the fact that we'd be cash flow positive, we were going to start testing some branding exercises. I think we've said this before. We have less than 5% brand awareness in the United States and we're a company with 1.7 million subscribers and literally no brand awareness. So there is massive upside for our company to put ourselves out there in the market with the special operating we have with the fully-integrated professionally installed and serviced smart home offering. So we're really excited about it. We actually started doing that in Q3. Our actual \u2013 we're not going to talk about the exact specifics. We spent less than 10 million on brand in Q4 last year and this year it's going to be somewhat less than 30 million in brand spend. We have a positive enough result, even better than we have expected. From a response perspective, all of these things do take years-and-years to mature and gain momentum but very excited about that. And then the second part of that question is, we're a company that we own our own platform. I think everyone here knows that. And so we developed our platform out, our operating system out, somewhat like it was like eight years ago. So we think that doubling down and enhancing and improving that and kind of revamping that is important with some of the IT and technical tools for on-boarding customers and underwriting. So there's some investment happening on that side of the company. And then we're going to further explore some of the initiatives we have around insurance that we've talked about and then some additional investments in aging in place and the potential that's coming without question for our company, because of our position in the home, the number of devices the amount of data. And kind of figuring out how to approach that market to massive margin, it requires physically installed piece of hardware to collect the right pieces of micro data in a home, which we have in our house. So we have multiple initiatives like that and so there is some spend happening in those areas. And we're really making sure that as a company we're being thoughtful around the future of the company, how we're positioned, taking best advantage of the fact that we've got with this proprietary operating platform with lots of customers growing long life cycle of the customer. So we're actually really excited about it.\nPaul Coster: You thanked me for joining the call. I got to tell you it's such a delight joining your call. So it just seems so exciting to me. So it's good to be here. Although a more sobering subject, you have filed the shell. And I think those of us who are looking at the stock rather than the business are a little bit irritated by that, we feel like there's an overhang not just fact but we were anticipating a refinancing of the debt. When are these things going to get done? When are you going to issue the equity or sell to \u2013 do the follow-on? And when are you going to refinance?\nDale Gerard: Yes, well, hey, this is Dale. Welcome to the bar. I think just to maybe state why we did the shell or what we did here, in connection with the Mosaic transaction that we completed last January, obviously January 2020, certain number of our shareholders or stockholders were granted registration rights, requiring the company to put up shell for registration that would cover those shares. Due to the fact that we were a stack or a shell company or a blank check, however you want to think about, probably emerging with it, we were not eligible S-3 eligible, so just recently and had to fulfill those registration requirements by filing an S-1 shell. As soon as we become or became S-3 eligible we decided to file universal shell on form S-3 to cover those existing shares, registration rights, as well as registration of some additional securities for potential offering directly in the future. At this time we have no present attention to immediately conduct any offering, so to that shell, the purpose itself was to provide flexibility. So that's kind of what we're thinking and unfortunately that's probably the best I can give you at this at this point.\nTodd Pedersen: It's not imminent, but we're prepared \u2013 the markets we\u2019re in, there's a need for the company to do that, then we can take advantage, so it's more preparation. As far as refinancing the debt, paying down some debt and those are still in consideration. I mean, obviously the debt markets are strong. I think we're now well-positioned from the financial perspective operationally and otherwise to go and execute on that. And so that's coming.\nPaul Coster: So I guess I'm sort of seeing your comments on the shell just to mean that those with big stakes in the companies still are in the name after all these years, aren't necessarily are keen to sell at this price level. Is that a true statement?\nTodd Pedersen: Yes, I mean, I can't speak for the major shareholders. I mean, there were some lockup periods that part of the agreement were six and 12 and some are 24 months based on some of the shareholders that they came in through back. So I can't really speak to whether\u2026\nDale Gerard: And look Paul, I can say this, I mean from a liquidity perspective, we wouldn't \u2013 we're open to that if they would like to sell down at some point, because we need more to put into stock. We all know that, so that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing. They haven't run to the markets to do a big block trade or anything like that, we all know this. But there is a point in time, in an appropriate sell-down over time would be beneficial to the overall company and the share price and allow more people get into this name. So we're kind of relaxed about that a little bit and they're going to make the decision as they go about, I happened to be a major shareholder and I'm not one of those.\nPaul Coster: Right. Got it. Okay. The last question is the key performance metrics have improved dramatically this last year. As we sort of roll into 2021, the macro numbers are now perhaps more of the focus than the key performance metrics. Because it seems to me like some of the \u2013 there's going to be attenuating improvements at this point, it is difficult for you to keep that rate of improvement going over the result?\nDale Gerard: Yes. So let me tell you the thing that we're \u2013 and I've mentioned this in some of the investments that we're making into the company, the platform, the technical tools that we use to onboard customers in the field over the phone, serve our service platform. Again, it's all proprietary to both. We invest in those because this is what we know. The demand is high, even with all of the things that we changed last year. I mean, remember we eliminated new business in Canada. We eliminated RICs, kind of April timeframe stopped onboarding RICs other than an occasional RIC with system outages. So we're anticipating RICs would be 1% of our business this year. And then we put the direct-to-home program on pause for six straight weeks and then did a slow roll out. And so even with that, we get the numbers we did, there's demand for our products and services. And the more we get our name out and tell our story that we're going to start seeing better and improved top line revenue growth and sub-growth we're confident in that. So part of that invest into the platform to make sure that we can do that and handle that growth and deliver in a way that's kind of magical to consumer. So we're kind of doing some things in preparation of seeing some positive results on the branding side of the exercise of that. Some of the new \u2013 we have some new initiatives that we're doing around just testing out new ways to enter into the market or get into a home and expand in the home. So we have a lot of things, we are really excited that we're doing, we feel positive about and we figured out a lead to know better macro numbers. And then obviously we're always focused on what are the key things in the business like attrition and net service margin and all of those things, which kind of hard to improve, too much on all those very kind of knock those out of the park. But we're thinking about the whole thing all the time, Paul.\nPaul Coster: Got it. Thank you so much.\nTodd Pedersen: Thank you, Paul.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRK Raghunathan Kamesh: Hi. This is RK on behalf of Rod. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the nice results. I was wondering if you could compare and contrast your paid-in-full contracts, versus your bank financed contracts, any differences you'd call out in terms of proceeds at point of sale or attrition or anything else?\nDale Gerard: Yes, I mean, \u2013 Hey RK, thanks for joining the call. Hope you and Rod are doing great. What I would say is, what we see normally on pay-in-full, a lot of times those are customers again that maybe don't qualify for financing, for example. So they still want to get on the platform. They still want to get the services that we offer, but maybe they're not able to take three cameras and two door locks and so they're taking a smaller system. So you're looking on average those are going to probably $1,000 or -ish upfront versus somebody that takes the complete system, 15, 16 devices, six or seven, what I would call smart devices, so those are outdoor cameras, doorbell cameras, cross-over views, door locks access those types of packages. Those are going to be in the $2,500 to $2,600 upfront, so that's kind of how to think about the difference there. And again, the consumer financing that's free for any financing fees, right, so, we do pay financing fees with [indiscernible] do pay those over time or we pay those upfront as their loans grow. So on average, you're seeing that call it $2,500 ish range on a super finance pay-in-full call it $1,000 or something.\nRK Raghunathan Kamesh: It's super helpful, Dale. Thank you and they're doing well. As a follow-up what's the sustainable level for net service costs and margins and what's included in your 2021 outlook?\nDale Gerard: Yes. So I'd say, we've said this all along. We had a couple of quarters, if you think about Q2, Q3, where and we called this out on all these calls saying, hey, we had a lot \u2013 we had fewer service tickets into the home, which is a big part of that service costs. As COVID was really taking hold, a lot of people didn't want people coming into their homes and so we were trying to take care of that most of them at phone. And so we've said, those service costs in those quarters were probably abnormally lower than what they would have been. I think we see service costs, what I would say in the margin range. We've said that probably in the 73% to 75% margin rate, service margin is kind of where we think were normalized service levels in terms of the service we're providing the customers and then the service requirements are what we're pulling in from customers in terms, either calls coming into our call centers or requiring us to actually go roll a truck out to their home, to fix up that we couldn't fix. By the way we fix 85% to 90% of those, those issues that come in from a customer we're able to do over the phone, because of our technology platform that we have. But that's kind of so long and short of the answer is probably that mid-70% range in terms of service margins.\nTodd Pedersen: One thing I'll say, and may be this is for the future, this is not going to be 2021 impact, but there's going to be a cost factor there in investment. We see some more opportunities and we're constantly doing this because we own the hardware stack, the platform, the installation capability. We're always making improvements to the software and firmware. And then we see gains on connectivity and usability, and reliability of our system and our offering. We were going to be investing even more because of the AI and machine learning into more self-healing capabilities, more awareness around what's happening down to the unit basis on the hardware that we've installed inside of the home. And so we believe there's improvements and better economics to come. Just Dale made the point that its two quarters were kind of abnormally low, even though if you look at kind of on a trend basis over the past four years, when we came to \u2013 we came down from the mid-$18 per month level, down into what somewhere in the $11\u2019s is kind of a normalized number. So we're very confident that that trend can continue over time. Now, there are things that need to be done and we're making investments in those. And part of it is, when we come out with a new hub or a new camera or new doorbell camera or the devices, they get better and better about staying connected and being reliable, which reduces inbound calls, technical support, truck rolls and such. So this is something we're constantly focused on.\nRK Raghunathan Kamesh: Makes very much sense. Thanks guys and good luck.\nTodd Pedersen: Thank you.\nDale Gerard: Thanks RK.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Erik Woodring of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErik Woodring: Hey guys. Congrats on the quarter, I wanted to ask kind of a high level strategy question and then a finance question. So just to start high level, obviously then last nine months have been pretty unprecedented in many ways. Just curious, Todd and Dale from each of your perspectives and what were some of the lessons that you learned this year about your business and what of that can you apply to the business going forward to make it more efficient, make it more cost effective? Just anything you can speak to that and I have follow-up.\nTodd Pedersen: So I think this, that I haven't heard that question. You're towards a great question. We had to transition, one thing we learned about the organization is we have the ability with great speed and efficiency to change on a dime. I mean, we like other companies we went from working in the office to work from home and had to change the whole dynamic of how we operate and took care of our customers, which by the way that's the most important thing. It's quality of service delivery or we are customer\u2019s hand. And we as an organization made that happen very, very quickly with very little disruption and making sure that our employees were safe and protected same as consumers. Now the one thing and you saw \u2013 I mean, if anyone's noticed this, but our cash flow turnaround from 2020 to 2021 \u2013 from 2019 to 2020 staggering. In part of that was just deficiencies and spend, less travel, less general spend with some budgetary items that we went through and said, hey, look this isn't driving revenue per se. We thought it might and it's not, let's get rid of that. So we had become more efficient in the dollars that we're spending. And I think as a group \u2013 as a leadership group we've got a great cadence in making sure that those don't creep back in. So just making sure that we're improving with the dollars that are coming through and making sure that they're redeployed in a way that actually adds benefit and grows value to the business or delivers better service to the consumer or develops new product or services they're going to want. So look, I can say this organization, I'm so proud of what happened, how we responded to the year in every way form and fashion. And the most important is we didn't let our customers down and then the demand grew and intensified. And those are the ways you win in a consumer facing space as you deliver on what you say, you're going to deliver on, when you're going to \u2013 when you say you're going to deliver on that, because that the word spreads, we haven't had brand awareness. So it's consumer awareness to build relationships. So that's what I would say.\nErik Woodring: Okay. That's awesome. That's really helpful. I guess maybe a relevant question then to touch on would just be on the cost side of things, clearly you saw a pretty sizeable uptick in costs in the fourth quarter, you mentioned brand awareness was less than $10 million. Can you just walk through kind of what drove the growth and costs in the fourth quarter? How much of that was kind of temporary or one-time versus permanent and then how to think about that into 2021? Thanks.\nDale Gerard: Yes. Good question. So, again as Todd said, there was brand spending in the fourth quarter, which we didn't have year-over-year. I think the other thing is, we extended \u2013 we were able to extend our direct-to-home program out into the early part of the fourth quarter, which we've never done before, so we have costs associated with that, that we wouldn't have had frankly in the past. So those are kind of the two big drivers of it. And then you did start seeing, again this is really part of the normal process of our service costs as we kind of \u2013 as we normally we'd put in accounts in Q2 Q3, and you'd start seeing a lot of Q3 going into Q4 and see service costs kind of come up because you have, that first 90 days after sales come in, you have some more calls come in, some of it is education, some of it's of helping people get the system set the way they want it set. Sometimes it requires truck rolls back up to the homes. And we started seeing some of that in the fourth quarter. Again, that's normal. We expected that in our numbers, but that's kind of how w3e see it. Thinking about \u2013 just to be kind of, as you think about 2021, it's going to be there'll be some odd kind of work year-over-year comparisons. Because again Q2 of 2020, we didn't start \u2013 really didn't even start direct-to-home April first part of May, we were shutdown really. So you didn't have any costs associated with that and it's popped up. We then coming out of April, we didn't know what the pandemic looked like, we didn't know how it is going to impact the business. So we scaled back and kind of cost. And our employees luckily allowed us to do something that we had to be stopped 401(k) paybacks for example. We didn't get merit for a period of time. We were able as the business went along and got into the fourth quarter, we actually reinstated merits. We actually did some study, reinstated 401(k) and some stuff around that. So we see all of those cost come back in the fourth quarter. That would've normally been there until Q2 and run rate out. But we're excited we put out the numbers that we put out in terms of our guidance. We're excited about, again as Todd said, really staying focused on those key metrics and really evaluating how do we spend our dollars. Travel was one, for example, not to pick on the travel, the travel is one it's like, do we need to travel as much to go see, partners separately, can we do that over Zoom, I mean, it's worked, it worked for nine months and we've done and the results are saying. So there's some of that we'll bring back in, but I think some of this Zoom and some of the other types of way to connect with our partners and our teams, we'll continue to do going forward for a period of time. Maybe broader, I mean, it's kind of part of the new branding.\nErik Woodring: That's really helpful if I could, if I could just sneak a last one in here, just in terms of your guidance, it looks like you're implying that you should get annual growth around like 3% next year. Just curious from your perspective or can you help contextualize, why we should expect that to grow? Is that implying new services? I understand you might not be able to tell us some of that, but just why we should think about that growing the way that you've got next year?\nDale Gerard: Yes. So let me tell you, what's interesting. Thanks for pointing that out. I don't want to, there's no nothing to be alarmed about with this, but we actually think it could be better. We're trying to be a bit cautious because the supply chain, like everyone else that manufactures products overseas there's concern around supply chain, we're good with the plan we have and we're showing you right here. But the demand for our products and services, cameras, doorbell cameras, they're not \u2013 we have homed 16 cameras in the map, that five years ago they didn't even want camera. And the way we are just connected and how they deploy and how people interact with them and the amount of interaction, I mean on this call, 124,000 live video views are going to happen in our customer base during this call. So the demand is so high, we believe it could have been better. We're working on trying to speed things up from a supply chain perspective. We don't think it's going to disrupt our plan at all, because we've planned quite a bit in advance to make sure we can hit this, but we think there's even. And we would have said few years ago, there wasn't much upside for that to increase. Now we're seeing the opposite. The demand for additional and more hardware professionally installed is increasing substantially. So we're excited about that. We're feeling like that, that's conservative because of the supply chain issue, not demand.\nErik Woodring: Awesome. Super helpful. Thank you guys. Congrats again.\nTodd Pedersen: Thank you.\nDale Gerard: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question. Come from Kunal Madhukar of Deutsche Bank, please go ahead.\nKunal Madhukar: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. A couple of I got, one on the subscribers and the outlook there, given the acceleration that you have seen throughout 2020 in the national inside sales and the fact that, hopefully by the time we get into the actual selling season, you'll probably be able to deploy a lot more sales guys into the direct-to-home. Why shouldn't be the subscriber count end up at more than 10% growth on a year-over-year basis in 2021? And then I've a question on branding and brand spent, given the approved financial metrics and the profitability and the cash flow profitability of business, why aren't you spending more?\nTodd Pedersen: Those are great \u2013 both of those are great questions. Here's what I would say on the direct-to-home program. We're still in the middle of this pandemic. We are being cautious about over hiring, I don't, if you remember that last year, we had a lot more people hired than we actually deployed. Put on pause, there were people that were concerned about going into the neighborhoods, in homes, or even on people's front porches to do consultative sales. The ones that did, we did it with all the safety concerns in mind and protocols. And we did all the proper measures to make sure that they were healthy, but \u2013 and we had a lot of success, but we're still, if we over hire and something, another disruption that happens, it's just very expensive. So we're trying to be not cautious, but just be balanced in our approach with the direct-to-home. And then from an inside sales perspective, it's still growing scam. We are wanting to prove out to ourselves and we think we have somewhat that it's just been a quarter, that the brand spend that we're doing in the specific areas, we're doing really are going to produce the results that all of our shareholders are going to appreciate. And that's \u2013 really what that means is it's going to lead to subscriber growth. We feel that's the case. We actually believe it or we\u2019re in, and we\u2019d say it\u2019s good enough, it probably warrants spending more than 30 million this year, but we're going to reserve the right to do that if we choose throughout the year, if we continue to improve. But for now, we're kind of saying somewhat less than 30 million is a modest amount to spend. But I would suspect you'd see over time, if they continue to show the results are showing that that will increase over the next few years.\nDale Gerard: I'd say this \u2013 I\u2019d add one additional point this describes is that, for attrition we finished 12.4% in 2020. Again, we're putting some caution into those numbers and maybe attrition is \u2013 maybe it's in the high-12% maybe even low-13%, but again, we're \u2013 there's a lot of unknowns out there, like still how are the economy is going to evolve, how they can impact the actual consumers. I mean, if there's more government stimulus checks put into the market, how does that impact our customers it seems like it was very good, our customers were in terms of how they performed in 2020. But again, so we're just kind of being taken what we know today in terms of what we see out there. Again, as Todd said around the sales side and then in terms of customer portfolio performance and trying to put out a number that we thing is reasonable.\nTodd Pedersen: And these things are all things that have to work in constantly, let\u2019s take this is what we know the product and services in the way we deliver them and how magical it is. It's going to gain momentum. We're perfectly suited for this environment. This new environment of working from home, some people back at the office, some that's kind of back and forth, even though with food delivery, DoorDash had more packaged delivery. We're like \u2013 we're perfectly suited for this new home environment. And we can take care of consumers in a very special way. So we're excited about the future. We have that opportunity to have a position to do that.\nKunal Madhukar: Thank you.\nTodd Pedersen: Thanks, Kunal.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Jeff Kessler of Imperial Capital. Please go ahead.\nJeff Kessler: Thank you. Hey, Todd? Hey Dale, how are you doing?\nTodd Pedersen: Hey Jeff, how are you?\nDale Gerard: Doing great.\nJeff Kessler: Okay. Sitting at home. I obviously have a lot of questions I'll hit you later on when I get you back. If we take this down to the street level so to speak or to the actual customer where your rubber meets the road, can you talk a little bit about, number one, what you do \u2013 what you've done, that's different now in the onboarding process and also in terms of relating to that net service cost, what are you doing in terms of \u2013 in terms of servicing the customer, both of which are showing up in the metrics, but in the real world, I need to know kind of what's changed over the last year?\nTodd Pedersen: Well, I think the simple fact is this. We own our whole technology stack. We're including sales, installation, monitoring, ongoing service, technical support, the entire feedback loop we own. It's proprietary to build it. Now obviously we will integrate with best-in-class products Google Device or an Amazon device, but we own the technology stack. And so we have the ability to have this incredible quick feedback loop. If a new product or a piece of hardware is causing more cause into the customer care or technical support department or causing more truckloads, we troubleshoot, we can troubleshoot quickly. It's our innovation center. It's our software and firmware engineers. It's our product designers. So this is \u2013 we've said this, and it's now proving to be not just true, but incredibly relevant to this business. And it's not just the margins. It's the consumer experience that's most important. If our service cost has come down with the \u2013 more it's 15 devices in a home, seven of them are smart home devices. These are door window sensors and to keep all in the glass break. Not that we don't have them, but these are really robust systems. I mentioned earlier, I just saw a guy today, 16 cameras at his home on the Vivint platform. He came and showed me, it's like \u2013 this is your company is so cool. Every single one of these are online. He had our system several years ago, four or five years ago when we were first coming out with extra cameras. And they would go offline sometimes. But we've troubleshooted, do all of these things I've talked about to make sure that experience is incredible. By the way drives down calls and service costs. So we think we're going to still continue to see gains from that respect. And when you say from an on-boarding perspective, what's your specific question?\nJeff Kessler: The first \u2013 those first conversations in those first couple of several weeks where the customer may have had problems, or may be more expensive to bring that customer on to get them up and ready, particularly if they're taking on a bunch of technology where they've been sold on 14 or 15 different items and being taught how to do it. How do you make sure that customer is satisfied a month or two later?\nTodd Pedersen: Well, again, this is right back to the same thing. A 100% of our installs are done by our employees. They use our technical tools to do the installation. We have these health metrics with our, we call it the tech teams, our proprietary platform for installation, service and sale, all combined up into our call center and customer service center and ultra \u2013 that's all the data we can track on a real-time basis. I don't know of anyone else that can do that in this space. I'm confident they can't. And so it's \u2013 we just have these huge advantages in the market they're going to continue to prove themselves out more and more as we go on and the space gets more robust and deeper into the home with products and services, which is happening that's we all know that\u2019s happening. And so it's \u2013 this is many, many years in the making. We didn't just decide to do this recently, or because someone else is doing it, this is a decision \u2013 we've made decisions over 20 years to invest in ensuring that the quality of service and the reliability and the magical experience is there. And it has to happen at the point of install. We walk away and things don't work well, that's a bad experience, and it's a cost center, and both of those are bad. And so we're getting better and better, better at those. Not that it's almost impossible to be perfect with technology and lots of devices that are connected wirelessly, but we're pretty darn good at it and getting better and I can assure you that over the next year and years. We have plans to continue to burn down those issues, eliminate them and make them our strong suits. So we're just getting started.\nJeff Kessler: But my follow-up is probably directed \u2013 actually probably directed toward Albany, the \u2013 below the cash flow from operations line to get down to what would be \u2013 what some of us would call just pure unadulterated, unfettered free cash flow. What are some of the subtractions that if we're trying to figure that out, we would have to be making \u2013 are you different in any other way than other companies?\nTodd Pedersen: Not I'm aware of that. I'm glad that I can take a look. I don't have all that bottoming air, but glad to catch up offline we can walk you through that. We'll be final it in day or two. So all of our financials will be out there within the next day or so.\nDale Gerard: Cash from operating activities was, I mean, we just and we knew we were going to, by the way, we knew we were going to deal on all things, but we've had tremendous improvements operationally, financially, and that it was on purpose. None of it happened on accident and we're hyper focused on how we operate this business. We want to be known as great operators, not just from a financial metric perspective, but toward consumers, because that's going to be, that is one of the key differentiators. We have professional installed fully on proprietary smart home platform. And that's going to lead to the future of our business, which is what a true smart home is going to be, which is the entrance into the home to what we're doing is going to provide lots of outlets into services and technologies that we're going to be able to provide for consumers. We've got to be great at the first part, just as maintaining these hardware devices having them be stable, reliable, elegant, great experience, low issues, and then we're doing that.\nJeff Kessler: All right. Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Todd Morgan of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nTodd Morgan: Thanks. Good evening, lots of information here. Just one thing that kind of I see is the branding efforts you've talked about. I mean, you've been very passionate about sort of the technology and the experience that you're offering folks yet. When I look at the ads, I kind of see two things and maybe I'm not seeing all the ads, but I see Snoop Dogg explaining, how easy to do it for me, installation model works. And I see the more traditional ads talking about doorbell cameras scaring way package dealers, and so on. Those were different messages than what you've just spent the last period here telling us about, I'm just curious as to kind of how you got to that kind of an advertising message. And is that something that you would expect to evolve even in 2021 or so? Thanks.\nTodd Pedersen: No, I mean, look, I will here's what I'd say. There's no \u2013 there are no company that's done branding enters in and can tell the entire story with their first entrance into the space. That's just not possible. So we just wanted to say, hey, here we are. This is Vivint. We actually have something that's cool. That's professionally installed. You don't need to worry about it. But I can assure you that, we will continue to tell our story over time and that's going to be something that evolves. We want to make sure it resonates with customers and it doesn't overwhelm them also. A lot of people don't realize that they can get 15, 20, 30, 50 devices installed their home profession at a very, very reasonable price. And to just put that out there, like I say might just have someone tune out a little bit because they would think, well, that's, even though we're saying it, let's say on an advertising campaign, they may not believe it like that, that can't be affordable. So it's just \u2013 here we are, this is simple. Just give us a try little doorbell, put that on there. And then we're pretty good at sales and upsells, and so we can upsell them into a full system. And so you'll see it evolve all the time. We're just the response and how simplistic and it was on purpose. The initial entrance was we had a tremendous response.\nTodd Morgan: No. Okay, great. Well, that's good to hear and great quarter and thanks a lot.\nTodd Pedersen: Thank you.\nOperator: And that's all the time, we have allotted for questions today. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Todd Pedersen for closing remarks.\nTodd Pedersen: So we appreciate everyone being on the call and via webcast. Again, we want to make sure everyone knows that we're super focused on just making sure that we deliver on what we say we're going to. We think the future is super bright. There's a bit everyone on the phone knows this. It's a big industry, lot of opportunity, and we are best suited to take advantage of that because of this, the ecosystem we've built out technologically our 12,000 employees that are taking care of our customers and expanding our reach throughout North America. So again, we appreciate you all paying attention to us and to invest in this panel. So and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Todd Pedersen",
            "content": "Thanks, Nate, and good afternoon to everyone joining the call. I'll start by recapping our terrific results for the fourth quarter and full year. Along with some of the key drivers of that performance, then I'll spend some time outlining some of our future priorities, sharing more of our vision for the smart home and why we think we have unique capabilities to deliver that vision as the premier end-to-end smart home platform company. Starting with the key financial highlights of the business, we had a strong finish to what was a very successful year for Vivint and our first year as a public company. Fourth quarter revenue grew by more than 8% to approximately $333 million. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $147 million up over 17% from the prior year and producing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 44% in the quarter. For the full year, Vivint grew total revenue by over 9% to $1.26 billion and adjusted EBITDA grew by 40% or $589 million. We originated over 343,000 new smart homes subscribers in this past year which was an acceleration from the previous year and the highest we've ever achieved in a year. As of December 31, Vivint had approximately 1.7 million total subscribers, up more than 9% versus the prior year. Dale will provide more specifics on the financials during his remarks, as well as share our outlook for 2021. But I do think it's important to provide some additional context to put our performance in perspective. The fact that we turned in such strong result emits the unprecedented challenges related to COVID-19 pandemic is nothing short are remarkable. We've certainly seen a lot in the 20 years since I founded the company and we performed well through the past economic downturns. But 2020 was altogether different and the challenges we dealt with in maintaining our sales and exceptional customer service, while protecting our employees and customers were profound. Some of these headwinds were self-imposed such as our decision to essentially eliminate retail installment contracts as one of our financing options as well as stopping direct-to-home sales in Canada. But what we could not have foreseen was, having to move our call centers and corporate employees to a work from home environment, and pulling our entire direct-to-home sales team out of their markets, delaying the start of the summer selling season for six weeks during the first wave of the pandemic. Despite all of this we were able to substantially beat our initial guidance for total subscribers and adjusted EBITDA, this attributable to the fact that we were well-positioned as a business heading into the pandemic both operationally and financially. We believe our cloud-based operating platform and the Vivint user experience are better today than ever before. The end-to-end Vivint platform is driven by AI and machine learning. So it's continuously getting smarter and improving. And because each smart home is installed professionally by us, it ensures that those systems work as designed, delivering a delightful and transformational smart home experience to our customers. We believe we have been able to drive significant improvements in our customer experience as well as overall profitability and cash flow. Thanks to our strategic focus in three primary areas. First transforming net service costs through our vertically integrated business model. Second, bringing down net subscriber acquisition costs through Flex Pay and third, scaling overall G&A expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. As a final reflection on 2020, while we were fortunate that we were able to adjust our process to deal with the most challenging sales climate we've ever seen, we're still seeing the impact of COVID-19 on our business in terms of restrictions in certain markets. Additionally, our unaided brand awareness is in the low-single digits. We began the process of fixing that late last year, investing to drive better consumer awareness of the brand on a national scale. Those investments will continue as we tell the story of who we are, what we do and how we can add value to people, delivering the security and peace of mind they desire. But beyond the brand, we also think that now it's the time to step things up in terms of overall vision to continue pushing new boundaries and delivering transformative smart home experience to every home. Vivint as an end-to-end smart home platform company with the most robust service offering, our vision is to extend the reach of the smart home experience well beyond where it is today by delivering additional services to the home, bridging even further to a truly autonomous home. Our smart home operating system processes over 1.4 billion daily events. And our proprietary platform collects and controls a massive amount of relevant data delivered through the Vivint devices in the home. There are many logical extensions of our end-to-end platform, including insurance, energy management, aging in place, in home healthcare, pet monitoring services, home inventory replenishment and deliberately home maintenance and repair. These initiatives are completely within our wheelhouse, in large part because we have built a platform that allows us to expand the many services homeowners' wants. Our expertise has always been in redefining the home experience by delivering intelligently designed cloud-enabled solutions directly to every home. Our proprietary cloud-based smart home operating system, along with our well-trained team of smart home professionals makes it possible to create a completely customized smart home. Today we have over 20 million connected devices on the Vivint platform. And we believe the data collected from those devices puts us in a very unique position to deliver many of the additional services I just mentioned. From the very beginning, we are focused on building products and services that are comprehensive, easy-to-use and affordable for the mass market. Delivering a truly integrated smart home experience requires unique proprietary technology. The expertise to customize and install smart devices in a customer's home and importantly, the ability to provide services through the entire lifecycle of the customer via call center professionals or in-home support. That is why our nationwide workforce of over 10,000 dedicated smart home employees is such a critical differentiator to the Vivint model. We took hold of our first-mover opportunity in this emerging category many years ago. And we believe we remain the leader, while others are busy trying to bundle together multiple apps, hardware sets and interactions across different providers. We're focused on extending the lead we feel we enjoy. I will now turn the call over to Dale to go through the specifics of our fourth quarter and full year results, as well as to provide our initial outlook for 2021. Yes, sure. As we had talked about \u2013 and by the way thanks for joining Paul, as we had talked about last year, if we had a clear insight into the fact that we'd be cash flow positive, we were going to start testing some branding exercises. I think we've said this before. We have less than 5% brand awareness in the United States and we're a company with 1.7 million subscribers and literally no brand awareness. So there is massive upside for our company to put ourselves out there in the market with the special operating we have with the fully-integrated professionally installed and serviced smart home offering. So we're really excited about it. We actually started doing that in Q3. Our actual \u2013 we're not going to talk about the exact specifics. We spent less than 10 million on brand in Q4 last year and this year it's going to be somewhat less than 30 million in brand spend. We have a positive enough result, even better than we have expected. From a response perspective, all of these things do take years-and-years to mature and gain momentum but very excited about that. And then the second part of that question is, we're a company that we own our own platform. I think everyone here knows that. And so we developed our platform out, our operating system out, somewhat like it was like eight years ago. So we think that doubling down and enhancing and improving that and kind of revamping that is important with some of the IT and technical tools for on-boarding customers and underwriting. So there's some investment happening on that side of the company. And then we're going to further explore some of the initiatives we have around insurance that we've talked about and then some additional investments in aging in place and the potential that's coming without question for our company, because of our position in the home, the number of devices the amount of data. And kind of figuring out how to approach that market to massive margin, it requires physically installed piece of hardware to collect the right pieces of micro data in a home, which we have in our house. So we have multiple initiatives like that and so there is some spend happening in those areas. And we're really making sure that as a company we're being thoughtful around the future of the company, how we're positioned, taking best advantage of the fact that we've got with this proprietary operating platform with lots of customers growing long life cycle of the customer. So we're actually really excited about it. It's not imminent, but we're prepared \u2013 the markets we're in, there's a need for the company to do that, then we can take advantage, so it's more preparation. As far as refinancing the debt, paying down some debt and those are still in consideration. I mean, obviously the debt markets are strong. I think we're now well-positioned from the financial perspective operationally and otherwise to go and execute on that. And so that's coming. Yes, I mean, I can't speak for the major shareholders. I mean, there were some lockup periods that part of the agreement were six and 12 and some are 24 months based on some of the shareholders that they came in through back. So I can't really speak to whether... Thank you, Paul. One thing I'll say, and may be this is for the future, this is not going to be 2021 impact, but there's going to be a cost factor there in investment. We see some more opportunities and we're constantly doing this because we own the hardware stack, the platform, the installation capability. We're always making improvements to the software and firmware. And then we see gains on connectivity and usability, and reliability of our system and our offering. We were going to be investing even more because of the AI and machine learning into more self-healing capabilities, more awareness around what's happening down to the unit basis on the hardware that we've installed inside of the home. And so we believe there's improvements and better economics to come. Just Dale made the point that its two quarters were kind of abnormally low, even though if you look at kind of on a trend basis over the past four years, when we came to \u2013 we came down from the mid-$18 per month level, down into what somewhere in the $11's is kind of a normalized number. So we're very confident that that trend can continue over time. Now, there are things that need to be done and we're making investments in those. And part of it is, when we come out with a new hub or a new camera or new doorbell camera or the devices, they get better and better about staying connected and being reliable, which reduces inbound calls, technical support, truck rolls and such. So this is something we're constantly focused on. Thank you. So I think this, that I haven't heard that question. You're towards a great question. We had to transition, one thing we learned about the organization is we have the ability with great speed and efficiency to change on a dime. I mean, we like other companies we went from working in the office to work from home and had to change the whole dynamic of how we operate and took care of our customers, which by the way that's the most important thing. It's quality of service delivery or we are customer's hand. And we as an organization made that happen very, very quickly with very little disruption and making sure that our employees were safe and protected same as consumers. Now the one thing and you saw \u2013 I mean, if anyone's noticed this, but our cash flow turnaround from 2020 to 2021 \u2013 from 2019 to 2020 staggering. In part of that was just deficiencies and spend, less travel, less general spend with some budgetary items that we went through and said, hey, look this isn't driving revenue per se. We thought it might and it's not, let's get rid of that. So we had become more efficient in the dollars that we're spending. And I think as a group \u2013 as a leadership group we've got a great cadence in making sure that those don't creep back in. So just making sure that we're improving with the dollars that are coming through and making sure that they're redeployed in a way that actually adds benefit and grows value to the business or delivers better service to the consumer or develops new product or services they're going to want. So look, I can say this organization, I'm so proud of what happened, how we responded to the year in every way form and fashion. And the most important is we didn't let our customers down and then the demand grew and intensified. And those are the ways you win in a consumer facing space as you deliver on what you say, you're going to deliver on, when you're going to \u2013 when you say you're going to deliver on that, because that the word spreads, we haven't had brand awareness. So it's consumer awareness to build relationships. So that's what I would say. Thank you. Those are great \u2013 both of those are great questions. Here's what I would say on the direct-to-home program. We're still in the middle of this pandemic. We are being cautious about over hiring, I don't, if you remember that last year, we had a lot more people hired than we actually deployed. Put on pause, there were people that were concerned about going into the neighborhoods, in homes, or even on people's front porches to do consultative sales. The ones that did, we did it with all the safety concerns in mind and protocols. And we did all the proper measures to make sure that they were healthy, but \u2013 and we had a lot of success, but we're still, if we over hire and something, another disruption that happens, it's just very expensive. So we're trying to be not cautious, but just be balanced in our approach with the direct-to-home. And then from an inside sales perspective, it's still growing scam. We are wanting to prove out to ourselves and we think we have somewhat that it's just been a quarter, that the brand spend that we're doing in the specific areas, we're doing really are going to produce the results that all of our shareholders are going to appreciate. And that's \u2013 really what that means is it's going to lead to subscriber growth. We feel that's the case. We actually believe it or we're in, and we'd say it's good enough, it probably warrants spending more than 30 million this year, but we're going to reserve the right to do that if we choose throughout the year, if we continue to improve. But for now, we're kind of saying somewhat less than 30 million is a modest amount to spend. But I would suspect you'd see over time, if they continue to show the results are showing that that will increase over the next few years. And these things are all things that have to work in constantly, let's take this is what we know the product and services in the way we deliver them and how magical it is. It's going to gain momentum. We're perfectly suited for this environment. This new environment of working from home, some people back at the office, some that's kind of back and forth, even though with food delivery, DoorDash had more packaged delivery. We're like \u2013 we're perfectly suited for this new home environment. And we can take care of consumers in a very special way. So we're excited about the future. We have that opportunity to have a position to do that. Thanks, Kunal. Hey Jeff, how are you? Well, I think the simple fact is this. We own our whole technology stack. We're including sales, installation, monitoring, ongoing service, technical support, the entire feedback loop we own. It's proprietary to build it. Now obviously we will integrate with best-in-class products Google Device or an Amazon device, but we own the technology stack. And so we have the ability to have this incredible quick feedback loop. If a new product or a piece of hardware is causing more cause into the customer care or technical support department or causing more truckloads, we troubleshoot, we can troubleshoot quickly. It's our innovation center. It's our software and firmware engineers. It's our product designers. So this is \u2013 we've said this, and it's now proving to be not just true, but incredibly relevant to this business. And it's not just the margins. It's the consumer experience that's most important. If our service cost has come down with the \u2013 more it's 15 devices in a home, seven of them are smart home devices. These are door window sensors and to keep all in the glass break. Not that we don't have them, but these are really robust systems. I mentioned earlier, I just saw a guy today, 16 cameras at his home on the Vivint platform. He came and showed me, it's like \u2013 this is your company is so cool. Every single one of these are online. He had our system several years ago, four or five years ago when we were first coming out with extra cameras. And they would go offline sometimes. But we've troubleshooted, do all of these things I've talked about to make sure that experience is incredible. By the way drives down calls and service costs. So we think we're going to still continue to see gains from that respect. And when you say from an on-boarding perspective, what's your specific question? Well, again, this is right back to the same thing. A 100% of our installs are done by our employees. They use our technical tools to do the installation. We have these health metrics with our, we call it the tech teams, our proprietary platform for installation, service and sale, all combined up into our call center and customer service center and ultra \u2013 that's all the data we can track on a real-time basis. I don't know of anyone else that can do that in this space. I'm confident they can't. And so it's \u2013 we just have these huge advantages in the market they're going to continue to prove themselves out more and more as we go on and the space gets more robust and deeper into the home with products and services, which is happening that's we all know that's happening. And so it's \u2013 this is many, many years in the making. We didn't just decide to do this recently, or because someone else is doing it, this is a decision \u2013 we've made decisions over 20 years to invest in ensuring that the quality of service and the reliability and the magical experience is there. And it has to happen at the point of install. We walk away and things don't work well, that's a bad experience, and it's a cost center, and both of those are bad. And so we're getting better and better, better at those. Not that it's almost impossible to be perfect with technology and lots of devices that are connected wirelessly, but we're pretty darn good at it and getting better and I can assure you that over the next year and years. We have plans to continue to burn down those issues, eliminate them and make them our strong suits. So we're just getting started. Not I'm aware of that. I'm glad that I can take a look. I don't have all that bottoming air, but glad to catch up offline we can walk you through that. We'll be final it in day or two. So all of our financials will be out there within the next day or so. No, I mean, look, I will here's what I'd say. There's no \u2013 there are no company that's done branding enters in and can tell the entire story with their first entrance into the space. That's just not possible. So we just wanted to say, hey, here we are. This is Vivint. We actually have something that's cool. That's professionally installed. You don't need to worry about it. But I can assure you that, we will continue to tell our story over time and that's going to be something that evolves. We want to make sure it resonates with customers and it doesn't overwhelm them also. A lot of people don't realize that they can get 15, 20, 30, 50 devices installed their home profession at a very, very reasonable price. And to just put that out there, like I say might just have someone tune out a little bit because they would think, well, that's, even though we're saying it, let's say on an advertising campaign, they may not believe it like that, that can't be affordable. So it's just \u2013 here we are, this is simple. Just give us a try little doorbell, put that on there. And then we're pretty good at sales and upsells, and so we can upsell them into a full system. And so you'll see it evolve all the time. We're just the response and how simplistic and it was on purpose. The initial entrance was we had a tremendous response. Thank you. So we appreciate everyone being on the call and via webcast. Again, we want to make sure everyone knows that we're super focused on just making sure that we deliver on what we say we're going to. We think the future is super bright. There's a bit everyone on the phone knows this. It's a big industry, lot of opportunity, and we are best suited to take advantage of that because of this, the ecosystem we've built out technologically our 12,000 employees that are taking care of our customers and expanding our reach throughout North America. So again, we appreciate you all paying attention to us and to invest in this panel. So and we look forward to talking to you next quarter."

            "content": "Thanks Todd, I'll walk through the financial portion of the presentation that we posted today in conjunction with our earnings release. First on Slide 6, we highlighted a few data points for the subscriber portfolio, which were strong across the board. Despite the economic and social challenges that existed in 2020, total subscribers grew from 1.55 million to 1.70 million or 9.2%. And total monthly revenue grew by 8% year-over-year. On Slide 7, we highlighted the revenue for the fourth quarter and the full year. Fourth quarter revenue grew by 8% to $332.5 million, while revenue for the full year grew by 9.1% to $1.26 billion. The revenue growth was mainly attributable to the aforementioned increase in total subscribers and total monthly revenue. Moving to Slide 8, adjusted EBITDA scaled nicely for both the fourth quarter and the full year. The primary drivers were lower expense, subscriber acquisition costs and scaling of service costs and G&A. For the year, we are proud to have increased adjusted EBITDA margins by another 1,000 basis points to 46.7% of revenue compared to 36.5% in 2019. While we feel we responded well to the challenges brought on by the pandemic, seamlessly transitioned thousands of customer service and corporate employees to our work from home environment. We had already implemented cost reductions even before the full impact of COVID-19 was felt. These actions put the company in a better position as the pandemic gripped the world. On Slide 9, we highlight a few metrics on new subscribers. New subscriber originations were 58,554 for the fourth quarter and 343,434 for the year. Both figures reflect outstanding results from our national inside sales channel and a strong second half of the year from our direct-to-home sales channel, following the multiple week delay at the start of the summer sales season caused by the pandemic. New subscribers grew by 27.7% in the quarter versus the prior year period and for the year we grew new subscribers by more than 8.5%. Furthermore, we reduced the number of Retail Installment Contracts or RICs by 85%. As mentioned on previous calls this has affected our new subscriber growth. But by shifting a greater proportion of our subscribers away from RICs and towards our financing partners, and pay-in-full arrangements, we have increased the cash collected at the point of sale thus reducing our net subscriber acquisition costs and improving our cash flow dynamics. Moving on to the right-hand side of Slide 10, our net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber for the year was $139 versus $1,018 in the prior year period, an 86.3% improvement, as we increased our upfront pricing for the purchase and installation of equipment and nearly eliminated the number of new subscribers that were financed via RICs. On the left-hand side of Slide 10, the improvement in the net service cost per subscriber had a major impact on our earnings for the fiscal year 2020. Our net service cost per subscriber declined from $13.73 in 2019 to $10.50 this past year. The solid improvement is due to the work of Vivint's vertically integrated smart home platform, which encompasses the software, the hardware, the installation and ongoing customer support. As we continue to make improvements in all of these areas, we're seeing continued positive trends in both customer satisfaction and the cost of service. The result is that our net service margins continued its upper trend moving from 73.8% in 2019 to 78.9% in 2020, the provided net service cost explains a large portion of the improvement in adjusted EBITDA that I cited earlier. It's worth mentioning that service costs were somewhat muted during the year as homeowners either delayed service calls or elected and solved the issues over the phone because of COVID related concerns. Additionally, we saw higher service revenue during the year from upgrades and moves, which had a positive impact on the net service cost metric. We would also note that service margins dipped a bit in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter as expected. Based on how we generally put our new customers particularly in the summer, we tend to see service costs increase in the latter part of the year. Slide 11 depicts our typical subscriber walk, illustrates the changes in total subscribers at year end. One of the areas we were concerned about as the pandemic took hold was its potential impact on the performance of our portfolio. And we were presumably surprised to see our attrition improve year-over-year ending at 12.4%, which was 150 basis points lower year-over-year and an eight quarter low. As we have started 2021, our portfolio continues to perform better than expected in terms of attrition and other leading indicators. While we are very happy with the year-over-year growth in new subscribers, total subscribers, revenue and adjusted EBITDA. The $448 million turnaround in cash flow from operations is our biggest accomplishment in 2020. We stated that our goal was to get the cash flow neutral in 2020, but with the change in upfront pricing reduction of retail installment contracts and improving operating metrics, we will able to generate $226.7 million in net cash flow from operating activities compared to the use of $221.6 million in 2019. We finished 2020 with the very strong liquidity position of approximately $648 million, including $313.8 million of cash on hand. During the quarter we saw approximately 4.1 million warrants exercised, which also had a positive impact on our cash position and increased our public flow as well. Finally moving to our financial outlook for the upcoming year on Slide 12, the fundamental characteristics of our financial model remain highly attractive, particularly in the contractual reoccurring revenue that provides long-term visibility and predictability to our business. We have several initiatives in 2021 that we believe will continue to feel our leadership position in smart home. In terms of guidance for 2021, we expect to end the year with approximately 1.80 million to 1.85 million total subscribers, full-year revenue between $1.38 billion and $1.42 billion and adjusted EBITDA between $640 million and $655 million. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line for Q&A. Yes, well, hey, this is Dale. Welcome to the bar. I think just to maybe state why we did the shell or what we did here, in connection with the Mosaic transaction that we completed last January, obviously January 2020, certain number of our shareholders or stockholders were granted registration rights, requiring the company to put up shell for registration that would cover those shares. Due to the fact that we were a stack or a shell company or a blank check, however you want to think about, probably emerging with it, we were not eligible S-3 eligible, so just recently and had to fulfill those registration requirements by filing an S-1 shell. As soon as we become or became S-3 eligible we decided to file universal shell on form S-3 to cover those existing shares, registration rights, as well as registration of some additional securities for potential offering directly in the future. At this time we have no present attention to immediately conduct any offering, so to that shell, the purpose itself was to provide flexibility. So that's kind of what we're thinking and unfortunately that's probably the best I can give you at this at this point. And look Paul, I can say this, I mean from a liquidity perspective, we wouldn't \u2013 we're open to that if they would like to sell down at some point, because we need more to put into stock. We all know that, so that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing. They haven't run to the markets to do a big block trade or anything like that, we all know this. But there is a point in time, in an appropriate sell-down over time would be beneficial to the overall company and the share price and allow more people get into this name. So we're kind of relaxed about that a little bit and they're going to make the decision as they go about, I happened to be a major shareholder and I'm not one of those. Yes. So let me tell you the thing that we're \u2013 and I've mentioned this in some of the investments that we're making into the company, the platform, the technical tools that we use to onboard customers in the field over the phone, serve our service platform. Again, it's all proprietary to both. We invest in those because this is what we know. The demand is high, even with all of the things that we changed last year. I mean, remember we eliminated new business in Canada. We eliminated RICs, kind of April timeframe stopped onboarding RICs other than an occasional RIC with system outages. So we're anticipating RICs would be 1% of our business this year. And then we put the direct-to-home program on pause for six straight weeks and then did a slow roll out. And so even with that, we get the numbers we did, there's demand for our products and services. And the more we get our name out and tell our story that we're going to start seeing better and improved top line revenue growth and sub-growth we're confident in that. So part of that invest into the platform to make sure that we can do that and handle that growth and deliver in a way that's kind of magical to consumer. So we're kind of doing some things in preparation of seeing some positive results on the branding side of the exercise of that. Some of the new \u2013 we have some new initiatives that we're doing around just testing out new ways to enter into the market or get into a home and expand in the home. So we have a lot of things, we are really excited that we're doing, we feel positive about and we figured out a lead to know better macro numbers. And then obviously we're always focused on what are the key things in the business like attrition and net service margin and all of those things, which kind of hard to improve, too much on all those very kind of knock those out of the park. But we're thinking about the whole thing all the time, Paul. Yes, I mean, \u2013 Hey RK, thanks for joining the call. Hope you and Rod are doing great. What I would say is, what we see normally on pay-in-full, a lot of times those are customers again that maybe don't qualify for financing, for example. So they still want to get on the platform. They still want to get the services that we offer, but maybe they're not able to take three cameras and two door locks and so they're taking a smaller system. So you're looking on average those are going to probably $1,000 or -ish upfront versus somebody that takes the complete system, 15, 16 devices, six or seven, what I would call smart devices, so those are outdoor cameras, doorbell cameras, cross-over views, door locks access those types of packages. Those are going to be in the $2,500 to $2,600 upfront, so that's kind of how to think about the difference there. And again, the consumer financing that's free for any financing fees, right, so, we do pay financing fees with [indiscernible] do pay those over time or we pay those upfront as their loans grow. So on average, you're seeing that call it $2,500 ish range on a super finance pay-in-full call it $1,000 or something. Yes. So I'd say, we've said this all along. We had a couple of quarters, if you think about Q2, Q3, where and we called this out on all these calls saying, hey, we had a lot \u2013 we had fewer service tickets into the home, which is a big part of that service costs. As COVID was really taking hold, a lot of people didn't want people coming into their homes and so we were trying to take care of that most of them at phone. And so we've said, those service costs in those quarters were probably abnormally lower than what they would have been. I think we see service costs, what I would say in the margin range. We've said that probably in the 73% to 75% margin rate, service margin is kind of where we think were normalized service levels in terms of the service we're providing the customers and then the service requirements are what we're pulling in from customers in terms, either calls coming into our call centers or requiring us to actually go roll a truck out to their home, to fix up that we couldn't fix. By the way we fix 85% to 90% of those, those issues that come in from a customer we're able to do over the phone, because of our technology platform that we have. But that's kind of so long and short of the answer is probably that mid-70% range in terms of service margins. Thanks RK. Yes. Good question. So, again as Todd said, there was brand spending in the fourth quarter, which we didn't have year-over-year. I think the other thing is, we extended \u2013 we were able to extend our direct-to-home program out into the early part of the fourth quarter, which we've never done before, so we have costs associated with that, that we wouldn't have had frankly in the past. So those are kind of the two big drivers of it. And then you did start seeing, again this is really part of the normal process of our service costs as we kind of \u2013 as we normally we'd put in accounts in Q2 Q3, and you'd start seeing a lot of Q3 going into Q4 and see service costs kind of come up because you have, that first 90 days after sales come in, you have some more calls come in, some of it is education, some of it's of helping people get the system set the way they want it set. Sometimes it requires truck rolls back up to the homes. And we started seeing some of that in the fourth quarter. Again, that's normal. We expected that in our numbers, but that's kind of how w3e see it. Thinking about \u2013 just to be kind of, as you think about 2021, it's going to be there'll be some odd kind of work year-over-year comparisons. Because again Q2 of 2020, we didn't start \u2013 really didn't even start direct-to-home April first part of May, we were shutdown really. So you didn't have any costs associated with that and it's popped up. We then coming out of April, we didn't know what the pandemic looked like, we didn't know how it is going to impact the business. So we scaled back and kind of cost. And our employees luckily allowed us to do something that we had to be stopped 401(k) paybacks for example. We didn't get merit for a period of time. We were able as the business went along and got into the fourth quarter, we actually reinstated merits. We actually did some study, reinstated 401(k) and some stuff around that. So we see all of those cost come back in the fourth quarter. That would've normally been there until Q2 and run rate out. But we're excited we put out the numbers that we put out in terms of our guidance. We're excited about, again as Todd said, really staying focused on those key metrics and really evaluating how do we spend our dollars. Travel was one, for example, not to pick on the travel, the travel is one it's like, do we need to travel as much to go see, partners separately, can we do that over Zoom, I mean, it's worked, it worked for nine months and we've done and the results are saying. So there's some of that we'll bring back in, but I think some of this Zoom and some of the other types of way to connect with our partners and our teams, we'll continue to do going forward for a period of time. Maybe broader, I mean, it's kind of part of the new branding. Yes. So let me tell you, what's interesting. Thanks for pointing that out. I don't want to, there's no nothing to be alarmed about with this, but we actually think it could be better. We're trying to be a bit cautious because the supply chain, like everyone else that manufactures products overseas there's concern around supply chain, we're good with the plan we have and we're showing you right here. But the demand for our products and services, cameras, doorbell cameras, they're not \u2013 we have homed 16 cameras in the map, that five years ago they didn't even want camera. And the way we are just connected and how they deploy and how people interact with them and the amount of interaction, I mean on this call, 124,000 live video views are going to happen in our customer base during this call. So the demand is so high, we believe it could have been better. We're working on trying to speed things up from a supply chain perspective. We don't think it's going to disrupt our plan at all, because we've planned quite a bit in advance to make sure we can hit this, but we think there's even. And we would have said few years ago, there wasn't much upside for that to increase. Now we're seeing the opposite. The demand for additional and more hardware professionally installed is increasing substantially. So we're excited about that. We're feeling like that, that's conservative because of the supply chain issue, not demand. Thank you. I'd say this \u2013 I'd add one additional point this describes is that, for attrition we finished 12.4% in 2020. Again, we're putting some caution into those numbers and maybe attrition is \u2013 maybe it's in the high-12% maybe even low-13%, but again, we're \u2013 there's a lot of unknowns out there, like still how are the economy is going to evolve, how they can impact the actual consumers. I mean, if there's more government stimulus checks put into the market, how does that impact our customers it seems like it was very good, our customers were in terms of how they performed in 2020. But again, so we're just kind of being taken what we know today in terms of what we see out there. Again, as Todd said around the sales side and then in terms of customer portfolio performance and trying to put out a number that we thing is reasonable. Doing great. Cash from operating activities was, I mean, we just and we knew we were going to, by the way, we knew we were going to deal on all things, but we've had tremendous improvements operationally, financially, and that it was on purpose. None of it happened on accident and we're hyper focused on how we operate this business. We want to be known as great operators, not just from a financial metric perspective, but toward consumers, because that's going to be, that is one of the key differentiators. We have professional installed fully on proprietary smart home platform. And that's going to lead to the future of our business, which is what a true smart home is going to be, which is the entrance into the home to what we're doing is going to provide lots of outlets into services and technologies that we're going to be able to provide for consumers. We've got to be great at the first part, just as maintaining these hardware devices having them be stable, reliable, elegant, great experience, low issues, and then we're doing that."

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Nate Stubbs, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nNate Stubbs: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us this afternoon to discuss the results of Vivint Smart Home for the 3- and 9-month periods ended September 30, 2020. Joining me on the conference call this afternoon are Todd Pedersen, Vivint's CEO; and Dale Gerard, Vivint's CFO.  I would like to begin by reminding everyone that the discussion today may contain forward-looking statements, including with regards to the company's future performance and prospects. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, are not guarantees of performance, and you should not put undue reliance on these statements. I would direct your attention to the risk factors detailed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q issued in fiscal year 2020, including for our most recent quarterly period ended September 30, 2020, which we expect to file on or about the date of this earnings call.  Please be aware that these risk factors may be updated from time to time in the company's periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and that the realization of any such risk factors could affect our future results and could cause those results or other outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  In today's remarks, we will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures for historical periods to the most comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are available in the earnings release and accompanying presentation, which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vivint.com.  I will now turn the call over to Todd.\nTodd Pedersen: Thanks, Nate, and welcome to everyone joining the call this afternoon. We are pleased to report another quarter of very strong performance. Our results underscore the importance of having a proprietary, fully-integrated AI-driven smart home platform, which is the backbone of our predictable and consistent recurring revenue model.  Touching briefly on a few financial highlights for the quarter. Total revenue and total subscribers grew by nearly 10%, reflecting healthy consumer demand for smart home and security services, along with our ability to retain a higher percentage of our customer portfolio. Our adjusted EBITDA margins continue to build upon previous quarters and expanded to new highs. Finally, we have stated our desire to operate the business in a more cash efficient way, and we are tracking to be cash flow positive by more than $100 million in 2020.  As we continue our focus on optimizing the business, we saw solid improvement across the board in many of our key performance metrics for the quarter. Notably, the last 12-month attrition rate improved by nearly a full point in the quarter and continues to exceed our forecasts. Our LTM attrition rate for Q3 was the lowest in the past 7 quarters, and I believe it speaks to the fact that our core value proposition, proven over 2 decades of reliably taking care of our customers and their families, is as relevant today as ever.  Vivint's fully-integrated and proprietary platform provides smart security and peace of mind to nearly 1.7 million customers across North America. Our customers interact with our systems on average 12 times every day, which provides our AI-based platform with over 1.5 billion pieces of data daily. This creates a real-time feedback loop, which enables us to proactively react to any issues happening in their homes. In many cases, we can identify an issue and are already working on a solution before the customer recognizes that something might be amiss.  By controlling the entire customer experience from the design of the software and hardware to the sales, installation and service throughout the life of the customer, we're able to provide a robust, reliable and elegant solution to our customers. We believe that homeowners recognize the value of having increasingly complex systems professionally installed and serviced. In this do-it-for-me age we're living in, we believe we have been the leader in revolutionizing the smart home industry by delivering what consumers demand: a fully-integrated smart home and security solution that is professionally installed and seamlessly managed. We believe this consumer demand is proven and our impressive growth. We added nearly 127,000 new subscribers during the quarter, up 14% from a year ago and driven by positive contributions from each of our major sales channels.  In today's environment of uncertainty, homeowners are spending more time thinking about and investing in their homes, which we believe is a very positive sign for Vivint. Our national inside sales channel continued its standout performance, generating 32% year-over-year growth in new subscribers. Meanwhile, our direct-to-home sales channel rebounded nicely from the COVID-related constraints earlier in the year, growing new subscriber adds by 5% versus the prior year period.  With coverage over 98% of ZIP codes in the United States, we believe that Vivint's premier model is in the best position to deliver a full smart home and security solution to virtually every household in the U.S. Consumers continue to expect increasingly complex smart home solutions that include integrated door locks, exterior cameras, interior cameras, lighting controls and thermostats that are professionally installed, monitored and serviced, but we're just getting started.  Even though we have nearly 1.7 million subscribers, our unaided consumer awareness is in the low single digits. The fact that we have been a leader in the rapidly-developing smart home market while relying mostly on grassroots efforts by our sales teams makes us believe there's a tremendous upside if we can increase consumer awareness on a national scale. As we look forward to 2021 and beyond, our focus will be on our key objective of building the Vivint brand and investing in new products, services and technologies. We want to do a better job of telling consumers who we are, what we do and how we can enhance our lives by delivering the convenience, security and peace of mind they desire.  In addition, we will look to continue our leadership and differentiation in the smart home industry by increasing our investment in technology and new product development to ensure that we are on the leading edge when it comes to delivering the products and services consumers want.  We believe Vivint is the clear leader in the Smart home and security solutions market. We are nationwide a fully-integrated smart home and security provider, and we have an opportunity to expand our business and accelerate growth by investing in our brand and technology and helping people understand the incredible value that Vivint brings.  I believe the company is ready to take the next step, and we're ready to handle the inevitable growth that will come with it. We have the technology and services that we believe consumers would absolutely want if they just knew about them. So we're excited about getting the message out, and we're excited about the possibilities and opportunities that exist for Vivint.  I will now turn the call over to Dale to go through the specifics of our strong third quarter results as well as provide our updated guidance for 2020.\nDale Gerard: Thanks, Todd. I will walk through the financial slide portion of the presentation that we posted today in conjunction with our third quarter earnings release. As Todd mentioned during his remarks, our results for the third quarter were very strong across the board.  First, on Slide 6, we highlight a couple of the key data points related to our subscriber portfolio. Total subscribers at quarter end grew from 1.56 million to 1.69 million year-over-year or 8.2%. Total monthly revenue increased by $6.3 million -- or 6.3% with an average monthly revenue per user or AMRU of $63.79.  On Slide 7, we highlight our revenue for the 3- and 9-month periods ended September 30. For the third quarter 2020, revenue was $319 million, up approximately 10% year-over-year. The growth in revenue was primarily attributable to an 8.2% increase in total subscribers. I would note that the third quarter 2019 revenue includes a $9.1 million reduction to revenue, resulting from a change in estimate related to RIC revenues recorded in prior periods.  Moving to Slide 8. Adjusted EBITDA increased significantly in the third quarter and year-to-date periods. The key drivers were continued scaling of our cost to service our subscriber portfolio, the expense portion of subscriber acquisition costs related to the origination of new subscribers and general and administrative expenses. We grew adjusted EBITDA by 53% to $154.5 million in the quarter while expanding our adjusted EBITDA margins by nearly 1,400 basis points to 48.4% of revenue compared to 34.6% in the prior year period. This is clearly a great result, and it's a function of a lot of hard work by our entire organization.  Although not shown on this slide, covenant adjusted EBITDA, which is the calculation used for our debt covenants, was $212.3 million in the quarter, an increase of $42.9 million or 25.3% compared to $169.4 million in the prior year period.  On Slide 9, we highlight some of our new subscriber metrics. New subscriber originations were 126,847 for the third quarter, which reflects outstanding results from our national inside sales channel and a nice rebound from our direct-to-home sales channel following some of the COVID-19-related restrictions earlier this year as the pandemic started to take hold across the U.S. Overall, new subscribers grew by 13.8% in the quarter versus the prior year period. We continue our focus to improve the cash flow dynamics of the business as evidenced by the 89% reduction in RICs during the quarter. While this has had some impact on these subscribers, by shifting a greater proportion of our subscribers away from RICs and towards our financing partners and paying full arrangements, we are able to increase the amount of cash collected at the point of installation, thus reducing our net subscriber acquisition cost and significantly improving our cash flow dynamics.  Moving on to Slide 10. We will cover our net service cost per subscriber and net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber for the quarter. We continued our trend of year-over-year improvements in net service cost per subscriber, moving from $16.38 in the third quarter of 2018 to $14.43 in the third quarter of 2019 and now down to $9.82 in the most recent quarter, a $6.56 improvement versus 2018. This continues our record-setting trend of achieving new lows in service cost per subscriber, and it demonstrates the advantage of Vivint's fully-integrated smart home and security platform, which encompasses the software, the hardware, the installation and ongoing customer support.  The result is that our net service margin continued its positive upward trend, moving from 68.7% in the third quarter of 2018 to 72.4% in the third quarter of 2019 and now to 80.1% in the most recent quarter. These efforts contributed significantly to the improvement seen in our adjusted EBITDA during the quarter.  It's important to note that given the seasonality how we generally put on new customers, particularly in the summer. We tend to see service costs increase in the latter part of the year. Additionally, as mentioned before, we believe service calls have remained abnormally low in the third quarter due to concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. So while we're really encouraged by the current trends and the corresponding benefits to our margins, we wouldn't anticipate sustained full year results at the 80% level.  On the right-hand side of the slide, our net subscriber acquisition costs for the last 12-month period ended September 30 were $209 versus $1,033 in the prior year period. The decrease represented nearly an 80% reduction as we have nearly eliminated the number of new subscribers that are financed via RICs by shifting to a higher mix of customers utilizing our financing partners or paying in full for the purchase of their smart home products. The year-over-year comparison also benefited from pricing leverage at the point-of-sale purchase of products and installation.  Moving on to Slide 11. We show our typical subscriber walk that illustrates the changes in total subscribers at quarter end and our attrition rate trend. One of the biggest highlights for the company continues to be the reversal in our attrition rate, which was lower sequentially by 90 basis points and fell to the lowest rate in the past 7 quarters. The third quarter measurement period benefited from a 2% sequential drop in customers that were in the end of their initial term life cycle phase. While the end of initial term mechanics helped, our portfolio has continued to perform better than expected in terms of the number of subscribers canceling and other leading portfolio indicators through October. We believe that the pandemic, social unrest and improved product performance as evidenced by our lower net service cost per subscriber are having a positive impact on our overall attrition rate.  Before we move to our updated outlook, I'll point out that several factors tied to our strong third quarter performance, leave us feeling very good, including our overall liquidity position, which stood at approximately $630 million as of September 30. Our third quarter operating cash flow was strong. For the 3-month period ended September 30, we generated $142.5 million in net cash from operating activities compared to $8.2 million for the same period in 2019. During the quarter, there were approximately 1.7 million warrants exercise, which added approximately $19 million to our September 30 cash position.  Finally, let's move to Slide 12, while I will address our updated financial outlook. We believe that the fundamental characteristics of Vivint's high-margin reoccurring revenue model are compelling. More than 95% of our revenue is recurring, which provides long-term visibility and predictability to our business. Many of our new subscribers initially sign up for 5-year contracts and remain on the Vivint platform for approximately 8 years, producing significant lifetime margins. Despite the many uncertainties pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic, our reoccurring revenue model has proven resilient, and we remain comfortable with our previous revenue guidance.  Our better-than-expected attrition rate performance and an improving unit economics have prompted us to update our guidance for total subscribers and adjusted EBITDA. We are raising our guidance for total subscribers to between 1.66 million and 1.70 million versus previous guidance of between 1.62 million and 1.68 million. We are reaffirming our guidance for total revenue of between $1.23 billion and $1.28 billion. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to between $570 million and $580 million versus previous guidance of between $555 million and $565 million.  Thanks to everyone for joining the call. Operator, you may open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Paul Coster with JPMorgan.\nPaul Coster: I've got three quick ones. First of all, Dale, can you talk to us about the debt refinancing plans?\nDale Gerard: Yes, Paul, thanks for joining the call. I think we're actually monitoring the markets to capital markets, and we wanted to get the quarter results now. We think they're strong. We think they're helpful in terms of whatever we decide to do. But we're actually monitoring, and when we're ready, we'll come out to the markets.\nPaul Coster: Okay. Got you. The service costs are going up in the fourth quarter, although I think you said that they might go up in the third quarter, and they didn't. So obviously, you got a good handle on things. But I also noticed that the average monthly revenue declined. Can you just talk us through that dynamic a little bit?\nDale Gerard: Yes. So again, Paul, I think -- and we talked about this a couple of -- over the last couple of calls. We purposely are bringing it down kind of the average subscription monthly, right, because we're charging more upfront. When you look at the overall out-of-pocket to our customer, it's actually increased year-over-year in terms of the total dollars related to the amount they pay for the financing piece, which goes to the financing partner into what they're paying us. And so what we've done is shifted a little bit of what they were paying us in terms of that subscription amount each month to pay the financing partner. But we're able to actually bring more cash in upfront, which is why we're producing the level of cash we are in terms of cash from operations. So that's really the driver behind that.\nTodd Pedersen: And to add to that, this is Todd, Paul, the $209 subscriber acquisition costs is a direct result of that. So this -- we couldn't be happier about that. But it does -- if you don't understand it, we appreciate the question, but it does look like revenue per subs is coming down, but it's actually not. We're selling more hardware than we've ever sold at a high-margin upfront. And so the business is working very, very well.\nDale Gerard: And then we're booked on the service cost fall. Again, we're cautious. We think that there's still calls in terms of truck rolls, and calls coming our call centers are still down somewhat compared to what we think would be a normal trend. And so we do expect, at some point those, calls will come back. But we think there's a big part of this, is where our new hardware, our software is performing better, and thus, that's also a big driver in terms of this. But we're very excited about where that service cost is on a subscriber basis and working very hard to keep it low as possible but -- and still maintain a very, very high-quality customer experience.\nPaul Coster: Got you. And Todd, it sounds like you feel like you could be doing so much better if there was better unassisted brand awareness out there. And it also sounds like you've got these new products and services in the pipeline. I think, most recently, the insurance product is the one that you're talking about. Is that still the sort of first in line? And should we expect some big splashy event to get the brand out there? Or is it more subtle than that?\nTodd Pedersen: So speaking to the branding, and again, I had said pretty clearly that until we were positive that we were going to be cash flow positive as a company, on a levered basis, which now we're kind of -- we've kind of put it out there, we're promising $100 million of positive cash flow on a levered basis, which we're very, very excited about, and we know the markets are, too. But we are -- and by the way, that includes money we are going to spend in Q4 on a launch -- a marketing launch.  Now we -- if you know anything about our company, we don't -- we like to test -- spend and test and test and analyze. And so we're going to be very, I guess, strategic and clinical about how we spend dollars on the marketing front, what to say, how to spend results that we can get from that. So we are launching in Q4 a branding and marketing effort nationwide. We've been working on it for quite some time, and we've known for a while that we're going to be cash flow positive for the year. So that -- we believe that's going to give us some great tailwind.  Now as anyone has seen a branding marketing campaign for a national brand goes, it takes time. This is something you've got to be committed to for years, not months. And -- but again, we've got to be very surgical and strategic about how we spend, where we spend and what we say, how we present the products and services that we have to the consumers, but we are launching that. I think in the coming weeks, you'll see something happen, hopefully. And then the next question was what, Paul, again?\nDale Gerard: That was it.\nTodd Pedersen: No, no, there's something else.\nPaul Coster: The new products' insurance. How many insurance for the first in line? Or is there anything else coming on?\nTodd Pedersen: So we are -- so we are still very pleased with the way insurance is going. Again, we're not announcing numbers yet. We're being very patient about how quickly we launched that product, how we partner, how we position ourselves to our consumers. But I can say this, we believe we've got an incredible advantage because of the view we have into the data that is delivered through our smart home platform that is proprietary to pivot.  And I say this with everything. This is going to be a huge advantage for our customers because they have a Vivint product and they believe in our services, not just smart home technologies, but services that we have and are going to be delivering. They're going to be the recipients of the benefit of that. So we're really excited.  And again, maybe at some point next year, we start talking about the numbers and the relevance to the future of the business, but committed to it and continue to test and expand that product and service.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.\nErik Woodring: Congrats on the quarter. It's really nice to see. I guess I just wanted to touch on the attrition rate. Obviously, you guys -- it's coming down. Just would love to hear your puts and takes, what you're hearing from your base in terms of what's keeping them on board. Or I guess, said another way, what's causing them to not roll off the platform? And then kind of how that's changed from kind of your guys' commentary maybe 2 or 3 quarters ago, where you've talked about attrition rates possibly being higher into the end of the year? And then I have a follow-up.\nTodd Pedersen: So this is -- attrition is an interesting thing. There's no one like silver bullet in attrition. It's a lot of little points of interaction with customers that determines their life cycle with us [indiscernible].  We've continued to improve. And again, this is really, really important. This is the differentiator with Vivint than everyone else. We create our own customers from a sales perspective. We professionally install the hardware that our engineers have designed and have written the software and the firmware for. We own our platform. It's this incredible cycle that -- and it's this feedback move that no one else has at this point. Others are trying to recreate our partnership to recreate that. But it's all -- it's lots of little points of contact and knowledge that we have to improve reliability of the product. It's how we answer calls, it's how we do installs, installation protocol, service protocols. And then this is just maybe not obvious, but it's obvious to us because we've been through a few downturns.  Our product and services, when I'm talking about smart security generally, has done very, very well through every downturn, at least I've run the company through. So the last downturn, we shared very well. And I think in general, if you think about the burglar alarm security industry, they've done well also as far as attrition goes. I mean I think people historically, when those things happen, they want to protect their largest investment, which is typically their home, their families, the assets inside of those. We provide that.  And then with this current environment of COVID, and people working from home, there's this incredible reconnection with the home, investment and kind of thought process around how people live and operate in their home, how they engage with -- and they're engaging with food delivery, grocery delivery, package delivery, increased demand for all of those services and how we integrate with that for consumer, making them safe and comfortable and giving them the knowledge that they wouldn't have without our services. There's all kinds of things that are benefiting our company today, and we're happy to do that because this environment is a little scary sometimes for people, and this provides nice peace of mind with smart security.  And here -- the great thing is, well, one, I hope things calm down on all fronts for everyone worldwide and our country. The -- I think that the engagement with our product and services and app on an individual consumer basis, has been incredible, and it's going to be remembered by our consumers.  And then again, I think you layer on with that, the fact that we are now starting at branding and advertising campaign really describing who we are, what we do, how we're differentiated and the value proposition that we deliver, we think we've got some good wind behind our backs.\nErik Woodring: Awesome. That's really helpful. And then I guess my follow-up would just be, why raise your subscriber -- year-end subscriber targets but not your revenue guidance? Just what was the thought process behind that? And any kind of moving pieces that we should be thinking about there?\nDale Gerard: Yes. I think, again, we're raising the subscriber targets based upon the fact that attrition is running much better than we had in our forecast. So our revenue guidance, the ranges, are we feeling comfortable?  One, the number of subscribers increasing doesn't impact -- I mean because we've got a pretty good-sized range there and we're given in terms of $1 billion range. We're within that range even if the subscribers are 20,000 or 30,000 or 40,000 more subscribers. So we feel very comfortable.  I mean if you go back, our revenue because this is the recurring revenue, we know going in, even starting to go into next year, we have a really good line of sight into what the revenue number will be. It's a little bit of moving around subscribers in terms of [indiscernible]. I think the other thing is we feel more comfortable today where we sit here in the first week of November than we did before in terms of the subscriber number, knowing how the metrics are working, how attrition has performed into a quarter plus or a quarter or so into the fourth quarter. So that's the reason why we made that guidance change.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI.\nAmit Daryanani: Yes. I guess a couple for me as well. Todd. First off, you've talked a fair bit about just increasing your brand awareness and recognition. I just want to get and understand the strategy there. But could you just touch on -- have you tested this in smaller regions, smaller cities? If so, what do those metrics look like to you? And then as you think about scaling this up to the extent you're talking about it, what does that investment look like from a cost perspective in calendar '21?\nTodd Pedersen: Yes. So we haven't tested the type of branding and advertising that we're going to do. But as you all know, we do -- we have an inside sales group that's about half of our -- half of the consumer adds on our customer base annually.  So we do spend money on branding and advertising. It's more lead-gen type advertising. So this is going to be slightly different. We're branding style. So we have not yet done it, and that's why we're not going in full force. We're going to test in but on a national basis. And from a dollar spent on branding, it's much more expensive to be -- to go into a city or region than on a national basis on a spend. So that's what we're going nationally, not just on a local basis.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. That's fair. I guess I was wondering if there's any way to dimension what that cost structure or cost will look like around that in calendar '21. And then I guess with Dale, the net service margins improved rather dramatically once again. And I understand some of this is more transitory in nature, perhaps even though on folks who come to the houses as much. But is there way to think -- if I look at the improvement you guys have had over there on a year-over-year basis, how much of that is structural versus something that's more transient that could go away in a post-COVID world if we get that ever?\nDale Gerard: Yes. So I think we believe that, again, we've been very focused on this. If you go back 24 months when servicing cost was, call it, high $18 range, $17 range, and this is the benefit of having this fully-integrated model where we own the software, we own the product, we own the hardware, we do the sales, we do the installation, all of that feedback loop that we have, the cost of feedback loop that we have allows us to know, hey, what are the issues. And as we said, one of the big issues and one of the big products that people want in their homes is video, it's cameras. Whether it's indoor camera, outdoor cameras, doorbell cameras, as Todd said earlier, there's lots of uses for the video.  And we knew that with some of the connectivity issues were a big part of that, which were driving up calls into our call centers, which were driving calls in related to driving us to have to roll trucks up to people's homes. Those are expensive, and you have to actually roll -- go out to people's homes and fix those issues. So we believe by rolling out some of the new products -- we rolled out some new camera products, new doorbell camera.  We've rolled out a new hub. We've upgraded the firmware and software associated with that, those products that service, and we've done a lot of work around the technology that we have from our tools when we're installing stuff around, hey, what's the Wi-Fi connectivity in this part of the house or this part of being outside on the start corner of the home and making sure that where we're installing equipment and hardware in those homes that it works and that there is Wi-Fi connectivity, and then we make sure it all works together before we're leaving. And so what I think you're seeing is there's a structural move but the lower -- and in terms of servicing cost will be lower. I'm not -- I can't tell you on the call today how much of that is, but we believe that there's definitely that movement because we're seeing less calls coming in.  And then we do know, too, because, again, the feedback loop we have, because we have to own this whole thing, is that we do know the type of calls are coming in, what those -- what are those issues. And we can go actually go work on those issues, whether they're, again, updates to the firmware, software, things of how we're installing the product in folks' home. So we think that's a big part of it.  Again, there's some part of it that's COVID-related. But fundamentally, we believe that we have this product and our services that we really are starting to fine-tune in terms of the cost to service those related to, again, calls coming in related to issues with the products. And again, a lot of that was around video, which we spent a lot of time and efforts to correct. Because ultimately -- and I think this also steps to the attrition that we talked about on an earlier question. If you get on your phone or you pull it up on your computer, however you're accessing the payment system and the cameras aren't on online or they're going offline, you're not going to be happy with the system versus today, you get on and the system works, the cameras are out there. You can go quickly to look at the events or you can pull it. It comes up and says someone's at your front door delivering a package. It works very well. It's seamless, your experience, that's going to drive customers to stay longer onto the platform.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shweta Khajuria with RBC.\nShweta Khajuria: Let me try two, please. Could you please run through why the subscriber acquisition cost decreased so much? And what -- how we should think about sustainability of that? That was a material decrease. And then the second one is, how are subscribers or potential subscribers responding to your new pricing plan or the change in the pricing plan? And yes. Just those two, please.\nDale Gerard: Sure. And I'll start here and then, Todd, you can jump in if I don't cover anything. I think I'm going to start in reverse order. I'm going to take your second question first, and then that drives into the first question. I think in terms of the pricing model that we have -- and we're always looking at this pricing model, by the way, and I think you'll see us make tweaks to it as we roll into '21. We're always -- as Todd said, we test a lot of things. So we tweak things, and we keep tweaking until we find the optimal. But I think in terms of the acceptance from customers, I mean we grew subscriber 14% in the third quarter. Year-over-year, we continue to add new subscribers.  And I think one of the things I'd say is inside sales is where you're getting leads coming from the Internet. So customers are going out on the Internet, for example, maybe they're searching for smart home, smart security, security. And they're going to see other people's offers out there, by the way, as they're doing that. And that channel is growing. I think it grew 32% in the quarter.  So we think customers understand it. They like the transparency of it, by the way. They like to know, hey, this is what I'm paying for the equipment that's going home. I can -- this is the equipment that I want to buy. It's not that, hey, you're getting stuck with the package of things that you don't really want in your home, whether it's sensors or whatever. They're picking exactly what they want, as Todd mentioned earlier. They're taking more equipment today than they've taken in past, and they're taking smart home equipment. It's not just a sensor here and a door or a window, it's outdoor cameras, it's the doorbell cameras, it's door locks, it's response servers. It's really those things that help them have better management of their home, and so that's -- we think it's been received very well in terms of the customers taking that from both of our channels.  In terms of the drop in net SAC, and we've kind of hinted to this on the last quarterly call, there's a couple of things going on here. One, we've reduced RICs substantially. If you go back to last year in the third, I think it's down 89% year-over-year in the quarter. And so if you recall, RICs are customers that we were basically financing and putting on our balance sheet, so we got no money upfront from those customers. Versus today, basically, 99% of the customers that we put on today, we're collecting money upfront either. They're -- it's coming from them financing through one of our financing partners, or they're just paying for it out of their own bank account. So that's fundamentally changing the amount of money that we're collecting upfront in terms of those customers.  And what you're seeing is, again, this is an LTM calculation. So what you had when we dropped from 9 -- I think it was about 950 in the first quarter to 630 in the second quarter. Now we're down to in the 208, 209 range this quarter because we're having those quarters that have higher RIC percentages that are falling off as we recalculate this out. So it's fundamentally changed the business. It's really driving the cash production is coming into this. We think it was something that we needed to do, and it's really changed, and frankly, allowing us to do some of this investment Todd's talking about in terms of brand and marketing and some of the other things we want to go do here.  In terms of how that looks, again, we'll tweak things. But I think, again, you'll have another quarter in the fourth quarter that as we kind of report out here in the next -- when we report fourth quarter, they have, call it, 8% to 12% RICs in that quarter, and those will fall off. And if you can kind of go do your math there, but if we have 1% RICs again, that number is probably going to continue on coming...\nTodd Pedersen: So the answer is it's sustainable. So I think we've kind of danced around this for a few quarters. Our business model is working the way it's working. We've said it was going to come down from 1,000. And we've not pinned a number, but we are very close to cash flow breakeven upfront when we create a customer. I'll just say it. We don't have to dance around or think about in the future. Anyone on the call, it's now public. So which is an incredible dynamic for our business compared to anyone on the call that listen to us, to our earnings call back when we were a consumer of debt. It was $2,200 -- our gross acquisition cost was -- gross and net was $2,200 subscriber acquisition costs.  So this is an incredible turnaround, and you're seeing the cash dynamics for the business, which also is because of the reduction in service costs, which is also because of the reduction in overhead. If you look at our overhead numbers compared to the past years, we've been incredibly focused on being a very lean company spending where we need to reinvest in what we think we're going to get growth, better technologies, better software, better firm work, better service delivery. So we've been busy in the last couple of years, and we're finally seeing those results. And again, back to the -- how do we grow the business more, continue to enhance products and service -- products and services to consumers wanting demand and then really go tell our story.  Someone's going to probably ask, I'm surprised no has, who's your competition. Our competition right now is a lack of awareness of business. We did -- we have an incredible business, north of $1 billion of revenue, incredible margins, great service delivery, and nobody knows who we are. Not nobody, but it's -- I mean it's single-digit consumer awareness of our brand.  When people really do understand how incredible it is, what we can do inside of their home and interact and engage with the way they're now living their lives and the value prop that we deliver, we're going to -- we believe we're going to catch some wind from that perspective. And so we're -- and again, it's going to take time. It's not going to be overnight, but we're obviously patient and committed. So we have -- we're excited about what's ahead of us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kunal Madhukar with Deutsche Bank.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Akash on for Kunal. I just have two questions. I guess the first question being, looking at third quarter versus second quarter, could we dig maybe a little bit deeper into buyer behaviors? And any changes in product mix that you guys saw in 3Q versus 2Q? And then also on the topic of competition, actually, looking at the landscape, any new trends that you guys are seeing in terms of the competition as it maybe relates to Amazon Ring X System or Google Nest? And any color there would be great.\nTodd Pedersen: Well, I'm going to talk first about the competition just because I said something and you asked the question anyway. We're always paying attention to what other people are doing out there. There's no question about it, we'd be crazy not to.  But this is a tough business. I mean -- and I'm not talking about the single point solution stuff like a doorbell camera or an Arlo camera on the exterior of the house. These are fully-integrated smart home systems on a very intelligent platform, 14 devices installed in a home. And so to do that, you've got to have a very capable installation network, which we happen to own our own, our employees. And then the ability to -- and we've talked about this quite a bit today. Kind of own that whole interaction with customer from the sale process to the installation, the ongoing support, either technical support over the phone or if needs be driving a truck out there if that has to happen to deliver what we say we're going to deliver. So we have not yet seen someone else step up to the level that we're doing this.  People have parts of what we have by way of nice camera design or a nice doorbell or nice thermostat. But we've got an incredible moat because of -- and this is 20 years in the making, incredible moat. To recreate what we've done is not easy. I'm not saying it can't be done, but very difficult to do.  And speaking to Google, I mean they did invest in ADT. And I think the partnership, which we're super happy. It kind of validates -- we believe it's not just sort of it really validates their beliefs and the need for this infrastructure to be in people's homes, beyond the phone, answer calls, install professionally these new technologies that are coming. But you did -- if you've noticed anything, Google also did in their Google Nest security product. So it's even for a Google expense, I think they spend a lot of money. I don't know the number, but it's a lot. I see their ads all the time. It's not easy. People don't just buy this off-the-shelf and just understand how to install it themselves. It's not that easy.  And then there is the DIY component of this industry, which we have that capability. We're testing that. We just happen to like to have really high margins, which we do; and a very long customer relationship, which we do. And as we've tested DIY, which we are, and we're capable of it. I mean that's the great thing, we have incredible flexibility in the services offering, pricing perspective. It's our hardware, our platform. We're not yet convinced that we want to heavily pursue DIY even if consumers demand it because we want to make sure when we get on this call, we say, hey, we had high margins and we have a long customer life and a huge profit pool ahead of us. We want to grow. We are growing at a very nice pace. We intend to grow -- we believe that there's a lot more growth in this space than what we show at this point. But we've got to invest in that and be focused on that, which we are. But we're not growing to grow just to add subs if it doesn't add margin, profit pool and customer longevity. We're not going to just chase that.  And again, we are -- it's a good question. We are absolutely paying attention, and we watch what other people do. But I would say this, we've got 20 years doing this business. And we believe we're the clear leader in the smart home as a service space, a clear leader and a lot of experience. And we're just really excited about the way that consumers are engaging with our platform, the number of interactions per day, the different use cases that they're starting to discover as they -- again, this is me also.  I'm so much more engaged with my home and my family because of the environment that none of us chose, it is what it is, and it's been unfortunate in some ways. But in other ways, we've had to learn how to do that. Enjoy the home is kind of our staycation, I think people are calling it. And it's our work environment for most of us a lot of the time. So we are perfectly positioned as a company that can deliver really interesting services and offerings into consumers' home right now. So we feel like we're a [indiscernible].\nDale Gerard: Mix of buyers [indiscernible].\nTodd Pedersen: Oh, so mix of buyers, not much change quarter-over-quarter. I mean not really actually. Sorry, I missed the last part.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Todd Morgan with Jefferies.\nTodd Morgan: I mean a great quarter. Good to see, I guess, year-over-year growth in subs, even with COVID. Two questions coming out of that. I guess first of all, is there any way to think about how much better or easier it would be to kind of sell and close and install and service customers without COVID? As you look forward, I know you've talked about continued growth, but how much is that kind of holding you back now, if that's the way to think about it.  And I guess, secondly, you talked a little bit about the SAC cost, this is for costs being on an LTM basis, really only a couple of hundred dollars. I mean if my math is right, you're basically paying nothing to add subs now, and it looks like you kind of suggested the same. Is there any reason to think that, that doesn't continue to be the case? In other words, you can kind of grow with effectively a $0 cash cost of adding that new subscriber?\nTodd Pedersen: Thanks for the questions. So to the net SAC, that's absolutely at this point a choice. And Dale said, this is kind of interesting. Before we had consumer financing, and the hardware was kind of part of the overall package, it was a little bit confusing. It's so beautiful now because customers really can just pick and choose either to pay upfront with no contract, by the way, no commitment, it's month-to-month from that point or user financing, 0% financing going forward. And the majority choose the 60-month financing. But it's an interesting thing because we now have kind of levers we can pull on where we want to be.  Now at this point, and again, things can change. I'm not -- we're not going to say nothing can ever change in the business environment or financing environment. But as it stands today, we are and can continue to operate at a minimum of breakeven upfront on the subscriber acquisition, which is absolutely amazing.  By the way, I don't -- when we really set out to do this internally as a group 18 months ago, I don't even know if we believe that we could do it, but the same goes true for the sub-$10 servicing cost. We had a goal by -- just so everyone knows on the phone to get down to $10 a month servicing cost about 3.5 years ago. So the fact that it's happened -- and some of it's in the environment that we're in, but others are my choice and investment, we're really excited about that.  So the answer is yes for now. Speaking to some date in the future where the economic environment changes and we are reliant on consumer financing group citizens, which has been amazing, in Fortiva, they've also been amazing, we can continue to do that. We think it's the right way to do this.\nTodd Morgan: And then the other question is around COVID. The impact of that do you think that's having on sales.\nTodd Pedersen: Yes. So from a COVID perspective, and I think maybe we have had -- we obviously had to put our direct-on-sales organization on pause. We also -- and I didn't mention this earlier. I want to make sure I do again. We eliminated about 40,000 subscribers we would have put on in the past in the form of RICs. So when you really look at our sales performance, customer adds and revenue, it's not good, it's outstanding.  And so again, we have benefited from people being home, being more engaged with their home. Our performance on a per reps or sales per or sales per sales rep per day and revenue per customer, it is up substantially. It's up really nicely, I guess, I would say that right saying. I think we are going to see that trend, at least where we are, maintained because I think there is a lot more awareness in markets about who Vivint is. And as we layer on the branding and marketing campaign that we're doing, that we hope to perfectly describe how elegantly we deliver services to consumers, the quality of product, the design of the product, the value prop that we're going to keep those gains going forward. I'm actually fairly confident of that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Marlin Rio [ph] with Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: Just a quick one on attrition. A few quarters back, you had talked about kind of a 14.5% to, let's call it, 15% level, mainly attributable to lower cohorts coming due. And I was just wondering if you can provide any commentary on how -- given the improvements in the last 2 quarters, if that has changed or if it's been pushed out or if it's maybe been kind of spread over a longer time frame?\nDale Gerard: And I just want to make sure in terms of the question -- I mean we think attrition, again, we've seen really, really positive signs of attrition in terms of the number of folks that were canceling that were at their initial in the term. That's been much lower than we had forecasted.  Our payment indicators in terms of payments coming in from customers performed really well. So we're seeing really good performance of the portfolio. I think as we look to the rest of this year -- and again, there is COVID. There's cases spike in all across the country, and we can't -- we don't know how that's going to actually impact or if it will impact our customer base.  I think if we looked at this year where I'm comfortable saying it is we're somewhere probably in the a 12.5% to 13% is where we'll end attrition for this year, so kind of in the range we are right now. That's where I think we'll end this full year. And then once we get a better indication of how things look going into next year, will give us an indication of what we think for 2021.  But I think we believe that our -- that the big fundamental change in how our service is performing, how we're delivering that service and the products that we're providing to the customers and the fact that even though they're home, Todd mentioned this earlier, there's just that reconnection that remodeling of their home, upgrading their home, adding the service to their home is something that they're doing and they want that in their home, and so we believe those customers will stay on the Vivint platform for a longer period of time.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And that's what I was getting at, Dale, is that instead of saying x amount of cohorts are coming due, normally, we see this type of behavior, that the past 2 quarters have been much better than my expectation. So it's not that, that 14% or whatever that number was got pushed forward. You could actually maybe even see that attrition or those cohorts coming due maybe spread out over a longer period. I guess my point is, that 14.5% to 15%, is that necessarily still out there and just pushed out? Or based on what you said in terms of people reconnecting with their home, we could actually see a shift in that to some extent?\nDale Gerard: Yes. No, I don't -- we don't believe -- again, I'll just kind of give you the range, I think, for the end of this year. We don't -- and we'll give you next year. But we don't believe that 14.5% to 15% is it's -- you could take that off the table, I guess, is the best way to say it. We think we're somewhere again in this 12.5% to 13% range this year. And then we'll see what happens next year. Again, if things continue to perform as they are today, it's been -- we're going to be in that 13-ish range. But we don't think that we're going to see this spike back up to kind of that 14% -- north of 14- ish, 15% range.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Todd Pedersen for closing remarks.\nTodd Pedersen: Yes. So we just want to thank everyone for getting on the call. We are excited about the quarter that we've had and the year that we've had to this point. Hopefully, we've lived up and beat expectations, at least that we've told you in the market.  I want to make sure you all know this, we're incredibly focused on the current quarter, all of the dynamics of the business. We've got a pulse on everything, where we feel very confident in what we've stated and what we've promised for the year. But as an organization, and I think you'll learn this over time, it's not just the next quarter. We are investing currently in making sure that we make improvements and strides towards better service delivery and everything for the future of the business. We hope to continue to outperform expectations in the future. So thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Todd Pedersen",
            "content": "Thanks, Nate, and welcome to everyone joining the call this afternoon. We are pleased to report another quarter of very strong performance. Our results underscore the importance of having a proprietary, fully-integrated AI-driven smart home platform, which is the backbone of our predictable and consistent recurring revenue model.  Touching briefly on a few financial highlights for the quarter. Total revenue and total subscribers grew by nearly 10%, reflecting healthy consumer demand for smart home and security services, along with our ability to retain a higher percentage of our customer portfolio. Our adjusted EBITDA margins continue to build upon previous quarters and expanded to new highs. Finally, we have stated our desire to operate the business in a more cash efficient way, and we are tracking to be cash flow positive by more than $100 million in 2020.  As we continue our focus on optimizing the business, we saw solid improvement across the board in many of our key performance metrics for the quarter. Notably, the last 12-month attrition rate improved by nearly a full point in the quarter and continues to exceed our forecasts. Our LTM attrition rate for Q3 was the lowest in the past 7 quarters, and I believe it speaks to the fact that our core value proposition, proven over 2 decades of reliably taking care of our customers and their families, is as relevant today as ever.  Vivint's fully-integrated and proprietary platform provides smart security and peace of mind to nearly 1.7 million customers across North America. Our customers interact with our systems on average 12 times every day, which provides our AI-based platform with over 1.5 billion pieces of data daily. This creates a real-time feedback loop, which enables us to proactively react to any issues happening in their homes. In many cases, we can identify an issue and are already working on a solution before the customer recognizes that something might be amiss.  By controlling the entire customer experience from the design of the software and hardware to the sales, installation and service throughout the life of the customer, we're able to provide a robust, reliable and elegant solution to our customers. We believe that homeowners recognize the value of having increasingly complex systems professionally installed and serviced. In this do-it-for-me age we're living in, we believe we have been the leader in revolutionizing the smart home industry by delivering what consumers demand: a fully-integrated smart home and security solution that is professionally installed and seamlessly managed. We believe this consumer demand is proven and our impressive growth. We added nearly 127,000 new subscribers during the quarter, up 14% from a year ago and driven by positive contributions from each of our major sales channels.  In today's environment of uncertainty, homeowners are spending more time thinking about and investing in their homes, which we believe is a very positive sign for Vivint. Our national inside sales channel continued its standout performance, generating 32% year-over-year growth in new subscribers. Meanwhile, our direct-to-home sales channel rebounded nicely from the COVID-related constraints earlier in the year, growing new subscriber adds by 5% versus the prior year period.  With coverage over 98% of ZIP codes in the United States, we believe that Vivint's premier model is in the best position to deliver a full smart home and security solution to virtually every household in the U.S. Consumers continue to expect increasingly complex smart home solutions that include integrated door locks, exterior cameras, interior cameras, lighting controls and thermostats that are professionally installed, monitored and serviced, but we're just getting started.  Even though we have nearly 1.7 million subscribers, our unaided consumer awareness is in the low single digits. The fact that we have been a leader in the rapidly-developing smart home market while relying mostly on grassroots efforts by our sales teams makes us believe there's a tremendous upside if we can increase consumer awareness on a national scale. As we look forward to 2021 and beyond, our focus will be on our key objective of building the Vivint brand and investing in new products, services and technologies. We want to do a better job of telling consumers who we are, what we do and how we can enhance our lives by delivering the convenience, security and peace of mind they desire.  In addition, we will look to continue our leadership and differentiation in the smart home industry by increasing our investment in technology and new product development to ensure that we are on the leading edge when it comes to delivering the products and services consumers want.  We believe Vivint is the clear leader in the Smart home and security solutions market. We are nationwide a fully-integrated smart home and security provider, and we have an opportunity to expand our business and accelerate growth by investing in our brand and technology and helping people understand the incredible value that Vivint brings.  I believe the company is ready to take the next step, and we're ready to handle the inevitable growth that will come with it. We have the technology and services that we believe consumers would absolutely want if they just knew about them. So we're excited about getting the message out, and we're excited about the possibilities and opportunities that exist for Vivint.  I will now turn the call over to Dale to go through the specifics of our strong third quarter results as well as provide our updated guidance for 2020. And to add to that, this is Todd, Paul, the $209 subscriber acquisition costs is a direct result of that. So this -- we couldn't be happier about that. But it does -- if you don't understand it, we appreciate the question, but it does look like revenue per subs is coming down, but it's actually not. We're selling more hardware than we've ever sold at a high-margin upfront. And so the business is working very, very well. So speaking to the branding, and again, I had said pretty clearly that until we were positive that we were going to be cash flow positive as a company, on a levered basis, which now we're kind of -- we've kind of put it out there, we're promising $100 million of positive cash flow on a levered basis, which we're very, very excited about, and we know the markets are, too. But we are -- and by the way, that includes money we are going to spend in Q4 on a launch -- a marketing launch.  Now we -- if you know anything about our company, we don't -- we like to test -- spend and test and test and analyze. And so we're going to be very, I guess, strategic and clinical about how we spend dollars on the marketing front, what to say, how to spend results that we can get from that. So we are launching in Q4 a branding and marketing effort nationwide. We've been working on it for quite some time, and we've known for a while that we're going to be cash flow positive for the year. So that -- we believe that's going to give us some great tailwind.  Now as anyone has seen a branding marketing campaign for a national brand goes, it takes time. This is something you've got to be committed to for years, not months. And -- but again, we've got to be very surgical and strategic about how we spend, where we spend and what we say, how we present the products and services that we have to the consumers, but we are launching that. I think in the coming weeks, you'll see something happen, hopefully. And then the next question was what, Paul, again? No, no, there's something else. So we are -- so we are still very pleased with the way insurance is going. Again, we're not announcing numbers yet. We're being very patient about how quickly we launched that product, how we partner, how we position ourselves to our consumers. But I can say this, we believe we've got an incredible advantage because of the view we have into the data that is delivered through our smart home platform that is proprietary to pivot.  And I say this with everything. This is going to be a huge advantage for our customers because they have a Vivint product and they believe in our services, not just smart home technologies, but services that we have and are going to be delivering. They're going to be the recipients of the benefit of that. So we're really excited.  And again, maybe at some point next year, we start talking about the numbers and the relevance to the future of the business, but committed to it and continue to test and expand that product and service. So this is -- attrition is an interesting thing. There's no one like silver bullet in attrition. It's a lot of little points of interaction with customers that determines their life cycle with us [indiscernible].  We've continued to improve. And again, this is really, really important. This is the differentiator with Vivint than everyone else. We create our own customers from a sales perspective. We professionally install the hardware that our engineers have designed and have written the software and the firmware for. We own our platform. It's this incredible cycle that -- and it's this feedback move that no one else has at this point. Others are trying to recreate our partnership to recreate that. But it's all -- it's lots of little points of contact and knowledge that we have to improve reliability of the product. It's how we answer calls, it's how we do installs, installation protocol, service protocols. And then this is just maybe not obvious, but it's obvious to us because we've been through a few downturns.  Our product and services, when I'm talking about smart security generally, has done very, very well through every downturn, at least I've run the company through. So the last downturn, we shared very well. And I think in general, if you think about the burglar alarm security industry, they've done well also as far as attrition goes. I mean I think people historically, when those things happen, they want to protect their largest investment, which is typically their home, their families, the assets inside of those. We provide that.  And then with this current environment of COVID, and people working from home, there's this incredible reconnection with the home, investment and kind of thought process around how people live and operate in their home, how they engage with -- and they're engaging with food delivery, grocery delivery, package delivery, increased demand for all of those services and how we integrate with that for consumer, making them safe and comfortable and giving them the knowledge that they wouldn't have without our services. There's all kinds of things that are benefiting our company today, and we're happy to do that because this environment is a little scary sometimes for people, and this provides nice peace of mind with smart security.  And here -- the great thing is, well, one, I hope things calm down on all fronts for everyone worldwide and our country. The -- I think that the engagement with our product and services and app on an individual consumer basis, has been incredible, and it's going to be remembered by our consumers.  And then again, I think you layer on with that, the fact that we are now starting at branding and advertising campaign really describing who we are, what we do, how we're differentiated and the value proposition that we deliver, we think we've got some good wind behind our backs. Yes. So we haven't tested the type of branding and advertising that we're going to do. But as you all know, we do -- we have an inside sales group that's about half of our -- half of the consumer adds on our customer base annually.  So we do spend money on branding and advertising. It's more lead-gen type advertising. So this is going to be slightly different. We're branding style. So we have not yet done it, and that's why we're not going in full force. We're going to test in but on a national basis. And from a dollar spent on branding, it's much more expensive to be -- to go into a city or region than on a national basis on a spend. So that's what we're going nationally, not just on a local basis. So the answer is it's sustainable. So I think we've kind of danced around this for a few quarters. Our business model is working the way it's working. We've said it was going to come down from 1,000. And we've not pinned a number, but we are very close to cash flow breakeven upfront when we create a customer. I'll just say it. We don't have to dance around or think about in the future. Anyone on the call, it's now public. So which is an incredible dynamic for our business compared to anyone on the call that listen to us, to our earnings call back when we were a consumer of debt. It was $2,200 -- our gross acquisition cost was -- gross and net was $2,200 subscriber acquisition costs.  So this is an incredible turnaround, and you're seeing the cash dynamics for the business, which also is because of the reduction in service costs, which is also because of the reduction in overhead. If you look at our overhead numbers compared to the past years, we've been incredibly focused on being a very lean company spending where we need to reinvest in what we think we're going to get growth, better technologies, better software, better firm work, better service delivery. So we've been busy in the last couple of years, and we're finally seeing those results. And again, back to the -- how do we grow the business more, continue to enhance products and service -- products and services to consumers wanting demand and then really go tell our story.  Someone's going to probably ask, I'm surprised no has, who's your competition. Our competition right now is a lack of awareness of business. We did -- we have an incredible business, north of $1 billion of revenue, incredible margins, great service delivery, and nobody knows who we are. Not nobody, but it's -- I mean it's single-digit consumer awareness of our brand.  When people really do understand how incredible it is, what we can do inside of their home and interact and engage with the way they're now living their lives and the value prop that we deliver, we're going to -- we believe we're going to catch some wind from that perspective. And so we're -- and again, it's going to take time. It's not going to be overnight, but we're obviously patient and committed. So we have -- we're excited about what's ahead of us. Well, I'm going to talk first about the competition just because I said something and you asked the question anyway. We're always paying attention to what other people are doing out there. There's no question about it, we'd be crazy not to.  But this is a tough business. I mean -- and I'm not talking about the single point solution stuff like a doorbell camera or an Arlo camera on the exterior of the house. These are fully-integrated smart home systems on a very intelligent platform, 14 devices installed in a home. And so to do that, you've got to have a very capable installation network, which we happen to own our own, our employees. And then the ability to -- and we've talked about this quite a bit today. Kind of own that whole interaction with customer from the sale process to the installation, the ongoing support, either technical support over the phone or if needs be driving a truck out there if that has to happen to deliver what we say we're going to deliver. So we have not yet seen someone else step up to the level that we're doing this.  People have parts of what we have by way of nice camera design or a nice doorbell or nice thermostat. But we've got an incredible moat because of -- and this is 20 years in the making, incredible moat. To recreate what we've done is not easy. I'm not saying it can't be done, but very difficult to do.  And speaking to Google, I mean they did invest in ADT. And I think the partnership, which we're super happy. It kind of validates -- we believe it's not just sort of it really validates their beliefs and the need for this infrastructure to be in people's homes, beyond the phone, answer calls, install professionally these new technologies that are coming. But you did -- if you've noticed anything, Google also did in their Google Nest security product. So it's even for a Google expense, I think they spend a lot of money. I don't know the number, but it's a lot. I see their ads all the time. It's not easy. People don't just buy this off-the-shelf and just understand how to install it themselves. It's not that easy.  And then there is the DIY component of this industry, which we have that capability. We're testing that. We just happen to like to have really high margins, which we do; and a very long customer relationship, which we do. And as we've tested DIY, which we are, and we're capable of it. I mean that's the great thing, we have incredible flexibility in the services offering, pricing perspective. It's our hardware, our platform. We're not yet convinced that we want to heavily pursue DIY even if consumers demand it because we want to make sure when we get on this call, we say, hey, we had high margins and we have a long customer life and a huge profit pool ahead of us. We want to grow. We are growing at a very nice pace. We intend to grow -- we believe that there's a lot more growth in this space than what we show at this point. But we've got to invest in that and be focused on that, which we are. But we're not growing to grow just to add subs if it doesn't add margin, profit pool and customer longevity. We're not going to just chase that.  And again, we are -- it's a good question. We are absolutely paying attention, and we watch what other people do. But I would say this, we've got 20 years doing this business. And we believe we're the clear leader in the smart home as a service space, a clear leader and a lot of experience. And we're just really excited about the way that consumers are engaging with our platform, the number of interactions per day, the different use cases that they're starting to discover as they -- again, this is me also.  I'm so much more engaged with my home and my family because of the environment that none of us chose, it is what it is, and it's been unfortunate in some ways. But in other ways, we've had to learn how to do that. Enjoy the home is kind of our staycation, I think people are calling it. And it's our work environment for most of us a lot of the time. So we are perfectly positioned as a company that can deliver really interesting services and offerings into consumers' home right now. So we feel like we're a [indiscernible]. Oh, so mix of buyers, not much change quarter-over-quarter. I mean not really actually. Sorry, I missed the last part. Thanks for the questions. So to the net SAC, that's absolutely at this point a choice. And Dale said, this is kind of interesting. Before we had consumer financing, and the hardware was kind of part of the overall package, it was a little bit confusing. It's so beautiful now because customers really can just pick and choose either to pay upfront with no contract, by the way, no commitment, it's month-to-month from that point or user financing, 0% financing going forward. And the majority choose the 60-month financing. But it's an interesting thing because we now have kind of levers we can pull on where we want to be.  Now at this point, and again, things can change. I'm not -- we're not going to say nothing can ever change in the business environment or financing environment. But as it stands today, we are and can continue to operate at a minimum of breakeven upfront on the subscriber acquisition, which is absolutely amazing.

            "name": "Dale Gerard",
            "content": "Thanks, Todd. I will walk through the financial slide portion of the presentation that we posted today in conjunction with our third quarter earnings release. As Todd mentioned during his remarks, our results for the third quarter were very strong across the board.  First, on Slide 6, we highlight a couple of the key data points related to our subscriber portfolio. Total subscribers at quarter end grew from 1.56 million to 1.69 million year-over-year or 8.2%. Total monthly revenue increased by $6.3 million -- or 6.3% with an average monthly revenue per user or AMRU of $63.79.  On Slide 7, we highlight our revenue for the 3- and 9-month periods ended September 30. For the third quarter 2020, revenue was $319 million, up approximately 10% year-over-year. The growth in revenue was primarily attributable to an 8.2% increase in total subscribers. I would note that the third quarter 2019 revenue includes a $9.1 million reduction to revenue, resulting from a change in estimate related to RIC revenues recorded in prior periods.  Moving to Slide 8. Adjusted EBITDA increased significantly in the third quarter and year-to-date periods. The key drivers were continued scaling of our cost to service our subscriber portfolio, the expense portion of subscriber acquisition costs related to the origination of new subscribers and general and administrative expenses. We grew adjusted EBITDA by 53% to $154.5 million in the quarter while expanding our adjusted EBITDA margins by nearly 1,400 basis points to 48.4% of revenue compared to 34.6% in the prior year period. This is clearly a great result, and it's a function of a lot of hard work by our entire organization.  Although not shown on this slide, covenant adjusted EBITDA, which is the calculation used for our debt covenants, was $212.3 million in the quarter, an increase of $42.9 million or 25.3% compared to $169.4 million in the prior year period.  On Slide 9, we highlight some of our new subscriber metrics. New subscriber originations were 126,847 for the third quarter, which reflects outstanding results from our national inside sales channel and a nice rebound from our direct-to-home sales channel following some of the COVID-19-related restrictions earlier this year as the pandemic started to take hold across the U.S. Overall, new subscribers grew by 13.8% in the quarter versus the prior year period. We continue our focus to improve the cash flow dynamics of the business as evidenced by the 89% reduction in RICs during the quarter. While this has had some impact on these subscribers, by shifting a greater proportion of our subscribers away from RICs and towards our financing partners and paying full arrangements, we are able to increase the amount of cash collected at the point of installation, thus reducing our net subscriber acquisition cost and significantly improving our cash flow dynamics.  Moving on to Slide 10. We will cover our net service cost per subscriber and net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber for the quarter. We continued our trend of year-over-year improvements in net service cost per subscriber, moving from $16.38 in the third quarter of 2018 to $14.43 in the third quarter of 2019 and now down to $9.82 in the most recent quarter, a $6.56 improvement versus 2018. This continues our record-setting trend of achieving new lows in service cost per subscriber, and it demonstrates the advantage of Vivint's fully-integrated smart home and security platform, which encompasses the software, the hardware, the installation and ongoing customer support.  The result is that our net service margin continued its positive upward trend, moving from 68.7% in the third quarter of 2018 to 72.4% in the third quarter of 2019 and now to 80.1% in the most recent quarter. These efforts contributed significantly to the improvement seen in our adjusted EBITDA during the quarter.  It's important to note that given the seasonality how we generally put on new customers, particularly in the summer. We tend to see service costs increase in the latter part of the year. Additionally, as mentioned before, we believe service calls have remained abnormally low in the third quarter due to concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. So while we're really encouraged by the current trends and the corresponding benefits to our margins, we wouldn't anticipate sustained full year results at the 80% level.  On the right-hand side of the slide, our net subscriber acquisition costs for the last 12-month period ended September 30 were $209 versus $1,033 in the prior year period. The decrease represented nearly an 80% reduction as we have nearly eliminated the number of new subscribers that are financed via RICs by shifting to a higher mix of customers utilizing our financing partners or paying in full for the purchase of their smart home products. The year-over-year comparison also benefited from pricing leverage at the point-of-sale purchase of products and installation.  Moving on to Slide 11. We show our typical subscriber walk that illustrates the changes in total subscribers at quarter end and our attrition rate trend. One of the biggest highlights for the company continues to be the reversal in our attrition rate, which was lower sequentially by 90 basis points and fell to the lowest rate in the past 7 quarters. The third quarter measurement period benefited from a 2% sequential drop in customers that were in the end of their initial term life cycle phase. While the end of initial term mechanics helped, our portfolio has continued to perform better than expected in terms of the number of subscribers canceling and other leading portfolio indicators through October. We believe that the pandemic, social unrest and improved product performance as evidenced by our lower net service cost per subscriber are having a positive impact on our overall attrition rate.  Before we move to our updated outlook, I'll point out that several factors tied to our strong third quarter performance, leave us feeling very good, including our overall liquidity position, which stood at approximately $630 million as of September 30. Our third quarter operating cash flow was strong. For the 3-month period ended September 30, we generated $142.5 million in net cash from operating activities compared to $8.2 million for the same period in 2019. During the quarter, there were approximately 1.7 million warrants exercise, which added approximately $19 million to our September 30 cash position.  Finally, let's move to Slide 12, while I will address our updated financial outlook. We believe that the fundamental characteristics of Vivint's high-margin reoccurring revenue model are compelling. More than 95% of our revenue is recurring, which provides long-term visibility and predictability to our business. Many of our new subscribers initially sign up for 5-year contracts and remain on the Vivint platform for approximately 8 years, producing significant lifetime margins. Despite the many uncertainties pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic, our reoccurring revenue model has proven resilient, and we remain comfortable with our previous revenue guidance.  Our better-than-expected attrition rate performance and an improving unit economics have prompted us to update our guidance for total subscribers and adjusted EBITDA. We are raising our guidance for total subscribers to between 1.66 million and 1.70 million versus previous guidance of between 1.62 million and 1.68 million. We are reaffirming our guidance for total revenue of between $1.23 billion and $1.28 billion. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to between $570 million and $580 million versus previous guidance of between $555 million and $565 million.  Thanks to everyone for joining the call. Operator, you may open the line for Q&A. Yes, Paul, thanks for joining the call. I think we're actually monitoring the markets to capital markets, and we wanted to get the quarter results now. We think they're strong. We think they're helpful in terms of whatever we decide to do. But we're actually monitoring, and when we're ready, we'll come out to the markets. Yes. So again, Paul, I think -- and we talked about this a couple of -- over the last couple of calls. We purposely are bringing it down kind of the average subscription monthly, right, because we're charging more upfront. When you look at the overall out-of-pocket to our customer, it's actually increased year-over-year in terms of the total dollars related to the amount they pay for the financing piece, which goes to the financing partner into what they're paying us. And so what we've done is shifted a little bit of what they were paying us in terms of that subscription amount each month to pay the financing partner. But we're able to actually bring more cash in upfront, which is why we're producing the level of cash we are in terms of cash from operations. So that's really the driver behind that. And then we're booked on the service cost fall. Again, we're cautious. We think that there's still calls in terms of truck rolls, and calls coming our call centers are still down somewhat compared to what we think would be a normal trend. And so we do expect, at some point those, calls will come back. But we think there's a big part of this, is where our new hardware, our software is performing better, and thus, that's also a big driver in terms of this. But we're very excited about where that service cost is on a subscriber basis and working very hard to keep it low as possible but -- and still maintain a very, very high-quality customer experience. That was it. Yes. I think, again, we're raising the subscriber targets based upon the fact that attrition is running much better than we had in our forecast. So our revenue guidance, the ranges, are we feeling comfortable?  One, the number of subscribers increasing doesn't impact -- I mean because we've got a pretty good-sized range there and we're given in terms of $1 billion range. We're within that range even if the subscribers are 20,000 or 30,000 or 40,000 more subscribers. So we feel very comfortable.  I mean if you go back, our revenue because this is the recurring revenue, we know going in, even starting to go into next year, we have a really good line of sight into what the revenue number will be. It's a little bit of moving around subscribers in terms of [indiscernible]. I think the other thing is we feel more comfortable today where we sit here in the first week of November than we did before in terms of the subscriber number, knowing how the metrics are working, how attrition has performed into a quarter plus or a quarter or so into the fourth quarter. So that's the reason why we made that guidance change. Yes. So I think we believe that, again, we've been very focused on this. If you go back 24 months when servicing cost was, call it, high $18 range, $17 range, and this is the benefit of having this fully-integrated model where we own the software, we own the product, we own the hardware, we do the sales, we do the installation, all of that feedback loop that we have, the cost of feedback loop that we have allows us to know, hey, what are the issues. And as we said, one of the big issues and one of the big products that people want in their homes is video, it's cameras. Whether it's indoor camera, outdoor cameras, doorbell cameras, as Todd said earlier, there's lots of uses for the video.  And we knew that with some of the connectivity issues were a big part of that, which were driving up calls into our call centers, which were driving calls in related to driving us to have to roll trucks up to people's homes. Those are expensive, and you have to actually roll -- go out to people's homes and fix those issues. So we believe by rolling out some of the new products -- we rolled out some new camera products, new doorbell camera.  We've rolled out a new hub. We've upgraded the firmware and software associated with that, those products that service, and we've done a lot of work around the technology that we have from our tools when we're installing stuff around, hey, what's the Wi-Fi connectivity in this part of the house or this part of being outside on the start corner of the home and making sure that where we're installing equipment and hardware in those homes that it works and that there is Wi-Fi connectivity, and then we make sure it all works together before we're leaving. And so what I think you're seeing is there's a structural move but the lower -- and in terms of servicing cost will be lower. I'm not -- I can't tell you on the call today how much of that is, but we believe that there's definitely that movement because we're seeing less calls coming in.  And then we do know, too, because, again, the feedback loop we have, because we have to own this whole thing, is that we do know the type of calls are coming in, what those -- what are those issues. And we can go actually go work on those issues, whether they're, again, updates to the firmware, software, things of how we're installing the product in folks' home. So we think that's a big part of it.  Again, there's some part of it that's COVID-related. But fundamentally, we believe that we have this product and our services that we really are starting to fine-tune in terms of the cost to service those related to, again, calls coming in related to issues with the products. And again, a lot of that was around video, which we spent a lot of time and efforts to correct. Because ultimately -- and I think this also steps to the attrition that we talked about on an earlier question. If you get on your phone or you pull it up on your computer, however you're accessing the payment system and the cameras aren't on online or they're going offline, you're not going to be happy with the system versus today, you get on and the system works, the cameras are out there. You can go quickly to look at the events or you can pull it. It comes up and says someone's at your front door delivering a package. It works very well. It's seamless, your experience, that's going to drive customers to stay longer onto the platform. Sure. And I'll start here and then, Todd, you can jump in if I don't cover anything. I think I'm going to start in reverse order. I'm going to take your second question first, and then that drives into the first question. I think in terms of the pricing model that we have -- and we're always looking at this pricing model, by the way, and I think you'll see us make tweaks to it as we roll into '21. We're always -- as Todd said, we test a lot of things. So we tweak things, and we keep tweaking until we find the optimal. But I think in terms of the acceptance from customers, I mean we grew subscriber 14% in the third quarter. Year-over-year, we continue to add new subscribers.  And I think one of the things I'd say is inside sales is where you're getting leads coming from the Internet. So customers are going out on the Internet, for example, maybe they're searching for smart home, smart security, security. And they're going to see other people's offers out there, by the way, as they're doing that. And that channel is growing. I think it grew 32% in the quarter.  So we think customers understand it. They like the transparency of it, by the way. They like to know, hey, this is what I'm paying for the equipment that's going home. I can -- this is the equipment that I want to buy. It's not that, hey, you're getting stuck with the package of things that you don't really want in your home, whether it's sensors or whatever. They're picking exactly what they want, as Todd mentioned earlier. They're taking more equipment today than they've taken in past, and they're taking smart home equipment. It's not just a sensor here and a door or a window, it's outdoor cameras, it's the doorbell cameras, it's door locks, it's response servers. It's really those things that help them have better management of their home, and so that's -- we think it's been received very well in terms of the customers taking that from both of our channels.  In terms of the drop in net SAC, and we've kind of hinted to this on the last quarterly call, there's a couple of things going on here. One, we've reduced RICs substantially. If you go back to last year in the third, I think it's down 89% year-over-year in the quarter. And so if you recall, RICs are customers that we were basically financing and putting on our balance sheet, so we got no money upfront from those customers. Versus today, basically, 99% of the customers that we put on today, we're collecting money upfront either. They're -- it's coming from them financing through one of our financing partners, or they're just paying for it out of their own bank account. So that's fundamentally changing the amount of money that we're collecting upfront in terms of those customers.  And what you're seeing is, again, this is an LTM calculation. So what you had when we dropped from 9 -- I think it was about 950 in the first quarter to 630 in the second quarter. Now we're down to in the 208, 209 range this quarter because we're having those quarters that have higher RIC percentages that are falling off as we recalculate this out. So it's fundamentally changed the business. It's really driving the cash production is coming into this. We think it was something that we needed to do, and it's really changed, and frankly, allowing us to do some of this investment Todd's talking about in terms of brand and marketing and some of the other things we want to go do here.  In terms of how that looks, again, we'll tweak things. But I think, again, you'll have another quarter in the fourth quarter that as we kind of report out here in the next -- when we report fourth quarter, they have, call it, 8% to 12% RICs in that quarter, and those will fall off. And if you can kind of go do your math there, but if we have 1% RICs again, that number is probably going to continue on coming... Mix of buyers [indiscernible]. And I just want to make sure in terms of the question -- I mean we think attrition, again, we've seen really, really positive signs of attrition in terms of the number of folks that were canceling that were at their initial in the term. That's been much lower than we had forecasted.  Our payment indicators in terms of payments coming in from customers performed really well. So we're seeing really good performance of the portfolio. I think as we look to the rest of this year -- and again, there is COVID. There's cases spike in all across the country, and we can't -- we don't know how that's going to actually impact or if it will impact our customer base.  I think if we looked at this year where I'm comfortable saying it is we're somewhere probably in the a 12.5% to 13% is where we'll end attrition for this year, so kind of in the range we are right now. That's where I think we'll end this full year. And then once we get a better indication of how things look going into next year, will give us an indication of what we think for 2021.  But I think we believe that our -- that the big fundamental change in how our service is performing, how we're delivering that service and the products that we're providing to the customers and the fact that even though they're home, Todd mentioned this earlier, there's just that reconnection that remodeling of their home, upgrading their home, adding the service to their home is something that they're doing and they want that in their home, and so we believe those customers will stay on the Vivint platform for a longer period of time. Yes. No, I don't -- we don't believe -- again, I'll just kind of give you the range, I think, for the end of this year. We don't -- and we'll give you next year. But we don't believe that 14.5% to 15% is it's -- you could take that off the table, I guess, is the best way to say it. We think we're somewhere again in this 12.5% to 13% range this year. And then we'll see what happens next year. Again, if things continue to perform as they are today, it's been -- we're going to be in that 13-ish range. But we don't think that we're going to see this spike back up to kind of that 14% -- north of 14- ish, 15% range."

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Nate Stubbs, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nNate Stubbs: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us this afternoon to discuss the results of Vivint Smart Home for the three and six-month period ending June 30, 2020. Joining me on the conference call this afternoon are Todd Pedersen, Vivint Smart Home\u2019s, Chief Executive Officer and Dale R. Gerard, Vivint\u2019s CFO. I would like to begin by reminding everyone that the discussion today may contain forward-looking statements, including with regards to the company\u2019s future performance and prospects. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of performance. You should not put undue reliance on these statements. You should understand that the following important factors, in addition to those discussed in the Risk Factors section in our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2019, and in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q issued in fiscal year 2020, including for the quarter period ended June 30, 2020, which is expected to be filed on or about the date of this earnings call, as such, factors may be updated from time to time in company\u2019s periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could affect our future results and could cause those results or other outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In today\u2019s remarks, we will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures for historical periods to the most comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are available in the earnings release and accompanying presentation, which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. I will now turn the call over to Todd.\nTodd Pedersen : Thanks, Nate, and good afternoon to everyone joining the call. I hope everyone continues to be healthy and safe in the current environment. Today, we will cover three main topics. One, discuss our strong financial and operating results for the second quarter; two, review our success in optimizing our portfolio economics and the resilient performance of a recurring revenue platform; and three, talk about the strong demand for our services as homeowners have spent more time focused on reconnecting with their homes. We\u2019ve done a great job as an organization navigating the challenges and uncertainties encountered during the first half of 2020. And we are very pleased with the significant improvements across all our key metrics in Q2. Revenue and total subscribers continue to grow at a steady pace, reflecting healthy demand for our smart home and security solutions despite a pause in our direct-to-home sales efforts for the first six weeks of the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margins continue to expand meaningfully and we now expect to be cash flow positive in 2020. Dale will dive into more specifics on the financial results in his remarks and he will also share updated thoughts on the full-year outlook, which we are revising upward given recent momentum in the business. Vivint now delivers smart home and security services to more than 1.6 million customers across North America. Our incredible results during what has been an extremely challenging time supports what we\u2019ve said all along. The customers value the peace of mind that our fully integrated services offer and that our high-margin recurring revenue model is built not only to be resilient, but also to thrive in the current environment. This is a time when people are reconnecting with their homes and we believe that Vivint is perfectly positioned for what could be a lasting change. In fact live video views through the Vivint app and panel increased by 19%, and the views of recorded video increased by 15% from Q1 to Q2. Although our customer value proposition is clear, our ability to add nearly 108,000 new smart home subscribers during the quarter is remarkable, given the fact that we paused all direct-to-home sales from mid-March to early May. We discontinued all direct-to-home sales activities in Canada and we mostly eliminated the number of new customers we generate from retail installment contracts. Despite these self-imposed limitations, new subscribers were off by just 3% from a year ago when no constraints are in place. Our national inside sales team, on the other hand, hasn\u2019t missed a beat and continue to see strong demand in the quarter, generating 25% year-over-year growth in new subscribers. We resumed direct-to-home sales in early May, as states around the country begin reopening their economies. Aside from the delayed start, our summer sales program is proceeding well and we\u2019re actually seeing productivity gains versus the prior year. Another powerful tailwind is that we\u2019re funding virtually all new customers through our paid-in-full or third-party financing with Vivint Flex Pay. This allows us to bring on new subscribers in a much more capital efficient way. Our external financing partners have remained committed to underwriting high volumes of high credit quality smart home customers. And we believe we have a significant edge versus our competitors by providing customers with options to easily finance a full smart home experience, while also dramatically improving our unit economics and cash flow dynamics. The nearly half point decrease in attrition this quarter is another standout result and frankly beat our internal plan by a significant margin. This speaks to the fact that our core value proposition proven over two decades of taking care of our customers and their families is as relevant as ever, as people are reconnecting with their homes in the current environment. Today we have well over 20 million connected devices on a proprietary cloud-based platform that enables customers to seamlessly manage and protect their homes. We believe we are uniquely qualified to help our customers deal with the current environment across the various smart home devices we support from door locks, outdoor and indoor cameras, thermostats, lighting controls, smart speakers, garage doors and many other connected devices. We recently announced a partnership with Chamberlain, the leading garage door manufacturer to integrate myQ Smart Garage technology into our platform. Vivint customers with a myQ Smart Garage can now control secure and monitor their garage anytime from anywhere using the Vivint Smart Home app. All these innovative products are designed to work together seamlessly through our elegant platform that homeowners can control from their in-home touchscreen hub through a single app on their phone or by simply using the voice. Our improved guidance for the full year underscores the confidence we have in our high-margin recurring revenue model. We are seeing healthy demand across all our sales channels for our smart home and security offerings and we are fully prepared to meet that demand. We continue to be judicious around overhead spend, budget and projects, and we now believe that we will be cash flow positive in 2020. To that point, we generated $111 million in cash from operating activities in the second quarter alone. We\u2019re excited to continue reporting our progress on this front. Before concluding my remarks, in light of recent events nationwide, I believe it\u2019s important to express how much we value diversity and inclusion at Vivint. The issues of racial inequity and injustice are significant and we must all take ownership of these issues. We can start by simply listening to each other, engage in productive conversations, re-examining our own views and actions, and ultimately being part of the positive change. I will now turn the call over to Dale to go through specifics of our strong second quarter results, as well as provide our updated guidance for 2020.\nDale Gerard: Thanks, Todd. I\u2019ll walk through the financial slide portion of the presentation that we posted today in conjunction with our earnings release. Overall, results were very strong across the board and this outperformance informs our decision to raise our guidance range for the full year, which I\u2019ll cover later. But first on slide seven, we highlight our revenue for the second quarter six-month period ended June 30. For the second quarter 2020, revenue grew by 8.9% to $306 million. The growth in revenue is attributable to a 6.8% increase in total subscribers as well as a 2.1% increase in the average monthly revenue per user. Our average monthly revenue per user was up $1.31 in the quarter versus last year. Moving to slide eight. Adjusted EBITDA has scaled significantly in the second quarter and six-month periods. The drivers were lower selling expenses and net service costs and continued scaling of our G&A. For the quarter, we are proud to have expanded adjusted EBITDA margins by 2000 basis points to 49.9% of revenue compared to 31.4% in the second quarter of 2019. This is clearly a great result overall and a function of a lot of hard work by our entire organization. Due to some seasonality inherent in our business, we wouldn\u2019t necessarily anticipate sustained full-year margins at that high level. It should be noted, for example, that the lower service costs we saw in the second quarter was due in part to fewer service calls and truck rolls due to concerns over COVID-19, while we do believe to be sustainable on a number of cost reduction initiatives that we completed during the first quarter and then are expected to meaningfully reduce G&A and overhead costs by streamlining our operations, focusing engineering and innovation, and driving better customer satisfaction. In addition to these actions and because analyzing how we operate more efficiently is a continuous exercise at Vivint, we initiated another round of focused cost-cutting during the second quarter to further reduce our discretionary spend. As a result of these actions, we have achieved greater than $30 million in permanent annualized fixed cost reductions. Meanwhile, covenant adjusted EBITDA, which is the calculation used for our debt covenants, was $200.5 million in the period, scaling by $45 million compared to $155.3 million in the second quarter 2019. As you look on slide nine, we highlight a few data points for the subscriber portfolio which were strong across the board. Total subscribers at quarter end grew from 1.51 million to 1.61 million year-over-year or 6.8%. Average Monthly Revenue per User, or AMRU, also increased to $64.66, up 2.1% year-over-year. AMRU has been growing from the recognition of deferred revenue and effective cost selling of new products, such as our newest generation of outdoor and doorbell cameras. On the next slide, slide 10, we highlight a few points on new subscribers. New subscriber originations were 107,980 for the second quarter, which was quite resilient considering that direct-to-home sales were paused in the U.S. for the early part of the quarter. We discontinued all direct-to-home sales in Canada during the quarter and we reduced a number of retail installment contracts or RICs by over 89%. One last point, by shifting a greater portion of our subscribers away from RICs and toward our third-party financing partners and pay-in-full, we are able to grow the point of sale revenue, thus reducing our net subscriber acquisition costs and significantly improving our cash flow dynamics. As we look to the future, we will continue to align the organization on delivering a true smart home experience to millions of homes in a profitable and cash efficient way. Moving to slide 11, we will cover our net service cost per subscriber and net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber. The reduction across both these key metrics continue to be a significant driver of our earnings improvement during the second quarter of 2020. We\u2019ve continued our trend of year-over-year improvements in net service cost per subscriber, moving from $16.71 in the second quarter of 2018 to $13.13 in the second quarter of 2019, and now to $9.93 in the most recent quarter, a $6.78 improvement versus 2018. This represents the lowest service cost per subscriber in the last ten years by a significant margin and it demonstrates the advantage of Vivint\u2019s fully integrated smart home cloud platform, which encompasses the software, the hardware, the installation and ongoing customer support. The result is that our net service margin continued its increasing trend moving from 68.6% in the second quarter of 2018 to 75.2% in the second quarter of 2019, and now 80.2% in the most recent quarter. These efforts contributed greatly to the improvement seen in our adjusted EBITDA. It\u2019s important to note here that given the seasonality of how we generally put on new customers, particularly in the summer, we tend to see service costs increase in the back half of the year. Additionally, as mentioned before, we believe service calls were abnormally low in the second quarter due to concerns over the coronavirus. So while we\u2019re really excited and encouraged by the current trends and the corresponding benefits to the margins that we are seeing, we wouldn\u2019t anticipate sustained full-year results at that level. On the right hand side of slide 11, we highlight the recent trend on our average net new subscriber acquisition cost. For the LTM period ended June 30, 2020, net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber decreased to $630. That\u2019s 40.8% lower compared to the prior LTM period, as we have nearly eliminated the number of new subscribers that are financed on a Vivint retail instalment contract and shifted to a higher mix of customers, utilizing our financing partners or paying in full for the purchase of their smart home products. During the quarter, we also benefited from pricing leverage on the point of sale purchase and installation of equipment. Moving on to slide 12. Slide 12 is a normal subscriber walk to illustrate the changes in total subscribers at quarter end. The biggest and most pleasant surprise was a reversal in attrition, which was lower sequentially for the first time in nine quarters. It is worth reiterating that our attrition has trended higher than our historical averages, given the higher percentage of customers that are in the end-of-term life cycle phase. First, the attrition rate for a customer cohort changes as it progresses through different phases of the life cycle. We define these phases as in-term, end-of-term and post initial term. Each phase carries with it a corresponding expected attrition rate, with attrition at its highest during the end-of-term phase. As we have shared in the past earnings calls, the cohort attrition curves remain fairly steady. The second factor that affects attrition is the percent of total customers in each stage of their life cycle. The percent of customers in the end-of-term phase rose in 2019 and will stay elevated in 2020 before beginning to fall in 2021. In the second quarter, attrition reversed course and was lower sequentially by 40 basis points to 13.7%. This still remains higher than our long-term trend for attrition, but was much better than our expectations given the higher percentage of customers that are in the end-of-term phase. And for what it\u2019s worth, our portfolio has continued to perform better than expectations in terms of attrition and other leading indicators through the end of July. Now we know there is a lot of curiosity out there regarding how we think our attrition curve may change as a result of the pandemic. The news on this front is all positive at least thus far. As to the potential drivers, our past experience through severe economic downturns, combined with the unique effects of the current pandemic and leading more people to reconnect with their homes and place tremendous value on our smart home solutions, as well as the general propensity for customers to focus inward and prioritize home security during times of crisis are some of the main factors that come to mind. Before we move to our updated outlook for the year, I\u2019ll point out that several factors tied to our strong second quarter performance leave us feeling very good about our overall liquidity position, which stood at approximately $478 million as of June 30. Our second quarter was strong from an operating cash flow perspective. For the three months ended June 30, we generated $111 million in net cash from operating activities compared to a use of $88 million for the same period in 2019. The strength in cash generation has carried through the end of July and we have repaid all of the outstanding amounts on our revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we also saw approximately $6.6 million of warrants exercised, which has a positive impact on our cash position and it increased our public float as well. Finally, let\u2019s move to slide 13 where I will address our updated financial outlook for the year. Over 95% of our revenue is recurring, which provides long-term visibility and predictability to our business. Most of our new subscribers that finance their smart home chooses to enter into a five-year contract and remain on the platform for approximately eight years, driving significant lifetime margin dollars. Despite the many uncertainties pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic, our reoccurring revenue model has proven resilient to any of the major downsides and we are comfortable with essentially restoring our original guidance for subscribers and revenue that we provided in early March before the country went on lockdown. Meanwhile, our strong unit economics and scale have contributed to our ability to drive significant adjusted EBITDA improvement. And that is reflected in our updated range. In terms of revised guidance based on our stronger than expected second quarter performance, solid demand for our products and services and having the full complement of sales channels available to acquire new Vivint customers, we expect to end 2020 with 1.62 million to 1.68 million total subscribers versus previous guidance of 1.55 million to 1.62 million. Our estimate for 2020 revenue is $1.23 billion to $1.28 billion versus previous guidance of $1.20 billion to $1.25 billion. And finally, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to between $555 million and $565 million versus previous guidance between $525 million and $535 million. Operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nPaul Coster: Wow, that was pretty awesome. Hard to kick this one apart, it was such a good news under the circumstances, really quite impressive. So Todd, you said you\u2019re going to be cash flow positive in 2020, so you are ahead of expectations. Is it sustainable? Or is the -- does this feel like just, for instance, the RIC number was also just so low. And I\u2019m just wondering, do you think all of this is sustainable?\nTodd Pedersen: Yes, we actually do believe it\u2019s sustainable. And as Dale mentioned, the reduction of RICs led to that number. And by the way, side note to the reduction of RICs, should -- we should see over time an improvement in attrition number on this pool of accounts that we put on this -- the underwriting on this year\u2019s book of business is outstanding. But yes, it is sustainable. We\u2019ve made some very good changes to the business and I think one that\u2019s listened to us. This is not -- this didn\u2019t just happen. We\u2019ve been working on the changes to the business models of the company, the cost structure for quite some time now and this just kind of a revelation of what we\u2019ve been intending to do. So, I think the answer is yes, it\u2019s sustainable.\nPaul Coster: Right. Got it. And then, of course, I mean, is it a competition or is it a validation where Google seems to be trying to help ADT catch up with you a bit, what does that mean to you?\nTodd Pedersen: Well, I think you hit it on the head. It\u2019s absolutely a validation of the model that Vivint delivers into the market, Smart Home as a Service. It absolutely requires great tech. But in the need for -- install ongoing service and providing the bulk of them is critically important to delivering really an elegant situation within. And so, yes, we\u2019re upbeat. When I read the news, honestly, -- that\u2019s great. We\u2019ve been saying all these all along. This is a huge TAM, is a huge opportunity and someone with the likes of Google investing into this space that you\u2019re in, you got to be -- that\u2019s got to be a good thing for us.\nPaul Coster: Okay, great, Thanks so much.\nTodd Pedersen: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nRod Hall: Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. Likewise, nice job in a tough environment. Couple of questions for you. I wanted to start off with the new subscriber linearity and see if you could give us some idea of how that flowed through the quarter? And then secondly, just wondering if you could give us any idea as what attrition might look like as you look forward through the rest of the year. If you can give us any kind of idea for what you\u2019re thinking on attrition in the next couple of quarters that would be useful. Thank you.\nDale Gerard: Yes, this is Dale. Hey, Rod. Thanks for joining. I think in terms of subscribers is tough. As we said, we had -- direct-to-home was really paused for the first six weeks of the quarter. So we really started rolling out direct-to-home to the different locations around the second week of May. And we saw a very quick ramp from those teams and continue to see really good production from those teams across all offices, across all states that we\u2019re in. And we\u2019re in most states that we wanted to be in. There is not like areas that we didn\u2019t go to. You roll teams out to where we expected to go out to. And they seem to be reporting well. And then when you look at inside sales, inside sales was really strong in the first quarter and that carried right into the second quarter. That\u2019s a more kind of ratable in terms of -- those are leads coming in from SEO and different referrals and so forth. And that volume and that demand has been very, very strong across the full -- for the full quarter. So we\u2019re seeing that demand continue into the third quarter here. And then, go ahead, Todd.\nTodd Pedersen: Well, the one thing I want to note and this is very important and again it\u2019s been mentioned already, but the fact that we\u2019ve put the numbers up that we have proven very substantial demand from consumers for the Vivint Smart Home offering. We are not on boarding new customers in Canada, which was a decent percentage of our overall business in the past, and then the elimination of RICs and also the pause on direct-to-home. When you look at it on the whole and you don\u2019t know the past, it looks good, considering, like you said, the environment. But when you really add it up together, the performance of Vivint in Q2 was outstanding. It\u2019s hard to describe how happy we are about how we\u2019re positioned, the consumer view on the product and services that we offer, the value we provide and really demand coming into the company.\nDale Gerard: And then just to touch quickly on your question around attrition. I mean, attrition again, we were very, very happy with how the attrition performed in the second quarter. We again think that\u2019s how people are really reconnecting with their homes, really valuing the services that we offer. And we\u2019re seeing the engagement with the platform, even though people are at home, the engagement is as high or higher than what we\u2019ve seen in previous quarters, because people are using it. Just a different way, they\u2019re using the cameras more. They\u2019re engaging more throughout their home with that, with the system. For example, like having deliveries to your front door, being able to use your door-up camera to talk to those people, see what packages are dropped off. Those types of interactions with the system we\u2019re seeing more and more, now that people are actually kind of in their homes and wanting to understand who is coming through that front door or what\u2019s being left at that front door. But we\u2019re also cautious about attrition. In terms of -- we still have a higher percentage of customers in their kind of end-of-term life cycle. That\u2019s still about 20% of our portfolio. And we know those customers normally perform at or have higher attrition, when they\u2019re in that kind of phase of their life cycle. And then we\u2019re also cautious about the economy in the second half. And so what I would tell you from attrition is we think it\u2019s performing really, really well right now. But we\u2019re also cautious as to what it will look like in the -- for the rest of the year, but we're feeling rather confident that we're seeing good performance out of it and will continue through the rest of the year.\nRod Hall: Okay, great. Well, thanks for that. And congrats again on the numbers. Thank you.\nTodd Pedersen: Thank you.\nDale Gerard: Thanks, Rod.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open.\nAmit Daryanani: I guess a couple for me as well. Maybe to start off with on the net subscriber acquisition costs. That came in a lot lower than I think we were modeling at least. And it sounds like it really reflected the fact that you were able to raise pricing on the upfront cost. Was there any other factors that were at play as well that dropped this number down? And I'm just wondering, if you start to raise the pricing for these starter packs, do you think that impedes demand of your subscriber growth eventually?\nTodd Pedersen: Yes. So obviously, we did change the pricing in our starter kit package. And it was incredibly well received from the consumer. And from a consumer's point of view, the dollars they're paying between ourselves and our financing partner does -- had really didn't change. It changes the balance of it, but it doesn't change the actual dollars paid on a monthly basis. And then I would just say that our performance spoke for itself when it comes to demand. It was increased demand, elevated numbers better performance on a per rep average for the direct-to-home program. And again, Dale spoke to the inside sales group and their performance year-over-year. So absolutely did not affect demand from consumers.\nDale Gerard: And then, it's been -- this is Dale. The other point of driving down kind of that net SAC is the fact that we reduced RICs of about -- almost 90% year-over-year. And that's not just a one-time kind of, hey, we did that in the second quarter. Our goal once we started rolling out Flex Pay and bringing on the finance partners was to bring RICs down to essentially zero. We'll have -- probably have some RICs as we go, but that's another big driver of the fact that we were able to take RICs down. And if you recall, RICs, just real quick is, as the -- as their contracts with Vivint is put in our balance sheet, we basically get no money upfront from those customers. So by being able to lower those substantially and move more of that upfront to our financing partners or to the customer actually paying in full for out of their own account, that's enabled us also to bring that net SAC down.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. That's really helpful. And then if I could just follow up, when I look at the new subscriber numbers and I completely understand how difficult Q2 was, right, it was down 3% I think or something like that, the new subscriber growth number, I'm curious if you look at maybe the month of June or the six weeks where you were not in a complete shutdown, what did that trend line look like? And then any indication in terms of how that's looked in the month of July as well?\nTodd Pedersen: So, we probably won't get that granular. But again, when I'd try to reiterate this. When you look at the numbers on an apples-to-apples basis, if you compare to the customers we underwrote in 2019 to 2020, the fact that we're only down 3% net subscriber adds is outs -- when I say outstanding, it's beyond outstanding. We eliminated 12% of the customers we would have underwritten last year and did not this year and still attain that. And on a revenue basis, because of the increase in revenue per subscriber per month, we actually were ahead of last year. So I can't reiterate this enough that it was just a tremendous quarter. And I would say the trend continues. So we can't get too granular on what's happening currently and going forward. But we feel like we're in a very positive situation. It's due to a lot of factors, but really consumer demand increased -- Dale mentioned this, people are really reconnecting with their home and we're seeing the benefits of that. We're one of those companies that really is having a positive effect from the fact that people are home, are looking at their home as their new environment and that we think that might be a lasting change over time.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. Last one from me and I'll leave after this. Given the better free cash flow expectations for the year, do we think about the company wanting to delever more quickly? Or how do you think about capital usage, given the fact this free cash flow positivity is getting pulled in a fair amount? That would be great. And congrats on a good quarter, guys.\nDale Gerard: Yes. Thanks. I think in terms of how we think about the cash flow, I mean, we continue -- we've said all along we wanted to kind of get to cash flow neutral this year. We're way ahead of our original projections of 12 to 18 months. And then we've also laid out a goal to be three times or less on a leverage ratio, on an EBITDA-to-debt ratio. So I think we'll look at that the cash that we have continued to generate and we'll look at how we want to use that cash, whether that's to pay down debt or to make other investments into the company, whether that's new products, new services. We don't -- Todd has talked about this quarter, we don't really have a brand out there. And so do we want to actually go spend some money on branding the company, which we think would even drive more customers to the growth overall for a long-term vision, so we'll decide how we go. But we're very, very excited about the fact we're able to kind of get this cash flow positive in the second quarter and we believe that will continue throughout the rest of the year. Yes. The last thing, I just recalled, and I said this on the -- as part of my remarks, we get paid down the revolver. We had $105 million outstanding on revolver at end of June and we did pay that down in July. And so we were able to kind of pay that revolver fully back and we're setting cash on the balance sheet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital. Your line is open.\nJeff Kessler: Thank you. And hello, gentlemen.\nTodd Pedersen: How are you doing?\nDale Gerard: Hi, Jeff.\nJeff Kessler: I'm doing good, doing good. And I am connecting with my home. One of the -- I'm wondering if the time that -- the downtime for your direct-to-home group, both the temporary period in the U.S. and the still ongoing period, I guess, in Canada, have you spent any of that time you want to call tinkering or fine-tuning what you want to add to that group and how that group actually goes to market and how they sell?\nTodd Pedersen: That's actually interesting that you would ask. But we actually did and we actually had some -- I'm not going to dig in, because I would say they're more experiments at how they engage and can engage with different types of inbound demand from consumers. But we did. We had to do it kind of overnight as all companies did when the shutdown happened. But we had positive results and I would say it's informing us a bit to how we might think about expanding our sales force, workforce engagement with consumers over time. And, as Dale mentioned, we hope to, at some point, maybe even this year start to build the brand and increase the inbound demand and really knowledge of Vivint's services. I mean, the reality is on an unaided awareness basis, less than 5% of American households even know who we are and what we do. And so, and as part of that test, we think there are some really tremendous opportunities to utilize that group, if additional demand does come in and be really efficient with those needs or increase around of Vivint's services. So yes.\nJeff Kessler: Has there been an app or a set of apps, and I know it's probably going to end up in video, but is there -- have you been able to get better sales per -- particularly on the initial package by doing anything with -- by stressing or changing the stress of different apps as the year has gone on? Because this has been a different year effectively in terms -- than we've seen in a long time. Is it -- are there types of video applications or the types of video that have really allowed you to sell a little bit better than you had before? And is it just video, because there could be some other things, there could be another partner is kind of silent helpers in there that would have helped you?\nTodd Pedersen: Yes. So, here is what I would say, definitely video is a major driver in increased demand for what we do. And there is no one that does it like we do it. I mean, with the professional install, our own proprietary hub, platform, technology stack, kind of the feedback loop, ability to service ongoing with the customer, there isn't anyone anywhere in the realm of the quality of service delivery that we have, connectivity and otherwise. But we did -- we have seen an increased demand in just the general peace of mind of what we provide. And that's viewed or I guess kind of displays itself in the engagement from our consumers with their app. This isn't us emailing them things that we've seen or we know or data that we're showing. This is actual engagement, user engagement in live video views, recorded video views, arm/disarm of the system and the different functionality inside of the system. So I would say there are no other outside apps that are helping push. I think this is becoming very kind of obvious to us and we believe this for a while that this is a huge market segment. We think that 80-plus percent penetration in the U.S. households is very attainable. We're not going to state, well, how many years we think that is, it would be a guess. But the demand is gaining momentum and people's interest in having the smart home that's provided by a premium service provider like Vivint is very much in demand and will be a large market.\nJeff Kessler: Okay. And finally, with regard to the market itself, it does seem as if young people moving out of the city or moving out of urban areas into the suburbs, getting into homes and larger homes are beginning to realize that DIY does not necessarily suffice particularly if they need monitoring for a larger home with whatever it is, from 15 to 40 zones. Are you finding that there is an attitudinal change as you talk about people getting more in touch with their homes? There is also on movement of people, what I would call it a de-urbanization, a little bit because of this?\nTodd Pedersen: Well, I think that's an interesting observation. Here is a couple of notes. One, we provide a DIY-able product and service currently. We are not talking about the numbers on that, but we actually do. The amazing thing for our customers or potential customers is that we can also back that up with truck rolls, answering the phone, technical service capabilities on the back end. So we can kind of end-to-end. However, someone wants to take delivery of our services, we can provide that and for very, very good value with the highest quality of products and services, and reliability for that matter. But it's interesting because DIY is brought up quite consistently to us in this space. And yet, you see Google who has DIY-able products that they've had for quite some time is now realizing that in order to really address the big market that Vivint is addressing, they need to combine up with a company that has the capabilities to go inside of people's homes and deliver service on an ongoing basis in a professional way. That's to say if they want to compete with us really on a grand scale. And then last thing is I'd say about DIY, that's an interesting thing even to my personal life. Through COVID, I didn't even -- I had never used some of the delivery -- food delivery services in the past. Now, that's all we do. So, I don't even go get my own food anymore. It's delivered to me. And so it's -- and I don't mow my lawn, I don't wash my car. No, I don't want to sound lazy. But I have other things done for me and I just don't think that consumers who want a really deep experience with a smart home want to be the CIO or technician of their home to manage 15, 20, 30, 40 devices, which is absolutely happening. People are adding more and more cameras and thermostats and door locks. And the connectivity is going deeper and deeper into the home. And so we couldn't be happier about the position that we're in and the fact that we are a market leader.\nJeff Kessler: Okay. Well, I'm sorry, but one quick final question from me. And that is because you brought up an interesting point here, which I deal with all of this -- with all my coverage here. And that is you've talked about service a lot and you talked about the cost of servicing customers. As you become more complex and you have become more complex, how are you -- what are you doing to make sure that your service levels keep up with the complexity that is demanded of you so that at the other end, it's still an easy integration in their minds to how to use the system and have the -- let's just say, have the tech explain to them in easy-to-use fashion? What they can do, what they can't do when you're going from five devices out up to 30 devices?\nTodd Pedersen: This is really important and this is where Vivint really shines. This -- the fact that we own our operating system, that we in-house develop that, our hub, our platform and again, we do integrate. Everyone on the platform knows that we will integrate best-in-class products into our platform. But we take it upon ourselves to make sure that we control that process and that data flow and the connectivity, because the -- if you're installing a doorbell camera, for instance, that's not too difficult to install and not too much to manage. But you start adding more like -- as you mentioned, more and more devices, connectivity becomes more and more of an issue. The demand on your WiFi gets greater and greater. And allows the unfortunate potential for things to go wrong. Now, with our feedback loop and the fact that our engineering team, software, firmware, hardware design, installation platform, service platform, network, you have this incredible feedback loop that's very immediate by the way. I mean, we obviously tracked and there is 1.5 billion pieces of data daily coming through our AI system. We are watching every last thing that's happening when it comes to service delivered to consumer. Because that -- at the end of the day, if it's not great, service levels aren't great, attrition is going to go through the roof. And you could theorize that going from $16, which we had per sub per month in service cost to $9.93 over two-year period, our service levels would go down substantially and therefore attrition would go up, the reverse has happened. We've done both, reduced our service cost per sub per month, not a little bit, substantially. And then also our service levels are not just maintained well, they're better and they're more enhanced. And that speaks through our attrition numbers that you're seeing, which, by the way, are better than we had hoped for. And we've done this business for a very, very long time and the great thing is it's a very predictable model. But this just -- it just so happens that as we continue to release new hubs, new firmware, new software releases, new installation protocols that we just get better and better and better at that delivery of service and connectivity and quality of service. And it reduces truck rolls and the need to keep up with service demands. If things work, you don't have to answer phones, you don't have to roll trucks. And it just so happens that we are best in class by quite a margin when it comes to those sorts of things.\nJeff Kessler: Okay. Well, thanks, Todd, and thanks, Dale, and thanks, Nate. I appreciate it.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Shweta Khajuria with RBC. Your line is open.\nShweta Khajuria: Okay. Thank you. Let me try two please. When we think about service costs, you said that you expect cost to increase in the back half because of dramatic reduction in the quarter from your calls due to COVID. Could you talk about the sustainability of those costs, and not only in the back half, but just generally as we think for the outer years? And then a similar question on EBITDA margins. How should we think about the potential for margin expansion going forward? The margins are already at pretty elevated levels. Even barring this quarter, your guide implies very healthy EBITDA margin. So help us think about the potential for expansion going forward? Thank you.\nDale Gerard: Yes, thanks. I think if you think about servicing costs, I think if you looked at the mid to high 70% margins is kind of where we think. I don't want to really quote a quarter dollar, I'd give you a service margin based on what we think. But we think in that 75-ish percent range is probably where we'll see kind of servicing costs come back in the second half of the year. And the reason why it's a little bit more, as you know, we put on a lot of our customers in a 90-day period. And there is always follow-up and service needs. So there are more service calls in that third quarter and just going into the fourth quarter just related to those new installs. And then again in the second quarter, I think we had a lot of times where we had where the calls into call center and into truck rolls were just decreased related around COVID. People not wanting people to come to their homes or -- and I think it goes back also to Todd's point is we have this fully integrated system that we can help, like we can solve a lot of problems over the phone. So when somebody does call in, we can actually log in to help, log remotely into their panel, resolve a lot of the issues, without having to send a truck or sending someone out to their home, which is really important.\nShweta Khajuria: Okay. And then on the margins, please?\nDale Gerard: Yes, on the margins, I think again, we thought we'd be in that, call it, low to mid 40% EBITDA margins. And I think that's again, when you look at the rest of this year, if you looked at on a full-year basis, I think that's kind of where we are. We're continuing and I think Todd said this and I've said this is we're always looking at ways to optimize in the business and optimize the scale what we have. And so we'll continue to look at that. When you look at it quarter over quarter or for the full year, we're probably looking in that low to mid 40% range.\nShweta Khajuria: Okay. Thank you very much.\nDale Gerard: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kunal Madhukar with DB. Your line is open.\nKunal Madhukar: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Great quarter. I had a couple. One, on the service cost side, wanted to understand how it is broken down between truck rolls, the people that are manning the -- or doing the monitoring part, and then the customer service side? And then on the attrition, wanted to get a sense of how much of the attrition is from moves versus not being built and what have you versus any other reason or switching to competitors?\nTodd Pedersen: Yes. So, we actually don't break the numbers out on the service cost per sub per month down to the actual -- the action that's happening inside of that structure. We just haven't done that and that probably wouldn't be detail that we would dig into. And then so we are just really hopefully and you are also incredibly happy with the results. But we probably gained some efficiencies across the board in all of those actions. And again, back to Vivint's owning of our operating system and technology, and hub development, software firmware releases, these all a result of not just what's happening today in the current environment. This is -- these are investments that we've made into our technology, service delivery, installation protocols over the years. And then there is how we answer phones and training down to the individual person. So there is a lot of things that go into the reduction of our service costs. And then when it comes to the attrition numbers with moves, we also don't want to break that out. I hate giving you that answer on both of those, but we just don't break those out in detail.\nKunal Madhukar: That's cool. A follow-up if I may. How do you think with -- and maybe this is -- maybe this might be just the thing about the landscape, but how do you think Google's partnership with ADT kind of changes, how alarm.com become -- which is the operating system for a number of your competitors, how does that change alarm.com and how they operate especially with like Google coming in with its tech stack and everything else?\nTodd Pedersen: What I would say is I'm not sure with the arrangement is and so you would really need to ask them about this, but getting back to Vivint, the fact that we own our platform, we developed it. And look, we've spent tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars on that alone and do annually on the maintenance and the improvement of that user experience. And the fact that it's fully integrated to our hub in our platform, I'm glad that we're Vivint and we own what we own, which is everything end-to-end and we don't depend on other hardware developers and providers, other platform or app or operating system providers. I'm very -- we've -- and look, our investors Blackstone and others have been very gracious over the years in allowing us to make sure that we own and control that entire technology stack, and it's proving to be very relevant -- and not just relevant, it's critical that we do have that and own that.\nKunal Madhukar: Great. Thank you.\nTodd Pedersen: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Todd Morgan with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nTodd Morgan: Thank you. Great results. Two things. Number one is a couple of companies have talked about supply chain issues in sourcing materials from overseas. And I know you guys typically would stock up early in the year. I don't know if given the very high subscriber adds that you're getting any kind of shortage or any difficulties in that front. And I guess, secondly, is if I look at the net subscriber acquisition costs $630, really great number. I mean, that's down by a third just even sequentially. If I think about the drivers that you called out, Dale, with the higher -- slightly higher package prices and really reduction in the RIC subscribers. Should that not continue to sort of ratchet down pretty rapidly here as you get into the third quarter, which is another big subscriber add quarter? Thanks.\nDale Gerard: Yes. Thanks. So two things. We'll start with the supply chain. You're right. We -- based upon the way we do our business and preparing for what I would call the second, third quarter where we put on most of our accounts, we do, do a lot of pre-buy and make sure we have inventory in place based on what we think we're going to do or install for that period. And so we've not really seen any, any disruption in terms of our supply chain. We have a really good Chief Procurement Officer and we're constantly working with all of our vendors in making sure our manufacture -- contract manufacturers make sure that we have product available to our technicians and to our sales reps, so we can install those when we need that. In the terms of the net subscriber acquisition costs, you are right. Based upon where -- what we said we were going to do in terms of how we structure our current pricing model, the fact that we've reduced RICs and we continue to see that reduction go forward, you should continue to see that's -- where it's $630, if you kind of run the math out, you would expect that to continue to come down as we roll in as we report probably third quarter and so forth.\nTodd Morgan: Great, thank you.\nDale Gerard: Thanks. See you, Todd.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.\nTodd Pedersen: Yes. So, we appreciate everyone getting on the phone call for our Q2 numbers. We were happy with the results. We hope all of you were also. And just know that management is very focused on the current economic environment, making sure that we're being cautious about any upcoming economic -- continued downturns impact or individual subscribers, customers or underwriting in their cost structure and investments. So we're -- we look forward to getting on the phone with you all again in Q3. So thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Todd Pedersen",
            "content": "Thanks, Nate, and good afternoon to everyone joining the call. I hope everyone continues to be healthy and safe in the current environment. Today, we will cover three main topics. One, discuss our strong financial and operating results for the second quarter; two, review our success in optimizing our portfolio economics and the resilient performance of a recurring revenue platform; and three, talk about the strong demand for our services as homeowners have spent more time focused on reconnecting with their homes. We've done a great job as an organization navigating the challenges and uncertainties encountered during the first half of 2020. And we are very pleased with the significant improvements across all our key metrics in Q2. Revenue and total subscribers continue to grow at a steady pace, reflecting healthy demand for our smart home and security solutions despite a pause in our direct-to-home sales efforts for the first six weeks of the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margins continue to expand meaningfully and we now expect to be cash flow positive in 2020. Dale will dive into more specifics on the financial results in his remarks and he will also share updated thoughts on the full-year outlook, which we are revising upward given recent momentum in the business. Vivint now delivers smart home and security services to more than 1.6 million customers across North America. Our incredible results during what has been an extremely challenging time supports what we've said all along. The customers value the peace of mind that our fully integrated services offer and that our high-margin recurring revenue model is built not only to be resilient, but also to thrive in the current environment. This is a time when people are reconnecting with their homes and we believe that Vivint is perfectly positioned for what could be a lasting change. In fact live video views through the Vivint app and panel increased by 19%, and the views of recorded video increased by 15% from Q1 to Q2. Although our customer value proposition is clear, our ability to add nearly 108,000 new smart home subscribers during the quarter is remarkable, given the fact that we paused all direct-to-home sales from mid-March to early May. We discontinued all direct-to-home sales activities in Canada and we mostly eliminated the number of new customers we generate from retail installment contracts. Despite these self-imposed limitations, new subscribers were off by just 3% from a year ago when no constraints are in place. Our national inside sales team, on the other hand, hasn't missed a beat and continue to see strong demand in the quarter, generating 25% year-over-year growth in new subscribers. We resumed direct-to-home sales in early May, as states around the country begin reopening their economies. Aside from the delayed start, our summer sales program is proceeding well and we're actually seeing productivity gains versus the prior year. Another powerful tailwind is that we're funding virtually all new customers through our paid-in-full or third-party financing with Vivint Flex Pay. This allows us to bring on new subscribers in a much more capital efficient way. Our external financing partners have remained committed to underwriting high volumes of high credit quality smart home customers. And we believe we have a significant edge versus our competitors by providing customers with options to easily finance a full smart home experience, while also dramatically improving our unit economics and cash flow dynamics. The nearly half point decrease in attrition this quarter is another standout result and frankly beat our internal plan by a significant margin. This speaks to the fact that our core value proposition proven over two decades of taking care of our customers and their families is as relevant as ever, as people are reconnecting with their homes in the current environment. Today we have well over 20 million connected devices on a proprietary cloud-based platform that enables customers to seamlessly manage and protect their homes. We believe we are uniquely qualified to help our customers deal with the current environment across the various smart home devices we support from door locks, outdoor and indoor cameras, thermostats, lighting controls, smart speakers, garage doors and many other connected devices. We recently announced a partnership with Chamberlain, the leading garage door manufacturer to integrate myQ Smart Garage technology into our platform. Vivint customers with a myQ Smart Garage can now control secure and monitor their garage anytime from anywhere using the Vivint Smart Home app. All these innovative products are designed to work together seamlessly through our elegant platform that homeowners can control from their in-home touchscreen hub through a single app on their phone or by simply using the voice. Our improved guidance for the full year underscores the confidence we have in our high-margin recurring revenue model. We are seeing healthy demand across all our sales channels for our smart home and security offerings and we are fully prepared to meet that demand. We continue to be judicious around overhead spend, budget and projects, and we now believe that we will be cash flow positive in 2020. To that point, we generated $111 million in cash from operating activities in the second quarter alone. We're excited to continue reporting our progress on this front. Before concluding my remarks, in light of recent events nationwide, I believe it's important to express how much we value diversity and inclusion at Vivint. The issues of racial inequity and injustice are significant and we must all take ownership of these issues. We can start by simply listening to each other, engage in productive conversations, re-examining our own views and actions, and ultimately being part of the positive change. I will now turn the call over to Dale to go through specifics of our strong second quarter results, as well as provide our updated guidance for 2020. Yes, we actually do believe it's sustainable. And as Dale mentioned, the reduction of RICs led to that number. And by the way, side note to the reduction of RICs, should -- we should see over time an improvement in attrition number on this pool of accounts that we put on this -- the underwriting on this year's book of business is outstanding. But yes, it is sustainable. We've made some very good changes to the business and I think one that's listened to us. This is not -- this didn't just happen. We've been working on the changes to the business models of the company, the cost structure for quite some time now and this just kind of a revelation of what we've been intending to do. So, I think the answer is yes, it's sustainable. Well, I think you hit it on the head. It's absolutely a validation of the model that Vivint delivers into the market, Smart Home as a Service. It absolutely requires great tech. But in the need for -- install ongoing service and providing the bulk of them is critically important to delivering really an elegant situation within. And so, yes, we're upbeat. When I read the news, honestly, -- that's great. We've been saying all these all along. This is a huge TAM, is a huge opportunity and someone with the likes of Google investing into this space that you're in, you got to be -- that's got to be a good thing for us. Thank you. Well, the one thing I want to note and this is very important and again it's been mentioned already, but the fact that we've put the numbers up that we have proven very substantial demand from consumers for the Vivint Smart Home offering. We are not on boarding new customers in Canada, which was a decent percentage of our overall business in the past, and then the elimination of RICs and also the pause on direct-to-home. When you look at it on the whole and you don't know the past, it looks good, considering, like you said, the environment. But when you really add it up together, the performance of Vivint in Q2 was outstanding. It's hard to describe how happy we are about how we're positioned, the consumer view on the product and services that we offer, the value we provide and really demand coming into the company. Thank you. Yes. So obviously, we did change the pricing in our starter kit package. And it was incredibly well received from the consumer. And from a consumer's point of view, the dollars they're paying between ourselves and our financing partner does -- had really didn't change. It changes the balance of it, but it doesn't change the actual dollars paid on a monthly basis. And then I would just say that our performance spoke for itself when it comes to demand. It was increased demand, elevated numbers better performance on a per rep average for the direct-to-home program. And again, Dale spoke to the inside sales group and their performance year-over-year. So absolutely did not affect demand from consumers. So, we probably won't get that granular. But again, when I'd try to reiterate this. When you look at the numbers on an apples-to-apples basis, if you compare to the customers we underwrote in 2019 to 2020, the fact that we're only down 3% net subscriber adds is outs -- when I say outstanding, it's beyond outstanding. We eliminated 12% of the customers we would have underwritten last year and did not this year and still attain that. And on a revenue basis, because of the increase in revenue per subscriber per month, we actually were ahead of last year. So I can't reiterate this enough that it was just a tremendous quarter. And I would say the trend continues. So we can't get too granular on what's happening currently and going forward. But we feel like we're in a very positive situation. It's due to a lot of factors, but really consumer demand increased -- Dale mentioned this, people are really reconnecting with their home and we're seeing the benefits of that. We're one of those companies that really is having a positive effect from the fact that people are home, are looking at their home as their new environment and that we think that might be a lasting change over time. How are you doing? That's actually interesting that you would ask. But we actually did and we actually had some -- I'm not going to dig in, because I would say they're more experiments at how they engage and can engage with different types of inbound demand from consumers. But we did. We had to do it kind of overnight as all companies did when the shutdown happened. But we had positive results and I would say it's informing us a bit to how we might think about expanding our sales force, workforce engagement with consumers over time. And, as Dale mentioned, we hope to, at some point, maybe even this year start to build the brand and increase the inbound demand and really knowledge of Vivint's services. I mean, the reality is on an unaided awareness basis, less than 5% of American households even know who we are and what we do. And so, and as part of that test, we think there are some really tremendous opportunities to utilize that group, if additional demand does come in and be really efficient with those needs or increase around of Vivint's services. So yes. Yes. So, here is what I would say, definitely video is a major driver in increased demand for what we do. And there is no one that does it like we do it. I mean, with the professional install, our own proprietary hub, platform, technology stack, kind of the feedback loop, ability to service ongoing with the customer, there isn't anyone anywhere in the realm of the quality of service delivery that we have, connectivity and otherwise. But we did -- we have seen an increased demand in just the general peace of mind of what we provide. And that's viewed or I guess kind of displays itself in the engagement from our consumers with their app. This isn't us emailing them things that we've seen or we know or data that we're showing. This is actual engagement, user engagement in live video views, recorded video views, arm/disarm of the system and the different functionality inside of the system. So I would say there are no other outside apps that are helping push. I think this is becoming very kind of obvious to us and we believe this for a while that this is a huge market segment. We think that 80-plus percent penetration in the U.S. households is very attainable. We're not going to state, well, how many years we think that is, it would be a guess. But the demand is gaining momentum and people's interest in having the smart home that's provided by a premium service provider like Vivint is very much in demand and will be a large market. Well, I think that's an interesting observation. Here is a couple of notes. One, we provide a DIY-able product and service currently. We are not talking about the numbers on that, but we actually do. The amazing thing for our customers or potential customers is that we can also back that up with truck rolls, answering the phone, technical service capabilities on the back end. So we can kind of end-to-end. However, someone wants to take delivery of our services, we can provide that and for very, very good value with the highest quality of products and services, and reliability for that matter. But it's interesting because DIY is brought up quite consistently to us in this space. And yet, you see Google who has DIY-able products that they've had for quite some time is now realizing that in order to really address the big market that Vivint is addressing, they need to combine up with a company that has the capabilities to go inside of people's homes and deliver service on an ongoing basis in a professional way. That's to say if they want to compete with us really on a grand scale. And then last thing is I'd say about DIY, that's an interesting thing even to my personal life. Through COVID, I didn't even -- I had never used some of the delivery -- food delivery services in the past. Now, that's all we do. So, I don't even go get my own food anymore. It's delivered to me. And so it's -- and I don't mow my lawn, I don't wash my car. No, I don't want to sound lazy. But I have other things done for me and I just don't think that consumers who want a really deep experience with a smart home want to be the CIO or technician of their home to manage 15, 20, 30, 40 devices, which is absolutely happening. People are adding more and more cameras and thermostats and door locks. And the connectivity is going deeper and deeper into the home. And so we couldn't be happier about the position that we're in and the fact that we are a market leader. This is really important and this is where Vivint really shines. This -- the fact that we own our operating system, that we in-house develop that, our hub, our platform and again, we do integrate. Everyone on the platform knows that we will integrate best-in-class products into our platform. But we take it upon ourselves to make sure that we control that process and that data flow and the connectivity, because the -- if you're installing a doorbell camera, for instance, that's not too difficult to install and not too much to manage. But you start adding more like -- as you mentioned, more and more devices, connectivity becomes more and more of an issue. The demand on your WiFi gets greater and greater. And allows the unfortunate potential for things to go wrong. Now, with our feedback loop and the fact that our engineering team, software, firmware, hardware design, installation platform, service platform, network, you have this incredible feedback loop that's very immediate by the way. I mean, we obviously tracked and there is 1.5 billion pieces of data daily coming through our AI system. We are watching every last thing that's happening when it comes to service delivered to consumer. Because that -- at the end of the day, if it's not great, service levels aren't great, attrition is going to go through the roof. And you could theorize that going from $16, which we had per sub per month in service cost to $9.93 over two-year period, our service levels would go down substantially and therefore attrition would go up, the reverse has happened. We've done both, reduced our service cost per sub per month, not a little bit, substantially. And then also our service levels are not just maintained well, they're better and they're more enhanced. And that speaks through our attrition numbers that you're seeing, which, by the way, are better than we had hoped for. And we've done this business for a very, very long time and the great thing is it's a very predictable model. But this just -- it just so happens that as we continue to release new hubs, new firmware, new software releases, new installation protocols that we just get better and better and better at that delivery of service and connectivity and quality of service. And it reduces truck rolls and the need to keep up with service demands. If things work, you don't have to answer phones, you don't have to roll trucks. And it just so happens that we are best in class by quite a margin when it comes to those sorts of things. Yes. So, we actually don't break the numbers out on the service cost per sub per month down to the actual -- the action that's happening inside of that structure. We just haven't done that and that probably wouldn't be detail that we would dig into. And then so we are just really hopefully and you are also incredibly happy with the results. But we probably gained some efficiencies across the board in all of those actions. And again, back to Vivint's owning of our operating system and technology, and hub development, software firmware releases, these all a result of not just what's happening today in the current environment. This is -- these are investments that we've made into our technology, service delivery, installation protocols over the years. And then there is how we answer phones and training down to the individual person. So there is a lot of things that go into the reduction of our service costs. And then when it comes to the attrition numbers with moves, we also don't want to break that out. I hate giving you that answer on both of those, but we just don't break those out in detail. What I would say is I'm not sure with the arrangement is and so you would really need to ask them about this, but getting back to Vivint, the fact that we own our platform, we developed it. And look, we've spent tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars on that alone and do annually on the maintenance and the improvement of that user experience. And the fact that it's fully integrated to our hub in our platform, I'm glad that we're Vivint and we own what we own, which is everything end-to-end and we don't depend on other hardware developers and providers, other platform or app or operating system providers. I'm very -- we've -- and look, our investors Blackstone and others have been very gracious over the years in allowing us to make sure that we own and control that entire technology stack, and it's proving to be very relevant -- and not just relevant, it's critical that we do have that and own that. Thank you. Yes. So, we appreciate everyone getting on the phone call for our Q2 numbers. We were happy with the results. We hope all of you were also. And just know that management is very focused on the current economic environment, making sure that we're being cautious about any upcoming economic -- continued downturns impact or individual subscribers, customers or underwriting in their cost structure and investments. So we're -- we look forward to getting on the phone with you all again in Q3. So thank you."

            "name": "Dale Gerard",
            "content": "Thanks, Todd. I'll walk through the financial slide portion of the presentation that we posted today in conjunction with our earnings release. Overall, results were very strong across the board and this outperformance informs our decision to raise our guidance range for the full year, which I'll cover later. But first on slide seven, we highlight our revenue for the second quarter six-month period ended June 30. For the second quarter 2020, revenue grew by 8.9% to $306 million. The growth in revenue is attributable to a 6.8% increase in total subscribers as well as a 2.1% increase in the average monthly revenue per user. Our average monthly revenue per user was up $1.31 in the quarter versus last year. Moving to slide eight. Adjusted EBITDA has scaled significantly in the second quarter and six-month periods. The drivers were lower selling expenses and net service costs and continued scaling of our G&A. For the quarter, we are proud to have expanded adjusted EBITDA margins by 2000 basis points to 49.9% of revenue compared to 31.4% in the second quarter of 2019. This is clearly a great result overall and a function of a lot of hard work by our entire organization. Due to some seasonality inherent in our business, we wouldn't necessarily anticipate sustained full-year margins at that high level. It should be noted, for example, that the lower service costs we saw in the second quarter was due in part to fewer service calls and truck rolls due to concerns over COVID-19, while we do believe to be sustainable on a number of cost reduction initiatives that we completed during the first quarter and then are expected to meaningfully reduce G&A and overhead costs by streamlining our operations, focusing engineering and innovation, and driving better customer satisfaction. In addition to these actions and because analyzing how we operate more efficiently is a continuous exercise at Vivint, we initiated another round of focused cost-cutting during the second quarter to further reduce our discretionary spend. As a result of these actions, we have achieved greater than $30 million in permanent annualized fixed cost reductions. Meanwhile, covenant adjusted EBITDA, which is the calculation used for our debt covenants, was $200.5 million in the period, scaling by $45 million compared to $155.3 million in the second quarter 2019. As you look on slide nine, we highlight a few data points for the subscriber portfolio which were strong across the board. Total subscribers at quarter end grew from 1.51 million to 1.61 million year-over-year or 6.8%. Average Monthly Revenue per User, or AMRU, also increased to $64.66, up 2.1% year-over-year. AMRU has been growing from the recognition of deferred revenue and effective cost selling of new products, such as our newest generation of outdoor and doorbell cameras. On the next slide, slide 10, we highlight a few points on new subscribers. New subscriber originations were 107,980 for the second quarter, which was quite resilient considering that direct-to-home sales were paused in the U.S. for the early part of the quarter. We discontinued all direct-to-home sales in Canada during the quarter and we reduced a number of retail installment contracts or RICs by over 89%. One last point, by shifting a greater portion of our subscribers away from RICs and toward our third-party financing partners and pay-in-full, we are able to grow the point of sale revenue, thus reducing our net subscriber acquisition costs and significantly improving our cash flow dynamics. As we look to the future, we will continue to align the organization on delivering a true smart home experience to millions of homes in a profitable and cash efficient way. Moving to slide 11, we will cover our net service cost per subscriber and net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber. The reduction across both these key metrics continue to be a significant driver of our earnings improvement during the second quarter of 2020. We've continued our trend of year-over-year improvements in net service cost per subscriber, moving from $16.71 in the second quarter of 2018 to $13.13 in the second quarter of 2019, and now to $9.93 in the most recent quarter, a $6.78 improvement versus 2018. This represents the lowest service cost per subscriber in the last ten years by a significant margin and it demonstrates the advantage of Vivint's fully integrated smart home cloud platform, which encompasses the software, the hardware, the installation and ongoing customer support. The result is that our net service margin continued its increasing trend moving from 68.6% in the second quarter of 2018 to 75.2% in the second quarter of 2019, and now 80.2% in the most recent quarter. These efforts contributed greatly to the improvement seen in our adjusted EBITDA. It's important to note here that given the seasonality of how we generally put on new customers, particularly in the summer, we tend to see service costs increase in the back half of the year. Additionally, as mentioned before, we believe service calls were abnormally low in the second quarter due to concerns over the coronavirus. So while we're really excited and encouraged by the current trends and the corresponding benefits to the margins that we are seeing, we wouldn't anticipate sustained full-year results at that level. On the right hand side of slide 11, we highlight the recent trend on our average net new subscriber acquisition cost. For the LTM period ended June 30, 2020, net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber decreased to $630. That's 40.8% lower compared to the prior LTM period, as we have nearly eliminated the number of new subscribers that are financed on a Vivint retail instalment contract and shifted to a higher mix of customers, utilizing our financing partners or paying in full for the purchase of their smart home products. During the quarter, we also benefited from pricing leverage on the point of sale purchase and installation of equipment. Moving on to slide 12. Slide 12 is a normal subscriber walk to illustrate the changes in total subscribers at quarter end. The biggest and most pleasant surprise was a reversal in attrition, which was lower sequentially for the first time in nine quarters. It is worth reiterating that our attrition has trended higher than our historical averages, given the higher percentage of customers that are in the end-of-term life cycle phase. First, the attrition rate for a customer cohort changes as it progresses through different phases of the life cycle. We define these phases as in-term, end-of-term and post initial term. Each phase carries with it a corresponding expected attrition rate, with attrition at its highest during the end-of-term phase. As we have shared in the past earnings calls, the cohort attrition curves remain fairly steady. The second factor that affects attrition is the percent of total customers in each stage of their life cycle. The percent of customers in the end-of-term phase rose in 2019 and will stay elevated in 2020 before beginning to fall in 2021. In the second quarter, attrition reversed course and was lower sequentially by 40 basis points to 13.7%. This still remains higher than our long-term trend for attrition, but was much better than our expectations given the higher percentage of customers that are in the end-of-term phase. And for what it's worth, our portfolio has continued to perform better than expectations in terms of attrition and other leading indicators through the end of July. Now we know there is a lot of curiosity out there regarding how we think our attrition curve may change as a result of the pandemic. The news on this front is all positive at least thus far. As to the potential drivers, our past experience through severe economic downturns, combined with the unique effects of the current pandemic and leading more people to reconnect with their homes and place tremendous value on our smart home solutions, as well as the general propensity for customers to focus inward and prioritize home security during times of crisis are some of the main factors that come to mind. Before we move to our updated outlook for the year, I'll point out that several factors tied to our strong second quarter performance leave us feeling very good about our overall liquidity position, which stood at approximately $478 million as of June 30. Our second quarter was strong from an operating cash flow perspective. For the three months ended June 30, we generated $111 million in net cash from operating activities compared to a use of $88 million for the same period in 2019. The strength in cash generation has carried through the end of July and we have repaid all of the outstanding amounts on our revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we also saw approximately $6.6 million of warrants exercised, which has a positive impact on our cash position and it increased our public float as well. Finally, let's move to slide 13 where I will address our updated financial outlook for the year. Over 95% of our revenue is recurring, which provides long-term visibility and predictability to our business. Most of our new subscribers that finance their smart home chooses to enter into a five-year contract and remain on the platform for approximately eight years, driving significant lifetime margin dollars. Despite the many uncertainties pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic, our reoccurring revenue model has proven resilient to any of the major downsides and we are comfortable with essentially restoring our original guidance for subscribers and revenue that we provided in early March before the country went on lockdown. Meanwhile, our strong unit economics and scale have contributed to our ability to drive significant adjusted EBITDA improvement. And that is reflected in our updated range. In terms of revised guidance based on our stronger than expected second quarter performance, solid demand for our products and services and having the full complement of sales channels available to acquire new Vivint customers, we expect to end 2020 with 1.62 million to 1.68 million total subscribers versus previous guidance of 1.55 million to 1.62 million. Our estimate for 2020 revenue is $1.23 billion to $1.28 billion versus previous guidance of $1.20 billion to $1.25 billion. And finally, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to between $555 million and $565 million versus previous guidance between $525 million and $535 million. Operator, please open the line for Q&A. Yes, this is Dale. Hey, Rod. Thanks for joining. I think in terms of subscribers is tough. As we said, we had -- direct-to-home was really paused for the first six weeks of the quarter. So we really started rolling out direct-to-home to the different locations around the second week of May. And we saw a very quick ramp from those teams and continue to see really good production from those teams across all offices, across all states that we're in. And we're in most states that we wanted to be in. There is not like areas that we didn't go to. You roll teams out to where we expected to go out to. And they seem to be reporting well. And then when you look at inside sales, inside sales was really strong in the first quarter and that carried right into the second quarter. That's a more kind of ratable in terms of -- those are leads coming in from SEO and different referrals and so forth. And that volume and that demand has been very, very strong across the full -- for the full quarter. So we're seeing that demand continue into the third quarter here. And then, go ahead, Todd. And then just to touch quickly on your question around attrition. I mean, attrition again, we were very, very happy with how the attrition performed in the second quarter. We again think that's how people are really reconnecting with their homes, really valuing the services that we offer. And we're seeing the engagement with the platform, even though people are at home, the engagement is as high or higher than what we've seen in previous quarters, because people are using it. Just a different way, they're using the cameras more. They're engaging more throughout their home with that, with the system. For example, like having deliveries to your front door, being able to use your door-up camera to talk to those people, see what packages are dropped off. Those types of interactions with the system we're seeing more and more, now that people are actually kind of in their homes and wanting to understand who is coming through that front door or what's being left at that front door. But we're also cautious about attrition. In terms of -- we still have a higher percentage of customers in their kind of end-of-term life cycle. That's still about 20% of our portfolio. And we know those customers normally perform at or have higher attrition, when they're in that kind of phase of their life cycle. And then we're also cautious about the economy in the second half. And so what I would tell you from attrition is we think it's performing really, really well right now. But we're also cautious as to what it will look like in the -- for the rest of the year, but we're feeling rather confident that we're seeing good performance out of it and will continue through the rest of the year. Thanks, Rod. And then, it's been -- this is Dale. The other point of driving down kind of that net SAC is the fact that we reduced RICs of about -- almost 90% year-over-year. And that's not just a one-time kind of, hey, we did that in the second quarter. Our goal once we started rolling out Flex Pay and bringing on the finance partners was to bring RICs down to essentially zero. We'll have -- probably have some RICs as we go, but that's another big driver of the fact that we were able to take RICs down. And if you recall, RICs, just real quick is, as the -- as their contracts with Vivint is put in our balance sheet, we basically get no money upfront from those customers. So by being able to lower those substantially and move more of that upfront to our financing partners or to the customer actually paying in full for out of their own account, that's enabled us also to bring that net SAC down. Yes. Thanks. I think in terms of how we think about the cash flow, I mean, we continue -- we've said all along we wanted to kind of get to cash flow neutral this year. We're way ahead of our original projections of 12 to 18 months. And then we've also laid out a goal to be three times or less on a leverage ratio, on an EBITDA-to-debt ratio. So I think we'll look at that the cash that we have continued to generate and we'll look at how we want to use that cash, whether that's to pay down debt or to make other investments into the company, whether that's new products, new services. We don't -- Todd has talked about this quarter, we don't really have a brand out there. And so do we want to actually go spend some money on branding the company, which we think would even drive more customers to the growth overall for a long-term vision, so we'll decide how we go. But we're very, very excited about the fact we're able to kind of get this cash flow positive in the second quarter and we believe that will continue throughout the rest of the year. Yes. The last thing, I just recalled, and I said this on the -- as part of my remarks, we get paid down the revolver. We had $105 million outstanding on revolver at end of June and we did pay that down in July. And so we were able to kind of pay that revolver fully back and we're setting cash on the balance sheet. Hi, Jeff. Yes, thanks. I think if you think about servicing costs, I think if you looked at the mid to high 70% margins is kind of where we think. I don't want to really quote a quarter dollar, I'd give you a service margin based on what we think. But we think in that 75-ish percent range is probably where we'll see kind of servicing costs come back in the second half of the year. And the reason why it's a little bit more, as you know, we put on a lot of our customers in a 90-day period. And there is always follow-up and service needs. So there are more service calls in that third quarter and just going into the fourth quarter just related to those new installs. And then again in the second quarter, I think we had a lot of times where we had where the calls into call center and into truck rolls were just decreased related around COVID. People not wanting people to come to their homes or -- and I think it goes back also to Todd's point is we have this fully integrated system that we can help, like we can solve a lot of problems over the phone. So when somebody does call in, we can actually log in to help, log remotely into their panel, resolve a lot of the issues, without having to send a truck or sending someone out to their home, which is really important. Yes, on the margins, I think again, we thought we'd be in that, call it, low to mid 40% EBITDA margins. And I think that's again, when you look at the rest of this year, if you looked at on a full-year basis, I think that's kind of where we are. We're continuing and I think Todd said this and I've said this is we're always looking at ways to optimize in the business and optimize the scale what we have. And so we'll continue to look at that. When you look at it quarter over quarter or for the full year, we're probably looking in that low to mid 40% range. Thank you. Yes. Thanks. So two things. We'll start with the supply chain. You're right. We -- based upon the way we do our business and preparing for what I would call the second, third quarter where we put on most of our accounts, we do, do a lot of pre-buy and make sure we have inventory in place based on what we think we're going to do or install for that period. And so we've not really seen any, any disruption in terms of our supply chain. We have a really good Chief Procurement Officer and we're constantly working with all of our vendors in making sure our manufacture -- contract manufacturers make sure that we have product available to our technicians and to our sales reps, so we can install those when we need that. In the terms of the net subscriber acquisition costs, you are right. Based upon where -- what we said we were going to do in terms of how we structure our current pricing model, the fact that we've reduced RICs and we continue to see that reduction go forward, you should continue to see that's -- where it's $630, if you kind of run the math out, you would expect that to continue to come down as we roll in as we report probably third quarter and so forth. Thanks. See you, Todd."

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Nate Stubbs, VP, Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nNate Stubbs: Good afternoon, everyone.

I will now turn the call over to Todd.\nTodd Pedersen: Thanks, Nate, and good afternoon to everyone joining the call. I hope everyone is staying safe in the current environment. And today, we will cover three main topics: discuss our financial and operating results for the first quarter, review our customer engagement and the performance of our platform during this difficult time, and highlight key elements of our business and actions we\u2019ve taken that give us confidence in our performance for the remainder of 2020 and beyond. We\u2019ve had a great start to 2020, and we are pleased to see significant improvements in our key metrics year-over-year. Revenue in total subscribers continue to grow, and EBITDA margins continue to expand despite the challenges related to the current environment. Dale will provide more specifics on the financials during his remarks, as well as share updated thoughts about our full year 2020 performance. The remainder of my commentary will focus on the Vivint Smart Home story in the context of COVID-19. Why our customers value our services even more during difficult and uncertain times like these, why we think our financial model is built to withstand the current environment, what proactive operational measures we have taken to protect our employees, our customers and our business and how we plan to get back up to speed with our direct owned sales teams. Our services qualify is essential under the guidelines issued by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. In a time when we\u2019re asked to stay at home for an extended period, there\u2019s no better time to have a comprehensive smart home system. Vivint Smart Home provides essential services to nearly 1.6 million customers across North America. Vivint services include life-saving and life-protecting 24/7 professional monitoring for emergency situations such as medical, fire, carbon monoxide and burglary alerts. Our vertically integrated model includes dedicated customer care and monitoring teams to ensure that we respond to these alerts from our customers within seconds. Our cloud platform and proprietary technology also allows customers to seamlessly manage and protect their homes, whether they\u2019re sheltering in place or away. Vivint takes care of our customers and their families while providing the peace of mind that people demand during times of heightened awareness, anxiety, crime and uncertainty. We\u2019ve been securing and creating smart homes for over 20 years. So I can tell you from experience that Vivint has a history of exhibiting strength and resiliency through challenging economic times. For example, we only witnessed a slight increase in customer attrition in 2008 and 2009 during the global financial crisis. Although the current pandemic poses a unique set of societal problems compared to then, we are confident that our customers will continue to value home security and smart home technology. In fact, a case can be made for pent-up demand forming as a result of this crisis. We have long believed the total addressable market for smart home presents a massive opportunity, and in the not so distant future, the vast majority of the 150 million homes in North America will be running on a comprehensive smart home operating system. We believe Vivint is the best-positioned provider to take advantage should demand accelerate in this way. We are confident in our value proposition because it has been proven over two decades. Today, we have over 21 million connected devices on the Vivint Smart Home proprietary cloud-based platform, and we are uniquely qualified to help our customers deal with the current environment across the various smart home devices we support. From door locks, cameras, security monitoring, thermostats, lighting controls, smart speakers and many other connected devices. All of these innovative products are designed to work together seamlessly through our elegant platform that homeowners can control from their in-home touchscreen hub, through a single app on their phone or other devices or by simply using their voice. Even prior to the current health and economic crisis, we already had the industry-leading engagement on our smart home operating system, with over 13 interactions a day on average and over 1.4 billion daily events being processed on our cloud platform. During the current pandemic, our platform has continued to seamlessly handle all daily interactions as our customers have relied even more on their smart home systems for various and often evolving use cases. Some of these use cases are very intuitive, such as our next-generation doorbell camera that intelligently detects packages and actively helps protect them from porch pirates. With more than 1 million packages that are still on - go missing from porches every day, our newest doorbell camera helps provide homeowners with peace of mind by helping to prevent crime before it happens. Other use cases have become increasingly important while we\u2019ve been sheltering in place, such as using indoor smart cameras to keep a watchful eye on elderly parents while social distancing or to make sure kids are doing their homework during the sudden era of distance learning. Customers are relying even more on smart smoke detectors as more home cooking takes place. And they are recognizing the value of our AI-powered outdoor cameras that recognizes potential lurkers and can sound an alert to scare way potential thieves. Whatever it may be, our customers have been more reliant on the various smart devices that we professionally installed for them in these ways and more. And they continue to lean on our nationwide team of dedicated smart home employees for a more urgent interaction such as real-time security monitoring or to get help in the event of medical emergency. The bottom line is that frequent engagement in the Vivint system is a very good indicator for us, and it\u2019s happening across our customer base during this pandemic. Although our value proposition is clear and we fully expect that our current customers will continue to make the most of what their Vivint system offers them, we also acknowledge that our ability to capitalize on any near term demand for new smart home systems is limited, particularly in light of state sheltering in place, coupled with our own decision to pause all direct-to-home sales in mid-March. Overall uncertainty at the macro level remains at historic highs, and we are closely monitoring how that continues to impact the credit markets and unemployment rates. There are very real risks that the world could be hit with additional waves of the virus, causing more social and economic disruption before a reliable vaccine is ready for widespread use. Fortunately, we benefit from a highly predictable and recurring revenue model, in which roughly 90% of our expected revenue for 2020 was under contract at the beginning of the year. Vivint has also implemented a number of operational changes and safety procedures to continue to protect the health and well-being of our employees while still providing the exceptional service levels our customers have come to rely on. All of these considerations give us great confidence in our ability to weather the current economic environment. To give you a sense for the actions we\u2019ve taken, we have transitioned our highly nimble workforce, including all corporate employees and more than 1,500 of our customer care professionals, to effective work-from-home environments, where they continue to provide uninterrupted customer service and maintain our high-quality standards. We are maintaining our geographically dispersed central monitoring stations to provide 24/7 professional monitoring services for all emergencies. Furthermore, we are now conducting daily fitness-for-duty assessments for all customer-facing employees, which includes a temperature and symptoms check. We are contacting customers before a visit to determine if anyone in the home is experiencing signs of illness or has been exposed to COVID-19, and rescheduling appointments when necessary. We are closely following CDC guidelines for social distancing and hand-washing, including cleaning workspaces and surfaces and not shaking hands with customers. And of course, we\u2019re using protective sanitary equipment during service visits such as disposable gloves, masks and hand sanitizer. We have implemented detailed business continuity plans intended to ensure the health, safety and well-being of our customers, employees and communities, and to protect the financial and operational strength of the company. Dale has more of the details that he\u2019ll share during his remarks around these efforts. But rest assured that we\u2019re remaining judicious around overhead spend, budgets, projects and everything else related to our goal of getting to cash flow neutral. That philosophy has not changed as a result of the pandemic, and we are tracking ahead of our previously stated timeline of 18 to 24 months. Moving now to our plans to resume direct to home sales, which account for about 50% of our new subscriber adds. Our sales teams are ready to hit the ground running, and they have received extensive training on proper interactions with customers in light of the current environment. The key gating factor is that we must follow individual state guidelines in ramping our sales teams across the country. At this point, many states have reopened, and we estimate that our direct to home sales teams are operating at about 70% of their full capacity. In time and assuming no further major setbacks from COVID-19, we\u2019re optimistic that the upcoming summer sales period will proceed. While all of this is happening, our priority remains to take all appropriate steps to protect the health, well-being of our employees and customers. Our other sales channel, national inside sales, which onboards nearly half of all new accounts in a normal environment, has continued to operate without material interruption throughout the pandemic. While we anticipate eventually reaching a full deployment of our direct to home sales channel in the U.S. over the next few weeks, in Canada, because of the lack of consumer financing options and that each account sold there historically has required a significant cash investment by the company, Vivint will no longer originate new customers through the direct-to-home channel. We will continue to sell smart homes through our national inside sales channel. Furthermore, we remain committed to our customers in Canada, and we\u2019ll continue to operate there with dedicated support and services. We anticipate that funding the vast majority of our new customers via the Vivint Flex Pay program will continue to be a key driver in our strategy of profitable subscriber growth. Our external customer financing partners have expressed their commitment to maintaining their current underwriting standards of new smart home customers through the current economic downturn. We believe that we are widening our lead over the competition in enabling customers to easily finance a full smart home experience while also dramatically improving Vivint\u2019s unit economics and the company\u2019s cash flow dynamics. I will now turn the call over to Dale to go through specifics of our first quarter results, as well as to provide our updated thoughts on the remainder of fiscal 2020.\nDale Gerard: Thanks, Todd. I\u2019ll walk through the financial slide portion of the presentation that we posted today in conjunction with our earnings release. On slide eight, we highlight our revenue, adjusted EBITDA and covenant adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. For first quarter 2020, revenue grew by 9.8% to $303.2 million. The growth in revenue is attributable to a 7.1% increase in total subscribers as well as a 2.3% increase in the average monthly revenue per user. In the center of slide eight, adjusted EBITDA has scaled nicely for the first quarter. The primary drivers were lower net service costs and continued scaling of our general and administrative expenses. For the quarter, we are proud to have scaled adjusted EBITDA margins by 570 basis points to 44.5% of revenue compared to 38.8% in the first quarter of 2019. Meanwhile, covenant adjusted EBITDA, which is a calculation used for our debt covenants, scaled by 840 basis points to 62.6% of revenue compared to 54.2% in the first quarter of 2019. As you look on slide nine, we highlight a few data points for the subscriber portfolio, which were strong across the board. Total subscribers at quarter-end grew from 1.45 million to 1.55 million or 7.1%. Average monthly revenue per user, or AMRU also increased to $65.27, up 2.3% year-over-year. AMRU has been moving up nicely due to recognition of deferred revenue and effective cross-selling of new products, such as our newest generation of outdoor and doorbell cameras. On the next slide, slide 10, we highlight a few points on new subscribers. New subscriber originations were 50,053 for the first quarter, which is strong considering that direct-to-home sales were paused in mid-March. We continue to refine and improve the underwriting requirements of our business, decreasing the number of retail installment contracts or RICs. We saw favorable year-over-year trends in subscriber financing mix during the first quarter, highlighted by a 53% reduction in the number of subscribers financed through retail installment contracts. By shifting a greater proportion of our subscribers away from RICs and towards our third-party financing partners and pay in full, we are able to reduce our net subscriber acquisition cost and improve our cash flow dynamics. As we look to the future, we will be focused on delivering a true smart home experience to millions of homes in a profitable and cash neutral way. Moving to slide 11, we will cover our net service cost per subscriber and net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber. The reduction in net service cost continued to be a significant driver of our earnings improvement during the first quarter of 2020. We continued our trend of year-over-year improvements in net service cost per subscriber, moving from $17.04 in the first quarter of 2018 to $13.83 in the first quarter of 2019, and now to $11.76 in the most recent quarter, a $5.28 improvement versus 2018. This represents the lowest service cost per subscriber in the last five years by a significant margin and demonstrates the advantage of Vivint\u2019s vertically integrated smart home cloud platform, which encompasses the software, the hardware, the installation and ongoing customer support. As we continue to make improvements in all of these areas, we\u2019re seeing continued positive trends in both the cost of service and customer satisfaction. The result is that our net service margin continued its increasing trend, moving from 68.6% in the first quarter of 2018 to 74% in the first quarter of 2019 and now to 77% in the most recent quarter. These efforts largely explain the improvement seen in our adjusted EBITDA. On the right-hand side of slide 11, we highlight our average net subscriber acquisition cost in the last 12 month period. For the first quarter ended March 31, 2020, net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber decreased to $960. That\u2019s 16% lower year-over-year as we continue to drive down the number of new subscribers that are financed on a Vivint retail installment contract and shift to a higher mix of customers utilizing our financing partners or paying in full for the purchase of their smart home products. During the quarter, we also benefited from pricing leverage on the point-of-sale purchase and installation of equipment. Before the recent pandemic hit, we had already put in place a number of cost-reduction initiatives that were completed during the first quarter and that are expected to meaningfully reduce G&A and overhead costs by streamlining operations, focusing engineering and innovation and driving better customer satisfaction. In addition to these actions and because analyzing how we can operate more efficiently is a continuous exercise of Vivint, we initiated another round of cost-cutting post COVID-19 to further reduce our discretionary spend. Slide 12 covers the lifetime value of our customers and the benefits of a reoccurring revenue model. In the last 12 months, we\u2019ve added approximately $1.75 billion of lifetime value. We continue to see nice backlog numbers, which, as a reminder, represent revenue adjusted for attrition that we expect to recognize over the lifetime of a customer. Backlog at quarter end was $5.73 billion, up 9% compared to $5.24 billion a year ago. Slide 13 depicts our typical subscriber walk that illustrates the changes in total subscribers at quarter end. As expected, our attrition has trended higher than our historical averages given the higher percentage of customers that are in the end of term lifecycle phase. Our attrition dynamics are driven by two primary factors. First, the rate of attrition for a customer cohort changes as it progresses through different phases of the life cycle. We define these phases as interim, end of term and post initial term. Each phase carries with it a corresponding expected attrition rate, with attrition at its highest during the end-of-term phase. As we have shared in past earnings calls, the cohort attrition curves remain fairly steady. The second factor that affects attrition is the percent of total customers in each stage of the life cycle. The percent of customers in the end-of-term phase rose in 2019 and will stay elevated in 2020 before falling again in 2021. In the first quarter, attrition trended slightly higher sequentially by 20 basis points to 14.1%. This remains higher than our long-term trend for attrition, but is in line with our expectations given the higher percentage of customers that are in the end-of-term phase. Now we know there\u2019s a lot of curiosity out there regarding how we think our attrition curve may change as a result of the pandemic. Echoing Todd\u2019s commentary about our past experiences through severe economic downturns, as well as propensity for customers to focus inward and prioritize home security during times of crisis, at this point, we have no reason to think the same structural curve that we\u2019ve discussed previously won\u2019t continue to hold, with a life cycle impact that I spoke about being the primary driver. As a case in point, our portfolio has performed slightly better than expectations in terms of attrition and other leading indicators through the end of April. That\u2019s a good segue into slide 14, where we address our business activity in the interim period since our first quarter ended in March. The key takeaway on the sales front is that we continue to see robust demand for our products and services, and we have continued to acquire new Vivint Smart Home customers, primarily via our national inside sales team, despite the challenges posed by COVID-19. On the cost side of the equation, we have curtailed discretionary spending to preserve cash and improve our highly variable cost structure. And as a result of these actions, some of which were initiated as normal course prior to COVID-19, we have achieved greater than $30 million in annualized fixed cost reductions. We have also fully drawn down on our revolving credit facility as a precautionary measure to increase our cash position, which stood at $305 million as of April 30, and preserved liquidity and flexibility in light of current uncertainty in the global financial markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, we remain on track to achieve our goals regarding cash use and are aiming to get to cash flow neutral ahead of our previously stated 18 to 24 month time frame. Finally, moving to our financial outlook for the year on slide 15. I\u2019ll first share some of the fundamental characteristics of our financial model. Over 95% of our revenue is reoccurring, which provides long-term visibility and predictability to our business. Most of our new subscribers that finance their smart home systems choose to enter into five year contracts and remain on the platform for approximately eight years driving significant lifetime margin dollars. Our strong unit economics and scale has contributed to our ability to drive significant adjusted EBITDA improvement. That said, most companies have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. And although we believe our reoccurring model makes us resilient to the full impact of the pandemic, it will affect our outcome for the year. In terms of revised guidance, we expect to end 2020 with 1.55 million to 1.62 million total subscribers. Our estimate for 2020 revenue is $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion versus previous guidance of $1.25 billion to $1.29 billion. And finally, we are reaffirming our previous 2020 adjusted EBITDA guidance of between $525 million and $535 million. Operator, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nRod Hall: Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. And nice job here in the midst of this turmoil. I wanted to - I guess I wanted to start with the subs growth guidance. You reduced that growth expectation by quite a bit in percentage terms, not by much in terms of absolute number of subs. But I wonder what assumptions you\u2019re making on distribution there. Are you thinking that all of the distribution now, from now until the end of the year is going to be from inside sales? Or do you think at some point, you\u2019ll be able to get back out again? Or just what kind of assumption is built into that in terms of selling motion?\nTodd Pedersen: This is Todd Pedersen speaking. Thanks for the compliment, by the way, on the quarter, we were super happy with it. So it is - it\u2019s a result of our direct-to-home program being put on pause, which was about mid-March. Obviously, like anyone else, we\u2019re trying to be respectful around the states being shut down. And here\u2019s the update on that. We have re-launched that program. We are - by this weekend, we feel like we\u2019ll be about 70% of what we normally would be from a sales rep perspective. There are still states that are not open to do business on the door-to-door program. We kind of - we\u2019re making some adjustments on where they might change as far as markets go. So that - so the number of subscribers is a result of that. The thing I would say, though, is the places that we have deployed. And it\u2019s early, still, but the receptivity and the per-rep average, if we look at it on a daily basis on a per-rep basis is very strong. So we\u2019re trying to - we\u2019re optimistic because we are having great interactions with consumers. We\u2019ve adjusted the process on how we sell in the neighborhoods and not going in people\u2019s homes if they don\u2019t feel comfortable with that. And trying to kind of practice social distancing, but we\u2019re optimistic by trying to make sure that we\u2019re conservative on the projection side.\nRod Hall: Okay. Yes, that\u2019s great. Because I figured maybe people will just - even though the sales force is operating, people wouldn\u2019t want them in their house and things like that, so that\u2019s good.\nTodd Pedersen: It\u2019s actually just - I want to be clear on this. They\u2019ve - it\u2019s been amazing how welcoming people are. Again, we\u2019re wearing masks, gloves, keeping our distance. They can actually e-sign to a cell phone or a tablet, so not to interact directly with the customer, not to go into their homes, but the productivity per rep is really good. So the receptivity from consumers and the demands for our product and services at this time is quite amazing, so...\nRod Hall: Okay. Thanks, Todd. And then if I can follow-up on that. I - your guidance now still implies EBITDA margin at least that\u2019s improving this year over last. And I see the big improvement in net service cost per sub, which seems like it\u2019s driving the nice margin improvement. Are you guys assuming that - I guess you\u2019re assuming that can continue along through the year, is that correct? Are we interpreting that the right way, the guidance?\nScott Hardy: Yeah, Rod. This is Scott. As we\u2019ve shared, we continue to see impressive gains on service costs, and that\u2019s a function of the vertically integrated business model that Todd talked about, having the integrated software platform, the hardware, the diagnostic tools, controlling the installation process, that\u2019s really helped us drive some significant improvements, both on the cost side and, importantly, on the customer satisfaction side. That said, historically, our service costs have been seasonally lower in Q1. Our service costs tend to be highest in the early months of a customer\u2019s life cycle. So given the seasonality of how we generally put new customers on, particularly in the summer, we tend to see service costs increase in the back half of the year. So while we\u2019re really encouraged by the current trends on service costs and the Q1 results, we wouldn\u2019t anticipate a sustained full year results at that level.\nTodd Pedersen: I want to add something to that. This is - it\u2019s super important to cite this. We\u2019ve been reporting publicly for about seven years now. And if people go back a few years back - and again, without public shareholders, we had debt holders. Our service costs several years back was north of $18 per subscriber per month, which, by the way, the business still worked at that level. But the - our decision to build out and own a proprietary technology stack, the operating system, the firmware, the hardware, the hardware development, again, like Scott mentioned, the diagnostic tools, this is an incredible and important moat we\u2019ve created and the capability that we have as a company to continue to enhance and tweak these - all of these functions of business to continue to improve the service cost. But really, really important is the delivery of the products and the service to customers. So customer satisfaction is way up. This is not we reduce cost and our service levels are worse, this is our service levels are as good as they\u2019ve ever been. So we\u2019re incredibly pleased with these results. Scott is being a bit modest.\nRod Hall: I was just curious what drives that EBITDA margin expansion then in the guide. Is it something else or is it probably service cost?\nDale Gerard: So this is Dale. So it\u2019s going to be some service costs for sure, Rod. And then I think as we said in the prepared remarks, we\u2019ve done a lot of going through our cost structure, we had taking out costs, so we feel really good about - we\u2019ll see that in the back half of the year. We did a lot of that in the first quarter, some of that early April. And so that $30 million we talked about, we\u2019ll see - on an annualized basis, we\u2019ll see some of that throughout the next nine months or eight months of 2020. So it\u2019s really kind of holding the - seeing the revenue come in, in terms of the subscribers and then servicing costs and then taking that out of cost. And it\u2019s not only on the G&A and the service side, but we also took out overhead costs. And I think you saw that in the fact that our net subscriber cost was $960. Some of that is upfront, but we\u2019re also attacking expense overhead within the sales process.\nTodd Pedersen: Look, there is the reality. We have - we\u2019re now starting to get the benefit of all the investments we\u2019ve made in the technology stack, and we\u2019re getting operational efficiencies there. But even from a corporate side, because of the tools and technologies and our ability to deliver, and we\u2019re able to bring back some of those costs and get operational efficiencies from a corporate perspective also. So we\u2019re super pleased with all of this. And this is all - this process, and you all noticed, we started this before COVID hit, so this is just a continuation of what we\u2019re already focused on.\nRod Hall: Great. All right, guys. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.\nTodd Pedersen: You bet, Todd.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open.\nMichael Fisher: Hey, guys. This is Michael Fisher on for Amit. I wanted to get into - you mentioned the cash flow neutral target is tracking ahead of the initial 18 to 24 months. Can you talk about maybe any of the drivers or what\u2019s kind of shifted since you initially put that target out that\u2019s maybe enabling some upside?\nTodd Pedersen: Yeah. So there\u2019s - it\u2019s multiple fronts. Obviously, the net subscriber acquisition cost is something that we focused on. You\u2019ve seen a gain there. You\u2019re going to see continued improvement there. We\u2019ve - I think we show a reduction in RICs from last year to this year of about 50%. You\u2019re going to see that improve. In fact, it\u2019s going to be one of the biggest gains that you\u2019ll see from the company. So really important. We\u2019re trying to make sure that we\u2019re financing these product sales off-balance sheet. We - and again, mentioned that we\u2019re now not onboarding new customers from the direct-to-home side in Canada, which we - we have never found a partner to provide the consumer financing. So those subscribers were all again on-boarded on balance sheet. They were great subscribers, great credit scores, but there was a large amount of cash usage. We are still servicing the customer base up there, and they are our customers, but the exchange rate and the lack of consumer financing available there, we\u2019ve chosen to halt that. Now we are still onboarding customers that call in and/or are referred into the company, so we have full capability of installation and service up there. And then just a plan of production in expenses and cost and reducing some budgets and eliminating projects here and there. So we\u2019re just really fine-tuning the way we operate this business. We intend, just so everyone knows, to take some of those savings, cash savings, and start to focus on growing and building the brand, telling the story. We have an incredible story to tell. We have an incredible technology and service that we can deliver to consumers, which is in very high demand right now, especially in this period of time. And just the quality of product and the design and the delivery of the services has now come to a point where like, okay, it\u2019s time to really focus on growing this business as we take advantage of this large market that we\u2019re part of.\nMichael Fisher: Okay. And then just to dig a little bit on the permanent fixed cost savings of $30 million, is that mostly - again, is that service cost savings as well flowing through or the drivers there? And then the $20 million in restructuring expense, is that part of the initiative to generate the cost savings?\nDale Gerard: Yeah. So we\u2019ll kind of break those down. The $20 million really relates around the changes in personnel and cost reductions that we did at the beginning of March. So we kind of - we\u2019d actually talked about on the fourth quarter call from 2019 and put out, and so that\u2019s really what is included in that restructuring charge there. It\u2019s - some of it\u2019s severance and most of - half of it or so is related to stock-based comp, which was - as we - those people left and their equity - kind of their treatment of their equity changed. And then the other cost, as Todd said, we really focused on cost, whether it\u2019s in servicing. And again, really focusing on overhead and making sure that we have the right infrastructure, the right cost structure and that we\u2019re spending money in the areas that really provide either servicing customers or they\u2019re providing growth. And so as we think about service, how do we think about our leadership, our structure there, level - kind of tiers, leaders in the field, people that are in the corporate, on the servicing side. And then on the G&A - and innovation, the same thing. It\u2019s like, hey, there\u2019s a lots of products and lots of different things we can go do, but let\u2019s focus in on what we really think the customers want that can drive that kind of next-gen of products. And so it\u2019s really across all areas of the company. It\u2019s not just one area. And we\u2019ve actually - I would say for 2020, we\u2019ve actually taken actions that are greater than the $30 million, but some of those will - that will come back most likely in 2021, such as - not - we\u2019ve discontinued any type of merit increases for \u201820. We\u2019ve actually stopped matching the 401(k). So we\u2019ve taken some actions. Again, we want to be ahead of it. We think that - and we\u2019ve done a lot of these in early April to make sure that we\u2019re in a good position to weather any kind of storm that comes at us here. But some of those will come back next year. But the $30 million is what we think of permanently is not coming back in the budgets and different things that we\u2019ve been doing.\nTodd Pedersen: And the $30 million, to be clear, is not part of the service cost reduction. It\u2019s separate.\nDale Gerard: Yes.\nScott Hardy: So you\u2019ll see some of it in the subscriber acquisition cost and a lot of it in the G&A.\nMichael Fisher: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Mally with Imperial Capital. Your line is open.\nEdward Mally: Hi, thank you. Just to go back to the attrition trends, away from where you are in the customer contract life cycle, have you seen over the last couple of months any changes in those trends with reduced relocations, for example, or changes in the drivers of attrition? That\u2019s my first question. And then second question, just to clarify on the revolver draw. You noted that it was fully drawn with $305 million of cash on the balance sheet at the end of April. Does the $305 million represent the full revolver draw or was it a higher amount drawn on the revolver?\nScott Hardy: Thanks, Edward. This is Scott. I\u2019ll tackle the attrition question and then turn it over to Dale to address the question about the revolver draw. On attrition, certainly given the economic impact of the COVID virus, this is something that we\u2019re paying very close attention to. We\u2019re monitoring consumer credit and unemployment trends and candidly feel fortunate that we have a majority of our customer base that consists of homeowners that have a credit score of over 700. So as Dale shared, our Q1 attrition was in line with expectations, slightly better than what we\u2019ve planned. It reflects really the value that we think consumers see in the services we\u2019re providing, particularly in times of uncertainty like this. Q1 was up over Q4 by about 20 basis points. That\u2019s a function of, as we\u2019ve shared in the past, cohort level attrition and then the percent of customers that are coming out of term. That percent has been going up. But overall, we\u2019re actually performing slightly better than we would have expected in Q1. Todd shared, and I think Dale did as well, we have a history of strength and resiliency during economic downturns. We saw that in 2008 and 2009, and through April and even the first week of May. And we\u2019re seeing indicators in terms of notices of cancellation in terms of number of customers that are going into our collection process that are tracking normal and in line with our expectations, which suggests an ongoing resiliency of the business model. We\u2019ve always had a forbearance program for customers that are in some form of financial distress, and that\u2019s where we will defer payment for a period of months and then extend their contract by a meaningful amount. We did see during the last six weeks, a modest and temporary increase in the number of customers that we are proactively calling in and asking for payment forbearance. That peaked really in late March and early April. But as of last week, the number of customers asking for forbearance was coming back into line with our historical run rates. And overall, during that period, it\u2019s well under 1% of our customer base that has done that. So we\u2019re feeling, at this point, that there\u2019s no real change to how we\u2019re seeing attrition for 2020.\nDale Gerard: Thanks, Scott. And then in terms of the revolver. So the revolving credit facility, we get the - amended that in mid-February when we did some refinancing efforts. So the revolver has a total capacity of $350 million. Less LCs, there\u2019s about $334 million that\u2019s outstanding that we\u2019ve drawn. And we have $305 million in cash as of April 30. And thankfully, today, we\u2019re still sitting on about $305 million of cash. So we really brought that revolver down. I mean, I was around, when last time there was these kind of disruptions in the market, so we brought that down as really - in case there was some disruption in the financial markets. And we could - we\u2019re able - and we didn\u2019t need it to draw it. We weren\u2019t able to, so we - in the abundance of consciousness, we drew down on that revolver, again, as sitting in cash on our balance sheet. And like I said, we drew down - total revolver outstanding drawdowns is $334 million and we\u2019re sitting on $300 million in cash, which you\u2019ll see when the Q comes out that we used about $30 million in operating cash flow for the first quarter.\nTodd Pedersen: And again, I think this was asked earlier, but we have given projections of getting cash flow neutral in 18 to 24 months. We are incredibly focused on trying to accomplish cash flow neutrality this year. There are factors that still remain with can we roll out our entire program? Will it last? Do states get shut back down? But what I would say is, it\u2019s our primary factor. I think just through some of the numbers Dale\u2019s thrown out now, we\u2019re doing substantially better than last year and are pleased with where we\u2019re sitting right now, and I think we\u2019ll do a good job towards getting near that level this year.\nEdward Mally: Okay. That\u2019s all very helpful. Thanks very much.\nTodd Pedersen: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Shweta Khajuria with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nShweta Khajuria: Great. Thank you. Going back to the resiliency of the business model. Could you please talk about potentially worst-case scenarios should the economy enter into a deeper recession worse than, let\u2019s say, 2008, 2009? The beauty of subscription model is that it provides great resiliency, and the average life of the subscriber here is pretty long. So could you please talk about how you think about the worst-case scenario and the resiliency of the business model? And then the second question is on the strength in overall e-commerce, so how - have you changed? And I\u2019m sorry if you covered this already, but have you changed the strategic sort of focus towards the strength in e-commerce and that as a channel, given that in the in-person sales channel is paused for now? Thank you.\nTodd Pedersen: Sure. Thanks for the questions. I\u2019m going to answer the first part of that. So knowing that unemployment rates are continuing to rise, we do understand that there\u2019s risk to some of our subscribers losing their jobs, not having the ability to pay as of yet. And I think we\u2019re kind of in the middle of it, but not at the end of it. We have not - if you\u2019re hearing our numbers here, we are not - we have not yet been affected by that. In fact, we\u2019ve seen slight improvements on all of the metrics in our business. And this is a product and service that provides safety and peace of mind. And with - and this is really important. With the differentiation, with the platform that we\u2019ve developed with camera technology and the software we have around our doorbell camera and packaged theft-detection deterrents, our outdoor cameras with the lurker alerts, just enhancing what we deliver, the demand is higher, whether it be someone who doesn\u2019t have anything at this point or that does have our services. And so it doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re completely protected from a continued downside scenario from a macroeconomic perspective, but we\u2019re in a very good position compared to most companies and most industries. We\u2019re deemed an essential service from states for a reason. It\u2019s essential to customers. And really, depending on what their circumstances are with family or be it pets or children or elderly parents that need to be cared and provided for and watched over. So we were - in fact, we\u2019re very proud of the fact that we deliver such incredible services, especially nowadays. But from a company perspective, here\u2019s what I would say, we\u2019ve taken a lot of time and been very surgical about looking at additional potential downsides and continued economic downturn, how we manage the business, how we manage costs in the field and otherwise, how we spend, budgets, prioritization of projects that we have. There are things that we can pull back on more. There\u2019s obviously overhead that can be either reallocated or readjusted to adjust to the current economic environment. So I would say we - this management team has a very organized and detailed and structured plan in the event that the economic downturn worsens and starts to affect us. And that will either be through attrition or lack of demand from the consumers, which we\u2019re not seeing any - either of those at this point. It doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t or won\u2019t, but at this point we have not seen that. Again, Scott mentioned a slight increase in the deferment program - or deferral program, but that\u2019s back in line. It was slight and momentary. So we\u2019re - again, we\u2019re watching on a daily basis every important metric that there is that you can watch in that regard, so...\nScott Hardy: Yeah, from an e-commerce perspective, Shweta, certainly our two primary go-to-market channels are direct-to-home and inside sales, and we are testing and constantly piloting other forms of channel distribution to get to market. E-commerce is one of those. I think, certainly, we\u2019ll see a continued trend accelerated by the COVID virus towards the e-commerce. And so that\u2019s an area we continue to test into, to evaluate. It\u2019s not really built into our forecast at this point, and so it\u2019s all upside for us as we\u2019re able to find the right bit and drive acquisition through those types of channels.\nShweta Khajuria: Okay. Thank you, both.\nTodd Pedersen: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kunal Madhukar with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nKunal Madhukar: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. A couple, if I may. One, with regard to the guide, especially on like subscriber gross adds. What are the assumptions that are going into the guide, especially in terms of how much do you think the direct-to-home can kind of get? How much do you think the national inside sales can kind of get? And how does that change - and especially in light of - we may be headed into a new normal, which we don\u2019t even know what it could look like. And so what happens if we have to be in a social distancing kind of an environment for the rest of the year? And then with regard to the financing on the upfront equipment, maybe you haven\u2019t seen it until now, maybe credit is still easy. What happens in an environment where credit becomes tougher? And do you think - how do you think that could potentially impact the subscriber growth for the rest of the year?\nTodd Pedersen: Yeah. So on the first part of the question - this is Todd. We don\u2019t break out the numbers to the specific channels, but this is what I would tell you. From an inside sales perspective, demand has been up over kind of our expected run rate in that channel. We - obviously, we mentioned we\u2019ve put on pause the direct-to-home program. Not all of the states - as you all know, not all of the states are open for any type of business, let alone someone going into neighborhoods and into homes. We\u2019ve made - well, what I can say is this. In the markets that we\u2019re in, in the states that are opened up, productivity per sales rep is up, which again speaks to the demand and the interest that people have in the services that we deliver - we do deliver. And from a social distancing perspective, we\u2019ve adjusted - from an engagement perspective, social distancing perspective. And then also tools perspective, we\u2019ve changed how we interact and engage with the consumer if needs be. In fact, some customers, we will not engage them directly. We will keep our social distance, and they will ask why won\u2019t we enter their home? But we are not entering homes unless people ask us to. And we obviously have done the physical checks on our sales force and our installation force every morning, making sure they have no signs of the virus, and then also asking the appropriate question to the family or home owner that we\u2019re entering into. But even with the change in environment and how we engage with consumers, which also includes the ability to do video - we\u2019ve all learned this. The ability to do a sales call over video, we have that capability, too, now like anyone else does in this situation. We\u2019ve adjusted, and the performance is very good. Now the question would be, and this is the - we pulled back on our gross subscriber adds because we did pause the direct-to-home program and there are states that still are not open yet. So that would be the difference in the number. But as far as productivity goes and engagement goes - and if this is the new norm, we\u2019re okay with that because we can accomplish what we need to accomplish with - just keep - continue to have social distancing and that type of thing. So we feel very confident in that regard. On the credit side, Dale is going to talk about that.\nDale Gerard: Yeah. Just one more. So I think, again, we don\u2019t give out guidance in terms of by channel, but I think what you could take Todd\u2019s - what Todd\u2019s saying is on the direct-to-home, whatever you have in your model for the full year, assume that we don\u2019t have very much for April because that channel was paused. That was pause kind of mid-March. So you could kind of say from mid-March until right now we\u2019re just starting to ramp back up. And as Todd said, we\u2019re probably about 70% of where we would normally be at this point in terms of reps out on the doors. So if you can kind of think through that as you remodel that. In terms of financing, again, we stay in very, very close contact with our two consumer financing partners. We have a primary and a secondary financing partner. We\u2019ve not seen anything at this point. It\u2019s something - it\u2019s one of those metrics, I guess, as Todd said, we watch every day and every morning. Early in the morning I get the report and I look at those to see what was the - what declines were we seeing yesterday, what were the reasons for declines on financing, what approval rates were, all the different things by channel. And so again, we\u2019re in contact with these partners. They\u2019re very committed to the program. They still are open for business and looking to put on new business. And so we\u2019re watching this, but we think that we have really good partners to partner with us here. And our customers - as Todd said, a lot of these customers - the demand for the products there and customers, their FICO score and their financial situation is still allowing them to continue to purchase this and get finance more of the product.\nTodd Pedersen: And look, anyone that\u2019s in the financial world that\u2019s lending money, whether it be a corporation or an individual or consumer, they\u2019re going to lend into a space or an industry where they\u2019re going to get a consistent return. And if you look at our - the financials and the numbers and you think about the forbearance on our customers, as it stands right now, numbers are trending really well as expected or slightly better than that. And so we believe that as long as our customer base is paying their bill and the demand is there so they can onboard more financing under on to the platform, we\u2019re in good position. Again, like Dale said, we\u2019re in communication with Citizens constantly, and they\u2019ve been a great partner. And by the way, they partner up with some other really large-scale companies that also depend on that financing. So as it stands today, we feel great. Now if that changed and the - Citizens went away, we do have a secondary financing partner. There are others out there we are not engaged with physically. But from a conversation perspective, there are others we\u2019re having conversations with. If it all went away, and that may be the question you\u2019re asking, we would have - we\u2019d slow down growth. But as it stands today in this current - and cut back costs, and there are other measures that we would take as a business. But as it stands right now, we feel like we\u2019re in a good position, so...\nKunal Madhukar: That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks, Todd. Thanks, Dale. A quick follow-up on the ARPU, the service ARPU. That declined precipitously on a year-over-year basis versus the declines that we\u2019ve been seeing previously. What happened there?\nDale Gerard: Yeah. Again, this goes back to how we\u2019ve talked about the pricing model and Flex Pay model, where ARPU - and a little bit - Todd talked about this a little bit in the fourth quarter call. We\u2019re actually looking - as we continue to drive cash - to cash flow neutral goal here, we\u2019re pushing - we\u2019re starting to leverage pricing upfront on some of the products and some of the sales at the point of sale. And what you\u2019re seeing, a little bit of that is that we\u2019re giving - our ARPU is coming down a little bit. Our service ARPU is coming in a little bit as the customers are paying more for the equipment and financing more. When you look at it out of pocket for a customer, it\u2019s still in that mid $70 a month range. $72 to $75 a month, the customer is paying. It\u2019s just that that bill now is split a little bit differently and a little bit more going to the finance partners, which, by the way, we get all that cash upfront. So the economics on that customer and the return on that capital is much better for us. And so that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing, and you\u2019re seeing that kind of flow through.\nTodd Pedersen: So this is very, very important. You mentioned the word precipitous. It\u2019s actually - this is actually a good thing. We\u2019ve talked about our objective to get to cash flow neutrality. This is one of those levers. Our old model - and if you look at some of the other models in consumer finance - or consumer-facing businesses, our old model was, we got all $75, but we had to finance that entire SAC on our balance sheet. Now we\u2019re having the consumer finance more of the hardware upfront. We\u2019re getting that cash upfront. And it\u2019s one of the drivers that\u2019s getting us towards cash flow neutrality. So it\u2019s - we\u2019re very, very pleased with the results. And I think everyone on this phone call will feel the same when we kind of finish up the year and we see the results of that. And so there\u2019s no reduction in demand for services. In fact, it\u2019s the opposite. There\u2019s an increasing demand for the hardware and services. We\u2019re just using finance as a lever to not have to go back to the debt work. So we\u2019re very pleased with this result.\nKunal Madhukar: Thank you so much. Thanks, that\u2019s most helpful.\nTodd Pedersen: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Todd Morgan with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nTodd Morgan: Thanks and thanks for the question. I guess, I must say, I think you guys are doing a pretty amazing job here. If I\u2019m looking at this, you added 50,000 gross subscribers in the first quarter this year when there was clearly issues. That was a couple of thousand more than you had a year ago, and in before that. So that\u2019s pretty strong. It looks like, if I\u2019m doing some quick math, that you think for the full year that the gross adds might be maybe 50,000 or so less than they were in 2019. Is it - I mean, can I kind of simplistically extrapolate out and say the net subscriber acquisition costs, that\u2019s probably close to $100 million of cash outlays that you would potentially avoid? Is it fair to think of things in that way? And I think you did say you might roll some of that back into sort of brand enhancement. But I mean, that\u2019s a big difference in the cash uses, if I\u2019m thinking about that right. Is that fair?\nDale Gerard: Yeah, I think the cash uses, I mean, if you looked at - we\u2019re still putting out about $1,000 on a sub. So if you say we\u2019re going to do less than 50,000 subs despite close to the $50 million of cash saving, $50 million to $60 million. But I think you\u2019re exactly right. That is a large cash savings if we\u2019re not able to do that. And then to the brand question, I think, Todd will give you what - whether we reinvest that money into brand.\nTodd Pedersen: Yes. So I mean, look, we are interested - we know that the services we deliver are very differentiated and special, and people that have them are raving fans. And it\u2019s getting better and better with technology advancements, and there are innovation centers developing enhancements in the software and the firmware and the deployment. We\u2019re just getting better at it. So we are laying out plans to begin to brand and market the business and services. Because frankly, a lot of people just don\u2019t even know who Vivint is, and we\u2019ve got 1.5 million subscribers. And so we intend to tell that story. Now we are not going to do that until we\u2019re confident that we have ex [ph] beyond - I\u2019d say, we\u2019re not going to do that until we\u2019re cash flow positive. We\u2019re not going to spend our debt to start a big marketing and demand-gen program. You\u2019re not going to see that. But we are feeling confident enough about the plans that we have laid out in the upcoming months. And we need to prep for that, think about that, think about how to tell the story, integrate that into our kind of ongoing financials and investment. So we hope to do it, intend to do it, but we will not do it until we have excess cash beyond neutrality.\nTodd Morgan: Okay. Great. And then just is there any change in the way you\u2019re sort of thinking about or processing sort of the second-look customers that you\u2019re signing up now? Are there more or less of those? Are you doing anything differently? Thanks.\nDale Gerard: Yes, no. It\u2019s - we rolled out the - Fortiva as our second financing partner, rolled those out in April of 2019. That is still the same as it\u2019s always been. They\u2019re kind of taking a look at anything that doesn\u2019t kind of get financed by Citizens, and rightly closes down to them. So really no change in that process at all.\nTodd Morgan: Okay. Good luck. And thank you.\nDale Gerard: Thanks, Todd.\nTodd Pedersen: Thanks for the question.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back to management for closing remarks.\nTodd Pedersen: We appreciate everyone getting on the call. I know some people had a bit of a difficult time getting on. Thanks for the patience with that. Again, management is incredibly pleased with Q1 performance. Although it\u2019s been a bit of a hectic last few months for us and other companies and individuals across the world, we felt like we\u2019ve responded quickly and decisively. And we look forward to a very good 2020 year. And you can expect us to deliver on the numbers. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

And today, we will cover three main topics: discuss our financial and operating results for the first quarter, review our customer engagement and the performance of our platform during this difficult time, and highlight key elements of our business and actions we've taken that give us confidence in our performance for the remainder of 2020 and beyond. We've had a great start to 2020, and we are pleased to see significant improvements in our key metrics year-over-year. Revenue in total subscribers continue to grow, and EBITDA margins continue to expand despite the challenges related to the current environment. Dale will provide more specifics on the financials during his remarks, as well as share updated thoughts about our full year 2020 performance. The remainder of my commentary will focus on the Vivint Smart Home story in the context of COVID-19. Why our customers value our services even more during difficult and uncertain times like these, why we think our financial model is built to withstand the current environment, what proactive operational measures we have taken to protect our employees, our customers and our business and how we plan to get back up to speed with our direct owned sales teams. Our services qualify is essential under the guidelines issued by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. In a time when we're asked to stay at home for an extended period, there's no better time to have a comprehensive smart home system. Vivint Smart Home provides essential services to nearly 1.6 million customers across North America. Vivint services include life-saving and life-protecting 24/7 professional monitoring for emergency situations such as medical, fire, carbon monoxide and burglary alerts. Our vertically integrated model includes dedicated customer care and monitoring teams to ensure that we respond to these alerts from our customers within seconds. Our cloud platform and proprietary technology also allows customers to seamlessly manage and protect their homes, whether they're sheltering in place or away. Vivint takes care of our customers and their families while providing the peace of mind that people demand during times of heightened awareness, anxiety, crime and uncertainty. We've been securing and creating smart homes for over 20 years. So I can tell you from experience that Vivint has a history of exhibiting strength and resiliency through challenging economic times. For example, we only witnessed a slight increase in customer attrition in 2008 and 2009 during the global financial crisis. Although the current pandemic poses a unique set of societal problems compared to then, we are confident that our customers will continue to value home security and smart home technology. In fact, a case can be made for pent-up demand forming as a result of this crisis. We have long believed the total addressable market for smart home presents a massive opportunity, and in the not so distant future, the vast majority of the 150 million homes in North America will be running on a comprehensive smart home operating system. We believe Vivint is the best-positioned provider to take advantage should demand accelerate in this way. We are confident in our value proposition because it has been proven over two decades. Today, we have over 21 million connected devices on the Vivint Smart Home proprietary cloud-based platform, and we are uniquely qualified to help our customers deal with the current environment across the various smart home devices we support. From door locks, cameras, security monitoring, thermostats, lighting controls, smart speakers and many other connected devices. All of these innovative products are designed to work together seamlessly through our elegant platform that homeowners can control from their in-home touchscreen hub, through a single app on their phone or other devices or by simply using their voice. Even prior to the current health and economic crisis, we already had the industry-leading engagement on our smart home operating system, with over 13 interactions a day on average and over 1.4 billion daily events being processed on our cloud platform. During the current pandemic, our platform has continued to seamlessly handle all daily interactions as our customers have relied even more on their smart home systems for various and often evolving use cases. Some of these use cases are very intuitive, such as our next-generation doorbell camera that intelligently detects packages and actively helps protect them from porch pirates. With more than 1 million packages that are still on - go missing from porches every day, our newest doorbell camera helps provide homeowners with peace of mind by helping to prevent crime before it happens. Other use cases have become increasingly important while we've been sheltering in place, such as using indoor smart cameras to keep a watchful eye on elderly parents while social distancing or to make sure kids are doing their homework during the sudden era of distance learning. Customers are relying even more on smart smoke detectors as more home cooking takes place. And they are recognizing the value of our AI-powered outdoor cameras that recognizes potential lurkers and can sound an alert to scare way potential thieves. Whatever it may be, our customers have been more reliant on the various smart devices that we professionally installed for them in these ways and more. And they continue to lean on our nationwide team of dedicated smart home employees for a more urgent interaction such as real-time security monitoring or to get help in the event of medical emergency. The bottom line is that frequent engagement in the Vivint system is a very good indicator for us, and it's happening across our customer base during this pandemic. Although our value proposition is clear and we fully expect that our current customers will continue to make the most of what their Vivint system offers them, we also acknowledge that our ability to capitalize on any near term demand for new smart home systems is limited, particularly in light of state sheltering in place, coupled with our own decision to pause all direct-to-home sales in mid-March. Overall uncertainty at the macro level remains at historic highs, and we are closely monitoring how that continues to impact the credit markets and unemployment rates. There are very real risks that the world could be hit with additional waves of the virus, causing more social and economic disruption before a reliable vaccine is ready for widespread use. Fortunately, we benefit from a highly predictable and recurring revenue model, in which roughly 90% of our expected revenue for 2020 was under contract at the beginning of the year. Vivint has also implemented a number of operational changes and safety procedures to continue to protect the health and well-being of our employees while still providing the exceptional service levels our customers have come to rely on. All of these considerations give us great confidence in our ability to weather the current economic environment. To give you a sense for the actions we've taken, we have transitioned our highly nimble workforce, including all corporate employees and more than 1,500 of our customer care professionals, to effective work-from-home environments, where they continue to provide uninterrupted customer service and maintain our high-quality standards. We are maintaining our geographically dispersed central monitoring stations to provide 24/7 professional monitoring services for all emergencies. Furthermore, we are now conducting daily fitness-for-duty assessments for all customer-facing employees, which includes a temperature and symptoms check. We are contacting customers before a visit to determine if anyone in the home is experiencing signs of illness or has been exposed to COVID-19, and rescheduling appointments when necessary. We are closely following CDC guidelines for social distancing and hand-washing, including cleaning workspaces and surfaces and not shaking hands with customers. And of course, we're using protective sanitary equipment during service visits such as disposable gloves, masks and hand sanitizer. We have implemented detailed business continuity plans intended to ensure the health, safety and well-being of our customers, employees and communities, and to protect the financial and operational strength of the company. Dale has more of the details that he'll share during his remarks around these efforts. But rest assured that we're remaining judicious around overhead spend, budgets, projects and everything else related to our goal of getting to cash flow neutral. That philosophy has not changed as a result of the pandemic, and we are tracking ahead of our previously stated timeline of 18 to 24 months. Moving now to our plans to resume direct to home sales, which account for about 50% of our new subscriber adds. Our sales teams are ready to hit the ground running, and they have received extensive training on proper interactions with customers in light of the current environment. The key gating factor is that we must follow individual state guidelines in ramping our sales teams across the country. At this point, many states have reopened, and we estimate that our direct to home sales teams are operating at about 70% of their full capacity. In time and assuming no further major setbacks from COVID-19, we're optimistic that the upcoming summer sales period will proceed. While all of this is happening, our priority remains to take all appropriate steps to protect the health, well-being of our employees and customers. Our other sales channel, national inside sales, which onboards nearly half of all new accounts in a normal environment, has continued to operate without material interruption throughout the pandemic. While we anticipate eventually reaching a full deployment of our direct to home sales channel in the U.S. over the next few weeks, in Canada, because of the lack of consumer financing options and that each account sold there historically has required a significant cash investment by the company, Vivint will no longer originate new customers through the direct-to-home channel. We will continue to sell smart homes through our national inside sales channel. Furthermore, we remain committed to our customers in Canada, and we'll continue to operate there with dedicated support and services. We anticipate that funding the vast majority of our new customers via the Vivint Flex Pay program will continue to be a key driver in our strategy of profitable subscriber growth. Our external customer financing partners have expressed their commitment to maintaining their current underwriting standards of new smart home customers through the current economic downturn. We believe that we are widening our lead over the competition in enabling customers to easily finance a full smart home experience while also dramatically improving Vivint's unit economics and the company's cash flow dynamics. I will now turn the call over to Dale to go through specifics of our first quarter results, as well as to provide our updated thoughts on the remainder of fiscal 2020. This is Todd Pedersen speaking. Thanks for the compliment, by the way, on the quarter, we were super happy with it. So it is - it's a result of our direct-to-home program being put on pause, which was about mid-March. Obviously, like anyone else, we're trying to be respectful around the states being shut down. And here's the update on that. We have re-launched that program. We are - by this weekend, we feel like we'll be about 70% of what we normally would be from a sales rep perspective. There are still states that are not open to do business on the door-to-door program. We kind of - we're making some adjustments on where they might change as far as markets go. So that - so the number of subscribers is a result of that. The thing I would say, though, is the places that we have deployed. And it's early, still, but the receptivity and the per-rep average, if we look at it on a daily basis on a per-rep basis is very strong. So we're trying to - we're optimistic because we are having great interactions with consumers. We've adjusted the process on how we sell in the neighborhoods and not going in people's homes if they don't feel comfortable with that. And trying to kind of practice social distancing, but we're optimistic by trying to make sure that we're conservative on the projection side. It's actually just - I want to be clear on this. They've - it's been amazing how welcoming people are. Again, we're wearing masks, gloves, keeping our distance. They can actually e-sign to a cell phone or a tablet, so not to interact directly with the customer, not to go into their homes, but the productivity per rep is really good. So the receptivity from consumers and the demands for our product and services at this time is quite amazing, so... I want to add something to that. This is - it's super important to cite this. We've been reporting publicly for about seven years now. And if people go back a few years back - and again, without public shareholders, we had debt holders. Our service costs several years back was north of $18 per subscriber per month, which, by the way, the business still worked at that level. But the - our decision to build out and own a proprietary technology stack, the operating system, the firmware, the hardware, the hardware development, again, like Scott mentioned, the diagnostic tools, this is an incredible and important moat we've created and the capability that we have as a company to continue to enhance and tweak these - all of these functions of business to continue to improve the service cost. But really, really important is the delivery of the products and the service to customers. So customer satisfaction is way up. This is not we reduce cost and our service levels are worse, this is our service levels are as good as they've ever been. So we're incredibly pleased with these results. Scott is being a bit modest. Look, there is the reality. We have - we're now starting to get the benefit of all the investments we've made in the technology stack, and we're getting operational efficiencies there. But even from a corporate side, because of the tools and technologies and our ability to deliver, and we're able to bring back some of those costs and get operational efficiencies from a corporate perspective also. So we're super pleased with all of this. And this is all - this process, and you all noticed, we started this before COVID hit, so this is just a continuation of what we're already focused on. You bet, Todd. Yeah. So there's - it's multiple fronts. Obviously, the net subscriber acquisition cost is something that we focused on. You've seen a gain there. You're going to see continued improvement there. We've - I think we show a reduction in RICs from last year to this year of about 50%. You're going to see that improve. In fact, it's going to be one of the biggest gains that you'll see from the company. So really important. We're trying to make sure that we're financing these product sales off-balance sheet. We - and again, mentioned that we're now not onboarding new customers from the direct-to-home side in Canada, which we - we have never found a partner to provide the consumer financing. So those subscribers were all again on-boarded on balance sheet. They were great subscribers, great credit scores, but there was a large amount of cash usage. We are still servicing the customer base up there, and they are our customers, but the exchange rate and the lack of consumer financing available there, we've chosen to halt that. Now we are still onboarding customers that call in and/or are referred into the company, so we have full capability of installation and service up there. And then just a plan of production in expenses and cost and reducing some budgets and eliminating projects here and there. So we're just really fine-tuning the way we operate this business. We intend, just so everyone knows, to take some of those savings, cash savings, and start to focus on growing and building the brand, telling the story. We have an incredible story to tell. We have an incredible technology and service that we can deliver to consumers, which is in very high demand right now, especially in this period of time. And just the quality of product and the design and the delivery of the services has now come to a point where like, okay, it's time to really focus on growing this business as we take advantage of this large market that we're part of. And the $30 million, to be clear, is not part of the service cost reduction. It's separate. And again, I think this was asked earlier, but we have given projections of getting cash flow neutral in 18 to 24 months. We are incredibly focused on trying to accomplish cash flow neutrality this year. There are factors that still remain with can we roll out our entire program? Will it last? Do states get shut back down? But what I would say is, it's our primary factor. I think just through some of the numbers Dale's thrown out now, we're doing substantially better than last year and are pleased with where we're sitting right now, and I think we'll do a good job towards getting near that level this year. Thank you. Sure. Thanks for the questions. I'm going to answer the first part of that. So knowing that unemployment rates are continuing to rise, we do understand that there's risk to some of our subscribers losing their jobs, not having the ability to pay as of yet. And I think we're kind of in the middle of it, but not at the end of it. We have not - if you're hearing our numbers here, we are not - we have not yet been affected by that. In fact, we've seen slight improvements on all of the metrics in our business. And this is a product and service that provides safety and peace of mind. And with - and this is really important. With the differentiation, with the platform that we've developed with camera technology and the software we have around our doorbell camera and packaged theft-detection deterrents, our outdoor cameras with the lurker alerts, just enhancing what we deliver, the demand is higher, whether it be someone who doesn't have anything at this point or that does have our services. And so it doesn't mean that we're completely protected from a continued downside scenario from a macroeconomic perspective, but we're in a very good position compared to most companies and most industries. We're deemed an essential service from states for a reason. It's essential to customers. And really, depending on what their circumstances are with family or be it pets or children or elderly parents that need to be cared and provided for and watched over. So we were - in fact, we're very proud of the fact that we deliver such incredible services, especially nowadays. But from a company perspective, here's what I would say, we've taken a lot of time and been very surgical about looking at additional potential downsides and continued economic downturn, how we manage the business, how we manage costs in the field and otherwise, how we spend, budgets, prioritization of projects that we have. There are things that we can pull back on more. There's obviously overhead that can be either reallocated or readjusted to adjust to the current economic environment. So I would say we - this management team has a very organized and detailed and structured plan in the event that the economic downturn worsens and starts to affect us. And that will either be through attrition or lack of demand from the consumers, which we're not seeing any - either of those at this point. It doesn't mean that we can't or won't, but at this point we have not seen that. Again, Scott mentioned a slight increase in the deferment program - or deferral program, but that's back in line. It was slight and momentary. So we're - again, we're watching on a daily basis every important metric that there is that you can watch in that regard, so... Thank you. Yeah. So on the first part of the question - this is Todd. We don't break out the numbers to the specific channels, but this is what I would tell you. From an inside sales perspective, demand has been up over kind of our expected run rate in that channel. We - obviously, we mentioned we've put on pause the direct-to-home program. Not all of the states - as you all know, not all of the states are open for any type of business, let alone someone going into neighborhoods and into homes. We've made - well, what I can say is this. In the markets that we're in, in the states that are opened up, productivity per sales rep is up, which again speaks to the demand and the interest that people have in the services that we deliver - we do deliver. And from a social distancing perspective, we've adjusted - from an engagement perspective, social distancing perspective. And then also tools perspective, we've changed how we interact and engage with the consumer if needs be. In fact, some customers, we will not engage them directly. We will keep our social distance, and they will ask why won't we enter their home? But we are not entering homes unless people ask us to. And we obviously have done the physical checks on our sales force and our installation force every morning, making sure they have no signs of the virus, and then also asking the appropriate question to the family or home owner that we're entering into. But even with the change in environment and how we engage with consumers, which also includes the ability to do video - we've all learned this. The ability to do a sales call over video, we have that capability, too, now like anyone else does in this situation. We've adjusted, and the performance is very good. Now the question would be, and this is the - we pulled back on our gross subscriber adds because we did pause the direct-to-home program and there are states that still are not open yet. So that would be the difference in the number. But as far as productivity goes and engagement goes - and if this is the new norm, we're okay with that because we can accomplish what we need to accomplish with - just keep - continue to have social distancing and that type of thing. So we feel very confident in that regard. On the credit side, Dale is going to talk about that. And look, anyone that's in the financial world that's lending money, whether it be a corporation or an individual or consumer, they're going to lend into a space or an industry where they're going to get a consistent return. And if you look at our - the financials and the numbers and you think about the forbearance on our customers, as it stands right now, numbers are trending really well as expected or slightly better than that. And so we believe that as long as our customer base is paying their bill and the demand is there so they can onboard more financing under on to the platform, we're in good position. Again, like Dale said, we're in communication with Citizens constantly, and they've been a great partner. And by the way, they partner up with some other really large-scale companies that also depend on that financing. So as it stands today, we feel great. Now if that changed and the - Citizens went away, we do have a secondary financing partner. There are others out there we are not engaged with physically. But from a conversation perspective, there are others we're having conversations with. If it all went away, and that may be the question you're asking, we would have - we'd slow down growth. But as it stands today in this current - and cut back costs, and there are other measures that we would take as a business. But as it stands right now, we feel like we're in a good position, so... So this is very, very important. You mentioned the word precipitous. It's actually - this is actually a good thing. We've talked about our objective to get to cash flow neutrality. This is one of those levers. Our old model - and if you look at some of the other models in consumer finance - or consumer-facing businesses, our old model was, we got all $75, but we had to finance that entire SAC on our balance sheet. Now we're having the consumer finance more of the hardware upfront. We're getting that cash upfront. And it's one of the drivers that's getting us towards cash flow neutrality. So it's - we're very, very pleased with the results. And I think everyone on this phone call will feel the same when we kind of finish up the year and we see the results of that. And so there's no reduction in demand for services. In fact, it's the opposite. There's an increasing demand for the hardware and services. We're just using finance as a lever to not have to go back to the debt work. So we're very pleased with this result. Thank you. Yes. So I mean, look, we are interested - we know that the services we deliver are very differentiated and special, and people that have them are raving fans. And it's getting better and better with technology advancements, and there are innovation centers developing enhancements in the software and the firmware and the deployment. We're just getting better at it. So we are laying out plans to begin to brand and market the business and services. Because frankly, a lot of people just don't even know who Vivint is, and we've got 1.5 million subscribers. And so we intend to tell that story. Now we are not going to do that until we're confident that we have ex [ph] beyond - I'd say, we're not going to do that until we're cash flow positive. We're not going to spend our debt to start a big marketing and demand-gen program. You're not going to see that. But we are feeling confident enough about the plans that we have laid out in the upcoming months. And we need to prep for that, think about that, think about how to tell the story, integrate that into our kind of ongoing financials and investment. So we hope to do it, intend to do it, but we will not do it until we have excess cash beyond neutrality. Thanks for the question. We appreciate everyone getting on the call. I know some people had a bit of a difficult time getting on. Thanks for the patience with that. Again, management is incredibly pleased with Q1 performance. Although it's been a bit of a hectic last few months for us and other companies and individuals across the world, we felt like we've responded quickly and decisively. And we look forward to a very good 2020 year. And you can expect us to deliver on the numbers. Thank you."

            "name": "Scott Hardy",
            "content": "Yeah, Rod. This is Scott. As we've shared, we continue to see impressive gains on service costs, and that's a function of the vertically integrated business model that Todd talked about, having the integrated software platform, the hardware, the diagnostic tools, controlling the installation process, that's really helped us drive some significant improvements, both on the cost side and, importantly, on the customer satisfaction side. That said, historically, our service costs have been seasonally lower in Q1. Our service costs tend to be highest in the early months of a customer's life cycle. So given the seasonality of how we generally put new customers on, particularly in the summer, we tend to see service costs increase in the back half of the year. So while we're really encouraged by the current trends on service costs and the Q1 results, we wouldn't anticipate a sustained full year results at that level. So you'll see some of it in the subscriber acquisition cost and a lot of it in the G&A. Thanks, Edward. This is Scott. I'll tackle the attrition question and then turn it over to Dale to address the question about the revolver draw. On attrition, certainly given the economic impact of the COVID virus, this is something that we're paying very close attention to. We're monitoring consumer credit and unemployment trends and candidly feel fortunate that we have a majority of our customer base that consists of homeowners that have a credit score of over 700. So as Dale shared, our Q1 attrition was in line with expectations, slightly better than what we've planned. It reflects really the value that we think consumers see in the services we're providing, particularly in times of uncertainty like this. Q1 was up over Q4 by about 20 basis points. That's a function of, as we've shared in the past, cohort level attrition and then the percent of customers that are coming out of term. That percent has been going up. But overall, we're actually performing slightly better than we would have expected in Q1. Todd shared, and I think Dale did as well, we have a history of strength and resiliency during economic downturns. We saw that in 2008 and 2009, and through April and even the first week of May. And we're seeing indicators in terms of notices of cancellation in terms of number of customers that are going into our collection process that are tracking normal and in line with our expectations, which suggests an ongoing resiliency of the business model. We've always had a forbearance program for customers that are in some form of financial distress, and that's where we will defer payment for a period of months and then extend their contract by a meaningful amount. We did see during the last six weeks, a modest and temporary increase in the number of customers that we are proactively calling in and asking for payment forbearance. That peaked really in late March and early April. But as of last week, the number of customers asking for forbearance was coming back into line with our historical run rates. And overall, during that period, it's well under 1% of our customer base that has done that. So we're feeling, at this point, that there's no real change to how we're seeing attrition for 2020. Yeah, from an e-commerce perspective, Shweta, certainly our two primary go-to-market channels are direct-to-home and inside sales, and we are testing and constantly piloting other forms of channel distribution to get to market. E-commerce is one of those. I think, certainly, we'll see a continued trend accelerated by the COVID virus towards the e-commerce. And so that's an area we continue to test into, to evaluate. It's not really built into our forecast at this point, and so it's all upside for us as we're able to find the right bit and drive acquisition through those types of channels."
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Dale Gerard",
            "content": "Thanks, Todd. I'll walk through the financial slide portion of the presentation that we posted today in conjunction with our earnings release. On slide eight, we highlight our revenue, adjusted EBITDA and covenant adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. For first quarter 2020, revenue grew by 9.8% to $303.2 million. The growth in revenue is attributable to a 7.1% increase in total subscribers as well as a 2.3% increase in the average monthly revenue per user. In the center of slide eight, adjusted EBITDA has scaled nicely for the first quarter. The primary drivers were lower net service costs and continued scaling of our general and administrative expenses. For the quarter, we are proud to have scaled adjusted EBITDA margins by 570 basis points to 44.5% of revenue compared to 38.8% in the first quarter of 2019. Meanwhile, covenant adjusted EBITDA, which is a calculation used for our debt covenants, scaled by 840 basis points to 62.6% of revenue compared to 54.2% in the first quarter of 2019. As you look on slide nine, we highlight a few data points for the subscriber portfolio, which were strong across the board. Total subscribers at quarter-end grew from 1.45 million to 1.55 million or 7.1%. Average monthly revenue per user, or AMRU also increased to $65.27, up 2.3% year-over-year. AMRU has been moving up nicely due to recognition of deferred revenue and effective cross-selling of new products, such as our newest generation of outdoor and doorbell cameras. On the next slide, slide 10, we highlight a few points on new subscribers. New subscriber originations were 50,053 for the first quarter, which is strong considering that direct-to-home sales were paused in mid-March. We continue to refine and improve the underwriting requirements of our business, decreasing the number of retail installment contracts or RICs. We saw favorable year-over-year trends in subscriber financing mix during the first quarter, highlighted by a 53% reduction in the number of subscribers financed through retail installment contracts. By shifting a greater proportion of our subscribers away from RICs and towards our third-party financing partners and pay in full, we are able to reduce our net subscriber acquisition cost and improve our cash flow dynamics. As we look to the future, we will be focused on delivering a true smart home experience to millions of homes in a profitable and cash neutral way. Moving to slide 11, we will cover our net service cost per subscriber and net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber. The reduction in net service cost continued to be a significant driver of our earnings improvement during the first quarter of 2020. We continued our trend of year-over-year improvements in net service cost per subscriber, moving from $17.04 in the first quarter of 2018 to $13.83 in the first quarter of 2019, and now to $11.76 in the most recent quarter, a $5.28 improvement versus 2018. This represents the lowest service cost per subscriber in the last five years by a significant margin and demonstrates the advantage of Vivint's vertically integrated smart home cloud platform, which encompasses the software, the hardware, the installation and ongoing customer support. As we continue to make improvements in all of these areas, we're seeing continued positive trends in both the cost of service and customer satisfaction. The result is that our net service margin continued its increasing trend, moving from 68.6% in the first quarter of 2018 to 74% in the first quarter of 2019 and now to 77% in the most recent quarter. These efforts largely explain the improvement seen in our adjusted EBITDA. On the right-hand side of slide 11, we highlight our average net subscriber acquisition cost in the last 12 month period. For the first quarter ended March 31, 2020, net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber decreased to $960. That's 16% lower year-over-year as we continue to drive down the number of new subscribers that are financed on a Vivint retail installment contract and shift to a higher mix of customers utilizing our financing partners or paying in full for the purchase of their smart home products. During the quarter, we also benefited from pricing leverage on the point-of-sale purchase and installation of equipment. Before the recent pandemic hit, we had already put in place a number of cost-reduction initiatives that were completed during the first quarter and that are expected to meaningfully reduce G&A and overhead costs by streamlining operations, focusing engineering and innovation and driving better customer satisfaction. In addition to these actions and because analyzing how we can operate more efficiently is a continuous exercise of Vivint, we initiated another round of cost-cutting post COVID-19 to further reduce our discretionary spend. Slide 12 covers the lifetime value of our customers and the benefits of a reoccurring revenue model. In the last 12 months, we've added approximately $1.75 billion of lifetime value. We continue to see nice backlog numbers, which, as a reminder, represent revenue adjusted for attrition that we expect to recognize over the lifetime of a customer. Backlog at quarter end was $5.73 billion, up 9% compared to $5.24 billion a year ago. Slide 13 depicts our typical subscriber walk that illustrates the changes in total subscribers at quarter end. As expected, our attrition has trended higher than our historical averages given the higher percentage of customers that are in the end of term lifecycle phase. Our attrition dynamics are driven by two primary factors. First, the rate of attrition for a customer cohort changes as it progresses through different phases of the life cycle. We define these phases as interim, end of term and post initial term. Each phase carries with it a corresponding expected attrition rate, with attrition at its highest during the end-of-term phase. As we have shared in past earnings calls, the cohort attrition curves remain fairly steady. The second factor that affects attrition is the percent of total customers in each stage of the life cycle. The percent of customers in the end-of-term phase rose in 2019 and will stay elevated in 2020 before falling again in 2021. In the first quarter, attrition trended slightly higher sequentially by 20 basis points to 14.1%. This remains higher than our long-term trend for attrition, but is in line with our expectations given the higher percentage of customers that are in the end-of-term phase. Now we know there's a lot of curiosity out there regarding how we think our attrition curve may change as a result of the pandemic. Echoing Todd's commentary about our past experiences through severe economic downturns, as well as propensity for customers to focus inward and prioritize home security during times of crisis, at this point, we have no reason to think the same structural curve that we've discussed previously won't continue to hold, with a life cycle impact that I spoke about being the primary driver. As a case in point, our portfolio has performed slightly better than expectations in terms of attrition and other leading indicators through the end of April. That's a good segue into slide 14, where we address our business activity in the interim period since our first quarter ended in March. The key takeaway on the sales front is that we continue to see robust demand for our products and services, and we have continued to acquire new Vivint Smart Home customers, primarily via our national inside sales team, despite the challenges posed by COVID-19. On the cost side of the equation, we have curtailed discretionary spending to preserve cash and improve our highly variable cost structure. And as a result of these actions, some of which were initiated as normal course prior to COVID-19, we have achieved greater than $30 million in annualized fixed cost reductions. We have also fully drawn down on our revolving credit facility as a precautionary measure to increase our cash position, which stood at $305 million as of April 30, and preserved liquidity and flexibility in light of current uncertainty in the global financial markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, we remain on track to achieve our goals regarding cash use and are aiming to get to cash flow neutral ahead of our previously stated 18 to 24 month time frame. Finally, moving to our financial outlook for the year on slide 15. I'll first share some of the fundamental characteristics of our financial model. Over 95% of our revenue is reoccurring, which provides long-term visibility and predictability to our business. Most of our new subscribers that finance their smart home systems choose to enter into five year contracts and remain on the platform for approximately eight years driving significant lifetime margin dollars. Our strong unit economics and scale has contributed to our ability to drive significant adjusted EBITDA improvement. That said, most companies have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. And although we believe our reoccurring model makes us resilient to the full impact of the pandemic, it will affect our outcome for the year. In terms of revised guidance, we expect to end 2020 with 1.55 million to 1.62 million total subscribers. Our estimate for 2020 revenue is $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion versus previous guidance of $1.25 billion to $1.29 billion. And finally, we are reaffirming our previous 2020 adjusted EBITDA guidance of between $525 million and $535 million. Operator, please open the line for Q&A. So this is Dale. So it's going to be some service costs for sure, Rod. And then I think as we said in the prepared remarks, we've done a lot of going through our cost structure, we had taking out costs, so we feel really good about - we'll see that in the back half of the year. We did a lot of that in the first quarter, some of that early April. And so that $30 million we talked about, we'll see - on an annualized basis, we'll see some of that throughout the next nine months or eight months of 2020. So it's really kind of holding the - seeing the revenue come in, in terms of the subscribers and then servicing costs and then taking that out of cost. And it's not only on the G&A and the service side, but we also took out overhead costs. And I think you saw that in the fact that our net subscriber cost was $960. Some of that is upfront, but we're also attacking expense overhead within the sales process. Yeah. So we'll kind of break those down. The $20 million really relates around the changes in personnel and cost reductions that we did at the beginning of March. So we kind of - we'd actually talked about on the fourth quarter call from 2019 and put out, and so that's really what is included in that restructuring charge there. It's - some of it's severance and most of - half of it or so is related to stock-based comp, which was - as we - those people left and their equity - kind of their treatment of their equity changed. And then the other cost, as Todd said, we really focused on cost, whether it's in servicing. And again, really focusing on overhead and making sure that we have the right infrastructure, the right cost structure and that we're spending money in the areas that really provide either servicing customers or they're providing growth. And so as we think about service, how do we think about our leadership, our structure there, level - kind of tiers, leaders in the field, people that are in the corporate, on the servicing side. And then on the G&A - and innovation, the same thing. It's like, hey, there's a lots of products and lots of different things we can go do, but let's focus in on what we really think the customers want that can drive that kind of next-gen of products. And so it's really across all areas of the company. It's not just one area. And we've actually - I would say for 2020, we've actually taken actions that are greater than the $30 million, but some of those will - that will come back most likely in 2021, such as - not - we've discontinued any type of merit increases for \u201820. We've actually stopped matching the 401(k). So we've taken some actions. Again, we want to be ahead of it. We think that - and we've done a lot of these in early April to make sure that we're in a good position to weather any kind of storm that comes at us here. But some of those will come back next year. But the $30 million is what we think of permanently is not coming back in the budgets and different things that we've been doing. Yes. Thanks, Scott. And then in terms of the revolver. So the revolving credit facility, we get the - amended that in mid-February when we did some refinancing efforts. So the revolver has a total capacity of $350 million. Less LCs, there's about $334 million that's outstanding that we've drawn. And we have $305 million in cash as of April 30. And thankfully, today, we're still sitting on about $305 million of cash. So we really brought that revolver down. I mean, I was around, when last time there was these kind of disruptions in the market, so we brought that down as really - in case there was some disruption in the financial markets. And we could - we're able - and we didn't need it to draw it. We weren't able to, so we - in the abundance of consciousness, we drew down on that revolver, again, as sitting in cash on our balance sheet. And like I said, we drew down - total revolver outstanding drawdowns is $334 million and we're sitting on $300 million in cash, which you'll see when the Q comes out that we used about $30 million in operating cash flow for the first quarter. Yeah. Just one more. So I think, again, we don't give out guidance in terms of by channel, but I think what you could take Todd's - what Todd's saying is on the direct-to-home, whatever you have in your model for the full year, assume that we don't have very much for April because that channel was paused. That was pause kind of mid-March. So you could kind of say from mid-March until right now we're just starting to ramp back up. And as Todd said, we're probably about 70% of where we would normally be at this point in terms of reps out on the doors. So if you can kind of think through that as you remodel that. In terms of financing, again, we stay in very, very close contact with our two consumer financing partners. We have a primary and a secondary financing partner. We've not seen anything at this point. It's something - it's one of those metrics, I guess, as Todd said, we watch every day and every morning. Early in the morning I get the report and I look at those to see what was the - what declines were we seeing yesterday, what were the reasons for declines on financing, what approval rates were, all the different things by channel. And so again, we're in contact with these partners. They're very committed to the program. They still are open for business and looking to put on new business. And so we're watching this, but we think that we have really good partners to partner with us here. And our customers - as Todd said, a lot of these customers - the demand for the products there and customers, their FICO score and their financial situation is still allowing them to continue to purchase this and get finance more of the product. Yeah. Again, this goes back to how we've talked about the pricing model and Flex Pay model, where ARPU - and a little bit - Todd talked about this a little bit in the fourth quarter call. We're actually looking - as we continue to drive cash - to cash flow neutral goal here, we're pushing - we're starting to leverage pricing upfront on some of the products and some of the sales at the point of sale. And what you're seeing, a little bit of that is that we're giving - our ARPU is coming down a little bit. Our service ARPU is coming in a little bit as the customers are paying more for the equipment and financing more. When you look at it out of pocket for a customer, it's still in that mid $70 a month range. $72 to $75 a month, the customer is paying. It's just that that bill now is split a little bit differently and a little bit more going to the finance partners, which, by the way, we get all that cash upfront. So the economics on that customer and the return on that capital is much better for us. And so that's what you're seeing, and you're seeing that kind of flow through. Yeah, I think the cash uses, I mean, if you looked at - we're still putting out about $1,000 on a sub. So if you say we're going to do less than 50,000 subs despite close to the $50 million of cash saving, $50 million to $60 million. But I think you're exactly right. That is a large cash savings if we're not able to do that. And then to the brand question, I think, Todd will give you what - whether we reinvest that money into brand. Yes, no. It's - we rolled out the - Fortiva as our second financing partner, rolled those out in April of 2019. That is still the same as it's always been. They're kind of taking a look at anything that doesn't kind of get financed by Citizens, and rightly closes down to them. So really no change in that process at all. Thanks, Todd."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. \nKevin Cole: Great. Thank you, Amy. Good morning and welcome to NRG energy's fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. This morning's call is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations and Webcast. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the safe harbor in today's presentation as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's presentation. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's President and CEO. \nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm joined this morning by Alberto Fornaro, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Home Retail; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations. This is my 25th earnings call as CEO and I wanted to start with a quick look back on what we have achieved. Over the past six years, we have transformed our company from a complex industrial story into one that is much simpler and focused on our core strengths. Along the way, we have made significant progress in our strategy to get closer to the customer, optimize our generation portfolio to serve those customers, strengthen the financial health of our company and created significant shareholder value. We now turn to the next phase in our evolution of growing our business and realizing the potential around the customer. I am excited about the future and look forward to sharing our progress with all of you in the months to come. Moving on to the three key messages of today's presentation on slide four. Our business delivered results in line with the 2021 guidance, effectively navigating supply chain constraints and volatile market conditions, further validating the strength and durability of our model. Next, I am pleased to report that we have successfully executed our winter storm Uri mitigation plan and we are increasing 2022 capital available for allocation. Finally, we continue to advance our five-year strategic road map in moving closer to the customer and our commitment to being excellent stewards of shareholder capital. The 2021 financial and operational results are on slide five. Beginning with our scorecard. We executed on all our priorities. I want to thank all the employees at NRG for maintaining focus during a challenging year, which included a global pandemic, Winter Storm Uri, asset sales and the integration of Direct Energy. Importantly, we were able to operate through these conditions while setting another record for safety. This is the fourth straight year we have set a new company safety record, an incredible accomplishment worthy of recognition. Direct Energy integration remains ongoing and we are on track to achieve our run rate synergies. During the year, we outperformed our initial expectations achieving $175 million versus our original expectation of $135 million. This integration is led by the same team and supported by the same governance of the transformation plan, which gives me the utmost confidence in our ability to reach if not exceed our run rate targets. Following multiple years of rightsizing our business, 2021 marked a significant milestone in capitalizing our best-in-class consumer services platform. We added roughly 3 million customers to our portfolio and expanded the scale and scope of home power and natural gas services. Also during the year, we monetized 4.8 gigawatts of non-core fossil assets in our East and West regions. And now the retirement of 1.6 gigawatts of coal assets in the East and signed an additional 800 megawatts of renewables PPAs. Next, we continue to adhere to our disciplined capital allocation principles. In late 2021, we announced a $1 billion share repurchase program to be completed throughout 2022. We also increased our dividend per share 8% in line with our stated dividend growth rate of 7% to 9%. In June, we held our Investor Day where we revealed our five-year strategic road map to create significant stakeholder value by moving closer to the customer, while also returning significant capital to our shareholders. Moving to the right-hand side of the slide for the financial results. We delivered $433 million of adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter, 31% higher than the prior year. This brings our full year results to $2.42 billion of adjusted EBITDA, 21% higher than the prior year primarily driven by the acquisition of Direct Energy and excluding the impact from Winter Storm Uri. Finally, we are maintaining our 2022 adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth guidance ranges. We are seeing promising results in mitigating winter supply chain constraints, and I look forward to updating you next quarter. As a result of our Winter Storm Uri mitigation plan, we are increasing our 2022 capital available for allocation by $212 million, which Alberto will discuss in more detail. Now turning to slide 6 for a brief update on the ERCOT market. Following Winter Storm Uri, it was clear that market reforms from well-head to light bulb were necessary to improve grid resilience. In the months following the event, we actively engaged in discussions with legislators, regulators and other market participants to introduce comprehensive and competitive solutions across the entire system to address areas that fail. In 2021, Texas made significant progress in hardening the electric grid through power plant and transmission weatherization standards, improved market design with changes in scarcity pricing, ancillary reforms and consumer protection improvements. In 2022, we expect Texas to expand its focus on hardening the natural gas infrastructure and implementation of phase 2 of power reforms which includes resource adequacy by establishing a load-side reserve requirement and on-site fuel security. I want to comment that Texas governor's office, legislature, PUCT and ERCOT for taking swift action and accelerating effective reforms that would normally take years and addressing them within months. While our work is not done yet, we believe Texas performance through a tough winter is a strong reflection of effective actions and policies. Moving to the right-hand side of the slide for an update on the financial impact from Winter Storm Uri. I am pleased to announce that we have successfully executed our mitigation strategy. Today, we're updating the net financial impact from the storm to $380 million from our prior expected range of $500 million to $700 million. Now turning to Slide 7. It is important that we recognize our ESG principles and highlight a few of our 2021 accomplishments. We created a sustainable framework with a strong foundation based on our corporate values and our sustainability program that brings all stakeholders working together with a common purpose from our customers to our employees to our operations. Our sustainability program consistently upholds a high standard of accountability and transparency across the pillars of environmental leadership, social focus and strong governance. I want to start with an update on our environmental leadership. As you know we committed to a stringent decarbonization path in line with the 1.5-degree Celsius scenario, which has been certified by the science-based target initiative. That means reducing our carbon emissions 50% by 2025 and net zero by 2050. As you can see on the right-hand side of the slide since 2014 we have reduced our carbon emissions by 44% and we have a clear line of sight to our 2025 goal. So just to put this in perspective this is equivalent to taking 5.8 million passenger vehicles off the road for a year. In addition as advocates for the electrification of transportation, in 2021 we set a goal to electrify 100% of our light-duty vehicle fleet by 2030 further demonstrating our commitment to progress. All these efforts have resulted in the diversification of our revenue streams to cleaner solutions. Since 2014 coal generation as a percentage of revenues has decreased by 80% and now represents less than 5% of our total revenues. If you recall not long ago coal made up almost one-third of our revenues. We still have much work to do, but I am confident we are on the right track and have the right team to succeed on our goals. On the social front, our engagement with our employees, communities and customers continues to advance. As I mentioned in my opening remarks in 2021 we once again achieved top-decile employee safety performance. We also implemented employee programs to support financial, physical and mental well-being. Our diversity equity and inclusion value continues to shape our culture and inform our decision-making as we strive to unlock the power of DEI as a way to better understand our customers and the communities we serve, while also making our team stronger. In our communities, we supported more than 750 non-profit organizations through our philanthropic arm Positive Energy. We also focused our volunteer efforts on food security through virtual and in-person food donations and packaging meals for those in need. And for our customers, we are always innovating. We have been a leader in facilitating renewable energy for our residential customers, as well as providing a path for small and medium sized businesses to participate in the sustainable energy transition. And as we all know, more than ever the home is the center of our lives. So we continue to advocate for individual customers choice in the products and services that best suit their values and lifestyle, delivered with reliability and affordability. Finally, regarding our strong governance, I am particularly proud of our transparency in reporting and accountability on our goals. In just this last past year, we released our 11th annual Sustainability Report, our fifth reporting compliance with SASB standards, and 12 CDP or climate disclosure project questionnaire. We also formally issued our first TCFD or task force on climate-related financial disclosure, as a way to improve and ensure our stakeholders have the right tools to make informed decisions and track our progress. In 2021, we issued our second sustainability-linked bond. If you recall we were the first company in North America to do it back in 2020. These bonds tie our financing cost to achieving our carbon reduction goals. As you can see, our culture of sustainability is ingrained in every part of our organization and we continue to play an integral part in our transition to a consumer services company. I am looking forward to sharing more details of our ESG journey with you later this spring in our 2021 sustainability report. Now, I want to provide you an update on our growth program. As I shared with you during Investor Day, our focus over 2021 and 2022 is twofold: optimizing the core and setting the stage for growing the core. In terms of optimizing the core, we continue to remain on track to integrate Direct Energy into our business and have been successful in optimizing our generation portfolio to support our customer-facing business. We are also making solid progress on our efforts around growing the natural gas and dual-fuel customer portfolio. Let me give you a couple of specific examples for both. One, we are seeing early success in achieving our customer count by leveraging our existing and long-standing partnerships with big box retailers to sell natural gas and expand our geographic footprint. Second, we are advancing our digital experience, so customers can easily enroll in both electricity and natural gas plants. These efforts are relatively new, and I will share more details as we make progress later in the year. Now, moving on to growing the core you will remember that our plan is focused in two areas: Energy Services and Home Services. The housing picture on the left really gives you a sense of the various customer solutions that are on our growth roadmap. Some of these solutions are already operational such as power, natural gas and storage, while others such as solar and EV are in the pilot or development phase. The table on the right slide provides the status on each of these targeted customer solutions. The important key takeaway is that, we are not starting our growth program from zero. We have meaningful existing capabilities to deliver many of our targeted customer solutions and we are leveraging those capabilities as we speak. For those customer solutions that are not currently operational, we will use 2022 as a staging period for us to prudently test and learn, optimize our participation model and refine the go-to-market approach such that when we get to 2023, we will have confidence in deploying capital against that growth. Moving to Slide 9. As you can see our capital allocation track record is cycle appropriate and directly in line with our roadmap to stabilize, right-size, redefine and now enhance our company. During 2016 and 2017 our primary focus was simplifying and strengthening the balance sheet. In 2018 and 2019 with the balance sheet significantly improved, we were able to shift to returning capital to shareholders and growth. In '20 and \u201921, the Direct acquisition meant more of our capital shifted towards growth and debt reduction. Now moving to 2022. We turn our focus towards achieving our per share growth objectives and growing into our investment-grade credit metrics through the full realization of Direct Energy run rate earnings and our growth program. And like I said earlier 2022, remains a staging year for growth which provides significant excess cash to be returned through dividends and share repurchases. I will provide you an update on the remaining unallocated cash throughout the year. So, with that I will pass it over to Alberto for the financial review. \nAlberto Fornaro: Thank you, Mauricio. I will now turn to Slide 11 for a review of the full year results. We finished the year achieving our 2021 adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth targets in line with guidance realizing more than $2.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.5 billion in free cash flow before growth. Adjusted EBITDA reflects a $419 million increase compared to 2020, primarily due to the acquisition of Direct Energy in January 2021. This is despite several unexpected headwinds including the extended forced outage at Limestone Unit 1 power plant additional planned and unplanned outages in Texas and increased ancillary charges. The results include the achievement of $175 million of Direct Energy synergies in line with the most recent expectations and in excess of the initial 2021 target set at $135 million. Free cash flow before growth was $1.512 billion -- $22 million ahead of the midpoint of 2021 guidance primarily, to lower capital expenditure. Moving to the highlights. 2021 was a productive year in moving closer to the customer. We closed on the Direct Energy acquisition and successfully started the integration. Next in December we closed the sale of 4.8 gigawatts of noncore East and West fossil generation. We also reduced our debt by $755 million and further linked our financial performance to our climate goals while reducing our interest expenses through refinancing callable debt through $1.1 billion sustainability-linked bond. Moving to the update on Winter Storm Uri impact, we have significantly improved the net impact from the storm. You may recall that at the end of Q3 our expectation for the mitigants was a range of $370 million to $570 million with a net impact of approximately $500 million to $700 million. Today we are reducing this net impact to $380 million as a result of increased mitigation of $708 million as a result of the securitization as well as effective management of customer bad debt accounted by the exposure. From a GAAP income statement perspective we fully recognize these mitigants in 2021 through a reduction in cost of goods sold. The cash impact however, was different and it is highlighted on the bottom left of Slide 11. First, you may recall that the mitigated loss includes bill credits to C&I customers and other items which are going to materialize as a cash flow in 2022. At the end of December the total amount was equal to $97 million. Second the $696 million of proceeds from the securitization while fully accrued in 2021 will be received in Q2 2022. Overall the cash impact of Uri in 2021 was therefore, equal to a net outflow of $979 million offset by a cash inflow in 2022 of $599 million. Moving to the right-hand side of the slide we are maintaining our 2022 adjusted EBITDA of $1.95 billion to $2.25 billion and free cash flow before growth of $1.14 billion to $1.44 billion guidance range. As Mauricio said in his scripted remarks, we are seeing promising results in mitigating our previously discussed winter supply chain constraints and we look forward to updating next quarter following the winter season. Since the last earnings call in December we announced and immediately began executed our $1 billion share repurchase program. We executed $120 million in repurchases to date with $39 million in December and $81 million year-to-date. The remaining program will be completed through 2022. Finally, our Direct Energy integration and synergy plan remains squarely on track. I will turn now to slide 12 for a brief update on our 2021 capital allocation. Moving left to right, our realized free cash flow before growth in 2021 is $22 million above the midpoint of the guidance. Next, we are showing our actual increase in cash of $41 million instead of the $150 million previously planned. Next, during the fourth quarter we finalized the purchase price adjustment with Centrica for the Direct Energy acquisition, resulting in a $25 million increase for the prior earnings call. Next, Winter Storm Uri as mentioned before the 2021 cash out was $979 million, while we expect to receive a net amount of $599 million in 2022 as shown in the next slide. Next, we completed another $500 million of debt reduction during the quarter bringing the full year total to $755 million using a portion of the $623 million of net proceeds received from the sale of the 4.8 gigawatt of generation asset. Lastly, as we mentioned before, $48 million were utilized for share repurchases including $39 million towards the $1 billion share repurchase program. The capital available for allocation at the end of 2021 has been, therefore, fully allocated. Turning to slide 13 and again working left to the right. The combination of the midpoint of our 2022 free cash flow guidance with the net cash expected from the proceeds of the securitization will provide us almost $1.9 billion of cash to be deployed in 2022. Moving to the right, we expect to increase the minimum cash to $650 million to approximately $339 million in dividends and completed the remaining $961 million of the share repurchase. Please note that the dividend amount is based on current share outstanding and we will provide updates on future earnings calls as we progress throughout the execution of the share repurchase program. Next in other investments column, we have committed $170 million at this point, which includes $70 million for the continued integration of Direct Energy business, $50 million for small book acquisitions, $25 million to prepare the land at Encina for an eventual sale and $25 million in other smaller projects. Lastly, we expect to have $310 million of remaining capital available for our location still to be allocated in 2022. Now turning to slide 14. We finished 2021 with a net debt to EBITDA of approximately 3.2 times after adjusting for non-cash items and removing the EBITDA from the recent asset sales. Our long-term financial strategy remains unchanged and we are committed to a strong balance sheet by continuing to target investment grade credit metrics of 2.5 to 2.75, primarily through full realization of the Direct Energy run rate synergies and growth initiatives. We will continue to provide updates on our path to investment-grade metrics as we execute these initiatives. Back to you, Mauricio.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Alberto. Moving to our 2022 priorities and expectations on slide 16. First, we will always be focused on the blocking and tackling of delivering on our financial, operational and ESG commitments, while adhering to our capital allocation principles. Beyond this, we're focusing our efforts in two key areas, provide additional disclosure to help better model our business and provide greater detail around our growth strategy. First, on our disclosures. Following the Direct Energy acquisition and our move towards consumers, we're working on a comprehensive rework that will enhance your ability to model the value of the customer. In the meantime, I want to start with the new hedging methodology slide in the appendix of today's presentation, which should help shed light on our rigorous risk management and supply optimization program that helps stabilize our business. On growth, as I discussed earlier, we will be transparent in the process and I look forward to updating you on this throughout the year. Finally, while 2021 was a challenging year, today our company is stronger and more promising than ever before. I am very excited about 2022 and the significant opportunities we have to create shareholder value. So with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. Amy, we're now ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Jonathan Arnold of Vertical Research.\nJonathan Arnold: Hi, good morning guys.\nAlberto Fornaro: Hey Jonathan, good morning.\nJonathan Arnold: Mauricio, thank you for the mention on the new disclosures that you just made. I'm just curious, if you can give us some sort of gauge of when we might expect to see those? Is that kind of midyear, next quarter or later in the year just some framework there?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes. No, Jonathan. So, I hope that you find useful the new hedging disclosures. And obviously Kevin will be available if you have any questions since this is a new information. With respect to the disclosures to help better model the value of the customer, my expectation is that, it will be done sometime either later in the year or beginning of next year. We are working hard to ensure that key performance indicators are aligned with our financial disclosures and we want to make sure that they are useful as opposed to rushing and giving you something midyear that you have to reconcile before and after. So, these type of changes I appreciate, they're always better at the end of the year. So you start with fresh slate. So I would -- that's -- I would think that it would be -- we're going to try to time it, when we are ready, when we believe is -- are going to be very useful. And when we don't make you do a lot of work in reconciling before and after. So I hope that this provides you some idea when we're planning to move.\nJonathan Arnold: Yes. No very helpful. Thank you, Mauricio. And then, on the -- one thing I noticed was that you're now talking about growing into the credit metrics. I think before you'd said you anticipated being there by the end of 2023. So, is that a change or just me overreading the slide. \nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes, I mean our commitment continues to be up 2.5 to 2.75. Obviously, we need to stay flexible. As you can appreciate there is a lot of things moving around this year. I mean it's a -- it continues to be a transition year because of the growth program that we have, the optimization that we have. So, our goal is to grow into the metrics. But obviously we will -- we have to remain flexible in this environment. And just Jonathan before I forget I wanted to make sure the additional hedging disclosures are available now and they're in the appendix of the presentation okay just to make sure that that's crystal clear.\nJonathan Arnold: Actually I had seen those and I was -- maybe I'll just ask a quick one on those while I have you. You're obviously giving a look that shows that you're I guess 15% over-hedged effectively or covered. I don't know how you would best describe it in ACA. Can you give us a little bit of an insight into how does that look by season? Is that sort of skewed winter versus summer? Just anything beyond just that kind of annual look.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes Jonathan. So, obviously, we feel comfortable providing the yearly disclosures. Why don't you start getting into the seasons, it is competitive-sensitive and in conversations with our commercial team, we wanted to make sure that we just provided this level of granularity to make sure that we don't compromise our commercial activities. So, I think that the two big takeaways from my perspective on the hedging slide is number one, we're pretty well hedged against our expected load. And then number two, it is a combination of electricity that we generate plus market purchases and our commercial team is responsible for optimizing between the two. So, that to me is a big takeaway on that slide and we wanted to just show how much our market purchases versus electric generation. One thing to note is this is just the economic generation in the money hedges, so you should assume also that we have some flex capacity that is out of the money both on the generation that we own and some of the tools and options that we buy from the market. So, just keep that in mind. \nJonathan Arnold: Great. Thank you very much for all the time guys.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Jon.\nOperator: Your next question is from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. \nMichael Lapides: Hey guys. Thank you for taking my question. If I look at, Mauricio, over the years when you've done M&A, often we get a year removed from the M&A, sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less and you guys start talking about upside to the synergy savings. How do you think now that we're a little more than a year removed from the Direct Energy acquisition and I know it's been a crazy year with Uri and everything else. Whether -- how do you assess whether there's potential upside either on broader cost management or cost management and synergy savings related to Direct?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes Michael. Good morning. So, obviously, the integration of Direct Energy was a three-year integration if you remember, Michael. And I am just very pleased with the performance of the team and achieving the synergies. We actually increase the synergies that we achieved in our first year. As we enter into the second year, I will tell you this I am incredibly comfortable that we're going to achieve them. But being mindful that this was a three-year program and we're literally just entering the second year. I will assess the potential of additional synergies. And I think what you should expect is throughout the year we will give you an update on our performance there. But I feel -- I remain very confident that we're going to achieve our numbers. And we'll give you an update if -- throughout the year we decide to update on that.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. And then one quick follow-up. If I just look at the balance sheet and this is going to get a little wonky, but like current assets is significantly higher than -- meaning if I look at things like accounts receivable and accounts payable, the spread between accounts receivable and accounts payable is about $1 billion a positive meaning AR is greater than AP and the current asset for derivative is significantly greater than the current liability. Those would imply that there's significant working capital cash inflows coming. But when I look at your free cash flow guidance, I don't think that's embedded. Am I just misreading that, or are there other things that significantly offset those items?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Okay. Michael, I will turn that over to Alberto. And obviously, as you said, I mean I think this was a little technical and we can always follow up with you. But I mean Alberto is there something that you want to add here.\nAlberto Fornaro: I just want to point you to a couple of things Michael. First of all, the derivative is obviously -- on the derivative value is a combination of the addition of the gas business and the increase in the gas price. So that has in this case, particularly on the asset side increase the value of that. Regarding the comment on current assets, please consider that we have also the included in the current asset that is the proceeds from the securitization and so on. But having said that, obviously we have acquired another business and it has an increase -- has increased our needs in terms of working capital. We have put that under focus and rest assured that there are initiatives to keep that under control that will be taken. So overall, we are very confident about the projection that we have for it.\nMauricio Gutierrez: And Michael, just to remind you, working capital was an area of focus during the transformation and we were very successful on that. We kind of have the road map on how to optimize our working capital and we're going to -- we are applying although those lessons learned through the integration of Direct Energy.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you guys. Much appreciated.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Michael.\nOperator: Your next question is from Paul Zimbardo, Bank of America.\nPaul Zimbardo: Hi, good morning.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Hey, good morning, Paul.\nPaul Zimbardo: I wanted to check in on kind of your achievement on the customer growth strategy and just any insights you can share on customer counts given some of the commodity volatility and if you're seeing any change in attrition recently?\nMauricio Gutierrez: I mean I'll pass it over to Elizabeth for the attrition, but I would say it's remained pretty constant. And I think that's what we experienced during the last year, our retention numbers were really good. So Elizabeth, do you want to provide a little color here?\nElizabeth Killinger: Yeah. Thanks for the question. We definitely achieved our customer count commitment for the year than what we had planned to achieve. We actually beat it by a bit. But as Mauricio mentioned, retention was extremely strong, really one of our best years ever. And that is a product of some of the efforts over the last kind of five years of increasing the tools and techniques we use, leveraging the data that we have to make sure we're putting the right renewal offers in front of customers that will entice them to stay with us. We did have some opportunity to recover in our sales channels as well with COVID, our face-to-face channels were set back quite a bit. And so we saw some improvements there. And then finally, on the DE integration front, we met or beat our expectations for retaining those customers. As you all know and have seen from us over the years as we acquire customers whether it's through M&A or small books, you do see some attrition in the year or two following that. And as long as we keep meeting or beating what we expect from that, we're going to be really pleased. But I'm super proud of the work the team has done from the frontline folks either face-to-face or in our call centers and the digital teams for all that they've done and I'm excited about the potential for 2022 and beyond. \nPaul Zimbardo: Okay. That's great to hear. And then a separate unrelated question. I know you all have been very proactive with some of the strategic asset sales as you repositioned the business. Do you see more opportunities to continue that trend and become more capital-light particularly on Texas on that theme?\nMauricio Gutierrez : Yes. I mean, as you know, we completed a pretty large divestiture in 2021 and the optimization of the portfolio is it's a focus of ours. As you remember on the Investor Day presentation, I said that in the growing the core is one of our key strategic priorities. That's going to continue. The North Star of that is we're going to have assets that better help us serve our customers. So whatever those are, they are core. And if not they're not core and we're going to look to optimize. Now with respect to Texas, obviously, we have our capital-light renewable PPA strategy that has been very successful close to 2.60 gigawatts. And we're going to continue to focus on that. We're constantly in the market. We're running RFPs basically on a continuous basis. We're going to be very selective on that. And it already has yielded tremendous value for us. And that's going to continue to be a focus now. As Texas is changing some of the market design changes to incentivize dispatchable generation, we are definitely looking into that. We have lots of sites that we can evaluate opportunities. And as we have done in the East, I mean, we're going to do it in Texas if we find the right partner, we're going to do it. But we're going to do it in a way that is a good use of our capital. So I expect that to continue. I know the teams are completely focused in evaluating additional opportunities that we have to bring additional supply to serve our customers. \nPaul Zimbardo: Great. Thank you very much.\nMauricio Gutierrez : Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Angie Storozynski of Seaport Global. \nAngie Storozynski: Thank you. So given what's happening in Europe and your disclosures on gas hedges, is it fair to say that even though there's this wide expansion of the positive gas bases in New England that should not have any negative impact on your gas retail margins in 2022?\nMauricio Gutierrez: That's correct Angie. So\u2026\nAngie Storozynski: Okay.\nMauricio Gutierrez: That's correct Angie. And just to, perhaps put a little finer point on our natural gas business. You need to think about it as a logistics business, okay? We serve -- first of all, we don't take any commodity price risk like, NYMEX Henry Hub. Most of the risk that we have is around basis. And then within basis, as we're serving customers, we have access to a tremendous network of logistics pipeline capacity, LDC relationships. So, that network allows us to manage and optimize our basis risk. So based on the disclosures that we provided we feel very comfortable. Obviously, there is always risk to be managed. But I feel very comfortable where I sit today on that. Chris Moser, I don't know if there is anything that you want to add?\nChris Moser: No. I think you hit the high points. Thanks, Mauricio.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And then\u2026\nMauricio Gutierrez: Great.\nAngie Storozynski: \u2026secondly, I know you're going to be providing an update on your guidance, I think on the first quarter call. But just looking at the drivers that you showed us on the fourth quarter call, I mean, it seems like any issues with coal and trona supplies have sort of subsided. Then, power prices in Texas this winter has been really weak. So the outage at your coal plant shouldn't be very painful from an EBITDA perspective. I'm kind of struggling to see what are the offsets to those mitigating factors to the negatives that you showed us on the year-over-year change between 2021 and 2022 EBITDA?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes Angie. So if you remember, we provided you, I think we call it, transitory items on all three, I think they're very constructive and positive signs that we're going to mitigate them. Obviously, we're just in February. So I want to wait for the first quarter call. But Alberto, can you just provide a little bit more specificity on where we are on all these the three items that we highlighted on the last earnings?\nAlberto Fornaro: Absolutely. First of all, we can confirm that, with regards to Limestone we still expect that Unit 1 will be back running in mid-April and the amount of the impact that we have quantified being $50 million during our third quarter call is basically confirmed. Let me just also remind you that, we have not included in 2022 any reimbursement from insurance coming both for property damages and business interruption, first of all, because it is difficult to quantify, and normally it's a long process to get there. But second, because we expect it to happen in 2023. We are working on it. But again, as I said, it's a long process. Second, regarding the coal supply chain, we quantified it in $100 million of which $60 million taxes and $40 million in the East as Mauricio has said, so far, we have been able to make some progress against [Indiscernible]. We confirm at this moment the same number and we will update you in Q3. And regarding the Texas ancillary services which was an impact of $70 million. We confirm the numbers and the actions that we have taken which is basically we pass through the increases in price with the exception to all the customer with the exception where we have a fixed rate contract and this will naturally happen when this contract will be renewed.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Right. And just to, I guess put a little finer point on the ancillary services as the customers that are reopening contracts will be able to pass through these ancillary services. I think of it as a change in law if you remember Angie. So, I think there is an opportunity for those customers that we couldn't pass it through we will in the reopening. And then, I am just incredibly pleased with the commercial team and how they've been managing the supply chain constraints around coal. We're still in the middle of the winter, but so far they've done a fantastic job and we will have an opportunity to provide you additional visibility and quantify that in the next earnings call.\nAngie Storozynski: Good. Thank you.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Great. Thank you, Angie.\nMauricio Gutierrez: So with that, I want to thank you all for your interest and look forward to updating you on our exciting growth plan and other priorities throughout the year. Thank you and stay safe.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mauricio Gutierrez",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm joined this morning by Alberto Fornaro, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Home Retail; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations. This is my 25th earnings call as CEO and I wanted to start with a quick look back on what we have achieved. Over the past six years, we have transformed our company from a complex industrial story into one that is much simpler and focused on our core strengths. Along the way, we have made significant progress in our strategy to get closer to the customer, optimize our generation portfolio to serve those customers, strengthen the financial health of our company and created significant shareholder value. We now turn to the next phase in our evolution of growing our business and realizing the potential around the customer. I am excited about the future and look forward to sharing our progress with all of you in the months to come. Moving on to the three key messages of today's presentation on slide four. Our business delivered results in line with the 2021 guidance, effectively navigating supply chain constraints and volatile market conditions, further validating the strength and durability of our model. Next, I am pleased to report that we have successfully executed our winter storm Uri mitigation plan and we are increasing 2022 capital available for allocation. Finally, we continue to advance our five-year strategic road map in moving closer to the customer and our commitment to being excellent stewards of shareholder capital. The 2021 financial and operational results are on slide five. Beginning with our scorecard. We executed on all our priorities. I want to thank all the employees at NRG for maintaining focus during a challenging year, which included a global pandemic, Winter Storm Uri, asset sales and the integration of Direct Energy. Importantly, we were able to operate through these conditions while setting another record for safety. This is the fourth straight year we have set a new company safety record, an incredible accomplishment worthy of recognition. Direct Energy integration remains ongoing and we are on track to achieve our run rate synergies. During the year, we outperformed our initial expectations achieving $175 million versus our original expectation of $135 million. This integration is led by the same team and supported by the same governance of the transformation plan, which gives me the utmost confidence in our ability to reach if not exceed our run rate targets. Following multiple years of rightsizing our business, 2021 marked a significant milestone in capitalizing our best-in-class consumer services platform. We added roughly 3 million customers to our portfolio and expanded the scale and scope of home power and natural gas services. Also during the year, we monetized 4.8 gigawatts of non-core fossil assets in our East and West regions. And now the retirement of 1.6 gigawatts of coal assets in the East and signed an additional 800 megawatts of renewables PPAs. Next, we continue to adhere to our disciplined capital allocation principles. In late 2021, we announced a $1 billion share repurchase program to be completed throughout 2022. We also increased our dividend per share 8% in line with our stated dividend growth rate of 7% to 9%. In June, we held our Investor Day where we revealed our five-year strategic road map to create significant stakeholder value by moving closer to the customer, while also returning significant capital to our shareholders. Moving to the right-hand side of the slide for the financial results. We delivered $433 million of adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter, 31% higher than the prior year. This brings our full year results to $2.42 billion of adjusted EBITDA, 21% higher than the prior year primarily driven by the acquisition of Direct Energy and excluding the impact from Winter Storm Uri. Finally, we are maintaining our 2022 adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth guidance ranges. We are seeing promising results in mitigating winter supply chain constraints, and I look forward to updating you next quarter. As a result of our Winter Storm Uri mitigation plan, we are increasing our 2022 capital available for allocation by $212 million, which Alberto will discuss in more detail. Now turning to slide 6 for a brief update on the ERCOT market. Following Winter Storm Uri, it was clear that market reforms from well-head to light bulb were necessary to improve grid resilience. In the months following the event, we actively engaged in discussions with legislators, regulators and other market participants to introduce comprehensive and competitive solutions across the entire system to address areas that fail. In 2021, Texas made significant progress in hardening the electric grid through power plant and transmission weatherization standards, improved market design with changes in scarcity pricing, ancillary reforms and consumer protection improvements. In 2022, we expect Texas to expand its focus on hardening the natural gas infrastructure and implementation of phase 2 of power reforms which includes resource adequacy by establishing a load-side reserve requirement and on-site fuel security. I want to comment that Texas governor's office, legislature, PUCT and ERCOT for taking swift action and accelerating effective reforms that would normally take years and addressing them within months. While our work is not done yet, we believe Texas performance through a tough winter is a strong reflection of effective actions and policies. Moving to the right-hand side of the slide for an update on the financial impact from Winter Storm Uri. I am pleased to announce that we have successfully executed our mitigation strategy. Today, we're updating the net financial impact from the storm to $380 million from our prior expected range of $500 million to $700 million. Now turning to Slide 7. It is important that we recognize our ESG principles and highlight a few of our 2021 accomplishments. We created a sustainable framework with a strong foundation based on our corporate values and our sustainability program that brings all stakeholders working together with a common purpose from our customers to our employees to our operations. Our sustainability program consistently upholds a high standard of accountability and transparency across the pillars of environmental leadership, social focus and strong governance. I want to start with an update on our environmental leadership. As you know we committed to a stringent decarbonization path in line with the 1.5-degree Celsius scenario, which has been certified by the science-based target initiative. That means reducing our carbon emissions 50% by 2025 and net zero by 2050. As you can see on the right-hand side of the slide since 2014 we have reduced our carbon emissions by 44% and we have a clear line of sight to our 2025 goal. So just to put this in perspective this is equivalent to taking 5.8 million passenger vehicles off the road for a year. In addition as advocates for the electrification of transportation, in 2021 we set a goal to electrify 100% of our light-duty vehicle fleet by 2030 further demonstrating our commitment to progress. All these efforts have resulted in the diversification of our revenue streams to cleaner solutions. Since 2014 coal generation as a percentage of revenues has decreased by 80% and now represents less than 5% of our total revenues. If you recall not long ago coal made up almost one-third of our revenues. We still have much work to do, but I am confident we are on the right track and have the right team to succeed on our goals. On the social front, our engagement with our employees, communities and customers continues to advance. As I mentioned in my opening remarks in 2021 we once again achieved top-decile employee safety performance. We also implemented employee programs to support financial, physical and mental well-being. Our diversity equity and inclusion value continues to shape our culture and inform our decision-making as we strive to unlock the power of DEI as a way to better understand our customers and the communities we serve, while also making our team stronger. In our communities, we supported more than 750 non-profit organizations through our philanthropic arm Positive Energy. We also focused our volunteer efforts on food security through virtual and in-person food donations and packaging meals for those in need. And for our customers, we are always innovating. We have been a leader in facilitating renewable energy for our residential customers, as well as providing a path for small and medium sized businesses to participate in the sustainable energy transition. And as we all know, more than ever the home is the center of our lives. So we continue to advocate for individual customers choice in the products and services that best suit their values and lifestyle, delivered with reliability and affordability. Finally, regarding our strong governance, I am particularly proud of our transparency in reporting and accountability on our goals. In just this last past year, we released our 11th annual Sustainability Report, our fifth reporting compliance with SASB standards, and 12 CDP or climate disclosure project questionnaire. We also formally issued our first TCFD or task force on climate-related financial disclosure, as a way to improve and ensure our stakeholders have the right tools to make informed decisions and track our progress. In 2021, we issued our second sustainability-linked bond. If you recall we were the first company in North America to do it back in 2020. These bonds tie our financing cost to achieving our carbon reduction goals. As you can see, our culture of sustainability is ingrained in every part of our organization and we continue to play an integral part in our transition to a consumer services company. I am looking forward to sharing more details of our ESG journey with you later this spring in our 2021 sustainability report. Now, I want to provide you an update on our growth program. As I shared with you during Investor Day, our focus over 2021 and 2022 is twofold: optimizing the core and setting the stage for growing the core. In terms of optimizing the core, we continue to remain on track to integrate Direct Energy into our business and have been successful in optimizing our generation portfolio to support our customer-facing business. We are also making solid progress on our efforts around growing the natural gas and dual-fuel customer portfolio. Let me give you a couple of specific examples for both. One, we are seeing early success in achieving our customer count by leveraging our existing and long-standing partnerships with big box retailers to sell natural gas and expand our geographic footprint. Second, we are advancing our digital experience, so customers can easily enroll in both electricity and natural gas plants. These efforts are relatively new, and I will share more details as we make progress later in the year. Now, moving on to growing the core you will remember that our plan is focused in two areas: Energy Services and Home Services. The housing picture on the left really gives you a sense of the various customer solutions that are on our growth roadmap. Some of these solutions are already operational such as power, natural gas and storage, while others such as solar and EV are in the pilot or development phase. The table on the right slide provides the status on each of these targeted customer solutions. The important key takeaway is that, we are not starting our growth program from zero. We have meaningful existing capabilities to deliver many of our targeted customer solutions and we are leveraging those capabilities as we speak. For those customer solutions that are not currently operational, we will use 2022 as a staging period for us to prudently test and learn, optimize our participation model and refine the go-to-market approach such that when we get to 2023, we will have confidence in deploying capital against that growth. Moving to Slide 9. As you can see our capital allocation track record is cycle appropriate and directly in line with our roadmap to stabilize, right-size, redefine and now enhance our company. During 2016 and 2017 our primary focus was simplifying and strengthening the balance sheet. In 2018 and 2019 with the balance sheet significantly improved, we were able to shift to returning capital to shareholders and growth. In '20 and '21, the Direct acquisition meant more of our capital shifted towards growth and debt reduction. Now moving to 2022. We turn our focus towards achieving our per share growth objectives and growing into our investment-grade credit metrics through the full realization of Direct Energy run rate earnings and our growth program. And like I said earlier 2022, remains a staging year for growth which provides significant excess cash to be returned through dividends and share repurchases. I will provide you an update on the remaining unallocated cash throughout the year. So, with that I will pass it over to Alberto for the financial review. Thank you, Alberto. Moving to our 2022 priorities and expectations on slide 16. First, we will always be focused on the blocking and tackling of delivering on our financial, operational and ESG commitments, while adhering to our capital allocation principles. Beyond this, we're focusing our efforts in two key areas, provide additional disclosure to help better model our business and provide greater detail around our growth strategy. First, on our disclosures. Following the Direct Energy acquisition and our move towards consumers, we're working on a comprehensive rework that will enhance your ability to model the value of the customer. In the meantime, I want to start with the new hedging methodology slide in the appendix of today's presentation, which should help shed light on our rigorous risk management and supply optimization program that helps stabilize our business. On growth, as I discussed earlier, we will be transparent in the process and I look forward to updating you on this throughout the year. Finally, while 2021 was a challenging year, today our company is stronger and more promising than ever before. I am very excited about 2022 and the significant opportunities we have to create shareholder value. So with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. Amy, we're now ready to open the line for questions. Yes. No, Jonathan. So, I hope that you find useful the new hedging disclosures. And obviously Kevin will be available if you have any questions since this is a new information. With respect to the disclosures to help better model the value of the customer, my expectation is that, it will be done sometime either later in the year or beginning of next year. We are working hard to ensure that key performance indicators are aligned with our financial disclosures and we want to make sure that they are useful as opposed to rushing and giving you something midyear that you have to reconcile before and after. So, these type of changes I appreciate, they're always better at the end of the year. So you start with fresh slate. So I would -- that's -- I would think that it would be -- we're going to try to time it, when we are ready, when we believe is -- are going to be very useful. And when we don't make you do a lot of work in reconciling before and after. So I hope that this provides you some idea when we're planning to move. Yes, I mean our commitment continues to be up 2.5 to 2.75. Obviously, we need to stay flexible. As you can appreciate there is a lot of things moving around this year. I mean it's a -- it continues to be a transition year because of the growth program that we have, the optimization that we have. So, our goal is to grow into the metrics. But obviously we will -- we have to remain flexible in this environment. And just Jonathan before I forget I wanted to make sure the additional hedging disclosures are available now and they're in the appendix of the presentation okay just to make sure that that's crystal clear. Yes Jonathan. So, obviously, we feel comfortable providing the yearly disclosures. Why don't you start getting into the seasons, it is competitive-sensitive and in conversations with our commercial team, we wanted to make sure that we just provided this level of granularity to make sure that we don't compromise our commercial activities. So, I think that the two big takeaways from my perspective on the hedging slide is number one, we're pretty well hedged against our expected load. And then number two, it is a combination of electricity that we generate plus market purchases and our commercial team is responsible for optimizing between the two. So, that to me is a big takeaway on that slide and we wanted to just show how much our market purchases versus electric generation. One thing to note is this is just the economic generation in the money hedges, so you should assume also that we have some flex capacity that is out of the money both on the generation that we own and some of the tools and options that we buy from the market. So, just keep that in mind. Thank you, Jon. Yes Michael. Good morning. So, obviously, the integration of Direct Energy was a three-year integration if you remember, Michael. And I am just very pleased with the performance of the team and achieving the synergies. We actually increase the synergies that we achieved in our first year. As we enter into the second year, I will tell you this I am incredibly comfortable that we're going to achieve them. But being mindful that this was a three-year program and we're literally just entering the second year. I will assess the potential of additional synergies. And I think what you should expect is throughout the year we will give you an update on our performance there. But I feel -- I remain very confident that we're going to achieve our numbers. And we'll give you an update if -- throughout the year we decide to update on that. Okay. Michael, I will turn that over to Alberto. And obviously, as you said, I mean I think this was a little technical and we can always follow up with you. But I mean Alberto is there something that you want to add here. And Michael, just to remind you, working capital was an area of focus during the transformation and we were very successful on that. We kind of have the road map on how to optimize our working capital and we're going to -- we are applying although those lessons learned through the integration of Direct Energy. Thank you, Michael. Hey, good morning, Paul. I mean I'll pass it over to Elizabeth for the attrition, but I would say it's remained pretty constant. And I think that's what we experienced during the last year, our retention numbers were really good. So Elizabeth, do you want to provide a little color here? Yes. I mean, as you know, we completed a pretty large divestiture in 2021 and the optimization of the portfolio is it's a focus of ours. As you remember on the Investor Day presentation, I said that in the growing the core is one of our key strategic priorities. That's going to continue. The North Star of that is we're going to have assets that better help us serve our customers. So whatever those are, they are core. And if not they're not core and we're going to look to optimize. Now with respect to Texas, obviously, we have our capital-light renewable PPA strategy that has been very successful close to 2.60 gigawatts. And we're going to continue to focus on that. We're constantly in the market. We're running RFPs basically on a continuous basis. We're going to be very selective on that. And it already has yielded tremendous value for us. And that's going to continue to be a focus now. As Texas is changing some of the market design changes to incentivize dispatchable generation, we are definitely looking into that. We have lots of sites that we can evaluate opportunities. And as we have done in the East, I mean, we're going to do it in Texas if we find the right partner, we're going to do it. But we're going to do it in a way that is a good use of our capital. So I expect that to continue. I know the teams are completely focused in evaluating additional opportunities that we have to bring additional supply to serve our customers. Great. Thank you. That's correct Angie. So... That's correct Angie. And just to, perhaps put a little finer point on our natural gas business. You need to think about it as a logistics business, okay? We serve -- first of all, we don't take any commodity price risk like, NYMEX Henry Hub. Most of the risk that we have is around basis. And then within basis, as we're serving customers, we have access to a tremendous network of logistics pipeline capacity, LDC relationships. So, that network allows us to manage and optimize our basis risk. So based on the disclosures that we provided we feel very comfortable. Obviously, there is always risk to be managed. But I feel very comfortable where I sit today on that. Chris Moser, I don't know if there is anything that you want to add? Great. Yes Angie. So if you remember, we provided you, I think we call it, transitory items on all three, I think they're very constructive and positive signs that we're going to mitigate them. Obviously, we're just in February. So I want to wait for the first quarter call. But Alberto, can you just provide a little bit more specificity on where we are on all these the three items that we highlighted on the last earnings? Right. And just to, I guess put a little finer point on the ancillary services as the customers that are reopening contracts will be able to pass through these ancillary services. I think of it as a change in law if you remember Angie. So, I think there is an opportunity for those customers that we couldn't pass it through we will in the reopening. And then, I am just incredibly pleased with the commercial team and how they've been managing the supply chain constraints around coal. We're still in the middle of the winter, but so far they've done a fantastic job and we will have an opportunity to provide you additional visibility and quantify that in the next earnings call. Great. Thank you, Angie. So with that, I want to thank you all for your interest and look forward to updating you on our exciting growth plan and other priorities throughout the year. Thank you and stay safe."

            "content": "Yeah. Thanks for the question. We definitely achieved our customer count commitment for the year than what we had planned to achieve. We actually beat it by a bit. But as Mauricio mentioned, retention was extremely strong, really one of our best years ever. And that is a product of some of the efforts over the last kind of five years of increasing the tools and techniques we use, leveraging the data that we have to make sure we're putting the right renewal offers in front of customers that will entice them to stay with us. We did have some opportunity to recover in our sales channels as well with COVID, our face-to-face channels were set back quite a bit. And so we saw some improvements there. And then finally, on the DE integration front, we met or beat our expectations for retaining those customers. As you all know and have seen from us over the years as we acquire customers whether it's through M&A or small books, you do see some attrition in the year or two following that. And as long as we keep meeting or beating what we expect from that, we're going to be really pleased. But I'm super proud of the work the team has done from the frontline folks either face-to-face or in our call centers and the digital teams for all that they've done and I'm excited about the potential for 2022 and beyond."

            "name": "Alberto Fornaro",
            "content": "Thank you, Mauricio. I will now turn to Slide 11 for a review of the full year results. We finished the year achieving our 2021 adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth targets in line with guidance realizing more than $2.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.5 billion in free cash flow before growth. Adjusted EBITDA reflects a $419 million increase compared to 2020, primarily due to the acquisition of Direct Energy in January 2021. This is despite several unexpected headwinds including the extended forced outage at Limestone Unit 1 power plant additional planned and unplanned outages in Texas and increased ancillary charges. The results include the achievement of $175 million of Direct Energy synergies in line with the most recent expectations and in excess of the initial 2021 target set at $135 million. Free cash flow before growth was $1.512 billion -- $22 million ahead of the midpoint of 2021 guidance primarily, to lower capital expenditure. Moving to the highlights. 2021 was a productive year in moving closer to the customer. We closed on the Direct Energy acquisition and successfully started the integration. Next in December we closed the sale of 4.8 gigawatts of noncore East and West fossil generation. We also reduced our debt by $755 million and further linked our financial performance to our climate goals while reducing our interest expenses through refinancing callable debt through $1.1 billion sustainability-linked bond. Moving to the update on Winter Storm Uri impact, we have significantly improved the net impact from the storm. You may recall that at the end of Q3 our expectation for the mitigants was a range of $370 million to $570 million with a net impact of approximately $500 million to $700 million. Today we are reducing this net impact to $380 million as a result of increased mitigation of $708 million as a result of the securitization as well as effective management of customer bad debt accounted by the exposure. From a GAAP income statement perspective we fully recognize these mitigants in 2021 through a reduction in cost of goods sold. The cash impact however, was different and it is highlighted on the bottom left of Slide 11. First, you may recall that the mitigated loss includes bill credits to C&I customers and other items which are going to materialize as a cash flow in 2022. At the end of December the total amount was equal to $97 million. Second the $696 million of proceeds from the securitization while fully accrued in 2021 will be received in Q2 2022. Overall the cash impact of Uri in 2021 was therefore, equal to a net outflow of $979 million offset by a cash inflow in 2022 of $599 million. Moving to the right-hand side of the slide we are maintaining our 2022 adjusted EBITDA of $1.95 billion to $2.25 billion and free cash flow before growth of $1.14 billion to $1.44 billion guidance range. As Mauricio said in his scripted remarks, we are seeing promising results in mitigating our previously discussed winter supply chain constraints and we look forward to updating next quarter following the winter season. Since the last earnings call in December we announced and immediately began executed our $1 billion share repurchase program. We executed $120 million in repurchases to date with $39 million in December and $81 million year-to-date. The remaining program will be completed through 2022. Finally, our Direct Energy integration and synergy plan remains squarely on track. I will turn now to slide 12 for a brief update on our 2021 capital allocation. Moving left to right, our realized free cash flow before growth in 2021 is $22 million above the midpoint of the guidance. Next, we are showing our actual increase in cash of $41 million instead of the $150 million previously planned. Next, during the fourth quarter we finalized the purchase price adjustment with Centrica for the Direct Energy acquisition, resulting in a $25 million increase for the prior earnings call. Next, Winter Storm Uri as mentioned before the 2021 cash out was $979 million, while we expect to receive a net amount of $599 million in 2022 as shown in the next slide. Next, we completed another $500 million of debt reduction during the quarter bringing the full year total to $755 million using a portion of the $623 million of net proceeds received from the sale of the 4.8 gigawatt of generation asset. Lastly, as we mentioned before, $48 million were utilized for share repurchases including $39 million towards the $1 billion share repurchase program. The capital available for allocation at the end of 2021 has been, therefore, fully allocated. Turning to slide 13 and again working left to the right. The combination of the midpoint of our 2022 free cash flow guidance with the net cash expected from the proceeds of the securitization will provide us almost $1.9 billion of cash to be deployed in 2022. Moving to the right, we expect to increase the minimum cash to $650 million to approximately $339 million in dividends and completed the remaining $961 million of the share repurchase. Please note that the dividend amount is based on current share outstanding and we will provide updates on future earnings calls as we progress throughout the execution of the share repurchase program. Next in other investments column, we have committed $170 million at this point, which includes $70 million for the continued integration of Direct Energy business, $50 million for small book acquisitions, $25 million to prepare the land at Encina for an eventual sale and $25 million in other smaller projects. Lastly, we expect to have $310 million of remaining capital available for our location still to be allocated in 2022. Now turning to slide 14. We finished 2021 with a net debt to EBITDA of approximately 3.2 times after adjusting for non-cash items and removing the EBITDA from the recent asset sales. Our long-term financial strategy remains unchanged and we are committed to a strong balance sheet by continuing to target investment grade credit metrics of 2.5 to 2.75, primarily through full realization of the Direct Energy run rate synergies and growth initiatives. We will continue to provide updates on our path to investment-grade metrics as we execute these initiatives. Back to you, Mauricio. Hey Jonathan, good morning. I just want to point you to a couple of things Michael. First of all, the derivative is obviously -- on the derivative value is a combination of the addition of the gas business and the increase in the gas price. So that has in this case, particularly on the asset side increase the value of that. Regarding the comment on current assets, please consider that we have also the included in the current asset that is the proceeds from the securitization and so on. But having said that, obviously we have acquired another business and it has an increase -- has increased our needs in terms of working capital. We have put that under focus and rest assured that there are initiatives to keep that under control that will be taken. So overall, we are very confident about the projection that we have for it. Absolutely. First of all, we can confirm that, with regards to Limestone we still expect that Unit 1 will be back running in mid-April and the amount of the impact that we have quantified being $50 million during our third quarter call is basically confirmed. Let me just also remind you that, we have not included in 2022 any reimbursement from insurance coming both for property damages and business interruption, first of all, because it is difficult to quantify, and normally it's a long process to get there. But second, because we expect it to happen in 2023. We are working on it. But again, as I said, it's a long process. Second, regarding the coal supply chain, we quantified it in $100 million of which $60 million taxes and $40 million in the East as Mauricio has said, so far, we have been able to make some progress against [Indiscernible]. We confirm at this moment the same number and we will update you in Q3. And regarding the Texas ancillary services which was an impact of $70 million. We confirm the numbers and the actions that we have taken which is basically we pass through the increases in price with the exception to all the customer with the exception where we have a fixed rate contract and this will naturally happen when this contract will be renewed."

There will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations, to read the Safe Harbor and introduce the call.\nKevin Cole: Thank you, Benjamin. Good morning, and welcome to NRG Energy\u2019s third quarter 2021 earnings call.

And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's President and CEO.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm joined this morning by Alberto Fornaro, Chief Financial Officer, also on the call and available for questions; we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Home Retail; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations. I'd like to start on Slide 4 of today's presentation. Our consumer services platform performed well through this summer and delivered stable results. We are narrowing our 2021 financial guidance at the low end of the range and initiating 2022 financial guidance. Our platform is navigating the unprecedented supply chain constraints, and we are actively working to mitigate the financial impact. Finally, we continue to make progress on our five-year growth plan. In the near-term, we are focused on the Direct Energy integration, organic growth in power and gas, and expanding our customer base with dual product options. Moving to the financial and operational results for the third quarter on Slide 5. Beginning on the left-hand side of this slide, I want to start with safety. We delivered another quarter of top decile safety performance. This marks 10 straight quarters at this level of performance, a testament towards our strong safety culture. As we continue our return to the office, the safety and well-being of our employees remains our top priority. During the third quarter, we delivered $767 million of adjusted EBITDA, which brings our year-to-date results to $1.99 billion, or 19% higher than the previous year, driven primarily by the acquisition of Direct Energy. We are, however, narrowing our 2021 guidance to the lower half of the range, primarily as a result of unanticipated supply chain constraints impacting fourth quarter results. This will also impact 2022 guidance, which I will address shortly. During the quarter, we made good progress on our key strategic initiatives. First, Direct Energy integration is well ahead of pace, achieving a $144 million year-to-date, or 107% of the original full-year plan. We are increasing our 2021 target to $175 million, which reflects the early realization of synergy targets in 2021. We are maintaining the full plan target of $300 million run rate in 2023. Next, in ERCOT, the PUCT continues to advance necessary actions to improve market reliability. In October, the PUCT implemented phase 1 of the winter weatherization standards, which will be in effect for these upcoming winter. This weatherization standard adopts best practices and addresses weather-related issues that are current during yearly. We are making the necessary investments in our fleet to be in compliance and ready for winter operations. On market design, the PUCT remains focused on our comprehensive solution to improve reliability and incentivize dispatchable resources. At NRG, we support this direction and have taken a leading role in offering ideas for the PUCT's consideration. We have proposed a comprehensive solution to prioritize reliability and achieve it through competitive solutions. The PUCT also approved the final orders for securitization to ensure a healthy and competitive market. I want to commend and thank the governor, legislature, and PUCT for tirelessly working to address the issues Uri exposed and to harden the ERCOT system and protecting the integrity of the competitive markets that have benefited consumers over the years. Now, turning to Home Retail. We continue to advance our best-in-class customer experience during the quarter. Our Reliant brand was recognized with two awards during the quarter. The North American Customer Centricity Award in the Crisis Management category, and the 2021 Innovation Leader Impact Award for the Make It Solar offering, which is our renewable energy initiative that allows customers to support solar energy without installing panels. Now, moving to the right-hand side of this slide to discuss 2022. First, as we detailed during our June Investor Day, 2022 is a staging year for high-grading our business and achieving our five-year 15% to 20% free cash flow per share growth plan. In 2022, we remain focused on integrating Direct Energy and achieving the plants high-quality synergies, removing or streamlining our East generation business that continues to weigh on our valuation, given earnings and terminal value concerns that otherwise would have masked our retail growth, deploying smaller amounts of capital to prepare the platform for growth and returning a significant amount of capital to shareholders. With that, we're introducing 2022 financial guidance of $1.95 billion to $2.25 billion of adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth of $1.14 to $1.44 billion. This guidance reflects our plan to fully realize our planned synergies and to streamline our East generation business. Also impacting this guidance are temporary impacts from unforeseen supply chain constraints, ancillary services charges in ERCOT, and our previously announced Limestone Unit 1 outage through April 2022. But leave no doubt. Now that we have identified these near-term headwinds, we are focused on mitigating these impacts into 2022. Finally, we are also announcing an 8% increase in our 2022 dividend in line with our stated dividend growth rate of 7% to 9%. Now, let me turn the call over to Alberto for a more detailed financial review. And after, I will discuss how we are advancing our Consumer Services five-year roadmap. Alberto?\nAlberto Fornaro: Thank you, Mauricio. Moving to the quarterly results, I will now turn to Slide 7 for a brief review of our financials. For the quarter, NRG delivered $767 million in adjusted EBITDA, or $15 million higher than the third quarter of last year. The increase in consolidated earnings was driven by the acquisition of Direct Energy and related additional synergies achieved in Q3, partially offset by the impact of the outage at Tower Limestone Unit 1 facility and other headwinds related to the onset of supply Country constraints. Specifically by region, the East benefited by $89 million, driven by the expected contribution from the Direct Energy acquisition and some incremental synergies and cost savings. This benefit was partially offset by reduced volume in our sale of power, as well as lower profitability through our PJM coal fleet due to supply chain constraints for chemical necessary to ran the environmental controls. Next, our Texas region decreased by $68 million due to the higher supplier cost to serve our retail load. With the outage of Limestone Unit 1, we had to purchase higher priced supply to supplement this lost generation. This increase in supply cost was partially offset by the contribution from the Direct Energy acquisition. As a reminder, we benefited last year from exceptionally low market power prices realized during the COVID-driven economic shutdown, and a favorable mix in usage between home and business customers. The free cash flow before growth in the quarter was $395 million, a reduction of $230 million year-over-year, driven primarily by two factors, a $75 million increase in cash interest due to the $3 billion in Direct Energy financing in late 2020 and second is the movement in inventory. During Q3, 2020, we reduced inventory by $60 million, driven by seasonal trends and coal utilization. While during Q3, 2021, we built up inventories by $75 million, mostly for the seasonal needs of the gas business. This overall resulted in $135 million negative cash flow [Indiscernible]. On a year-to-date basis, our progress in terms of incremental profitability [Indiscernible] and driven by the acquisition of Direct Energy. Our expectation for the next impact for [Indiscernible] remains at $500 million to $700 million, with the $10 million increase in 1 time costs, offset by a similar increase in the range of expecting mitigants now that positive developments at the Texas legislator and increase the probability of recouping some of our Uri losses. The total negative cash impact as shift this slightly as the estimated bill credits or old to large commercial and industrial customer. Have been reduced by higher billings in 2021. As a consequence, that 2021 Uri negative cash impact has increased by 85 million with their current funding movement in 2022. We expect to receive the majority of the securitization proceeds during the first quarter of 2022 with a possible first tranche later this year. Now, turning to the Direct Energy Integration, we are confirming our goal to achieve a run rate of $300 million synergies by 2023. During 2021, we have identified farther areas for cost synergies and were able to realize certain synergies earlier than anticipated. Overall, we are on track to achieve $175 million of synergy for 2021 with 144 million realize the year-to-date. Synergy expectation, As well as one-time cost savings achieved so far, are fully embedded respectively in our 2021 guidance and year-to-date actuals. As you are all familiar, supply chain constraints are affecting many industry across the country and they are affecting our operation as well. In addition to our Limestone Unit 1 outage, which has now extended to meet April 2022, constraints in the availability of coal are impacting both costs and volumes. In addition, our Midwest generation coal plants are impacted by shortfall in necessary chemicals to run the environmental controls of the fleet. Due to these constraints, we are now narrowing our guidance to the lower end of our original guidance to $2.4 to $2.5 billion. We are currently near the bottom of this range, but we are working intensively to improve our results. Consequently, we also narrowed our free cash flow before growth guidance to $1.44 billion to $1.54 billion. Moving to Slide 8, we are initiating guidance for 2022 to $1.95 billion to $2.25 billion. This is a significant decrease from our current 2021 results, driven by 3 elements as laid-out on these lines. Plant [Indiscernible] of east and west power plants, and deactivation of our Midwest generation, already highlighted in the Investor Day. The reduction in the New York City capacity revenues and the impact from the transitory costs that are related to 2022. As mentioned above, the contribution from Direct Energy would increase in 2022 by $130 million driven by the anticipated increase in synergies. We have already realized more synergy benefits in 2021, accelerating some action. And Therefore, we believe that we can achieve our target for 2022 of $225 million. Next, we anticipated the sale of our east and west assets to close next month for a net of $620 million in sales proceeds, reducing EBITDA by $100 million going forward. With a retirement of our core assets in the east, in mid-2022, EBITDA will decreased by $90 million in the year. In addition, due to change in New York capacity market parameters, capacity prices have decreased on a more permanent basis affecting our Astoria, And after keel facilities and reducing EBITDA by further -- further $30 million. Mentionable, we are experiencing a onetime extended forced outage at our Limestone Unit 1 facility. And what we believe to be transitory supply chain constraints that are negatively impacting 2022 results and we expect to correct them in 2023. With increased power prices, the extended outage at our limestone facility is increasing our supply cost by $50 million to April 2022 [Indiscernible] constraints on coal and chemical deliveries and commodity price, we expect fuel and supply cost to increase by $100 million in 2022 while returning to normal levels if future year. Lastly with the change in the AdCos market, we are expecting an increase in ancillary charges that were initiated after we contracted customer and were not included in our margin price. In the future, these costs will be included in future contract prices. But during 2022, we will incur an incremental $70 million of ancillary costs. This outcome is negative to us and our management team is working tirelessly to mitigate these incremental costs as best as possible, including further one-time proceedings opportunity. Due to an increased volatility in these environments, we are also increasing the range of our guidance with expectation that we can identify enough mitigants. In 2022 to offset a portion of these costs. The deduction in any EBITDA is the primary driver for the lower free cash flow before growth. I will now turn to Slide 9 where we are updating our plan 2021 capital allocation. In the past, our practice on this large, is to highlight changes from last quarter in blue, starting from the left most column, we have updated the 2021 excess cash with the latest the free cash flow midpoint to $1.49 billion, reducing available cash by 50 million. Moving to the Winter Storm Uri and as discussed before, that midpoint for the net estimated cash impact for Winter Storm Uri remains at $600 million, but given the increased utilization of customer credit in 2021, the net cash impact after assuming mitigants has increased to $535 million in 2021, and decreased by the same amount in 2022 to only $65 million. As you're aware, the much securitization builds HB4492 and SB1580 have been approved and the regulation has been finalized by our [Indiscernible] and the PUCT. We anticipate that the main portion of the financing and release of funds will occur during the first quarter of 2022. Moving to the next column, to pursue our targeted net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. We completed the delivering of $250 million. Plus early redemption fees of $64 million in Q3, totaling $319 million. Finally, we have added the anticipated sale of 4.8 gigawatt to our generation in the Easter-west regions, the net cash proceeds of $620 million will be utilized powerfully for data reduction. $500 million to maintain leverage and impact. After incremental fees of $16 million, the remaining 104 million will be available for general capital allocation. This leaves $375 million our remaining capital for allocation, and this capital is dependent on the successful conclusion of securitization process. Finally, of late after reducing our corporate debt balance for 2021, debt delivering and for the minimum cash, our 2021 net debt balance will be approximately $7.9 billion, which when based at the midpoint of adjusted EBITDA implies a ratio slightly above 3 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. As discussed during Investor Day, given our growth profile, our goal is to achieve investment-grade metrics or 2.5 to 2.75 net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. We remain committed with strong balance Sheet, and continued to target it 2.5 to 2.75 ratio, primarily through the full realization of Direct Energy land rate earnings back to you, Mauricio.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank Alberto. So turning to Slide 12, I want to provide an update on our progress executing our five-year growth roadmap. As I told you at Investor Day, two of our strategic priorities are to optimize the core and to grow the core. Optimizing the core will focus on strengthening our power and gas businesses, completing the Direct Energy Integration and continuing the decarbonization of our generation fleet. The Direct Energy transaction significantly increased our scale and materially enhance our natural gas capabilities. This created 2 near-term opportunities, increasing our number of pure natural gas customers, and expanding our dual product capabilities within our existing network of customers. Efforts in both of these areas are well underway, and we will leverage the collective experience of NRG and NRG Energy teams to execute on our growth in these targeted areas. In addition to natural gas and dual product customer growth, we will continue to invest in our core power business to extend our market-leading position in competitive retail electricity by continuing to meet the customers where they are, and to deliver the innovation that customers have come to expect from NRG, and its family of brands. The Direct Energy Integration is well on track and today, we are reiterating our full synergy plan targets. Upon closing Direct Energy, we immediately begun rationalizing offices in areas with significant employee geographic overlap and completed a number of critical system consolidations without any meaningful impact to the operations of the Company. Given that the integration is being led by the same team responsible for executing the transformation plan, we are highly confident in our ability to achieve the synergy targets that we have shared with you. Our portfolio decarbonization efforts remain ongoing. The 4.8 gigawatt asset sale to ArcLight remains on track to close by year-end with only New York PSC approval outstanding. We have 1.6 gigawatts of coal assets in PJM slated to retire in mid-2022 with the remainder of our PJM fleet under strategic review. We continue to execute on our renewable PPA strategy, having signed 2.7 gigawatts nationally, and expect to procure more renewable power through additional air-force for solar, wind, and battery storage in our core markets. Now, shifting to grow the quarter, our objectives are centered around distinct customer experiences in both Power Services and Home Services. As we work to shape these distinct customer experiences, we will break them down into discrete pieces and apply a test and learn discipline in order to refine our customer value proposition, optimal business model, and go-to-market strategy. By starting small, it allows us to stay nimble and deploy limited capital while gathering critical market intelligence to inform how we approach these new customer offerings for sustained long-term growth. 2022 will serve as a staging year where we will be focused on the test and learn environment [Indiscernible] discussed. Although this staging year will not be as growth capital intensive as the later years, it is a crucial year in which we will need to develop data back conviction in our initiatives in order to have the confidence to deploy more significant capital in 2023 and 2024. We will be sure to share more on our 2022 efforts as the year progresses. Now, as we're turning our attention to 2022 with limited cost on our capital, I want to take a moment to review our capital allocation framework and capital available for allocation. Beginning on the left hand side of this slide, we expect to have over $1.6 billion in capital available for allocation, including 375 million of on allocated cash from 2021. We will apply our capital allocation principles that are outlining the right side of this slide. Beyond sake and operational excellence, our first use of capital for allocation is to achieve and maintain a strong balance sheet. Our focus is to grow into our target metrics of 2.5 to 2.75 times by the end of 2023, resulting in the vast majority of our excess cash to be available for allocation throughout our 50% return of capital and 50% opportunistic frameworks. I look forward to providing you a comprehensive capital allocation update on our next earnings call. But these should give you a good idea of our financial flexibility. I am proud of the strength of our platform that despite near-term supply chain constraints, continues to provide our customers differentiated products and services. And for our shareholders, the financial flexibility to both execute our ambitious five-year growth, plan while returning significant cash to our investors. Now turning to Slide 14, I want to provide a few closing thoughts on today's presentation. During the third quarter, we continue to make significant progress on our strategic priorities, but we still have work to do this year. Over the remainder of the year, we expect to close on our announced asset sales and saw consequently execute on our capital allocation priorities. As we move into 2022, I am confident our platform is well-positioned to deliver strong and predictable results and create significant shareholder value. So with that, Benjamin will open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for the time.\nMauricio Gutierrez : Hey, good morning, Julien.\nAlberto Fornaro: Good morning.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning. So just to kick things off real quickly, I understand the markets are dynamic and turbulent here. Can you just walk through a little bit more on the coal supply chain basically. And when are you expecting this to resolve itself? And more specifically, how much of this is realized versus unrealized? I just want to understand really the level of further exposure that could exist here as you think about your level of confidence in getting the supplies that you are anticipating to get, if you will?\nMauricio Gutierrez : Yes, Julien. So let me start by \u2013 we\u2019ve all seen and experienced a pretty solid increase in natural gas prices. So when natural gas prices move up, where coal-generation flexes up and that caused a stress in the coal supply chain because I mean, we have been, for the past four or five years, generating at a certain level, not only us, but the entire coal-generation industry. So when you rapidly flex up, your coal supply chain doesn't flex up as quickly as you would like it to be, whether it's the commodity, the delivery, which is rail or chemicals, which is to control the emissions. Now, when that happens, in a normal circumstance, we will use that incremental generation to serve our month-to-month customers that are on their variable pricing. Now, when we are constrained, when we cannot flex up because of the supply constraints, then we have to go-to-market and procure at higher prices, which means then we have to make a decision, how much of these higher cost we pass through our customers. Keep in mind that we are balancing here margin stability and retention. So -- and one of the objectives that we have when we see these sudden increases -- short-term sudden increases, we don't want to cause a bill shock to our customers. We want to make sure that we maintain that we pass some of the cost, but not all of the cost. Obviously in the mid and the long-term, you can pass all the costs. But in the short-term, you really want to avoid bill shocks because if you lose the customer, you're also going to spend money in acquiring back the customer. So that's why this is a very deliberate, this is a balancing act between margin and stability and retention. Now, in terms of the duration of these, I expect these to be primarily in the first-half of the year. I think this will ease off in the second half because supply chain and the coal supply chain will respond to increasing pricing levels. Now to your question around realized and unrealized, most of these right now is on realized, but - because these are month-to-month customers. So, we have some levers to mitigate the impact. I mean, the first one is, obviously, how do we optimize our coal generation? Should we be looking only at running when you have really high-margin hours and then backing down in low-margin hours? We are in constant communication and testing the market in terms of our retail pricing strategy and priorities. I mean, the other leverage, Direct Energy synergies, and we're going to continue looking at if we can expand those Direct Energy synergies. And then finally, as you mentioned, I mean, this is a very evolving story, so things can change fairly quickly, just like the entire system moved up in the back of natural gas. It can come back down to more normal levels, and therefore, this will -- these constraints will ease, and we'll be back to a more normalized, I guess, environment. So I hope that these provides you that that framework and that explanation on what we're seeing today.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Excellent. And just to be clear about this, basically, it was more about the gas price increasing and you wanting to ramp per coal-to-gas switching, your coal gen, such that when you think about the existing commitment that you had on rail, et cetera, those remain intact here, if you will, coming into this fall season and into next year. And also, if I can throw out just the third question super quickly, can you just reaffirm here your expectations on '23? And otherwise I think I heard that already in the commentary, just want to make sure, we're crystal clear on the transient nature of these factors here, especially against your '23?\nMauricio Gutierrez : Absolutely. And I think that's what \u2013 that\u2019s how we wanted to lay it out for all of you. I mean, there - we think of this as transitory, specifically for 2022, both some of these supply chain plus the outage in Limestone, I expect that to normalize in 2023 and that's why we wanted to provide you the earnings power of our platform on a \u2013 in a normalized basis \u201823 and beyond.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Okay. We'll leave it there. Thank you, guys.\nMauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Julien.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Lapides: Hey, guys. Just curious you talked about a lot of these things being kind of abnormal or one-off items. As you think about the opportunity set for investing capital, would you be willing to push out the date you get to the 2.25 to 2.75 net debt to EBITDA to use capital for either a gross initiatives that generates a really high return or to use it to repurchase equity, which may generate an equally higher or even higher return? How do you evaluate when the market gives you opportunities that may be transient in nature about the timing of wanting to do debt pay down versus the timing of other more accretive investments?\nMauricio Gutierrez : Yes, Michael, I mean, we're always have to be flexible and aware of the opportunities that we have, right? I mean, we cannot be tone-deaf to what is happening around the organization around our markets. I believe that the value proposition of NRG, it is this balance approach of maintaining a strong balance sheet, returning capital to shareholders and growing the Company now. And that we have a tremendous opportunity on growing into these customer service or consumer service opportunities that we see in the market. So we're very, very excited about that. Now, having said that, I expect 2022 to perhaps be a little bit lighter on the investing in growth as opposed to '23, '24, and '25. What that means is, the business -- our business that is generating tremendous excess cash over $1.6 billion. We're going to be using our capital allocation principles, which is going to be returning capital to shareholders and growing. But since we're going to be only deploying, I would say a smaller part in 2022, I think, you should expect our share of returning capital to be bigger than the 50% that we have indicated in the past. So that's how I would think about it. Now, we continue -- we remain committed to our 2.5 to 2.75 by 2023 and we expect what achieve that through growing our EBITDA. And we grow the EBITDA by executing on the Direct Energy synergies and now with the incremental growth EBITDA that we can generate. So that's how I would frame it. Michael, obviously, we'll remain flexible, we'll remain opportunistic and we are not going to be tone-deaf to what we -- the opportunities that we will see in the market.\nMichael Lapides : Got it. How do you think about for 2022 cash available for allocation? About when you would make the decisions on the other 50%.\nMauricio Gutierrez : Well, I mean our plan would be to provide you a lot more clarity in the next earnings call. We would have that point. Identify what goes to growth investments and what we're going to do to return capital to shareholders. But I think -- I hope that the number that we provided you today. Gives you have a pretty good idea in terms of the magnitude of the excess cash that we have and where are we leaning and where do we see the opportunities to create value. I have said in the past, I believe that buying back our shares at discount creates value for our shareholders. Since I took over as CEO, we have bought back close to 25% of all the shares outstanding. So this is something that we're going to continue doing, is part of our value proposition, and we're going to remain opportunistic about it.\nMichael Lapides : Got it. And hey, last question I'll be quick here. Just curious when the Board, and we can look at the various financial metrics in the proxy that outline with the goals of the Company. But just curious when you have conversations with the Board, what tends to be most important, EBITDA growth, free cash flow per share growth, or is there another metric we should think about?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Well, Michael, I will tell you. It's always free cash flow per share growth because that's what matters to our shareholders. The per-share metrics, and we've outlined a 15% to 20% free cash flow per share growth in our 5-year plan. I think that's very, very compelling. We have the excess cash to execute on that both in terms of growing the numerator and then reducing the denominator while maintaining a strong Balance Sheet. So I think this balanced approach serves us well in the long run. Perhaps in the short-term, there may be other things that people want to do but I'm looking at long term value creation for our shareholders here.\nMichael Lapides : Got it. Thank you guys. Appreciate it Mauricio.\nMauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Michael.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim.\nShahriar Pourreza: Hey, good morning, guys.\nMauricio Gutierrez : Good morning, Shahriar.\nShahriar Pourreza: Well, sorry to sort of beat on this a little bit, but I just want to get a bit of a stronger sense and I'm still getting questions here on it. The '22 guidance walk is the normalized '22 EBITDA before transitory cost kind of a fair run rate target, as we're thinking about future years and sort of the significant coal supply chain cost, can they be mitigate d if this isn't a short-term headwind? I mean, why assume this is transitory, especially if the gas curve has longevity? And then, the Texas ancillary service charges in bucket 2, what are those exactly again?\nMauricio Gutierrez : The ancillary service was ERCOT instituted a short-term increasing ancillaries to maintain their reliable Think of the system. Chris, do you want to provide a little bit more specifically around and before I go into the before I pass it on to you, I just want to make sure that everybody understands our run rate. we actually have it on slide 8. We have normalized that to around $2.32 billion. And we say they're transitory, because the transitory supply chain is, when you're flexing off your coal generation, their supply chain takes a little time. I think about mining railroad sets that are allocated to call and chemicals. You can -- when the plant, can flex up fairly quickly. A supply chain that has been sized for the type of generation that we have experienced for the past five or six years. It doesn't flex up that quickly, so that's why I said it's going to take a little bit of time. I expect this to be in the first-half of the year. I think this is going to ease off in the second-half of the year, so that's why I refer to them as transitory. But, Chris, can you just go into detail around the ancillary service s?\nChristopher Moser : Yeah. Shahriar, they moved up responsive a little bit, couple of 100 megawatts. But the big change that they made in the middle of the summer last year was then moved up the non-spend requirements and that was by a factor depending on the hour and the day between 2 and three X. So that's been the bigger of the two impacts in terms of ancillary changes that they've made so far. Now, we're still waiting to see PUCT is a hard working sessions. And we've seen a memo from Chairman Lake detailing his thoughts. There is plenty of debate about, hey, what do we want to do on ancillaries going forward and certainly on the ORDC parameters too? Brattle group is coming in. They're going to study various combinations of, at what part of reserves should you start ORDC to kick in, at what slope should incline and whereas the cap, kind of a thing. There's a lot of moving pieces right now in terms of market designs that should be according to the schedule that I've seen nailed down by mid to late December. I think that they're planning on posting something around December 20, which will be their pick of ORDC changes, whether or not they have a winter fuel ancillary in there which is different than these 2 ancillaries I am talking about, what level that they want for the non-spend. And then also we've been advocating for an LSD obligation that would phase in over a couple of years. And Chairman Lake included that in his memo too so -- and there's a bunch of market design stuff that's moving that we'll be getting to here as we get to the end of the year.\nMauricio Gutierrez : And now, Shahriar, just to be still to be clear. Some of these ancillary costs that preceded describing a lot of them, we pass them through already, our customers, some of them we -- like I said, we don't want to create a bill shock. So in the medium to long run, all of these ancillaries will be passed through to customers. But in the short-term, we're managing these bill shock versus stability of margin and our retention numbers, just keep that in mind. That's why I call this transitory.\nShahriar Pourreza: Right.\nMauricio Gutierrez: And over the medium to long run they all make it -- to pass it out.\nShahriar Pourreza: And then, just lastly, you added 500 megawatts of PPAs in ERCOT last quarter. Can you maybe just unpack this a little bit? What's behind this? What are you seeing in the market right now? And more importantly, does some of these input cost pressures in specifically the renewable space, could that potentially impact your future PPA opportunities? Thanks, guys.\nMauricio Gutierrez : Yes, once again, I think that's in short term. We are seeing some supply chain issues in the solar, particularly in solar. We are going to be constantly in the market running RSPs to get solar wind and we are actually now looking at batteries. They continue to be very attractive from an economic standpoint. We are probably taking off our feet from the pedal just because it's -- we are aware of the supply chain, so we are slowing down a little bit on these PPAs. We want to see how these works out and then re-engage. I think that's the prudent thing to do. I'm very pleased with where we are today in terms of the PPAs that we have been able to sign and the economics that we have been able to achieve. But I also recognize that there is a transitory issue right now with supply chain that I don't want to be signing PPA's at higher costs. We've been very disciplined in terms of where we actually execute these PPAs. So my expectation is it has slowed down over the past couple of months, I think it's going to continue like that. And we're going to start picking up when we start seeing these supply chain issues ease off a little bit.\nShahriar Pourreza: Great. Thanks, guys. I'll stop there. Appreciate it.\nMauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Shahriar.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.\nSteve Fleishman: Hi, good morning.\nMauricio Gutierrez : Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Fleishman: Another [Indiscernible] in cost as gas prices which is also lifting up power prices and you don't mention that as a pressure in '22. Is that something that you feel like you're able to pass along to customers essentially or is that also kind -- because there is some lag and things and everything like how much is that additional pressure?\nMauricio Gutierrez: So think about this in 2 markets now that we have a power and gas business. So let me start with the gas business perhaps because that's the newest for all of you on the -- our ownership. Our gas business, think of it as a logistics business. We don't take commodity price risk. Every time we sign a customer, we back-to-back it with natural gas. And as part of that, we get a tremendous amount of, call it assets pipeline, storage, LDC relationships. So that infrastructure gives us the ability to manage some of the volatility that exist.\nAlberto Fornaro : Less on the price of nymex and more on the basis. So I feel very confident that our team has the ability to manage because of that very large infrastructure network -- natural gas networks that we have. So I'm actually quite comfortable with the exposure of our higher natural gas prices on our natural gas business. And then on the power side, I think we -- I already described it, Steve, in terms of higher gas prices, you have this issue on the coal constraints, but in general, think of these almost as inflationary pressure. We can pass it through and we actually choose to pass some of that. In the long term -- in the medium to long term you pass everything. And it's going to be a balancing act between -- you don't want to\nMauricio Gutierrez : cause a bill shock to our customers, at the same time you want to manage stable margins and good retention numbers, which are very, very compelling on our business. So that's how I'm thinking about it and that's why -- I mean, if it's a structurally higher gas prices, I don't have a big issue with that. I mean, the issue it always comes when gas prices move up very, very quickly. And then you have these constraints on the coal supply chain, and that's what we are addressing these here as transitory.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And then just more explicitly asking, I think what others maybe were earlier. The -- obviously when you look at debt to EBITDA targets, EBITDA is lower. It affect meaningfully where you are. Just this '22 EBITDA guidance. Are you going to be targeting off of that or are you just going to say this is not normal and we're just going to ignore it?\nMauricio Gutierrez : I think you need to recognize that '22 is a transition year and our commitment is achieving this in 2023, which we expect to go back to our normalized earnings. So when you're thinking about our trajectory from where we are today to how we get to 2023, you always have to take into consideration this on anticipated issue that we're seeing on the supply chain. So we remain committed for 2023. We believe that we can get to those credit metrics by growing into them now, not only Direct Energy synergies, but also additional growth EBITDA that we can execute on. And that's how I think about it. So I wouldn't read too much into the number in 2022. I think what is important is our objective in 2023.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski from Seaport.\nAngie Storozynski: Thank you. I wanted to start with a question about buybacks. And they need to support the stock clarity. Okay. Well, I understand that the Board usually makes those decisions in the fourth quarter. Well, I'll argue that given today's updates, an earlier decision would have been badly needed. Your peer made some unique decisions on that front. You guys -- seems like most of the money that would go to buybacks is not going to materialize anytime soon, and again, there is a need to support the stock. So would you be open to some unorthodox solutions here to again accelerate the buybacks either -- I don't know, either use revolver or something else to just support the stock now?\nMauricio Gutierrez : Well, as I said Angie, the first thing is I think the value proposition of NRG has always been this balanced approach between a strong Balance Sheet, returning capital and growing. So what you're describing is basically levering up to buy back stock. And at this point that's not our focus. Our focus is on continued executing on this balanced approach. But like I said, we are generating tremendous excess cash in the next 13 months. We're going to be deploying that consistently with our target allocation principles. That already gives you an indication. I described as the floor on share buybacks because you can clearly see the $1.6 billion of excess cash. You can look at -- if that's a 50/50, then you know what the dividend number is. You can be confident that the share buybacks that gets us to the 50%, that's -- you should think of that as the floor. And then on the opportunistic deployment of the other 50%, that's what we're talking about, right? That's what we're going to be flexing off. We want to be opportunistic about it. But I also want to I want to stay true to the value proposition that we have indicated to our shareholders. We're not going to become the FNG, and we're going to evaluate all the options that are available to us. And I think our record of execution should tell you that if there is a deep discount on our shares, we will react accordingly and we have done that in the past.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And then the second question. So my initial take when I read the press release, was that all of these issues that are weighing on that 2.3 to normalize EBITDA are related to generation. But really, if you listen to the discussion so far on this call, it seems like all of them are retail related. And again, I know that you're no longer differentiating between generation and retail but it seems like your pitch is an attempt to protect those retail margins when all of these charges that we're talking about should have been weighing the profitability of the retail book. And again, I understand you don't separate, but again, to me it just seems like there is a weakening of the profitability of that large retail book for various reasons, some of which you do not control. But I feel like you are attempting to make it seem like it's on the generation side when it seems like it's more on the retail side.\nMauricio Gutierrez : Well, Angie, it stems from the generation side because when you actually -- if we actually, in a normal circumstance, if our coal generation was able to flex off, we always plan to use that additional megawatts to cover our month-on-month customers. We don't have it and the market indicates that we should, but because we have these constraints, we cannot flex that off. We have to buy it as replacement cost. So I wouldn't characterize it as a retail thing. I think that's the -- I'm trying to connect the two so you understand the reason why this is happening. It stems from the generation side but if I actually had a heat rate call option on gas, I wouldn't be having this conversation. We would be able to flex up those megawatts and serve our month-to-month customers. So, I just want to be careful that I actually wouldn't characterize it as a retail concern. This is basically starts with an issue on coal supply that impacts our coal-generation economics which then impacts how we were thinking about managing those month-to-month customers than your pricing every month on a continuous basis.\nAngie Storozynski: So just one follow-up here because I guess if the -- I don't quite understand that the hedging strategy here, because I would have thought your -- you had your retail book using economic generation at the time of the hedge. And so in light of the higher power prices they economic generation from has in coal plants has increased. You don't really have many gas plants, so there's not much of a detriment. So there should be potential excess generation from the coal plans which -- okay, it's not materializing because you don't have access to incremental coal supplies, but why would it be a drag versus the initial hedge?\nMauricio Gutierrez : Well, because the month-to-month, you don't have an initial hedge on the month-to-month. You hedge against your fixed price low. And like I said, we are passing some of that cost, but not all of the cost. So on the month-to-month, because you have this desirable pricing, you have some but the extent that we have seen in terms of the increase in gas prices that impact power prices, really has put us in a position where we need to make a decision, do we want to pass through all of these at the expense of retention or not? But it all stems from the fact that we cannot flex up our coal generation because of these supply constraint issues.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. Thank you.\nMauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Angie.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold from Vertical Research.\nJonathan Arnold: Yeah, good morning, guys.\nMauricio Gutierrez : Hey Jonathan. Good morning.\nJonathan Arnold : Hi. A couple of things. Could you just give us a little more on what exactly happened at Limestone, what caused the extension and how confident are you that they will come back in April. And maybe quantify that what the impact in '21 has been, or is expected to be.\nMauricio Gutierrez : Sure, Jonathan, Chris?\nChristopher Moser : Yes, Jonathan, this is Chris. In terms of what happened at Limestone, the duct that connects the back-end controls to the stack collapsed, and so we've gone through the demolition part of that, still finalizing root cause, but very close on that. And we are well underway on the restoration plan, which is expected to be done in April 15, right in the middle of April.\nJonathan Arnold : Okay.\nMauricio Gutierrez : It will be -- the plant will be available ahead of the summer.\nJonathan Arnold : Do you have business interruption what have you insurance on that -- these assumptions?\nChristopher Moser : Yes, there's property damage and business interruption, but that will take a little while to work through right. But we notified them. They've been working through it with on the process as we've been going in terms of demolition and the reconstruction of it.\nJonathan Arnold : Okay. And then obviously, you mentioned you're confident that these pressures are going to moderate in the second half, is that what's assumed in the 100 million on Slide 8 or could that number increase if you don't see that moderation in the back half of the year?\nMauricio Gutierrez : Yes. So our number incorporates our expectation. What we're right now seeing and hearing from our railroad partners and coal suppliers So this is reflected in this number. Obviously, we're working hard to mitigate this and I already listed a few of the things that we're going to mitigate. We're going to be working harder. I'm not pleased with it and I don't want -- these are not realize, these are unrealized and as long as they're unrealized There is some opportunity to get back to normal number. And then if they, if it gets better, quicker than you can expect upside if it gets worse than we will try to mitigate things. I think we're getting ahead of it, we have a pretty good we believe in terms of how we can mitigate these for 2022. But yes, that's how I would characterize it.\nJonathan Arnold : But you're not assuming mitigation currently, right?\nChristopher Moser : No.\nJonathan Arnold: Okay. And then finally, on this normalized '22 number, so we're trying to think about what that looks like. Beyond ' 22. We'd add incremental direct synergies, right?\nMauricio Gutierrez : Correct.\nJonathan Arnold : Which are -- could you remind me.\nMauricio Gutierrez : So we have about a $110 million in 2023 in addition to 2. [Indiscernible], I think that's what we -- and obviously, this is just another lever that we're working hard. I'm very pleased to see where we are on synergies year-to-date. But we're always going to be looking at additional opportunities to make our platform more efficient.\nJonathan Arnold : Okay. So 110 on top of the 2.32 that you would expect, and you're also hoping clearly exceed that?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Correct. And then also keep in mind that you have the remaining of the PJM assets, which is about $40 million, a unit to the [Indiscernible] in order to complete their normalization of your exercise.\nJonathan Arnold : I see that. Great. Thank you very much.\nMauricio Gutierrez : All right. Great. Thanks, Jon.\nOperator: It is all the time we have for questions. That concludes the Q&A portion of today's conference. I'll now pass it to Mauricio Gutierrez for closing remarks.\nMauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Benjamin. Well, thank you, everybody, for your interest in NRG, and I look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mauricio Gutierrez",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm joined this morning by Alberto Fornaro, Chief Financial Officer, also on the call and available for questions; we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Home Retail; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations. I'd like to start on Slide 4 of today's presentation. Our consumer services platform performed well through this summer and delivered stable results. We are narrowing our 2021 financial guidance at the low end of the range and initiating 2022 financial guidance. Our platform is navigating the unprecedented supply chain constraints, and we are actively working to mitigate the financial impact. Finally, we continue to make progress on our five-year growth plan. In the near-term, we are focused on the Direct Energy integration, organic growth in power and gas, and expanding our customer base with dual product options. Moving to the financial and operational results for the third quarter on Slide 5. Beginning on the left-hand side of this slide, I want to start with safety. We delivered another quarter of top decile safety performance. This marks 10 straight quarters at this level of performance, a testament towards our strong safety culture. As we continue our return to the office, the safety and well-being of our employees remains our top priority. During the third quarter, we delivered $767 million of adjusted EBITDA, which brings our year-to-date results to $1.99 billion, or 19% higher than the previous year, driven primarily by the acquisition of Direct Energy. We are, however, narrowing our 2021 guidance to the lower half of the range, primarily as a result of unanticipated supply chain constraints impacting fourth quarter results. This will also impact 2022 guidance, which I will address shortly. During the quarter, we made good progress on our key strategic initiatives. First, Direct Energy integration is well ahead of pace, achieving a $144 million year-to-date, or 107% of the original full-year plan. We are increasing our 2021 target to $175 million, which reflects the early realization of synergy targets in 2021. We are maintaining the full plan target of $300 million run rate in 2023. Next, in ERCOT, the PUCT continues to advance necessary actions to improve market reliability. In October, the PUCT implemented phase 1 of the winter weatherization standards, which will be in effect for these upcoming winter. This weatherization standard adopts best practices and addresses weather-related issues that are current during yearly. We are making the necessary investments in our fleet to be in compliance and ready for winter operations. On market design, the PUCT remains focused on our comprehensive solution to improve reliability and incentivize dispatchable resources. At NRG, we support this direction and have taken a leading role in offering ideas for the PUCT's consideration. We have proposed a comprehensive solution to prioritize reliability and achieve it through competitive solutions. The PUCT also approved the final orders for securitization to ensure a healthy and competitive market. I want to commend and thank the governor, legislature, and PUCT for tirelessly working to address the issues Uri exposed and to harden the ERCOT system and protecting the integrity of the competitive markets that have benefited consumers over the years. Now, turning to Home Retail. We continue to advance our best-in-class customer experience during the quarter. Our Reliant brand was recognized with two awards during the quarter. The North American Customer Centricity Award in the Crisis Management category, and the 2021 Innovation Leader Impact Award for the Make It Solar offering, which is our renewable energy initiative that allows customers to support solar energy without installing panels. Now, moving to the right-hand side of this slide to discuss 2022. First, as we detailed during our June Investor Day, 2022 is a staging year for high-grading our business and achieving our five-year 15% to 20% free cash flow per share growth plan. In 2022, we remain focused on integrating Direct Energy and achieving the plants high-quality synergies, removing or streamlining our East generation business that continues to weigh on our valuation, given earnings and terminal value concerns that otherwise would have masked our retail growth, deploying smaller amounts of capital to prepare the platform for growth and returning a significant amount of capital to shareholders. With that, we're introducing 2022 financial guidance of $1.95 billion to $2.25 billion of adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth of $1.14 to $1.44 billion. This guidance reflects our plan to fully realize our planned synergies and to streamline our East generation business. Also impacting this guidance are temporary impacts from unforeseen supply chain constraints, ancillary services charges in ERCOT, and our previously announced Limestone Unit 1 outage through April 2022. But leave no doubt. Now that we have identified these near-term headwinds, we are focused on mitigating these impacts into 2022. Finally, we are also announcing an 8% increase in our 2022 dividend in line with our stated dividend growth rate of 7% to 9%. Now, let me turn the call over to Alberto for a more detailed financial review. And after, I will discuss how we are advancing our Consumer Services five-year roadmap. Alberto? Thank Alberto. So turning to Slide 12, I want to provide an update on our progress executing our five-year growth roadmap. As I told you at Investor Day, two of our strategic priorities are to optimize the core and to grow the core. Optimizing the core will focus on strengthening our power and gas businesses, completing the Direct Energy Integration and continuing the decarbonization of our generation fleet. The Direct Energy transaction significantly increased our scale and materially enhance our natural gas capabilities. This created 2 near-term opportunities, increasing our number of pure natural gas customers, and expanding our dual product capabilities within our existing network of customers. Efforts in both of these areas are well underway, and we will leverage the collective experience of NRG and NRG Energy teams to execute on our growth in these targeted areas. In addition to natural gas and dual product customer growth, we will continue to invest in our core power business to extend our market-leading position in competitive retail electricity by continuing to meet the customers where they are, and to deliver the innovation that customers have come to expect from NRG, and its family of brands. The Direct Energy Integration is well on track and today, we are reiterating our full synergy plan targets. Upon closing Direct Energy, we immediately begun rationalizing offices in areas with significant employee geographic overlap and completed a number of critical system consolidations without any meaningful impact to the operations of the Company. Given that the integration is being led by the same team responsible for executing the transformation plan, we are highly confident in our ability to achieve the synergy targets that we have shared with you. Our portfolio decarbonization efforts remain ongoing. The 4.8 gigawatt asset sale to ArcLight remains on track to close by year-end with only New York PSC approval outstanding. We have 1.6 gigawatts of coal assets in PJM slated to retire in mid-2022 with the remainder of our PJM fleet under strategic review. We continue to execute on our renewable PPA strategy, having signed 2.7 gigawatts nationally, and expect to procure more renewable power through additional air-force for solar, wind, and battery storage in our core markets. Now, shifting to grow the quarter, our objectives are centered around distinct customer experiences in both Power Services and Home Services. As we work to shape these distinct customer experiences, we will break them down into discrete pieces and apply a test and learn discipline in order to refine our customer value proposition, optimal business model, and go-to-market strategy. By starting small, it allows us to stay nimble and deploy limited capital while gathering critical market intelligence to inform how we approach these new customer offerings for sustained long-term growth. 2022 will serve as a staging year where we will be focused on the test and learn environment [Indiscernible] discussed. Although this staging year will not be as growth capital intensive as the later years, it is a crucial year in which we will need to develop data back conviction in our initiatives in order to have the confidence to deploy more significant capital in 2023 and 2024. We will be sure to share more on our 2022 efforts as the year progresses. Now, as we're turning our attention to 2022 with limited cost on our capital, I want to take a moment to review our capital allocation framework and capital available for allocation. Beginning on the left hand side of this slide, we expect to have over $1.6 billion in capital available for allocation, including 375 million of on allocated cash from 2021. We will apply our capital allocation principles that are outlining the right side of this slide. Beyond sake and operational excellence, our first use of capital for allocation is to achieve and maintain a strong balance sheet. Our focus is to grow into our target metrics of 2.5 to 2.75 times by the end of 2023, resulting in the vast majority of our excess cash to be available for allocation throughout our 50% return of capital and 50% opportunistic frameworks. I look forward to providing you a comprehensive capital allocation update on our next earnings call. But these should give you a good idea of our financial flexibility. I am proud of the strength of our platform that despite near-term supply chain constraints, continues to provide our customers differentiated products and services. And for our shareholders, the financial flexibility to both execute our ambitious five-year growth, plan while returning significant cash to our investors. Now turning to Slide 14, I want to provide a few closing thoughts on today's presentation. During the third quarter, we continue to make significant progress on our strategic priorities, but we still have work to do this year. Over the remainder of the year, we expect to close on our announced asset sales and saw consequently execute on our capital allocation priorities. As we move into 2022, I am confident our platform is well-positioned to deliver strong and predictable results and create significant shareholder value. So with that, Benjamin will open the line for questions. Hey, good morning, Julien. Yes, Julien. So let me start by \u2013 we've all seen and experienced a pretty solid increase in natural gas prices. So when natural gas prices move up, where coal-generation flexes up and that caused a stress in the coal supply chain because I mean, we have been, for the past four or five years, generating at a certain level, not only us, but the entire coal-generation industry. So when you rapidly flex up, your coal supply chain doesn't flex up as quickly as you would like it to be, whether it's the commodity, the delivery, which is rail or chemicals, which is to control the emissions. Now, when that happens, in a normal circumstance, we will use that incremental generation to serve our month-to-month customers that are on their variable pricing. Now, when we are constrained, when we cannot flex up because of the supply constraints, then we have to go-to-market and procure at higher prices, which means then we have to make a decision, how much of these higher cost we pass through our customers. Keep in mind that we are balancing here margin stability and retention. So -- and one of the objectives that we have when we see these sudden increases -- short-term sudden increases, we don't want to cause a bill shock to our customers. We want to make sure that we maintain that we pass some of the cost, but not all of the cost. Obviously in the mid and the long-term, you can pass all the costs. But in the short-term, you really want to avoid bill shocks because if you lose the customer, you're also going to spend money in acquiring back the customer. So that's why this is a very deliberate, this is a balancing act between margin and stability and retention. Now, in terms of the duration of these, I expect these to be primarily in the first-half of the year. I think this will ease off in the second half because supply chain and the coal supply chain will respond to increasing pricing levels. Now to your question around realized and unrealized, most of these right now is on realized, but - because these are month-to-month customers. So, we have some levers to mitigate the impact. I mean, the first one is, obviously, how do we optimize our coal generation? Should we be looking only at running when you have really high-margin hours and then backing down in low-margin hours? We are in constant communication and testing the market in terms of our retail pricing strategy and priorities. I mean, the other leverage, Direct Energy synergies, and we're going to continue looking at if we can expand those Direct Energy synergies. And then finally, as you mentioned, I mean, this is a very evolving story, so things can change fairly quickly, just like the entire system moved up in the back of natural gas. It can come back down to more normal levels, and therefore, this will -- these constraints will ease, and we'll be back to a more normalized, I guess, environment. So I hope that these provides you that that framework and that explanation on what we're seeing today. Absolutely. And I think that's what \u2013 that's how we wanted to lay it out for all of you. I mean, there - we think of this as transitory, specifically for 2022, both some of these supply chain plus the outage in Limestone, I expect that to normalize in 2023 and that's why we wanted to provide you the earnings power of our platform on a \u2013 in a normalized basis \u201823 and beyond. Thank you, Julien. Yes, Michael, I mean, we're always have to be flexible and aware of the opportunities that we have, right? I mean, we cannot be tone-deaf to what is happening around the organization around our markets. I believe that the value proposition of NRG, it is this balance approach of maintaining a strong balance sheet, returning capital to shareholders and growing the Company now. And that we have a tremendous opportunity on growing into these customer service or consumer service opportunities that we see in the market. So we're very, very excited about that. Now, having said that, I expect 2022 to perhaps be a little bit lighter on the investing in growth as opposed to '23, '24, and '25. What that means is, the business -- our business that is generating tremendous excess cash over $1.6 billion. We're going to be using our capital allocation principles, which is going to be returning capital to shareholders and growing. But since we're going to be only deploying, I would say a smaller part in 2022, I think, you should expect our share of returning capital to be bigger than the 50% that we have indicated in the past. So that's how I would think about it. Now, we continue -- we remain committed to our 2.5 to 2.75 by 2023 and we expect what achieve that through growing our EBITDA. And we grow the EBITDA by executing on the Direct Energy synergies and now with the incremental growth EBITDA that we can generate. So that's how I would frame it. Michael, obviously, we'll remain flexible, we'll remain opportunistic and we are not going to be tone-deaf to what we -- the opportunities that we will see in the market. Well, I mean our plan would be to provide you a lot more clarity in the next earnings call. We would have that point. Identify what goes to growth investments and what we're going to do to return capital to shareholders. But I think -- I hope that the number that we provided you today. Gives you have a pretty good idea in terms of the magnitude of the excess cash that we have and where are we leaning and where do we see the opportunities to create value. I have said in the past, I believe that buying back our shares at discount creates value for our shareholders. Since I took over as CEO, we have bought back close to 25% of all the shares outstanding. So this is something that we're going to continue doing, is part of our value proposition, and we're going to remain opportunistic about it. Well, Michael, I will tell you. It's always free cash flow per share growth because that's what matters to our shareholders. The per-share metrics, and we've outlined a 15% to 20% free cash flow per share growth in our 5-year plan. I think that's very, very compelling. We have the excess cash to execute on that both in terms of growing the numerator and then reducing the denominator while maintaining a strong Balance Sheet. So I think this balanced approach serves us well in the long run. Perhaps in the short-term, there may be other things that people want to do but I'm looking at long term value creation for our shareholders here. Thank you, Michael. Good morning, Shahriar. The ancillary service was ERCOT instituted a short-term increasing ancillaries to maintain their reliable Think of the system. Chris, do you want to provide a little bit more specifically around and before I go into the before I pass it on to you, I just want to make sure that everybody understands our run rate. we actually have it on slide 8. We have normalized that to around $2.32 billion. And we say they're transitory, because the transitory supply chain is, when you're flexing off your coal generation, their supply chain takes a little time. I think about mining railroad sets that are allocated to call and chemicals. You can -- when the plant, can flex up fairly quickly. A supply chain that has been sized for the type of generation that we have experienced for the past five or six years. It doesn't flex up that quickly, so that's why I said it's going to take a little bit of time. I expect this to be in the first-half of the year. I think this is going to ease off in the second-half of the year, so that's why I refer to them as transitory. But, Chris, can you just go into detail around the ancillary service s? And now, Shahriar, just to be still to be clear. Some of these ancillary costs that preceded describing a lot of them, we pass them through already, our customers, some of them we -- like I said, we don't want to create a bill shock. So in the medium to long run, all of these ancillaries will be passed through to customers. But in the short-term, we're managing these bill shock versus stability of margin and our retention numbers, just keep that in mind. That's why I call this transitory. And over the medium to long run they all make it -- to pass it out. Yes, once again, I think that's in short term. We are seeing some supply chain issues in the solar, particularly in solar. We are going to be constantly in the market running RSPs to get solar wind and we are actually now looking at batteries. They continue to be very attractive from an economic standpoint. We are probably taking off our feet from the pedal just because it's -- we are aware of the supply chain, so we are slowing down a little bit on these PPAs. We want to see how these works out and then re-engage. I think that's the prudent thing to do. I'm very pleased with where we are today in terms of the PPAs that we have been able to sign and the economics that we have been able to achieve. But I also recognize that there is a transitory issue right now with supply chain that I don't want to be signing PPA's at higher costs. We've been very disciplined in terms of where we actually execute these PPAs. So my expectation is it has slowed down over the past couple of months, I think it's going to continue like that. And we're going to start picking up when we start seeing these supply chain issues ease off a little bit. Thank you, Shahriar. Good morning, Steve. So think about this in 2 markets now that we have a power and gas business. So let me start with the gas business perhaps because that's the newest for all of you on the -- our ownership. Our gas business, think of it as a logistics business. We don't take commodity price risk. Every time we sign a customer, we back-to-back it with natural gas. And as part of that, we get a tremendous amount of, call it assets pipeline, storage, LDC relationships. So that infrastructure gives us the ability to manage some of the volatility that exist. cause a bill shock to our customers, at the same time you want to manage stable margins and good retention numbers, which are very, very compelling on our business. So that's how I'm thinking about it and that's why -- I mean, if it's a structurally higher gas prices, I don't have a big issue with that. I mean, the issue it always comes when gas prices move up very, very quickly. And then you have these constraints on the coal supply chain, and that's what we are addressing these here as transitory. I think you need to recognize that '22 is a transition year and our commitment is achieving this in 2023, which we expect to go back to our normalized earnings. So when you're thinking about our trajectory from where we are today to how we get to 2023, you always have to take into consideration this on anticipated issue that we're seeing on the supply chain. So we remain committed for 2023. We believe that we can get to those credit metrics by growing into them now, not only Direct Energy synergies, but also additional growth EBITDA that we can execute on. And that's how I think about it. So I wouldn't read too much into the number in 2022. I think what is important is our objective in 2023. Well, as I said Angie, the first thing is I think the value proposition of NRG has always been this balanced approach between a strong Balance Sheet, returning capital and growing. So what you're describing is basically levering up to buy back stock. And at this point that's not our focus. Our focus is on continued executing on this balanced approach. But like I said, we are generating tremendous excess cash in the next 13 months. We're going to be deploying that consistently with our target allocation principles. That already gives you an indication. I described as the floor on share buybacks because you can clearly see the $1.6 billion of excess cash. You can look at -- if that's a 50/50, then you know what the dividend number is. You can be confident that the share buybacks that gets us to the 50%, that's -- you should think of that as the floor. And then on the opportunistic deployment of the other 50%, that's what we're talking about, right? That's what we're going to be flexing off. We want to be opportunistic about it. But I also want to I want to stay true to the value proposition that we have indicated to our shareholders. We're not going to become the FNG, and we're going to evaluate all the options that are available to us. And I think our record of execution should tell you that if there is a deep discount on our shares, we will react accordingly and we have done that in the past. Well, Angie, it stems from the generation side because when you actually -- if we actually, in a normal circumstance, if our coal generation was able to flex off, we always plan to use that additional megawatts to cover our month-on-month customers. We don't have it and the market indicates that we should, but because we have these constraints, we cannot flex that off. We have to buy it as replacement cost. So I wouldn't characterize it as a retail thing. I think that's the -- I'm trying to connect the two so you understand the reason why this is happening. It stems from the generation side but if I actually had a heat rate call option on gas, I wouldn't be having this conversation. We would be able to flex up those megawatts and serve our month-to-month customers. So, I just want to be careful that I actually wouldn't characterize it as a retail concern. This is basically starts with an issue on coal supply that impacts our coal-generation economics which then impacts how we were thinking about managing those month-to-month customers than your pricing every month on a continuous basis. Well, because the month-to-month, you don't have an initial hedge on the month-to-month. You hedge against your fixed price low. And like I said, we are passing some of that cost, but not all of the cost. So on the month-to-month, because you have this desirable pricing, you have some but the extent that we have seen in terms of the increase in gas prices that impact power prices, really has put us in a position where we need to make a decision, do we want to pass through all of these at the expense of retention or not? But it all stems from the fact that we cannot flex up our coal generation because of these supply constraint issues. Thank you, Angie. Hey Jonathan. Good morning. Sure, Jonathan, Chris? It will be -- the plant will be available ahead of the summer. Yes. So our number incorporates our expectation. What we're right now seeing and hearing from our railroad partners and coal suppliers So this is reflected in this number. Obviously, we're working hard to mitigate this and I already listed a few of the things that we're going to mitigate. We're going to be working harder. I'm not pleased with it and I don't want -- these are not realize, these are unrealized and as long as they're unrealized There is some opportunity to get back to normal number. And then if they, if it gets better, quicker than you can expect upside if it gets worse than we will try to mitigate things. I think we're getting ahead of it, we have a pretty good we believe in terms of how we can mitigate these for 2022. But yes, that's how I would characterize it. Correct. So we have about a $110 million in 2023 in addition to 2. [Indiscernible], I think that's what we -- and obviously, this is just another lever that we're working hard. I'm very pleased to see where we are on synergies year-to-date. But we're always going to be looking at additional opportunities to make our platform more efficient. Correct. And then also keep in mind that you have the remaining of the PJM assets, which is about $40 million, a unit to the [Indiscernible] in order to complete their normalization of your exercise. All right. Great. Thanks, Jon. Thank you, Benjamin. Well, thank you, everybody, for your interest in NRG, and I look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you."

            "name": "Alberto Fornaro",
            "content": "Thank you, Mauricio. Moving to the quarterly results, I will now turn to Slide 7 for a brief review of our financials. For the quarter, NRG delivered $767 million in adjusted EBITDA, or $15 million higher than the third quarter of last year. The increase in consolidated earnings was driven by the acquisition of Direct Energy and related additional synergies achieved in Q3, partially offset by the impact of the outage at Tower Limestone Unit 1 facility and other headwinds related to the onset of supply Country constraints. Specifically by region, the East benefited by $89 million, driven by the expected contribution from the Direct Energy acquisition and some incremental synergies and cost savings. This benefit was partially offset by reduced volume in our sale of power, as well as lower profitability through our PJM coal fleet due to supply chain constraints for chemical necessary to ran the environmental controls. Next, our Texas region decreased by $68 million due to the higher supplier cost to serve our retail load. With the outage of Limestone Unit 1, we had to purchase higher priced supply to supplement this lost generation. This increase in supply cost was partially offset by the contribution from the Direct Energy acquisition. As a reminder, we benefited last year from exceptionally low market power prices realized during the COVID-driven economic shutdown, and a favorable mix in usage between home and business customers. The free cash flow before growth in the quarter was $395 million, a reduction of $230 million year-over-year, driven primarily by two factors, a $75 million increase in cash interest due to the $3 billion in Direct Energy financing in late 2020 and second is the movement in inventory. During Q3, 2020, we reduced inventory by $60 million, driven by seasonal trends and coal utilization. While during Q3, 2021, we built up inventories by $75 million, mostly for the seasonal needs of the gas business. This overall resulted in $135 million negative cash flow [Indiscernible]. On a year-to-date basis, our progress in terms of incremental profitability [Indiscernible] and driven by the acquisition of Direct Energy. Our expectation for the next impact for [Indiscernible] remains at $500 million to $700 million, with the $10 million increase in 1 time costs, offset by a similar increase in the range of expecting mitigants now that positive developments at the Texas legislator and increase the probability of recouping some of our Uri losses. The total negative cash impact as shift this slightly as the estimated bill credits or old to large commercial and industrial customer. Have been reduced by higher billings in 2021. As a consequence, that 2021 Uri negative cash impact has increased by 85 million with their current funding movement in 2022. We expect to receive the majority of the securitization proceeds during the first quarter of 2022 with a possible first tranche later this year. Now, turning to the Direct Energy Integration, we are confirming our goal to achieve a run rate of $300 million synergies by 2023. During 2021, we have identified farther areas for cost synergies and were able to realize certain synergies earlier than anticipated. Overall, we are on track to achieve $175 million of synergy for 2021 with 144 million realize the year-to-date. Synergy expectation, As well as one-time cost savings achieved so far, are fully embedded respectively in our 2021 guidance and year-to-date actuals. As you are all familiar, supply chain constraints are affecting many industry across the country and they are affecting our operation as well. In addition to our Limestone Unit 1 outage, which has now extended to meet April 2022, constraints in the availability of coal are impacting both costs and volumes. In addition, our Midwest generation coal plants are impacted by shortfall in necessary chemicals to run the environmental controls of the fleet. Due to these constraints, we are now narrowing our guidance to the lower end of our original guidance to $2.4 to $2.5 billion. We are currently near the bottom of this range, but we are working intensively to improve our results. Consequently, we also narrowed our free cash flow before growth guidance to $1.44 billion to $1.54 billion. Moving to Slide 8, we are initiating guidance for 2022 to $1.95 billion to $2.25 billion. This is a significant decrease from our current 2021 results, driven by 3 elements as laid-out on these lines. Plant [Indiscernible] of east and west power plants, and deactivation of our Midwest generation, already highlighted in the Investor Day. The reduction in the New York City capacity revenues and the impact from the transitory costs that are related to 2022. As mentioned above, the contribution from Direct Energy would increase in 2022 by $130 million driven by the anticipated increase in synergies. We have already realized more synergy benefits in 2021, accelerating some action. And Therefore, we believe that we can achieve our target for 2022 of $225 million. Next, we anticipated the sale of our east and west assets to close next month for a net of $620 million in sales proceeds, reducing EBITDA by $100 million going forward. With a retirement of our core assets in the east, in mid-2022, EBITDA will decreased by $90 million in the year. In addition, due to change in New York capacity market parameters, capacity prices have decreased on a more permanent basis affecting our Astoria, And after keel facilities and reducing EBITDA by further -- further $30 million. Mentionable, we are experiencing a onetime extended forced outage at our Limestone Unit 1 facility. And what we believe to be transitory supply chain constraints that are negatively impacting 2022 results and we expect to correct them in 2023. With increased power prices, the extended outage at our limestone facility is increasing our supply cost by $50 million to April 2022 [Indiscernible] constraints on coal and chemical deliveries and commodity price, we expect fuel and supply cost to increase by $100 million in 2022 while returning to normal levels if future year. Lastly with the change in the AdCos market, we are expecting an increase in ancillary charges that were initiated after we contracted customer and were not included in our margin price. In the future, these costs will be included in future contract prices. But during 2022, we will incur an incremental $70 million of ancillary costs. This outcome is negative to us and our management team is working tirelessly to mitigate these incremental costs as best as possible, including further one-time proceedings opportunity. Due to an increased volatility in these environments, we are also increasing the range of our guidance with expectation that we can identify enough mitigants. In 2022 to offset a portion of these costs. The deduction in any EBITDA is the primary driver for the lower free cash flow before growth. I will now turn to Slide 9 where we are updating our plan 2021 capital allocation. In the past, our practice on this large, is to highlight changes from last quarter in blue, starting from the left most column, we have updated the 2021 excess cash with the latest the free cash flow midpoint to $1.49 billion, reducing available cash by 50 million. Moving to the Winter Storm Uri and as discussed before, that midpoint for the net estimated cash impact for Winter Storm Uri remains at $600 million, but given the increased utilization of customer credit in 2021, the net cash impact after assuming mitigants has increased to $535 million in 2021, and decreased by the same amount in 2022 to only $65 million. As you're aware, the much securitization builds HB4492 and SB1580 have been approved and the regulation has been finalized by our [Indiscernible] and the PUCT. We anticipate that the main portion of the financing and release of funds will occur during the first quarter of 2022. Moving to the next column, to pursue our targeted net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. We completed the delivering of $250 million. Plus early redemption fees of $64 million in Q3, totaling $319 million. Finally, we have added the anticipated sale of 4.8 gigawatt to our generation in the Easter-west regions, the net cash proceeds of $620 million will be utilized powerfully for data reduction. $500 million to maintain leverage and impact. After incremental fees of $16 million, the remaining 104 million will be available for general capital allocation. This leaves $375 million our remaining capital for allocation, and this capital is dependent on the successful conclusion of securitization process. Finally, of late after reducing our corporate debt balance for 2021, debt delivering and for the minimum cash, our 2021 net debt balance will be approximately $7.9 billion, which when based at the midpoint of adjusted EBITDA implies a ratio slightly above 3 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. As discussed during Investor Day, given our growth profile, our goal is to achieve investment-grade metrics or 2.5 to 2.75 net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. We remain committed with strong balance Sheet, and continued to target it 2.5 to 2.75 ratio, primarily through the full realization of Direct Energy land rate earnings back to you, Mauricio. Good morning. Less on the price of nymex and more on the basis. So I feel very confident that our team has the ability to manage because of that very large infrastructure network -- natural gas networks that we have. So I'm actually quite comfortable with the exposure of our higher natural gas prices on our natural gas business. And then on the power side, I think we -- I already described it, Steve, in terms of higher gas prices, you have this issue on the coal constraints, but in general, think of these almost as inflationary pressure. We can pass it through and we actually choose to pass some of that. In the long term -- in the medium to long term you pass everything. And it's going to be a balancing act between -- you don't want to"

But the big change that they made in the middle of the summer last year was then moved up the non-spend requirements and that was by a factor depending on the hour and the day between 2 and three X. So that's been the bigger of the two impacts in terms of ancillary changes that they've made so far. Now, we're still waiting to see PUCT is a hard working sessions. And we've seen a memo from Chairman Lake detailing his thoughts. There is plenty of debate about, hey, what do we want to do on ancillaries going forward and certainly on the ORDC parameters too? Brattle group is coming in. They're going to study various combinations of, at what part of reserves should you start ORDC to kick in, at what slope should incline and whereas the cap, kind of a thing. There's a lot of moving pieces right now in terms of market designs that should be according to the schedule that I've seen nailed down by mid to late December. I think that they're planning on posting something around December 20, which will be their pick of ORDC changes, whether or not they have a winter fuel ancillary in there which is different than these 2 ancillaries I am talking about, what level that they want for the non-spend. And then also we've been advocating for an LSD obligation that would phase in over a couple of years. And Chairman Lake included that in his memo too so -- and there's a bunch of market design stuff that's moving that we'll be getting to here as we get to the end of the year. Yes, Jonathan, this is Chris. In terms of what happened at Limestone, the duct that connects the back-end controls to the stack collapsed, and so we've gone through the demolition part of that, still finalizing root cause, but very close on that. And we are well underway on the restoration plan, which is expected to be done in April 15, right in the middle of April. Yes, there's property damage and business interruption, but that will take a little while to work through right. But we notified them. They've been working through it with on the process as we've been going in terms of demolition and the reconstruction of it. No."

And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's President and CEO.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm joined this morning by Alberto Fornaro, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Home Retail; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.  Just a few weeks ago, we hosted our comprehensive Investor Day. Since then, we have had the opportunity to speak with many of you in detail about our strategic plan, which will position us as the leading energy consumer services company and create tremendous stakeholder value. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters. But for this call, we will keep our remarks brief and focus on our quarterly results.  Turning to Slide 3. I would like to start with the 3 key messages for today's call. Our integrated platform delivered strong results during the second quarter, up 14% compared to the same period last year. And today, we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance ranges.  Next, following Winter Storm Uri, the Governor and Texas legislature acted swiftly to begin to address critical issues and improve grid reliability. The Public Utility and Railroad Commissions are now in the process of implementing these directives to strengthen both the electric and natural gas systems to improve reliability and protect customers. I want to thank the Governor and the Texas legislature for their leadership on these issues.  Finally, in June, we held our Investor Day focused on our long-term strategic outlook, our road map through 2025 and the compelling value proposition of our consumer platform.  Now moving to the financial and operational results for the quarter on Slide 4, beginning on the left-hand side of the slide. We again delivered top decile safety performance. This is the ninth straight quarter we have achieved top decile safety, an incredible accomplishment for the entire company. As we start to come back to the office, we will continue to adhere to the CDC guidelines to ensure the safety and well-being of our people.  During the quarter, we continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives with focus on integrating Direct Energy, advancing our capital-light decarbonization efforts and expanding our secondary product capabilities.  Starting with the Direct Energy integration. Through the second quarter, we achieved $89 million in synergies or 2/3 of our 2021 target. Today, we're reaffirming both, the 2021 and full plan targets. Next, we continue to perfect our customer-centric model through advancing noncore asset sales and retirements and expanding our renewable PPA strategy across all of our markets.  Moving to the right-hand side of the slide. We are reporting $656 million of adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter or 14% growth year-on-year and $1.223 billion or 33% growth year-to-date. Strong second quarter results were largely driven by the Direct Energy acquisition and favorable weather in the East, further demonstrating the value of our diversified platform of consumer services. Alberto will discuss in more detail the quarterly drivers in his section.  Turning to Slide 5 for a brief update on our core markets, beginning on the left-hand side of the slide. Following Winter Storm Uri in February, it was clear that market reforms were necessary to improve grid resilience. In the months following the event, we actively engaged in discussions with legislators, regulators and other market participants to introduce comprehensive and competitive solutions across the entire system to address areas that failed and to ensure an event like this does not happen again. The Texas legislature acted swiftly in addressing these issues, passing Senate Bills 2 and 3, which were signed into law by the Governor on June 8, focused on reliability from the wellhead to the lightbulb. Importantly, Senate Bill 3 provides the Public Utility Commission, Railroad Commission and other parties the tools and the need to get it done right.  The PUCT and ERCOT are now working to implement the power market portions of the reform. We are focused on supporting them in the implementation of these policies and procedures to ensure the market functions properly in the future. We expect the focus over coming months to be on improving price formation through mechanisms to incentivize reliability. It will also establish clear winterization and maintenance outage standards and protocols for the electric system.  Importantly, the PUCT is focused on customer bills and ensuring these actions do not materially impact affordability, which has been a compelling attribute of living and doing business in Texas. We believe that PUCT will be able to address the key issues of market design, system hardening and modernization this year for the power sector.  Next, moving to the bottom left-hand side of the slide. The Governor and legislature recognized the financial harm of socializing the cost of defaults by regulated entities like Brazos and Rayburn across competitive markets. The legislation also addresses unhedgeable costs due to ERCOT's management of the grid, particularly during the final 32 hours of the event. The Texas legislature passed and the Governor signed into law necessary securitizations to address both default allocations and uplift charges. We expect to have greater line of sight on our costs eligible for securitization later this year.  Finally, our expected net financial impact from Winter Storm Uri remains unchanged at $500 million to $700 million. From last quarter, our gross impact increased by $85 million primarily due to resettlements and bad debt, which we expect to be fully offset through our mitigation strategy.  Moving to the right-hand side of the slide for an update on our ongoing portfolio and real estate optimization efforts. First, during the quarter, PJM held its first capacity auction in roughly 3 years, which provided disappointing results. Subsequently, given market conditions, we announced our intention to retire 1.6 gigawatts or 55% of our PJM coal generation by 2022 and the strategic review of our remaining PJM portfolio.  Next, our previously announced 4.8-gigawatt asset sale remains on track to close in the fourth quarter. Finally, our portfolio repositioning and optimization is a continuous process. We are committed to our business model, and we'll continue to provide updates on our progress.  On the next two slides, I want to review some of the highlights from our Investor Day, beginning on Slide 6 with our strategy and platform. This was our first Investor Day since 2018. And in 3 short years, we underwent a significant transformation: doubling the number of customers we serve, optimizing our generation fleet to serve our customers, building an efficient operating platform and strengthening our balance sheet while returning significant excess cash to our shareholders.  The acquisition of Direct Energy in January marked the next step in our journey as we completed the 3-year transformation plan and began our decisive transition into a consumer services company. While historically, our core product has been electricity, the addition of Direct Energy brought scale to our retail natural gas and services businesses. With consumers increasingly seeking a trusted partner to provide home solutions, our advantaged consumer platform is uniquely positioned to meet our customer needs in ways other providers cannot match. Just yesterday, Green Mountain Energy filed an application to provide its 100 renewable electric product in Arizona. We're constantly on the lookout for new markets and to grow our service offering in existing ones.  As we offer adjacent products and services, we can leverage our existing platform to access cost synergies. This economic advantage, coupled with better insights and more personalization, result in a better experience for our customers. For NRG, this advantage means broader insights into how consumers interact with their homes, additional margin and better retention on our core product. And then the cycle repeats as we grow, creating a more valuable business.  As you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, we have provided you a road map of our strategic priorities through 2025. Over the near term, our focus is on optimizing our core, which includes integrating Direct Energy, decarbonizing our retail supply and expanding our current dual-fuel customer base. Next, beginning in 2022, our focus will shift to growing the core through residential power and home services. Finally, throughout this entire period, we will be returning significant capital to shareholders.  To summarize our road map, we're starting with our foundation as a best-in-class integrated energy retailer. We will leverage our operating platform to become a trusted partner for power services, and then we will broaden our offerings and partnerships to become a provider of select home services.  Finally, we have quantified for you what I believe is an achievable growth opportunity over the course of this strategic road map. In total, we have identified $720 million of incremental EBITDA growth opportunity, which will be achieved through the Direct Energy integration and the deployment of up to $2 billion of growth investments in both CapEx and OpEx opportunities. This capital will be deployed to the maximum return opportunity, and you can expect transparency as we begin to allocate investment dollars. Given our near-term focus on integrating Direct Energy and growing dual-fuel customers, you should expect this capital to be weighted towards the second half of our road map.  Now turning to Slide 7. Over the course of our strategic road map, we expect to generate $8 billion in cumulative excess cash, which also excludes roughly $0.5 billion dollars of excess cash still to be allocated this year. Applying our 50-50 capital allocation framework, resulting $4 billion returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and $4 billion for opportunistic growth, we have earmarked $2 billion to achieve the $520 million incremental EBITDA detailed on the prior slide. The remaining $2 billion is available to be allocated to the maximum return opportunity, whether it be growth investments or share repurchases.  In summary, we outlined a compelling value proposition, anchored by a portfolio of favor brands serving nearly 6 million customers. We are positioned to grow and leverage our existing operating platform to achieve higher margins and longer-tenure customers. We have the financial flexibility to invest capital at attractive returns while returning significant capital to shareholders. And we have the right people and the right platform to create sustainable value for all stakeholders.  So with that, I want to welcome Alberto Fornaro to the call and provide a brief introduction. Alberto joined NRG on June 1, following an extensive CFO search. Alberto is a seasoned finance expert who brings over 30 years of experience and a unique combination of consumer, technology, manufacturing and risk management experience. I believe Alberto's expertise is the ideal feed to enhance our transition into a consumer services company.  Alberto, welcome, and I will turn it over to you for the financial review.\nAlberto Fornaro: Thank you, Mauricio, for your kind words, and good morning, everyone. I am excited to be with you this morning and to join NRG during its transformation to become a consumer services company.  Now more than ever, customer experience and engagement are key priorities for leading companies, and I feel fortunate to be part of an organization that is completely focusing on the customer to continue to grow. I look forward to the dialogue with our analysts and investment community over the months to come. Hopefully, we will be able to meet in person sometime in the near future.  Moving to the quarterly results, I will now turn to Slide 9 for a brief review of our financials. For the quarter, NRG delivered $656 million in adjusted EBITDA or $82 million higher than the second quarter of last year. The increase in consolidated earnings was driven by the acquisition of Direct Energy and the related addition of synergies achieved in Q2.  Specifically, by region, these benefited from the expected contribution from the Direct Energy acquisition. In addition, favorable weather resulted in outperformance by both our electric and natural gas businesses. Finally, we enjoyed favorable intra-year timing of demand response revenues.  Next, our Texas region partially offset these benefits due to lower residential demand driven by milder weather and return-to-work trends as well as to higher retail supply costs. As a reminder, we benefited last year from exceptionally low market power prices realized during the start of the COVID-driven economic shutdown.  On a year-to-date basis, our progress in terms of incremental profitability was even more significant. It demonstrates the value of our diversified consumer services platform and its ability to absorb the possible impact of headwinds, such as the current forced outage we are dealing with at Limestone Unit 1, which will extend until year-end.  Our expectation for the net impact from Winter Storm Uri remains at $500 million to $700 million with an $85 million increase in onetime costs, offset by a similar increase in the range of expected mitigants. This is primarily due to the positive development of the Texas securitization legislation during the quarter. The total negative cash impact is still expected to be $350 million to $550 million in 2021 and $150 million in 2022 due to the estimated bill credits on to large commercial and industrial customers.  Now turning to Direct Energy integration. We are confirming our goal to achieve a run rate of $300 million synergies by 2023. We are on track to achieve $135 million of synergies for 2021 with $89 million realized year-to-date. Synergy expectations as well as synergies achieved so far are fully embedded, respectively, in our 2021 guidance and year-to-date actuals.  Overall, we are off to a great start in the first half of the year, and we are reaffirming guidance at $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion for adjusted EBITDA and $1.44 billion to $1.64 billion for free cash flow before growth.  I will now turn to Slide 10 where we are updating our planned 2021 capital allocation. As in the past, our practice on this slide is to highlight changes from last quarter in blue. Starting from the left, on the third column, the net capital required for the Direct Energy acquisition was increased by $35 million based on the latest estimate of the post-closing working capital adjustments. We anticipate finalizing the working capital adjustments during the third quarter.  Moving to the next column, and as discussed on the previous slide, the midpoint for net estimated cash impact from Winter Storm Uri remains at $450 million. This includes the increase of $85 million for onetime costs in 2021 and similar increase in expected mitigants driven primarily by the latest Texas legislation. As you are aware, the much anticipated securitization bills, HB4492 and SB1580, have been approved and are being finalized by ERCOT and PUCT. Clarity about the expected completion should come later this year.  Moving to the next column. To achieve a 3.0 net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, we expect to deleverage by $255 million plus early reduction fee of $9 million, totaling $2,264 million of capital to be allocated. This leaves $461 million of remaining capital available for allocation. A large portion of this capital is dependent on the successful conclusion of the ERCOT securitization processes.  Finally, as a reminder, today, the capital allocation waterfall does not include the impact from our pending 4.8-gigawatt asset sale, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Net cash proceeds will be utilized partly for debt reduction, $500 million to maintain leverage neutrality and the remaining $100 million to $150 million after purchase price adjustments to be available for general capital allocation.  Finally, on Slide 11. After reducing our corporate debt balance for the expected 2021 debt reimbursement and for the minimum cash, our 2021 net debt balance will be approximately $7.9 billion, which when based at the midpoint of the adjusted EBITDA implies a ratio of 3.0 net debt to adjusted EBITDA.  As discussed during the Investor Day, given our growth profile, we have revised our time line to achieve investment-grade metrics of 2.5 to 2.75x net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. We plan on achieving a stronger 3.0 ratio by year-end to 2021 and growing into our longer-term targets of 2.5 to 2.75 ratio by 2023 primarily through the full realization of Direct Energy run rate earnings.  We remain committed to a strong balance sheet and to achieve credit metrics aligned with an investment-grade rating. We are very comfortable in achieving our target and are continuing to maintain a constructive dialogue with the rating agencies.  Back to you, Mauricio.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Alberto. Turning to Slide 13, I want to provide a few closing thoughts on today's presentation.  During the quarter, we made significant progress on our priorities: integrating Direct Energy, perfecting and growing our platform and executing disciplined capital allocation. NRG has never been stronger. We have the stability and financial flexibility to thrive and take advantage of opportunities through all market cycles. At our Investor Day, we outlined for you the tremendous opportunity to deliver value for shareholders, and I have never been more excited about the future of this company. I look forward to updating you on our progress along the way.  So with that, Ray, we'll open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Just in brief, if you can comment on the nuclear -- federal nuclear efforts, perhaps the best way to define, you can comment on that just in brief, and what that might mean for your specific opportunities here, if you don't mind.\nMauricio Gutierrez: I'm sorry, Julien, you were breaking up a little bit. Are you talking about the nuclear PTC?\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Exactly. Indeed. And what that might be at the federal level for your asset.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Right. Well, I mean the -- so first, let me just say that in terms of regional or market-specific, out-of-market subsidies, whether it's for nuclear or any other technology, we'd rather see competitive incentives in our respective markets. Now having said that, if there is a national PTC, obviously, that changes our perspective. We will look at participating that through our South Texas project facility down in Texas. And obviously, that has a positive impact on our -- on that particular asset.  So that's how I would think about the national PTC, but I need to highlight the national aspect of it. I mean I think if it's just regional, it creates a lot of dynamics, intra markets that are not necessarily in the best interest of competitive markets.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Indeed. Just wanted to get your perspective on that. And if you don't mind, perhaps a bigger-picture question here. Can you comment on the commodity backdrop here? I mean I just -- there's been a lot of movement in the various forward curve. Obviously, your position is not always obvious from a net short or net loan perspective, depending on the specific market. Can you comment a little bit on the overall position today as you think about the later dated years and just how that positions you against the target you articulated earlier?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Sure, Julien. I mean as I tried to highlight in the past, our integrated platform really has reduced exposure to the underlying commodity prices. Whether it is increasing in natural gas, which we have seen or increasing in power prices, this tends to affect all market participants, all retail providers. So to some extent, all these increasing commodity prices can be passed through to customers. It's not that it's just affecting us or affecting somebody else.  I will say that given the addition of the natural gas business with the acquisition of Direct Energy, that actually has been very complementary, and it highlights the strength of the diversified portfolio. I mean in the East, if you look at it, it's actually even more noticeable. If gas prices are increasing, perhaps that has some impact on -- in the near term on our power business, but it has actually a benefit on our natural gas business, which is incredibly sizable. So that's why I think investors need to think about our business is somewhat insulated from increases in commodity prices.  Now I don't know, Chris, if you have any comments around just the direction of the price move and what to expect as I think I already addressed the impact on our portfolio.\nChristopher Moser: Yes. The only thing I would add is, I mean, look, gas has been strong because there's a lot of increased demand out there, right? LNG is going crazy overseas with Europe on bid against Asia, that's driving things up. I think that the U.S. just recently became the largest exporter of LNG in the world, passing Australia, which is a hell of a thing. I haven't seen that before. Storage is low right now.  So yes, we're in a bit of an upcycle right here. But like Mauricio said, it's something that we can price in, right? So if we're pricing to our customers off of the curves that we see and we're covering it off of the curves as they happen or off of our generation, we're in a good spot where we tack on the margin, move on our merry way.  So I think Mauricio is right. The integrated platform is a great way to play this, whether it's an upcycle or downcycle.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. And just the last quick clarification, if you don't mind. Are you confident with respect to the transition? I know we're still early right after your Analyst Day here. But just with respect to some of the early indications on a strategic pivot on the retail side, any level of comments you can offer? I know it's -- forgetting that as a little bit early here.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Okay. Julien, I want to understand your question. I mean any confidence on our people to...\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Just early planning as you think about executing against the full $700 million uplift.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Okay. Got it. So I mean we are very confident on that. And actually, we have already started a number of initiatives both on power services and home services. But as I said, I mean our #1 priority right now, and I want to be unequivocal about it, is integrating Direct Energy and achieving the $300 million of synergies. That's the least path resistance to value, and we're focused on that. Then we're going to look at the low-hanging fruit opportunities like optimizing our dual-fuel customers. We have good visibility on them. We want our power customers to buy natural gas, and we want our natural gas customers to buy power. So the cost of acquisition is actually pretty compelling.  And then -- and I think that would be the focus for the rest of 2021 and in 2022. You need to think about those opportunities on power and home services as we are testing and learning right now. And if we think that the opportunity is very attractive, then we will accelerate the scale up. If it's not, then we will kill it quickly.  But I expect that most of that investment will happen in the second half of our planning period towards, let's say, '23 and beyond. But we're very, very excited. We actually have a pilot program right now on home solar, which is very exciting, and we're learning a lot about what customers want. So we are waiting -- we're not waiting. We're starting these initiatives. We're very small, deploying very little capital, and -- but we're learning a whole lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.\nJames Kennedy: It's actually James for Shar. Congrats on the results. I just had a few housekeeping questions on the quarter. Can we just unpack the February impact shifts a little bit more? It looks like the buckets moved around $85 million. On the growth side, what's the breakdown there between resettlement and bad debt? And then just on the mitigation side, is that entirely securitization recovery assumption?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes. So as Alberto mentioned, buckets moved a little. On a gross basis, it moved by $85 million. I mean the majority of it is just resettlements. And I would say 70%, 30% between resettlements and then 30% bad debt. So we feel very confident with the -- now with the clarity that we have around securitization that we're going to be able to offset that.  So net-net, there is no change in the impact of the -- of Winter Storm Uri. Although, as I've mentioned before, I mean things are going to move a little bit up and down. It just happened also in this quarter, but we have the upcoming 180-day settlement and -- just in a couple of weeks, and we're monitoring that. But I actually think that that's going to be very small. But nonetheless, I mean I expect things to move just a little bit, whether it's up or down. But now that we have this visibility on the securitization, it just gives me a lot of comfort to maintain the range that we have.\nJames Kennedy: Got you. And then just on the PJM strategic review, could you provide any guidance on the time line for the balance of the fleet?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Well, I mean just to take a little bit of a step back because I think it's -- context is important here. So when you look at the PJM fleet, you're really talking about the Midwest generation fleet. I mean that's the lion's share of it. And as we have quantified for you in the past, I mean that's about 5% of our earnings. So it's important just to put the context and the magnitude of that.  I think everybody has seen the auction results. They were very disappointing. That basically resulted in the announcement of 50% of our coal fleet, the retirement -- the announced retirements of 50% of our coal fleet. I think given the changes in capacity prices in PJM, it's just prudent that we do a deep dive review of the rest of the portfolio. It's ongoing at this point, and we're looking at everything in terms of reliability, if they're needed for reliability, what are the development prospects. I mean we're looking at just about everything for that -- on that strategic review. And I'll -- as we progress, I'll keep you all updated, but that's where we are.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Lapides: Couple of things. First of all, the biggest investor concern about NRG is your short position in Texas, meaning the fact you don't have as much generation as you might have retail load. How do you anticipate changing your disclosures going forward to help get people comfortable with the short position, meaning whether you'll outline PPAs you have or tolling agreements or the hedging of future demand simply because -- while I doubt there's going to be another Uri, I'm not so -- I'm not a weatherman, so I can't predict it, but I kind of doubt it.  But there will be weather events, summer and winter, down the road, maybe not as violent as Uri, but they'll happen. The Grid just a couple of weeks ago was actually forecasting one in Texas. And clearly, the short exposure is the single biggest risk outstanding for NRG. So how do you plan on changing your disclosure going forward about your long or short position as a mix of contracting physical assets and other hedging?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Right. Well, Michael, and let me just be clear here. NRG doesn't have a short position. When I talk about running an integrated model, every megawatt that we are selling to our customers, we're back to backing, whether it is with own generation or whether it is contracting generation in the market or just buying on the open wholesale market. So I want to be clear, Michael, because I think that is a misconception of NRG. We are not short electricity. We're not short of products that we're selling to our customers. We back-to-back them all. So that will be the first point.  The second point is, we don't have to own every single megawatt that we have. I mean that is -- we can actually achieve the same attributes of owning generation by contracting them. We have a number of renewable PPAs that we have. We contract with other counterparties. And whether it is a tolling deal or some physical transaction, we can actually bind the open market in the forwards. So I mean there is a number of things.  I would say that the biggest lesson coming from Winter Storm Uri is the diversification of our supply. If I own 1 big power plant, and you will basically say, \"Okay. Well, now they're not short.\" That big -- that 1 power plant will be a single point of failure. That's what we're trying to avoid. That was the big lesson from Winter Storm Uri.  So I actually feel a lot more comfortable that we have a best-in-class commercial team that is looking at sourcing those megawatts from our power plants, from other people's power plants and from the open market. That is the best strategy that we have. And if we can do it in a capital-light way that frees off our cash and maintains the strong free cash flow to EBITDA ratio that we have, the better.  So that's how I think about it, Michael. But this notion that you're describing that somehow, the biggest risk is the short position of NRG, I just don't share that same view.\nMichael Lapides: Right. But can I follow up on that real quick? Just -- I'm going to try and keep it simple. Do you have enough megawatt hours of your own generation or under multiyear contracts to meet expected peak demand, summer and winter?\nMauricio Gutierrez: I mean every -- we do. That's what this balancing -- running a balanced portfolio is -- now I expect the commercial team when we go into the shorter term to position the -- our -- to adjust our position based on their -- sometimes based on their commodity, based on weather, based on prices. But you're talking about optimization around the edge, not necessarily a position going forward.  So I mean if you're asking me, do we have enough megawatts? I would say yes. On a nameplate capacity, our portfolio is sufficient to cover just as much of the network that we sell. But that's not what we're trying to do. What we're trying to do is optimize our supply to make sure that we put the position -- we have the company positioned in the best possible way given where we think the market is.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research.\nKeith Stanley: First, on capital allocation, would you expect the $461 million of cash available from the slide to be fully allocated this year? Or is it more likely a good chunk of that gets pushed to next year just because you need the cash back from the year you offset still?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes. Keith, I think -- I mean I'll -- well, first of all, we allocate capital when we actually have the cash available to us. So while we have created some financial flexibility given the changes that we did on the glide path to achieve our investment-grade credit metrics, they are still underpinned by when we're going to receive the money from the Uri mitigation plan; and then secondly, from the sale of our Eastern California asset.  So those are the 2 big triggers. As soon as we have that excess cash, I am going to apply our capital allocation principles. I expect to provide all of you another update on the third quarter call, and I expect these money to start coming in towards the fourth quarter.  So as we have always done in the past, and I don't think this should be a surprise to anybody, we allocate that excess cash when we actually have the cash. And that's how I -- that's how you should think about just in terms of timing, Keith.\nKeith Stanley: Got it. The second question, just can you give an update? Curious how retail margins sort of ignoring the changes in power prices, if you can isolate it, just how retail margins are tracking after the shakeout from the winter storm. Are you seeing less competition in the Texas market given the volatility event? Or just any comment on trends in margins.\nMauricio Gutierrez: I think margins have been relatively stable. As we -- even though the winter storm was pretty impactful, particularly on the regulated side, but also on the unregulated. Many of the retail providers have either credit sleeves or back-to-back. So we saw just a handful of people being exposed to the open market, and I think they fell through the process. But they were the minimum number of participants. I wouldn't say that there was a big number of participants that were under tremendous stress on the retail side. So margins have been relatively stable. The competition is still out there, similar to what we have seen in the past.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold from Vertical Research.\nJonathan Arnold: Can I just ask on the mitigation, the storm Uri? Did -- has any of that been realized already? Or is it all still to come?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Most of it will -- is still to come. I mean as you know, the securitization process is still ongoing while they pass the law. What we expect is in August to -- we're going to have a hearing. And then in October, we need to have an order that is going to define how they're going to allocate those -- that money. So I expect that by October, we'll have even more line of sight in terms of the allocation methodology. And so that will be on the securitization.  And then on the other two, the bad debt is a continuous process. And then I think everybody knows that in the heat recall option that we had, I mean that's going to take a little bit more time given the legal route that we're taking.\nJonathan Arnold: Okay. Great. And then on just -- on a -- looking forward and just thinking about some of the new targets and the strategy laid out at the Analyst Day, should we anticipate that you will start to provide sort of more disclosure around sort of the granularity between different types of customers, single fuel, dual fuel, et cetera, and just some ways to start tracking your performance on that plan over time? And then if so, when do you think we might start to see some of that kind of incremental disclosure?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes. No. That's an excellent point, Jonathan. And as I said to you before, we're going to be increasing our disclosures. We're actually working on it right now given the strategic update that we provided to all of you just a month ago.  So I think what you should expect to see is transparency and visibility in terms of how we go from the margin that we have today to the margin that we want to have in 2025, the steps that we're taking. We're going to have conversations around the different initiatives to deploy the $2 billion of capital. We're in the test-and-learn period right now. But as we start scaling up in any of these initiatives, we will have a conversation with all of you ahead of time in terms of what the opportunity -- quantifying the opportunity, what is the capital that is required and what is the EBITDA associated to it.  So there is a lot more disclosures to come both in terms of the $2 billion of capital deployment that we expect and the opportunity that, that represents, but also the makeup of our portfolio around customers, what we're seeing around the longevity of these customers in our portfolio.\nJonathan Arnold: Mauricio, do you see those as something that will be sort of part of the regular kind of quarterly cycle when you get to that or more something you'll do once a year or so or something like that?\nMauricio Gutierrez: No. My goal, we'll make it part of the quarterly updates. And I think that, in earnest, will come probably towards the end of the year and start the new year with fresh financials. We're already working on it now. And I think you should expect a -- more disclosures as we go into 2022.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global.\nAngie Storozynski: I was actually about to ask a similar question about disclosures. It seems to me at least that the business has become a bit of a black box for all of us. I don't think that we really appreciate some exposure to gas margins and hence, some increased seasonality of Direct Energy, especially. So we would definitely appreciate the disclosures.  And again, I did hear Mauricio's comments about the fact that you guys are not short power. So I understand that at least in the long term. But how can you reconcile the movement in forward power curves and the fact that you are relying on market-based purchases of power on your medium-term margins on the retail side? I mean I understand that you match your contracts with -- in the market purchases, but I don't think that that's -- it's possible to time it just right.  So again, directionally, explain how the move in forward curves should have impacted your retail margins.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Sure, Angie. So I mean I think you need to make the distinction between customers that are on their fixed price. And the customers that are on their fixed price, we back-to-back that. So the minute we sign a customer under fixed price, we have the supply, we lock in the margin. And that is very simple. I mean we price every customer based on the forward curve. So I don't think that doesn't create any exposure.  Perhaps you're talking about the variable rates, the month-to-month, and whether or not we can buy that. But keep in mind, I mean a variable rate is exactly that. You have the ability to change the price if the underlying commodity price in the market changes. So that's why I was saying, we have the ability to pass through some of these costs.  And we're not the only ones exposed to it. Every single retail energy provider, electric provider, each is exposed to these changes in power prices. So it's not like this puts us in a disadvantage. I mean it impacts the supply cost of all retail electric providers. So you would expect a similar -- a move to offset that increase. That's why I'd say, I still don't understand this concept around why some investors or some of you think that we're short power.  I mean having a variable price customer allows us to change prices. Whether it's up or down, if prices are coming down, perhaps we can move the customers' pricing down. But if prices rise, we can do the same. So in the medium term -- when you're talking about the medium term, I'm assuming you're talking about 12 to 18 months. I mean that's plenty of time to take price actions. And that's what we have done in the past. We consistently see that. So that's how I think about the exposure.  And on the fixed price, it's -- we always do it back-to-back. So I'm not concerned about fixed price customers that go multiyear, particularly for C&I customers.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And then just one last follow-up on capital allocation. So I mean I'm really glad to see that you will be restarting your share buyback program. Now is that in any way implicitly stating that your investment-grade rating is sort of delayed inherently given the Uri storm? And as such, there is no point in trying to delever as quickly as possible, hence, you have some more flexibility? Because, again, I would have expected that you're going to try to go back to that, say, 2.5 to 2.75 net debt to EBITDA as quickly as possible. And clearly, buybacks are not going to help with this.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Well, I mean I think what we said is, we have adjusted our life path to the 2.5 to 2.75. We haven't changed our targets of investment-grade credit metrics. We changed just the trajectory on how to get there. And that was informed by our conversations with rating agencies in the aftermath of Winter Storm Uri.  So it's very consistent with the conversations that we have with rating agencies. I don't control the credit rating timing. That's not on us. That's on the rating agencies. We believe that 3x is a strong -- a very strong balance sheet, but we still are targeting 2.5 to 2.75. But given this change in glide path, it has provided some financial flexibility to -- if we have excess cash, which we anticipate to have by the end of the year, then we will allocate that through the guidance and principles that are very transparent and that we have communicated to all of you.  So that's how I expect to start allocating this excess cash, which includes share buybacks towards the end of the year when we start having some excess cash, but I mean that's going to be contingent on when do we close the asset sale and when do we start seeing the money from the Uri mitigants.\nOperator: That is all the time we have for questions. I will now pass the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez for closing remarks.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Great. Thank you. Well, thank you for your interest in NRG and look forward to continue updating you in this exciting new opportunity and phase for NRG. Thank you, everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mauricio Gutierrez",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm joined this morning by Alberto Fornaro, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Home Retail; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.  Just a few weeks ago, we hosted our comprehensive Investor Day. Since then, we have had the opportunity to speak with many of you in detail about our strategic plan, which will position us as the leading energy consumer services company and create tremendous stakeholder value. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters. But for this call, we will keep our remarks brief and focus on our quarterly results.  Turning to Slide 3. I would like to start with the 3 key messages for today's call. Our integrated platform delivered strong results during the second quarter, up 14% compared to the same period last year. And today, we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance ranges.  Next, following Winter Storm Uri, the Governor and Texas legislature acted swiftly to begin to address critical issues and improve grid reliability. The Public Utility and Railroad Commissions are now in the process of implementing these directives to strengthen both the electric and natural gas systems to improve reliability and protect customers. I want to thank the Governor and the Texas legislature for their leadership on these issues.  Finally, in June, we held our Investor Day focused on our long-term strategic outlook, our road map through 2025 and the compelling value proposition of our consumer platform.  Now moving to the financial and operational results for the quarter on Slide 4, beginning on the left-hand side of the slide. We again delivered top decile safety performance. This is the ninth straight quarter we have achieved top decile safety, an incredible accomplishment for the entire company. As we start to come back to the office, we will continue to adhere to the CDC guidelines to ensure the safety and well-being of our people.  During the quarter, we continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives with focus on integrating Direct Energy, advancing our capital-light decarbonization efforts and expanding our secondary product capabilities.  Starting with the Direct Energy integration. Through the second quarter, we achieved $89 million in synergies or 2/3 of our 2021 target. Today, we're reaffirming both, the 2021 and full plan targets. Next, we continue to perfect our customer-centric model through advancing noncore asset sales and retirements and expanding our renewable PPA strategy across all of our markets.  Moving to the right-hand side of the slide. We are reporting $656 million of adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter or 14% growth year-on-year and $1.223 billion or 33% growth year-to-date. Strong second quarter results were largely driven by the Direct Energy acquisition and favorable weather in the East, further demonstrating the value of our diversified platform of consumer services. Alberto will discuss in more detail the quarterly drivers in his section.  Turning to Slide 5 for a brief update on our core markets, beginning on the left-hand side of the slide. Following Winter Storm Uri in February, it was clear that market reforms were necessary to improve grid resilience. In the months following the event, we actively engaged in discussions with legislators, regulators and other market participants to introduce comprehensive and competitive solutions across the entire system to address areas that failed and to ensure an event like this does not happen again. The Texas legislature acted swiftly in addressing these issues, passing Senate Bills 2 and 3, which were signed into law by the Governor on June 8, focused on reliability from the wellhead to the lightbulb. Importantly, Senate Bill 3 provides the Public Utility Commission, Railroad Commission and other parties the tools and the need to get it done right.  The PUCT and ERCOT are now working to implement the power market portions of the reform. We are focused on supporting them in the implementation of these policies and procedures to ensure the market functions properly in the future. We expect the focus over coming months to be on improving price formation through mechanisms to incentivize reliability. It will also establish clear winterization and maintenance outage standards and protocols for the electric system.  Importantly, the PUCT is focused on customer bills and ensuring these actions do not materially impact affordability, which has been a compelling attribute of living and doing business in Texas. We believe that PUCT will be able to address the key issues of market design, system hardening and modernization this year for the power sector.  Next, moving to the bottom left-hand side of the slide. The Governor and legislature recognized the financial harm of socializing the cost of defaults by regulated entities like Brazos and Rayburn across competitive markets. The legislation also addresses unhedgeable costs due to ERCOT's management of the grid, particularly during the final 32 hours of the event. The Texas legislature passed and the Governor signed into law necessary securitizations to address both default allocations and uplift charges. We expect to have greater line of sight on our costs eligible for securitization later this year.  Finally, our expected net financial impact from Winter Storm Uri remains unchanged at $500 million to $700 million. From last quarter, our gross impact increased by $85 million primarily due to resettlements and bad debt, which we expect to be fully offset through our mitigation strategy.  Moving to the right-hand side of the slide for an update on our ongoing portfolio and real estate optimization efforts. First, during the quarter, PJM held its first capacity auction in roughly 3 years, which provided disappointing results. Subsequently, given market conditions, we announced our intention to retire 1.6 gigawatts or 55% of our PJM coal generation by 2022 and the strategic review of our remaining PJM portfolio.  Next, our previously announced 4.8-gigawatt asset sale remains on track to close in the fourth quarter. Finally, our portfolio repositioning and optimization is a continuous process. We are committed to our business model, and we'll continue to provide updates on our progress.  On the next two slides, I want to review some of the highlights from our Investor Day, beginning on Slide 6 with our strategy and platform. This was our first Investor Day since 2018. And in 3 short years, we underwent a significant transformation: doubling the number of customers we serve, optimizing our generation fleet to serve our customers, building an efficient operating platform and strengthening our balance sheet while returning significant excess cash to our shareholders.  The acquisition of Direct Energy in January marked the next step in our journey as we completed the 3-year transformation plan and began our decisive transition into a consumer services company. While historically, our core product has been electricity, the addition of Direct Energy brought scale to our retail natural gas and services businesses. With consumers increasingly seeking a trusted partner to provide home solutions, our advantaged consumer platform is uniquely positioned to meet our customer needs in ways other providers cannot match. Just yesterday, Green Mountain Energy filed an application to provide its 100 renewable electric product in Arizona. We're constantly on the lookout for new markets and to grow our service offering in existing ones.  As we offer adjacent products and services, we can leverage our existing platform to access cost synergies. This economic advantage, coupled with better insights and more personalization, result in a better experience for our customers. For NRG, this advantage means broader insights into how consumers interact with their homes, additional margin and better retention on our core product. And then the cycle repeats as we grow, creating a more valuable business.  As you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, we have provided you a road map of our strategic priorities through 2025. Over the near term, our focus is on optimizing our core, which includes integrating Direct Energy, decarbonizing our retail supply and expanding our current dual-fuel customer base. Next, beginning in 2022, our focus will shift to growing the core through residential power and home services. Finally, throughout this entire period, we will be returning significant capital to shareholders.  To summarize our road map, we're starting with our foundation as a best-in-class integrated energy retailer. We will leverage our operating platform to become a trusted partner for power services, and then we will broaden our offerings and partnerships to become a provider of select home services.  Finally, we have quantified for you what I believe is an achievable growth opportunity over the course of this strategic road map. In total, we have identified $720 million of incremental EBITDA growth opportunity, which will be achieved through the Direct Energy integration and the deployment of up to $2 billion of growth investments in both CapEx and OpEx opportunities. This capital will be deployed to the maximum return opportunity, and you can expect transparency as we begin to allocate investment dollars. Given our near-term focus on integrating Direct Energy and growing dual-fuel customers, you should expect this capital to be weighted towards the second half of our road map.  Now turning to Slide 7. Over the course of our strategic road map, we expect to generate $8 billion in cumulative excess cash, which also excludes roughly $0.5 billion dollars of excess cash still to be allocated this year. Applying our 50-50 capital allocation framework, resulting $4 billion returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and $4 billion for opportunistic growth, we have earmarked $2 billion to achieve the $520 million incremental EBITDA detailed on the prior slide. The remaining $2 billion is available to be allocated to the maximum return opportunity, whether it be growth investments or share repurchases.  In summary, we outlined a compelling value proposition, anchored by a portfolio of favor brands serving nearly 6 million customers. We are positioned to grow and leverage our existing operating platform to achieve higher margins and longer-tenure customers. We have the financial flexibility to invest capital at attractive returns while returning significant capital to shareholders. And we have the right people and the right platform to create sustainable value for all stakeholders.  So with that, I want to welcome Alberto Fornaro to the call and provide a brief introduction. Alberto joined NRG on June 1, following an extensive CFO search. Alberto is a seasoned finance expert who brings over 30 years of experience and a unique combination of consumer, technology, manufacturing and risk management experience. I believe Alberto's expertise is the ideal feed to enhance our transition into a consumer services company.  Alberto, welcome, and I will turn it over to you for the financial review. Thank you, Alberto. Turning to Slide 13, I want to provide a few closing thoughts on today's presentation.  During the quarter, we made significant progress on our priorities: integrating Direct Energy, perfecting and growing our platform and executing disciplined capital allocation. NRG has never been stronger. We have the stability and financial flexibility to thrive and take advantage of opportunities through all market cycles. At our Investor Day, we outlined for you the tremendous opportunity to deliver value for shareholders, and I have never been more excited about the future of this company. I look forward to updating you on our progress along the way.  So with that, Ray, we'll open the line for questions. I'm sorry, Julien, you were breaking up a little bit. Are you talking about the nuclear PTC? Right. Well, I mean the -- so first, let me just say that in terms of regional or market-specific, out-of-market subsidies, whether it's for nuclear or any other technology, we'd rather see competitive incentives in our respective markets. Now having said that, if there is a national PTC, obviously, that changes our perspective. We will look at participating that through our South Texas project facility down in Texas. And obviously, that has a positive impact on our -- on that particular asset.  So that's how I would think about the national PTC, but I need to highlight the national aspect of it. I mean I think if it's just regional, it creates a lot of dynamics, intra markets that are not necessarily in the best interest of competitive markets. Sure, Julien. I mean as I tried to highlight in the past, our integrated platform really has reduced exposure to the underlying commodity prices. Whether it is increasing in natural gas, which we have seen or increasing in power prices, this tends to affect all market participants, all retail providers. So to some extent, all these increasing commodity prices can be passed through to customers. It's not that it's just affecting us or affecting somebody else.  I will say that given the addition of the natural gas business with the acquisition of Direct Energy, that actually has been very complementary, and it highlights the strength of the diversified portfolio. I mean in the East, if you look at it, it's actually even more noticeable. If gas prices are increasing, perhaps that has some impact on -- in the near term on our power business, but it has actually a benefit on our natural gas business, which is incredibly sizable. So that's why I think investors need to think about our business is somewhat insulated from increases in commodity prices.  Now I don't know, Chris, if you have any comments around just the direction of the price move and what to expect as I think I already addressed the impact on our portfolio. Okay. Julien, I want to understand your question. I mean any confidence on our people to... Okay. Got it. So I mean we are very confident on that. And actually, we have already started a number of initiatives both on power services and home services. But as I said, I mean our #1 priority right now, and I want to be unequivocal about it, is integrating Direct Energy and achieving the $300 million of synergies. That's the least path resistance to value, and we're focused on that. Then we're going to look at the low-hanging fruit opportunities like optimizing our dual-fuel customers. We have good visibility on them. We want our power customers to buy natural gas, and we want our natural gas customers to buy power. So the cost of acquisition is actually pretty compelling.  And then -- and I think that would be the focus for the rest of 2021 and in 2022. You need to think about those opportunities on power and home services as we are testing and learning right now. And if we think that the opportunity is very attractive, then we will accelerate the scale up. If it's not, then we will kill it quickly.  But I expect that most of that investment will happen in the second half of our planning period towards, let's say, '23 and beyond. But we're very, very excited. We actually have a pilot program right now on home solar, which is very exciting, and we're learning a lot about what customers want. So we are waiting -- we're not waiting. We're starting these initiatives. We're very small, deploying very little capital, and -- but we're learning a whole lot. Yes. So as Alberto mentioned, buckets moved a little. On a gross basis, it moved by $85 million. I mean the majority of it is just resettlements. And I would say 70%, 30% between resettlements and then 30% bad debt. So we feel very confident with the -- now with the clarity that we have around securitization that we're going to be able to offset that.  So net-net, there is no change in the impact of the -- of Winter Storm Uri. Although, as I've mentioned before, I mean things are going to move a little bit up and down. It just happened also in this quarter, but we have the upcoming 180-day settlement and -- just in a couple of weeks, and we're monitoring that. But I actually think that that's going to be very small. But nonetheless, I mean I expect things to move just a little bit, whether it's up or down. But now that we have this visibility on the securitization, it just gives me a lot of comfort to maintain the range that we have. Well, I mean just to take a little bit of a step back because I think it's -- context is important here. So when you look at the PJM fleet, you're really talking about the Midwest generation fleet. I mean that's the lion's share of it. And as we have quantified for you in the past, I mean that's about 5% of our earnings. So it's important just to put the context and the magnitude of that.  I think everybody has seen the auction results. They were very disappointing. That basically resulted in the announcement of 50% of our coal fleet, the retirement -- the announced retirements of 50% of our coal fleet. I think given the changes in capacity prices in PJM, it's just prudent that we do a deep dive review of the rest of the portfolio. It's ongoing at this point, and we're looking at everything in terms of reliability, if they're needed for reliability, what are the development prospects. I mean we're looking at just about everything for that -- on that strategic review. And I'll -- as we progress, I'll keep you all updated, but that's where we are. Right. Well, Michael, and let me just be clear here. NRG doesn't have a short position. When I talk about running an integrated model, every megawatt that we are selling to our customers, we're back to backing, whether it is with own generation or whether it is contracting generation in the market or just buying on the open wholesale market. So I want to be clear, Michael, because I think that is a misconception of NRG. We are not short electricity. We're not short of products that we're selling to our customers. We back-to-back them all. So that will be the first point.  The second point is, we don't have to own every single megawatt that we have. I mean that is -- we can actually achieve the same attributes of owning generation by contracting them. We have a number of renewable PPAs that we have. We contract with other counterparties. And whether it is a tolling deal or some physical transaction, we can actually bind the open market in the forwards. So I mean there is a number of things.  I would say that the biggest lesson coming from Winter Storm Uri is the diversification of our supply. If I own 1 big power plant, and you will basically say, \"Okay. Well, now they're not short.\" That big -- that 1 power plant will be a single point of failure. That's what we're trying to avoid. That was the big lesson from Winter Storm Uri.  So I actually feel a lot more comfortable that we have a best-in-class commercial team that is looking at sourcing those megawatts from our power plants, from other people's power plants and from the open market. That is the best strategy that we have. And if we can do it in a capital-light way that frees off our cash and maintains the strong free cash flow to EBITDA ratio that we have, the better.  So that's how I think about it, Michael. But this notion that you're describing that somehow, the biggest risk is the short position of NRG, I just don't share that same view. I mean every -- we do. That's what this balancing -- running a balanced portfolio is -- now I expect the commercial team when we go into the shorter term to position the -- our -- to adjust our position based on their -- sometimes based on their commodity, based on weather, based on prices. But you're talking about optimization around the edge, not necessarily a position going forward.  So I mean if you're asking me, do we have enough megawatts? I would say yes. On a nameplate capacity, our portfolio is sufficient to cover just as much of the network that we sell. But that's not what we're trying to do. What we're trying to do is optimize our supply to make sure that we put the position -- we have the company positioned in the best possible way given where we think the market is. Yes. Keith, I think -- I mean I'll -- well, first of all, we allocate capital when we actually have the cash available to us. So while we have created some financial flexibility given the changes that we did on the glide path to achieve our investment-grade credit metrics, they are still underpinned by when we're going to receive the money from the Uri mitigation plan; and then secondly, from the sale of our Eastern California asset.  So those are the 2 big triggers. As soon as we have that excess cash, I am going to apply our capital allocation principles. I expect to provide all of you another update on the third quarter call, and I expect these money to start coming in towards the fourth quarter.  So as we have always done in the past, and I don't think this should be a surprise to anybody, we allocate that excess cash when we actually have the cash. And that's how I -- that's how you should think about just in terms of timing, Keith. I think margins have been relatively stable. As we -- even though the winter storm was pretty impactful, particularly on the regulated side, but also on the unregulated. Many of the retail providers have either credit sleeves or back-to-back. So we saw just a handful of people being exposed to the open market, and I think they fell through the process. But they were the minimum number of participants. I wouldn't say that there was a big number of participants that were under tremendous stress on the retail side. So margins have been relatively stable. The competition is still out there, similar to what we have seen in the past. Most of it will -- is still to come. I mean as you know, the securitization process is still ongoing while they pass the law. What we expect is in August to -- we're going to have a hearing. And then in October, we need to have an order that is going to define how they're going to allocate those -- that money. So I expect that by October, we'll have even more line of sight in terms of the allocation methodology. And so that will be on the securitization.  And then on the other two, the bad debt is a continuous process. And then I think everybody knows that in the heat recall option that we had, I mean that's going to take a little bit more time given the legal route that we're taking. Yes. No. That's an excellent point, Jonathan. And as I said to you before, we're going to be increasing our disclosures. We're actually working on it right now given the strategic update that we provided to all of you just a month ago.  So I think what you should expect to see is transparency and visibility in terms of how we go from the margin that we have today to the margin that we want to have in 2025, the steps that we're taking. We're going to have conversations around the different initiatives to deploy the $2 billion of capital. We're in the test-and-learn period right now. But as we start scaling up in any of these initiatives, we will have a conversation with all of you ahead of time in terms of what the opportunity -- quantifying the opportunity, what is the capital that is required and what is the EBITDA associated to it.  So there is a lot more disclosures to come both in terms of the $2 billion of capital deployment that we expect and the opportunity that, that represents, but also the makeup of our portfolio around customers, what we're seeing around the longevity of these customers in our portfolio. No. My goal, we'll make it part of the quarterly updates. And I think that, in earnest, will come probably towards the end of the year and start the new year with fresh financials. We're already working on it now. And I think you should expect a -- more disclosures as we go into 2022. Sure, Angie. So I mean I think you need to make the distinction between customers that are on their fixed price. And the customers that are on their fixed price, we back-to-back that. So the minute we sign a customer under fixed price, we have the supply, we lock in the margin. And that is very simple. I mean we price every customer based on the forward curve. So I don't think that doesn't create any exposure.  Perhaps you're talking about the variable rates, the month-to-month, and whether or not we can buy that. But keep in mind, I mean a variable rate is exactly that. You have the ability to change the price if the underlying commodity price in the market changes. So that's why I was saying, we have the ability to pass through some of these costs.  And we're not the only ones exposed to it. Every single retail energy provider, electric provider, each is exposed to these changes in power prices. So it's not like this puts us in a disadvantage. I mean it impacts the supply cost of all retail electric providers. So you would expect a similar -- a move to offset that increase. That's why I'd say, I still don't understand this concept around why some investors or some of you think that we're short power.  I mean having a variable price customer allows us to change prices. Whether it's up or down, if prices are coming down, perhaps we can move the customers' pricing down. But if prices rise, we can do the same. So in the medium term -- when you're talking about the medium term, I'm assuming you're talking about 12 to 18 months. I mean that's plenty of time to take price actions. And that's what we have done in the past. We consistently see that. So that's how I think about the exposure.  And on the fixed price, it's -- we always do it back-to-back. So I'm not concerned about fixed price customers that go multiyear, particularly for C&I customers. Well, I mean I think what we said is, we have adjusted our life path to the 2.5 to 2.75. We haven't changed our targets of investment-grade credit metrics. We changed just the trajectory on how to get there. And that was informed by our conversations with rating agencies in the aftermath of Winter Storm Uri.  So it's very consistent with the conversations that we have with rating agencies. I don't control the credit rating timing. That's not on us. That's on the rating agencies. We believe that 3x is a strong -- a very strong balance sheet, but we still are targeting 2.5 to 2.75. But given this change in glide path, it has provided some financial flexibility to -- if we have excess cash, which we anticipate to have by the end of the year, then we will allocate that through the guidance and principles that are very transparent and that we have communicated to all of you.

Great. Thank you. Well, thank you for your interest in NRG and look forward to continue updating you in this exciting new opportunity and phase for NRG. Thank you, everyone."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Alberto Fornaro",
            "content": "Thank you, Mauricio, for your kind words, and good morning, everyone. I am excited to be with you this morning and to join NRG during its transformation to become a consumer services company.  Now more than ever, customer experience and engagement are key priorities for leading companies, and I feel fortunate to be part of an organization that is completely focusing on the customer to continue to grow. I look forward to the dialogue with our analysts and investment community over the months to come. Hopefully, we will be able to meet in person sometime in the near future.  Moving to the quarterly results, I will now turn to Slide 9 for a brief review of our financials. For the quarter, NRG delivered $656 million in adjusted EBITDA or $82 million higher than the second quarter of last year. The increase in consolidated earnings was driven by the acquisition of Direct Energy and the related addition of synergies achieved in Q2.  Specifically, by region, these benefited from the expected contribution from the Direct Energy acquisition. In addition, favorable weather resulted in outperformance by both our electric and natural gas businesses. Finally, we enjoyed favorable intra-year timing of demand response revenues.  Next, our Texas region partially offset these benefits due to lower residential demand driven by milder weather and return-to-work trends as well as to higher retail supply costs. As a reminder, we benefited last year from exceptionally low market power prices realized during the start of the COVID-driven economic shutdown.  On a year-to-date basis, our progress in terms of incremental profitability was even more significant. It demonstrates the value of our diversified consumer services platform and its ability to absorb the possible impact of headwinds, such as the current forced outage we are dealing with at Limestone Unit 1, which will extend until year-end.  Our expectation for the net impact from Winter Storm Uri remains at $500 million to $700 million with an $85 million increase in onetime costs, offset by a similar increase in the range of expected mitigants. This is primarily due to the positive development of the Texas securitization legislation during the quarter. The total negative cash impact is still expected to be $350 million to $550 million in 2021 and $150 million in 2022 due to the estimated bill credits on to large commercial and industrial customers.  Now turning to Direct Energy integration. We are confirming our goal to achieve a run rate of $300 million synergies by 2023. We are on track to achieve $135 million of synergies for 2021 with $89 million realized year-to-date. Synergy expectations as well as synergies achieved so far are fully embedded, respectively, in our 2021 guidance and year-to-date actuals.  Overall, we are off to a great start in the first half of the year, and we are reaffirming guidance at $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion for adjusted EBITDA and $1.44 billion to $1.64 billion for free cash flow before growth.  I will now turn to Slide 10 where we are updating our planned 2021 capital allocation. As in the past, our practice on this slide is to highlight changes from last quarter in blue. Starting from the left, on the third column, the net capital required for the Direct Energy acquisition was increased by $35 million based on the latest estimate of the post-closing working capital adjustments. We anticipate finalizing the working capital adjustments during the third quarter.  Moving to the next column, and as discussed on the previous slide, the midpoint for net estimated cash impact from Winter Storm Uri remains at $450 million. This includes the increase of $85 million for onetime costs in 2021 and similar increase in expected mitigants driven primarily by the latest Texas legislation. As you are aware, the much anticipated securitization bills, HB4492 and SB1580, have been approved and are being finalized by ERCOT and PUCT. Clarity about the expected completion should come later this year.  Moving to the next column. To achieve a 3.0 net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, we expect to deleverage by $255 million plus early reduction fee of $9 million, totaling $2,264 million of capital to be allocated. This leaves $461 million of remaining capital available for allocation. A large portion of this capital is dependent on the successful conclusion of the ERCOT securitization processes.  Finally, as a reminder, today, the capital allocation waterfall does not include the impact from our pending 4.8-gigawatt asset sale, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Net cash proceeds will be utilized partly for debt reduction, $500 million to maintain leverage neutrality and the remaining $100 million to $150 million after purchase price adjustments to be available for general capital allocation.  Finally, on Slide 11. After reducing our corporate debt balance for the expected 2021 debt reimbursement and for the minimum cash, our 2021 net debt balance will be approximately $7.9 billion, which when based at the midpoint of the adjusted EBITDA implies a ratio of 3.0 net debt to adjusted EBITDA.  As discussed during the Investor Day, given our growth profile, we have revised our time line to achieve investment-grade metrics of 2.5 to 2.75x net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. We plan on achieving a stronger 3.0 ratio by year-end to 2021 and growing into our longer-term targets of 2.5 to 2.75 ratio by 2023 primarily through the full realization of Direct Energy run rate earnings.  We remain committed to a strong balance sheet and to achieve credit metrics aligned with an investment-grade rating. We are very comfortable in achieving our target and are continuing to maintain a constructive dialogue with the rating agencies.  Back to you, Mauricio."

LNG is going crazy overseas with Europe on bid against Asia, that's driving things up. I think that the U.S. just recently became the largest exporter of LNG in the world, passing Australia, which is a hell of a thing. I haven't seen that before. Storage is low right now.  So yes, we're in a bit of an upcycle right here. But like Mauricio said, it's something that we can price in, right? So if we're pricing to our customers off of the curves that we see and we're covering it off of the curves as they happen or off of our generation, we're in a good spot where we tack on the margin, move on our merry way.  So I think Mauricio is right. The integrated platform is a great way to play this, whether it's an upcycle or downcycle."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Nate Stubbs, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nNate Stubbs: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us this afternoon to discuss the results of Vivint Smart Home for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Joining me on the conference call is Todd Pedersen, CEO; and Dale R. Gerard, CFO. I would like to begin by reminding everyone that today\u2019s discussion may contain forward-looking statements, including with regards to the company\u2019s future performance and prospects. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of performance, and you should not put undue reliance on these statements. I would direct your attention to the risk factors detailed in the amendment to our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2020, which we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 11, 2021.

Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures for historical periods to the most comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are available in the earnings release and accompanying presentation, which are available on the Investor Relations website at investors.vivin.com. I will now turn the call over to Todd.\nTodd Pedersen: Thanks, Nate, and good afternoon to everyone. I hope that life is starting to get back to normal for all of you as vaccine rollouts accelerate until a case counts decline. Today, we will cover the following topics. Discuss our strong financial and operating results for the quarter. Review our robust customer engagement and the performance of our platform. Talk about our excitement over the near-term outlook for Vivint\u2019s premier end-to-end smart home platform as we gear up for what we expect to be a normal summer selling season. And as our customers engagement levels remain high, regardless of whether people are spending time inside or outside of their homes. The momentum around our business that we saw in 2020 as carried into the first quarter of 2021. And we are pleased to report continued improvements in our key metrics year-over-year, including an accelerated revenue growth of 13% along with 60,000 new smart home originations, which represented a 20% increase, all while producing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 47%. As of March 31, 2021, Vivint\u2019s total subscribers grew 10% from the same period in 2020, to more than 1.7 million. Along with the highlights I previously mentioned. We also saw solid improvements across the board and other key metrics for the quarter, including another steep decline in net subscriber acquisition costs per subscriber and the lowest LTM attrition rate in the past nine quarters. I believe that these strong results speak to the fact that our core value proposition proven over two decades of reliably taking care of our customers and their families is as relevant today as ever. Dale will provide more specifics on financials during his remarks, as well as share our thoughts about our full year 2021 guidance. If the past year has taught us anything, it\u2019s that there is no better time for homeowners to have a comprehensive smart home system. The 1.1 billion daily events processed by our smart home operating system across more than 23 million connected devices are the best indicator of the frequent engagement of Vivint\u2019s customer base. We are uniquely qualified to help our customers deal with any environment across the various smart home devices we support. From door locks, cameras, security monitoring, thermostats, lighting controls, garage door controls, and many other connected devices. All of these innovative products are designed to work together seamlessly through our elegant platform that homeowners can control from their in-home touch-screen hub through a single app on their phone, or by simply using their voice. Vivint services also include life saving and life protecting 24/7 professional monitoring, or emergencies such as medical, fire, carbon monoxide and burglary alerts. Our vertically integrated model includes dedicated customer care and monitoring teams to ensure that we respond to alerts within seconds. Our cloud platform and proprietary technology also allows customers to seamlessly manage and protect their homes, regardless of whether they\u2019re socially distancing inside the home, or from somewhere outside of it. Vivint takes care of our customers and their families while providing the peace of mind that people demand during times of heightened awareness, anxiety, uncertainty and mobility. We\u2019ve been securing and innovating smart homes for over 20 years. In our experience since the onset of the pandemic, is only cemented in our minds the fact that our customers will continue to value home security and smart home technology during challenging economic and societal times underscoring the strength and resiliency of the Vivint model in any type of environment. With attention now turning to the reopening of the economy and having this coincide with the onset of our summer selling season. We remain bullish about the near-term demand for the business. Given that approximately 50% of the adult population in the U.S. have now received at least one dose of the vaccine and that by the end of the month, we anticipate that all states will have lifted mandatory quarantine restrictions. The tried and true process of selling door to door and installing new Vivint systems inside of homes is getting back to normal. We believe the pent up demand for travel also plays right into our hands. To the extent last year shelters became this year\u2019s travelers, they still have every reason to remain highly engaged with their smart home systems. Based on interaction volumes with our platform before COVID, during COVID, and now as the country begins to look beyond COVID our systems and services have proven to be just as relevant in all of these environments. We\u2019re still respectful of the fact that we continue to operate in a world actively dealing with COVID-19. We have increased the preparedness of our direct sales team as they head out to markets across the U.S. at full capacity. And they\u2019ll be ready to go with all the right training and necessary PPE to interact with current and new customers. As a reminder, last year at this time, we had to swiftly move our call centers and corporate employees to a work from home environment. Paused our entire direct home sales teams for about six weeks during the first wave of the pandemic delaying the started the summer selling season. At this point, we fully expect to return to a more normal summer sales season this year. Meanwhile, our other sales channel, national inside sales, which onboards nearly half of all new subscribers and the normal environment has turned in robust results through the pandemic. And we believe that momentum will continue in 2021. We have long believed the total addressable market for smart home presents a massive opportunity. And in the not so distant future the vast majority of the 150 million homes in North America will be running on a comprehensive smart home operating system. We believe Vivint is the premier end-to-end smart home platform company with the most robust service offering and as such is the best position provider to take advantage of this opportunity. We believe in order to take advantage of the growth opportunities in smart home, it\u2019s important that we increase our focus and investment in our brand, technology and new product development. On this front, I\u2019m pleased \u2013 early returns we\u2019ve seen from our brand investment rolled out during the fourth quarter of 2020 to drive better consumer awareness on a national scale. Those investments will continue as we tell the story of who we are? What we do? And how we can add value to people by delivering the security and peace of mind they desire? But beyond the brand, we also think now is the time to step things up in terms of technology and our product vision to maintain our position on the leading edge the product development and to continue pushing new boundaries by delivering a transformative smart home experience to every home. Before I turn the call over to Dale to go through specifics of our first quarter results, as you may have seen Vivint recently resolved the matter with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission related to certain historical instances of violations of the company\u2019s policies by sales employees. We are pleased to put this matter behind us. Vivint takes matters of compliance seriously, particularly as customers across the country put their trust in us to protect their homes and families. We have already taken steps before the FTC began its review to strengthen our compliance policies. And we will continue to make this a focus going forward. To that end, we are deeply committed to operating with integrity, doing right by our customers, delivering on our commitments to stakeholders and providing exceptional service to our customers. I will now turn the call over to Dale.\nDale Gerard: Thanks, Todd. Before I get into the results for the quarter, just a quick comment on the recent statement by the SEC related to the accounting for warrants issued by SPAC companies. Following the issuance of the statement, we reevaluated our historical accounting for both the public and private placement warrants assumed in conjunction with our merger with Mosaic in January 2020. Like a majority of SPACs, we previously recorded these warrants as equity. However, based on our valuation, we determine that the warrants should have been classified as liabilities and measured at fair value in the closing date of the merger was subsequent changes in fair value reported as non-operating income or expense, and our consolidated statements of operations each reporting period. Of Tuesday of this week, we filed an amendment to our 2020 Form 10-K to restate our previously filed financial statements. As a result of this restatement, we recorded a $109.3 million non-operating loss related to the warrants. And our warrant liability was $83.6 million as of December 31, 2020. I\u2019ll now walk through the financial portion of the presentation that we posted today in conjunction with the earnings release. Looking on Slide 6, we highlight a few metrics for the subscriber portfolio, which continued to be strong across the board. Total subscribers grew 10.2% from 1.55 million to 1.71 million. Average monthly revenue per user our AMRU increase to $67.24 up 3% year-over-year. An increase in AMRU was driven by additional sales of new products, such as our latest generation of outdoor and doorbell cameras, as well as the recognition of deferred revenue. On Slide 7, we cover revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. For the first quarter of 2021 revenue grew by 13.2% with $343.3 million. The revenue growth is attributed to previously mentioned double-digit increase in total subscribers, as well as the increase in the average monthly revenue per user. Adjusted EBITDA grew nicely in the first quarter. The primary drivers for the scaling of service and expense, subscriber acquisition cost. For the quarter we increase our adjusted EBITDA margin by 270 basis points, the 47.2% of revenue, compared to 44.5% in the first quarter of 2020. Moving to Slide 8, we will highlight a few points on the subscribers originated in the first quarter of 2021. A subscriber originations led by a 29% year-over-year growth in our National Inside Sales Channel were 60,127 for the quarter. How and which subscribers we onboard is important to our success today and in the future, and we continue to redefine and boost the underwriting requirements and process to qualify and onboard new subscribers. One of the pauses of the enhanced underwriting requirements is that we are able to reduce the number of retail installment contracts or RICs that are financed on the company\u2019s balance sheet. For the first quarter of 2021, we saw a 77% reduction in the number of subscribers financed through retail installment contracts. By shifting a greater proportion of our subscribers away from RICs and towards third party financing partners and pay in full arrangements we\u2019re able to reduce our net subscriber acquisition cost and improve the company\u2019s cash flow dynamics. Speaking of our third party financing partners, I\u2019m pleased to announce we recently completed a successful renegotiation of our agreement with Citizens Bank, our primary financing partner under the Vivint Flex Pay program. This renewal resulted in a contract extension of three years in the implementation of a new line of credit finance offering through our consumers, which will streamline the initial sales process and facilitate up sales and upgrades of additional and new equipment during a customer\u2019s lifecycle. Moving to the new line of credit finance offering changes the timing of when the merchant discount rate and loss your fees are incurred, which will impact the amount of cash in the near term. That said, we are fully committed and intend to operate the business on a cash flow positive basis this year and going forward. Moving to Slide 9, we will cover service costs per subscriber and new subscriber acquisition costs per subscriber. We continued our trend of year-over-year improvements in net service cost per subscriber moving from $11.76 in the first quarter of 2020 to $10.77 in the first quarter of 2021. This reiterates the advantage of Vivint\u2019s vertically integrated, smart home cloud platform, which encompasses the software, the hardware, the installation, and ongoing customer support. As we continue to make improvements in all these areas, we\u2019re seeing positive trends in both the cost of service as well as customer satisfaction. Our net service margin continued to be in the high 70% range at 77.7% for the first quarter of 2021. A drop in service cost per subscriber is driving a significant portion of the increased in adjusted EBITDA dollars, as well as adjusted EBITDA margin percentage. On the right hand of Slide 9, we highlight net subscriber acquisition costs for the last 12 month period. For the period ended March 31, 2021, net subscriber acquisition costs per new subscriber decreased to $66. That\u2019s 93% lower year-over-year, as we continue to drive down the number of new subscribers that are financed via RICs and shipped to a higher mix of customers utilizing our financing partners are paying in full, the purchase of their smart home products. During the quarter, we also continue to benefit from pricing leverage on the point of sale, purchase and installation of equipment. Slide 10 depicts our typical subscriber walk that illustrates some changes in total subscribers at quarter end. One of the pleasant surprises throughout the pandemic has been the performance of our subscriber portfolio. Once again, our attrition improved ending at 11.8%, which is 230 basis points lower year-over-year, and at a nine quarter low. Our portfolio continues to perform better than expected in terms of both attrition and other leading indicators. In terms of cash flow, we saw a nearly $19 million improvement in net cash used in operating activities during the quarter. We finished the first quarter with $274 million of cash on hand and a very strong liquidity position of approximately $600 million. Finally, moving toward guidance for the year on Slide 11. The top of the page highlight several fundamental characteristics of our financial model, including reoccurring monthly revenue from long-term subscriptions, a highly predictable business model and the ability to thrive in all economic environments. We are pleased with the momentum in the business on the strong start to the year. And we\u2019re bullish about our ability to operate the direct-to-home sales team during this summer selling season at full capacity. We are also aware of potential supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, and hiring constraints that could limit further upside. Taking all of these factors into consideration, we are confirming our original guidance as follows. We still expect in 2021 with 1.8 million to 1.85 million total subscribers. Our estimate for 2021 revenue continues to be $1.38 billion to $1.42 billion. And finally, we have firm our previous 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance of between $640 million and $655 million. This concludes our prepared remarks on the first quarter. Operator, please open the call for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Paul Coster from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nPaul Coster: Yes, thanks very much for taking my question. You said it sounds like the guidance implies that supply chain risks present upside perhaps, but not factored into the guidance, so the limited from a downside, thinking one of the first sort of tilts in that kind of way. Can you just talk to us about what your biggest sort of component risks are and how it is that you seem to be managing through this problem so well on a relative basis?\nDale Gerard: Hey, Paul. It\u2019s Dale. Thanks for joining the call. We look at it a big part of our growth initiative and some of the stuff we\u2019re trying to do is really around camera attach rates. And as, we think that\u2019s one of the big selling points and why people really like smart home as one of the big advantages we think our systems have over others, integrated analytics, and the different things that we can do with that, in terms of notices, and so forth with customers. And so part of what we\u2019re doing with our pricing and how we\u2019re selling and what we\u2019re seeing in terms of take rate, or adoption of additional cameras, we\u2019re in good shape, we believe right now. But if adoption rates are higher than we think, and if there\u2019s any, disruption, in terms of chip manufacturing, and or the big thing, really, one of the big things is logistics frankly, supports and getting and then from the ports, it could be some where we may have to limit the number of cameras, we sell the second, maybe late in the third quarter or fourth quarter. But, we think we\u2019ve addressed that we\u2019re doing some stuff with air spray and shipping. And so, we\u2019re just calling that out as to say, hey, based on, we\u2019re off to a good start. We think that the year we\u2019re going to have a good year. But with some stuff around supply chain, like there\u2019s some inflationary pressures out there, there\u2019s some hiring constraints, what we\u2019re probably no different than other companies as we try to continue to ramp up, especially in the field, in higher and in the markets that we service, have been able to hire enough installers and service professionals to be able to take care of the customers the way we want to take care of them. So, we just kind of put all that stuff together and said hey, based upon on where we are today, and what we see. We think, confirming our guidance, which we think is really good guidance for the year to begin with, is the best path at this point. Todd, I don\u2019t know anything you just want to add?\nTodd Pedersen: Yes, I was just saying, Paul, you kind of caught that which is based on supply chain issues that Dale mentioned, the potential for upside beyond where we sit is limited to product being delivered to the U.S. and being able to install that. So it\u2019s not impossible that we could see some upside, but it\u2019s going to be quite difficult or just like own house everyone else their supply chain issues out there. Ships mean, kind of front end center, driving most of that. So but we do feel very comfortable this number. We\u2019re fortunate that we have a seasonal business in some regards, because we treat order a lot of the hardware and had done that last year. And so a lot of what we need to attain these numbers, we already know we have a kind of insight.\nPaul Coster: Gotcha. And a quick follow up, I think investors have been working really hard to try and figure out what\u2019s going wrong, because the stocks been going down and we\u2019re all sort of very anxious, but something obvious here. Let me just sort of try and my luck is the, it sounds like you\u2019ve entered into an extended term with Citizens Bank, but as part of that, there\u2019s different allocation of the credit risk. Does that relate back to this FTC issue? And in passing? Todd, can you just tell us, what is actually the FTC issue identified and when it occurred?\nDale Gerard: Yes, I think the first part, Paul, [indiscernible] in terms of the extension with Citizens, we\u2019re very, very pleased with our partnership with Citizens, they\u2019ve done a very good partner. We\u2019ve had a relationship during consumer finance with him since early 2017. And so we were glad to be able to extend it, the changes that we\u2019re making in that program assistance really has, nothing in terms of the FTC. It was really part of the negotiations to move from the installment line into a, what we call a line of credit, which really is better for us long-term and better for our customers. It\u2019s easier for the onboarding process. And then really where we will see the benefit is the additional sales of hardware, either additional products that customers want to take or as we roll out new products, and customers want to have those systems, their line of credit allows for that in a way that the installment loan which was a kind of a fixed loan debt. And so, in reality, the way the terms are set with the line of credit or more standard terms, our terms are ahead with installment loan, we\u2019re probably not what with standard industry? We were able to do that, I think early on. So by moving to the line of credit, one of the things that was part of that was we\u2019ve kind of go to more standard terms around how come, the users of these products pay for that the credit offering from Citizens or from other banks, and then Todd will pick this.\nTodd Pedersen: Yes, I mean. The first thing I\u2019d say is, we\u2019re glad to have this FTC settlement done. Now, why we have not, we\u2019ve been asked about refinancing paying down debt, and we were not able to do that didn\u2019t feel like it was good timing, in the middle of that FTC settlement happening. So, we\u2019re glad to have that past and in the past. Secondly, we\u2019re a company that we want to provide great service, take care of consumers, our customers, and so this behavior, if it\u2019s not consistent with integrity and doing right by consumers, has no part of this company. But back in 2017, we did have some sales people that got around some systems that we found out and let those people go. And that was part of this investigation by the FTC. And the thing is, we found out we did let those return those people let them go. But again, that\u2019s in the past and done. We\u2019re glad to have that behind us. We\u2019ve definitely made. And we do this every year enhanced improvements on compliance, and systems and controls to ensure that underwriting and everything is up to par and again, compliant with laws of the United States from a financing perspective. So again, glad to have that behind us and done and the settlement over.\nPaul Coster: All right. Thanks so much Todd. Thanks.\nTodd Pedersen: Yes. Thank you, Paul.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kessler from Imperial Capital. Your line is now open.\nJeff Kessler: Thank you. And it\u2019s been great working with all you guys. I will hopefully, we\u2019ll continue to talk. Just not in the position I am that\u2019s all. I\u2019ve got really a couple of questions here. Firstly, what are the \u2013 it looks this year from the sound \u2013 look, you\u2019re going to have to the economy looks like it\u2019s opening up, you have \u2013 you are making investments you\u2019re talking about? And you\u2019ve already started with in branding the company. Now, can you talk about what other types of investments and how much that may cost you that you\u2019re going to be involved with assuming that other than that the overall economy opens up is probably timing for you to start pushing on some of the other home, some improving home automation, trying to put some distance as we knew and others in terms of technology, trying to do things, in terms of maybe improving. I don\u2019t know improving your training or focus on how you onboard your new salespeople are spending more money there. Can you just talk about the various types of increased investment you\u2019ll be doing in addition to branding?\nTodd Pedersen: So, and by the way, it\u2019s been great to work with you to these years. We\u2019re going to miss this, I guess it\u2019s a perfect like that, hopefully relationship continues.\nJeff Kessler: I\u2019m sure; we\u2019ll have with my other guys.\nDale Gerard: That sounds great. Well, so a couple of things. We are \u2013 we agree that investment in continued product enhancement and quality and technologies is critical, so that we can keep our lead in the market and deliver the best services that we can to consumers and that\u2019s first and foremost. The quality has got to be there. The values got to be there or continue to drive that. We are investing in new tools and technologies from onboarding customers, underwriting customers; we\u2019ve built these tools over the years. Some of them we feel need to be refreshed. You\u2019ll probably end up seeing within a year or so a platform kind of reinvestment in the platform. Again, we built out our operating system seven, eight years ago. And we believe that there\u2019s some updates that can be done and will be done to enhance that, that experience for the consumer, allow us to do more upgrades, have more content for consumers information, consumers and allow us to kind of deliver service to them through those enhanced \u2013 to be enhanced operating system. So, that\u2019s going to happen now we\u2019re super pleased with the results that have been are, it\u2019s early I mean, we started rebranding the marketing, really in Q4. But as you saw with our Q1 numbers, 13%, top line revenue growth compared to \u2013 we\u2019re starting to see some momentum there. Now, we are already mentioned earlier that with some supply chain constraints. We\u2019re not going to be off to the races, because we have to be, if we do add customers, we need product and hardware to be able to install. So although we\u2019re a great year passed out, and we take the numbers and projections we have are strong, the cash flow dynamics of the business, the attrition numbers, our net operating margins, our net SAC are all super strong and improving year-over-year. So, we\u2019re really excited about how the company is positioned. And, what the future looks like for this.\nJeff Kessler: This includes an increased investment in SAC?\nDale Gerard: What? Can you maybe expand? What do you mean?\nJeff Kessler: You talked about new tools for onboarding customers and getting customers trained and things like that?\nDale Gerard: Yes, I mean, it\u2019s really within our area of information technology for that area, which we do allocate out the SAC, from that SAC some of that service. So yes, there\u2019ll be some of that there. And then some of the brands then that\u2019s directly contributed to the media that we\u2019re doing is actually being [indiscernible]. But, it\u2019s part of like, as we said earlier, when we did the fourth quarter call and talked about kind of what we expect 2021 said, hey, we\u2019re going to make investments in really three areas of Todd just talked about, you\u2019re going to see those really, you\u2019ll start seeing the impact of those in Q2. In terms of where we\u2019re kind of really starting to get some of the spend in terms of brand is, as we kind of rolled out the summer sales force. And then as we\u2019ve hired up for some of the stuff we need to do in technology, and product development, you\u2019ll start seeing that kind of come through Q2, Q3.\nJeff Kessler: Okay. Same question actually is on attrition. And going through the various components of attrition obviously, percentage of customers coming to term on their contracts is obviously an important one mover it is an important one, people who can\u2019t pay were isn\u2019t important when people don\u2019t like your sit or whatever. It\u2019s always someone important; these are all move around depending on the times we\u2019re living in, and the ability to reaffirm to create a better value proposition for your customers. What is going on, when attrition because clearly, you even say that your sweet spot is probably going to be somewhere in the 12% or maybe the high 11% to 12% or 13% to come. In the past, you seem to may be under estimated how far attrition can go up. But now you seem to be under estimating how far attrition can come down?\nTodd Pedersen: Yes, well, so here\u2019s a couple of things. We \u2013 that we are fully integrated platform, end-to-end solution. We continue to make improvements in the hardware, the installation process, the firmware; we\u2019ve got this incredible feedback loop that we\u2019ve talked about. So, we continue to make improvements and enhancements from that perspective. If these products work and we have 14 or 15 devices on average per home, if they work consistently and the use case are relevant to consumers, they keep the product now there are obviously circumstances where people lose their jobs or have financial changes in their lives that they calls some of these people to cancel. We hope think people it\u2019s not because people don\u2019t like our system, but maybe that happens occasionally. But the other is, if you\u2019ve noticed in the last year, we\u2019ve made them great enhancements to the underwriting the reduction in RICs to the platform is going to have continued impact on efficient overtime. And again enhancements in every little detail of what we do, to deliver service to consumers is going to impact. So, we\u2019re not we\u2019re hopeful we\u2019re not trying to be pessimistic, we continue to see potential gains in that from that side. That\u2019s pretty, for a consumer facing business on a 1% monthly attrition is pretty incredible. And then you add to that our net subscriber costs come down substantially. And our net service costs $10.77 this is a really good story. And real good build up from what we\u2019ve been trying to accomplish in the last couple of years.\nJeff Kessler: So that\u2019s the sweet spot, are you are you changing your view of what maybe your long-term sweet spot range should be for LTM attrition?\nDale Gerard: No, Jeff at this point, Jeff, no. I think what we\u2019re taught, like Todd said, I think as we get more time in here, and we continue to see how attrition performs, we may picked up, but at this point, I think we\u2019re going to stay where [Technical Difficulty]\nTodd Pedersen: I would say that we\u2019re super pleased with all of the, all of the results are great, but the $10.77 per subscriber and net servicing costs, that means people are \u2013 our systems are working, we\u2019re not having to roll trucks and fix things as often as we used to work, replace hardware. So again, the better and more reliable the system is, and the more elegant, in fact, the more robust the system is, the more we see attrition coming down over time. So, we\u2019re not done from an aspiration perspective. But we think we\u2019re feeling confident about what we\u2019ve injected to the market for the year. And hope to make gains over that if possible.\nJeff Kessler: Great, thank you very much. I appreciate it.\nTodd Pedersen: Thanks again, Jeff. Good luck in retirement.\nJeff Kessler: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is [indiscernible] on behalf of Rod. Nice job on the results. Could you expand on the difference between the installment line versus line of credit and how it\u2019s better for customers? And you also mentioned some impacts to tax to cash flow. So, could you give us some color on that?\nTodd Pedersen: Okay. So the line of credit in the \u2013 that what we have as soon as, and what we\u2019ve been putting us this is kind of a fixed term installment loan. And so but that means once the customer finance, what the finance at the initial point of the sale, that was fixed, and if the customer called back, six months later said, hey, I really \u2013 I only bought two cameras, I wish I would bought a third camera, so I can put her out on my back porch, we weren\u2019t able to actually add that to the finance. The line of credit, it\u2019s more like a credit card, the way to think about it. And so that will allow us to actually go back and add to that system and make instead of have to come out of pocket that point for that camera, and the install, they can add that to the line of credit. So that\u2019s the really the big difference. It just allows us that the customer and allows us as the companies to be able to offer that product to them, and the customer then to be able to finance that going forward, as they want new or additional products installed in their homes. In terms of the cash, the way \u2013 the way the installment loan product has worked, we paid the kind of the MDR fee in the last year overtime. And so every month, if there were \u2013 the MDR fee was paid every month and losses were paid as occurred up into the loss based on the loss arrangements that we have the caps that we had in place. The way it will move the line of credit will move eventually, as we transition through the next kind of 24 months, it\u2019ll move to that\u2019ll be like a more standard where we\u2019ll pay that the MDR fee and then the expected losses upfront, and so it\u2019d be a net. So very, very similar to how our program works with Fortiva or other financing partner.\nUnidentified Analyst: Super helpful. I also wanted to ask about direct-to-home. So the subscriber growth sequentially is a bit weaker than historical trends. And I understand they\u2019re still operating in a COVID environment. But could you talk about how that \u2013 why that is and expand the line on that?\nTodd Pedersen: Yes, look, we\u2019re basically saying that we believe that will operate in the normal way from a deployment perspective. We\u2019ve deployed the majority of our direct-to-home sales people across the country, they\u2019re still \u2013 some number of them, they\u2019re still coming \u2013 going out to market. We\u2019re having, we are obviously respectful of this social distancing still at this point, even though that is changing somewhat with vaccinations and a percentage of people are being vaccinated across the country, and based on CDC guidelines and suggestions. But it feels like, it will be back to more of a normal type year for the summer selling season, which we\u2019re excited about. Now, we\u2019ve made adjustments that be based on COVID maybe accelerated some of the adjustments on how we underwrite and do approvals for consumer events, we used to do it on our devices. We have salespeople who travel around with an iPad. Now, it\u2019s done on the consumers\u2019 device. So, we can maintain the social distancing, even in the future. The second thing that it really does for us is from a compliance perspective, it really tightens things up. So, this is a net positive all the way around. We\u2019re, again, trying to be respectful of COVID-19, and making sure that we\u2019re not spreading anything, we still checking people\u2019s health on a daily basis in market, wearing the appropriate masks and gloves and that sort of thing. But then, from an underwriting and compliance perspective, with the adjustments, it\u2019s going to be a net positive for the company.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks, Todd. And last question from me, could you give us an update on the insurance business?\nTodd Pedersen: Yes, so we\u2019re still \u2013 I would say we\u2019re still in test mode. We believe, we have great upside potential with that business. And again, this is the great thing about owning our platform and the data that we have. If you think about it super, it\u2019s hyper local data inside of the home based on consumer actions and interactions with the system. So usage patterns, we have all of that collected inside of our data that we collect on a daily basis. We\u2019re not quite ready to start announcing volume or future projections, but we\u2019re trying to make sure that we have everything from a compliance perspective from a financial perspective and underwriting perspective dialed in before we will expand that business out with.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thanks, [indiscernible].\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Erik Woodring from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nErik Woodring: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Congrats on the quarter, and again, congrats on the attrition rate, really impressive stuff. I guess I wanted to ask an earlier question, perhaps a different way. And that was, would you say that through the end of the March quarter, there was still a bit of what I\u2019d call COVID complacency, driving that metric, meaning, I know you had less than 10% of your base reached the end of term in 1Q, but are people perhaps putting a decision to reevaluate their smart home provider on hold for now, given the environment? Just curious you take on that? And then I will follow up. Thanks.\nTodd Pedersen: Yes, I mean, look, that could be true with some of the consumers. And then the other side of that is, the better underwriting our systems are working and operating better as we continue to make improvements, like I mentioned earlier on firmware, software, new hardware releases, installation protocols, just every little thing that we do. We\u2019ve been through different types of downturns and issues in the past. And this kind of is proving out again, the fact that what we deliver to people, which is peace of mind in different ways for different people, based on their situation in their living environment, that this is something that people see value in, and we continue to try to push those boundaries and make sure that we\u2019re more and more relevant from a consumer perspective every day.\nErik Woodring: Okay, that\u2019s super helpful. And then I guess my second question, selling expenses were up more than 100% year-over-year, smart home subscribers were up 20%. What drove that growth in selling expenses? Should we interpret that as meaning it\u2019s getting more expensive to acquire new customers? And then how do I kind of tie that with Net SAC that obviously continues to reach very impressive new lows? Thanks.\nTodd Pedersen: Yes. So a couple things last year in the first quarter, if you recall, we shut down kind of direct-to-home. So, part of your year-over-year is the fact that the last, I don\u2019t know the last two or three weeks of the first quarter, there was no spend, when I say no spend, we kind of said don\u2019t spend any more money on recruiting, training, anything so that\u2019s a big variance or a variance to kind of year-over-year in terms of that. And then you have some of that brand spin, also, as I said, we\u2019re pushing some of the brand spin, that\u2019s media directly tied to commercials and so forth into SAC also. So, I mean, we\u2019re in terms of terms of our gross cost, or net gross cost of SAC, it\u2019s in line with where we have been. And again, we keep driving down the Net, because we\u2019re charging more for, sorry, we\u2019re selling more product. So the upfront, basically, the number of cameras, number of devices we\u2019re selling is higher. I think the other thing to say as a call, because I actually look at selling expense or SAC excluding stock based comp. So, when you \u2013 so stock based comp was a big driver in that in terms of the legacy equity that we had that came through in the first quarter that also got expense, plus the new grants that are there. So, that\u2019s kind of a double kind of whammy there in terms of that expense. But if you looked at I think it\u2019s 11%. I think without that stock based comp charge; you\u2019re only up about 11%, around $5 million year-over-year.\nErik Woodring: Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. And then I guess if I can squeeze on the last one. I remember you guys kind of previously guiding to long-term adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid-40%. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but is that still how we should think about the long-term? And I say that compared to obviously your current guidance, which would imply you\u2019re kind of already there? And that\u2019s it for me. Thanks again and congrats, again.\nDale Gerard: Yes, I think, again, a lot of things we\u2019re seeing improvement across the board, right, we\u2019re seeing better servicing costs, and as we can continue to drive down service costs, but while still providing really of such exceptional service for our customers, again, moderate \u2013 being able to leverage G&A in terms of what we\u2019re spending there. I think overall, we still think kind of in a mid-40s, whether that\u2019s 45% to 47%, is really kind of where we see margin that. For the near-term, I think, as we continue to invest in the business and make decisions that we think will help the business long-term being more successful in terms of products, technology, brand, as Todd has mentioned, so that\u2019s kind of where we\u2019re shooting for today.\nErik Woodring: Okay, thanks, guys.\nDale Gerard: Thank you, Erik.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Marlane Pereiro from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nMarlane Pereiro: Great, thank you for taking my questions. I just have two very quick one. One, can you share any thoughts on addressing the capital structure? And two and I apologize if I missed this, but for attrition, how do you think about a normalized level or kind of a steady state for the business? Thank you.\nDale Gerard: Sure. I take it through. Our backwards attrition, I think we\u2019ve kind of said, we think 12% to 13%. If I had the group attrition, I\u2019d say attrition somewhere in the high 11%. That\u2019s probably low 13%. So, maybe its 12% to 12.5% is kind of where we think at this point. Again, as Todd said, as we continue to provide a better service, better value to our customer, that they really \u2013 they look at this and say, hey, I need this everyday as part of my life. I mean our interactions that we saw pre-COVID, during COVID, and post-COVID continuing to increase in terms of how many times people are interacting with their system via their app. And so that tells us that and I think one of the things that we actually found in our quarter is that those interactions went up. And I think, part of that\u2019s the being able to answer the door, get your deliveries without touchless deliveries, not have to talk to the person, but you can talk them through your video camera, your doorbell camera, those types of things. So, even when people go back to the office, which, I think people will at some point, they\u2019ve got these uses probably used cases that they\u2019ve discovered why they were at home, that actually it will be beneficial. And so we kind of \u2013 again, attrition, we\u2019re happy where it is. And the thing, I think it\u2019s important about attritional service, as somebody mentioned earlier, we\u2019re less than 10% of our portfolio is at the end of their initial term is that goes up that have the drop \u2013 that has an impact that will lift attrition, automatically, even though attrition is not really performing worse, is just as you the percent of customers at the end of term, you always see a little bit of a higher percentage of attrition related to those customers. If we can drive that down, then we can lower that long-term attrition number. In terms of the cap structure, I think Todd said, we\u2019ll be looking to address that, I think sooner than later, as we you know, want to go ahead and take care, I think we\u2019ve got some 2022s, 2023s for sure that we\u2019d like to take care of the maturities and extend those. And so I think you\u2019ll see us look to be out in the market at some point in the near future.\nMarlane Pereiro: Great. Thank you, Dale.\nDale Gerard: Thank you. Have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll now like to hand it over to Mr. Todd Pedersen, for any closing remarks.\nTodd Pedersen: We appreciate everyone getting on the call with us today. And again, we\u2019re looking back at this past quarter, which was a build up in the past couple of years, a plan set in place. We\u2019re excited to see the acceleration in top-line revenue growth improvement in LTM attrition, net subscriber acquisition costs, servicing costs everything with the business is performing incredibly well. We\u2019re excited about the future of the business. And look forward to getting on the phone call with you guys again in the next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Todd Pedersen",
            "content": "Thanks, Nate, and good afternoon to everyone. I hope that life is starting to get back to normal for all of you as vaccine rollouts accelerate until a case counts decline. Today, we will cover the following topics. Discuss our strong financial and operating results for the quarter. Review our robust customer engagement and the performance of our platform. Talk about our excitement over the near-term outlook for Vivint's premier end-to-end smart home platform as we gear up for what we expect to be a normal summer selling season. And as our customers engagement levels remain high, regardless of whether people are spending time inside or outside of their homes. The momentum around our business that we saw in 2020 as carried into the first quarter of 2021. And we are pleased to report continued improvements in our key metrics year-over-year, including an accelerated revenue growth of 13% along with 60,000 new smart home originations, which represented a 20% increase, all while producing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 47%. As of March 31, 2021, Vivint's total subscribers grew 10% from the same period in 2020, to more than 1.7 million. Along with the highlights I previously mentioned. We also saw solid improvements across the board and other key metrics for the quarter, including another steep decline in net subscriber acquisition costs per subscriber and the lowest LTM attrition rate in the past nine quarters. I believe that these strong results speak to the fact that our core value proposition proven over two decades of reliably taking care of our customers and their families is as relevant today as ever. Dale will provide more specifics on financials during his remarks, as well as share our thoughts about our full year 2021 guidance. If the past year has taught us anything, it's that there is no better time for homeowners to have a comprehensive smart home system. The 1.1 billion daily events processed by our smart home operating system across more than 23 million connected devices are the best indicator of the frequent engagement of Vivint's customer base. We are uniquely qualified to help our customers deal with any environment across the various smart home devices we support. From door locks, cameras, security monitoring, thermostats, lighting controls, garage door controls, and many other connected devices. All of these innovative products are designed to work together seamlessly through our elegant platform that homeowners can control from their in-home touch-screen hub through a single app on their phone, or by simply using their voice. Vivint services also include life saving and life protecting 24/7 professional monitoring, or emergencies such as medical, fire, carbon monoxide and burglary alerts. Our vertically integrated model includes dedicated customer care and monitoring teams to ensure that we respond to alerts within seconds. Our cloud platform and proprietary technology also allows customers to seamlessly manage and protect their homes, regardless of whether they're socially distancing inside the home, or from somewhere outside of it. Vivint takes care of our customers and their families while providing the peace of mind that people demand during times of heightened awareness, anxiety, uncertainty and mobility. We've been securing and innovating smart homes for over 20 years. In our experience since the onset of the pandemic, is only cemented in our minds the fact that our customers will continue to value home security and smart home technology during challenging economic and societal times underscoring the strength and resiliency of the Vivint model in any type of environment. With attention now turning to the reopening of the economy and having this coincide with the onset of our summer selling season. We remain bullish about the near-term demand for the business. Given that approximately 50% of the adult population in the U.S. have now received at least one dose of the vaccine and that by the end of the month, we anticipate that all states will have lifted mandatory quarantine restrictions. The tried and true process of selling door to door and installing new Vivint systems inside of homes is getting back to normal. We believe the pent up demand for travel also plays right into our hands. To the extent last year shelters became this year's travelers, they still have every reason to remain highly engaged with their smart home systems. Based on interaction volumes with our platform before COVID, during COVID, and now as the country begins to look beyond COVID our systems and services have proven to be just as relevant in all of these environments. We're still respectful of the fact that we continue to operate in a world actively dealing with COVID-19. We have increased the preparedness of our direct sales team as they head out to markets across the U.S. at full capacity. And they'll be ready to go with all the right training and necessary PPE to interact with current and new customers. As a reminder, last year at this time, we had to swiftly move our call centers and corporate employees to a work from home environment. Paused our entire direct home sales teams for about six weeks during the first wave of the pandemic delaying the started the summer selling season. At this point, we fully expect to return to a more normal summer sales season this year. Meanwhile, our other sales channel, national inside sales, which onboards nearly half of all new subscribers and the normal environment has turned in robust results through the pandemic. And we believe that momentum will continue in 2021. We have long believed the total addressable market for smart home presents a massive opportunity. And in the not so distant future the vast majority of the 150 million homes in North America will be running on a comprehensive smart home operating system. We believe Vivint is the premier end-to-end smart home platform company with the most robust service offering and as such is the best position provider to take advantage of this opportunity. We believe in order to take advantage of the growth opportunities in smart home, it's important that we increase our focus and investment in our brand, technology and new product development. On this front, I'm pleased \u2013 early returns we've seen from our brand investment rolled out during the fourth quarter of 2020 to drive better consumer awareness on a national scale. Those investments will continue as we tell the story of who we are? What we do? And how we can add value to people by delivering the security and peace of mind they desire? But beyond the brand, we also think now is the time to step things up in terms of technology and our product vision to maintain our position on the leading edge the product development and to continue pushing new boundaries by delivering a transformative smart home experience to every home. Before I turn the call over to Dale to go through specifics of our first quarter results, as you may have seen Vivint recently resolved the matter with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission related to certain historical instances of violations of the company's policies by sales employees. We are pleased to put this matter behind us. Vivint takes matters of compliance seriously, particularly as customers across the country put their trust in us to protect their homes and families. We have already taken steps before the FTC began its review to strengthen our compliance policies. And we will continue to make this a focus going forward. To that end, we are deeply committed to operating with integrity, doing right by our customers, delivering on our commitments to stakeholders and providing exceptional service to our customers. I will now turn the call over to Dale. Yes, I was just saying, Paul, you kind of caught that which is based on supply chain issues that Dale mentioned, the potential for upside beyond where we sit is limited to product being delivered to the U.S. and being able to install that. So it's not impossible that we could see some upside, but it's going to be quite difficult or just like own house everyone else their supply chain issues out there. Ships mean, kind of front end center, driving most of that. So but we do feel very comfortable this number. We're fortunate that we have a seasonal business in some regards, because we treat order a lot of the hardware and had done that last year. And so a lot of what we need to attain these numbers, we already know we have a kind of insight. Yes, I mean. The first thing I'd say is, we're glad to have this FTC settlement done. Now, why we have not, we've been asked about refinancing paying down debt, and we were not able to do that didn't feel like it was good timing, in the middle of that FTC settlement happening. So, we're glad to have that past and in the past. Secondly, we're a company that we want to provide great service, take care of consumers, our customers, and so this behavior, if it's not consistent with integrity and doing right by consumers, has no part of this company. But back in 2017, we did have some sales people that got around some systems that we found out and let those people go. And that was part of this investigation by the FTC. And the thing is, we found out we did let those return those people let them go. But again, that's in the past and done. We're glad to have that behind us. We've definitely made. And we do this every year enhanced improvements on compliance, and systems and controls to ensure that underwriting and everything is up to par and again, compliant with laws of the United States from a financing perspective. So again, glad to have that behind us and done and the settlement over. Yes. Thank you, Paul. So, and by the way, it's been great to work with you to these years. We're going to miss this, I guess it's a perfect like that, hopefully relationship continues. Yes, well, so here's a couple of things. We \u2013 that we are fully integrated platform, end-to-end solution. We continue to make improvements in the hardware, the installation process, the firmware; we've got this incredible feedback loop that we've talked about. So, we continue to make improvements and enhancements from that perspective. If these products work and we have 14 or 15 devices on average per home, if they work consistently and the use case are relevant to consumers, they keep the product now there are obviously circumstances where people lose their jobs or have financial changes in their lives that they calls some of these people to cancel. We hope think people it's not because people don't like our system, but maybe that happens occasionally. But the other is, if you've noticed in the last year, we've made them great enhancements to the underwriting the reduction in RICs to the platform is going to have continued impact on efficient overtime. And again enhancements in every little detail of what we do, to deliver service to consumers is going to impact. So, we're not we're hopeful we're not trying to be pessimistic, we continue to see potential gains in that from that side. That's pretty, for a consumer facing business on a 1% monthly attrition is pretty incredible. And then you add to that our net subscriber costs come down substantially. And our net service costs $10.77 this is a really good story. And real good build up from what we've been trying to accomplish in the last couple of years. I would say that we're super pleased with all of the, all of the results are great, but the $10.77 per subscriber and net servicing costs, that means people are \u2013 our systems are working, we're not having to roll trucks and fix things as often as we used to work, replace hardware. So again, the better and more reliable the system is, and the more elegant, in fact, the more robust the system is, the more we see attrition coming down over time. So, we're not done from an aspiration perspective. But we think we're feeling confident about what we've injected to the market for the year. And hope to make gains over that if possible. Thanks again, Jeff. Good luck in retirement. Okay. So the line of credit in the \u2013 that what we have as soon as, and what we've been putting us this is kind of a fixed term installment loan. And so but that means once the customer finance, what the finance at the initial point of the sale, that was fixed, and if the customer called back, six months later said, hey, I really \u2013 I only bought two cameras, I wish I would bought a third camera, so I can put her out on my back porch, we weren't able to actually add that to the finance. The line of credit, it's more like a credit card, the way to think about it. And so that will allow us to actually go back and add to that system and make instead of have to come out of pocket that point for that camera, and the install, they can add that to the line of credit. So that's the really the big difference. It just allows us that the customer and allows us as the companies to be able to offer that product to them, and the customer then to be able to finance that going forward, as they want new or additional products installed in their homes. In terms of the cash, the way \u2013 the way the installment loan product has worked, we paid the kind of the MDR fee in the last year overtime. And so every month, if there were \u2013 the MDR fee was paid every month and losses were paid as occurred up into the loss based on the loss arrangements that we have the caps that we had in place. The way it will move the line of credit will move eventually, as we transition through the next kind of 24 months, it'll move to that'll be like a more standard where we'll pay that the MDR fee and then the expected losses upfront, and so it'd be a net. So very, very similar to how our program works with Fortiva or other financing partner. Yes, look, we're basically saying that we believe that will operate in the normal way from a deployment perspective. We've deployed the majority of our direct-to-home sales people across the country, they're still \u2013 some number of them, they're still coming \u2013 going out to market. We're having, we are obviously respectful of this social distancing still at this point, even though that is changing somewhat with vaccinations and a percentage of people are being vaccinated across the country, and based on CDC guidelines and suggestions. But it feels like, it will be back to more of a normal type year for the summer selling season, which we're excited about. Now, we've made adjustments that be based on COVID maybe accelerated some of the adjustments on how we underwrite and do approvals for consumer events, we used to do it on our devices. We have salespeople who travel around with an iPad. Now, it's done on the consumers' device. So, we can maintain the social distancing, even in the future. The second thing that it really does for us is from a compliance perspective, it really tightens things up. So, this is a net positive all the way around. We're, again, trying to be respectful of COVID-19, and making sure that we're not spreading anything, we still checking people's health on a daily basis in market, wearing the appropriate masks and gloves and that sort of thing. But then, from an underwriting and compliance perspective, with the adjustments, it's going to be a net positive for the company. Yes, so we're still \u2013 I would say we're still in test mode. We believe, we have great upside potential with that business. And again, this is the great thing about owning our platform and the data that we have. If you think about it super, it's hyper local data inside of the home based on consumer actions and interactions with the system. So usage patterns, we have all of that collected inside of our data that we collect on a daily basis. We're not quite ready to start announcing volume or future projections, but we're trying to make sure that we have everything from a compliance perspective from a financial perspective and underwriting perspective dialed in before we will expand that business out with. Yes, I mean, look, that could be true with some of the consumers. And then the other side of that is, the better underwriting our systems are working and operating better as we continue to make improvements, like I mentioned earlier on firmware, software, new hardware releases, installation protocols, just every little thing that we do. We've been through different types of downturns and issues in the past. And this kind of is proving out again, the fact that what we deliver to people, which is peace of mind in different ways for different people, based on their situation in their living environment, that this is something that people see value in, and we continue to try to push those boundaries and make sure that we're more and more relevant from a consumer perspective every day. Yes. So a couple things last year in the first quarter, if you recall, we shut down kind of direct-to-home. So, part of your year-over-year is the fact that the last, I don't know the last two or three weeks of the first quarter, there was no spend, when I say no spend, we kind of said don't spend any more money on recruiting, training, anything so that's a big variance or a variance to kind of year-over-year in terms of that. And then you have some of that brand spin, also, as I said, we're pushing some of the brand spin, that's media directly tied to commercials and so forth into SAC also. So, I mean, we're in terms of terms of our gross cost, or net gross cost of SAC, it's in line with where we have been. And again, we keep driving down the Net, because we're charging more for, sorry, we're selling more product. So the upfront, basically, the number of cameras, number of devices we're selling is higher. I think the other thing to say as a call, because I actually look at selling expense or SAC excluding stock based comp. So, when you \u2013 so stock based comp was a big driver in that in terms of the legacy equity that we had that came through in the first quarter that also got expense, plus the new grants that are there. So, that's kind of a double kind of whammy there in terms of that expense. But if you looked at I think it's 11%. I think without that stock based comp charge; you're only up about 11%, around $5 million year-over-year. We appreciate everyone getting on the call with us today. And again, we're looking back at this past quarter, which was a build up in the past couple of years, a plan set in place. We're excited to see the acceleration in top-line revenue growth improvement in LTM attrition, net subscriber acquisition costs, servicing costs everything with the business is performing incredibly well. We're excited about the future of the business. And look forward to getting on the phone call with you guys again in the next quarter. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Todd. Before I get into the results for the quarter, just a quick comment on the recent statement by the SEC related to the accounting for warrants issued by SPAC companies. Following the issuance of the statement, we reevaluated our historical accounting for both the public and private placement warrants assumed in conjunction with our merger with Mosaic in January 2020. Like a majority of SPACs, we previously recorded these warrants as equity. However, based on our valuation, we determine that the warrants should have been classified as liabilities and measured at fair value in the closing date of the merger was subsequent changes in fair value reported as non-operating income or expense, and our consolidated statements of operations each reporting period. Of Tuesday of this week, we filed an amendment to our 2020 Form 10-K to restate our previously filed financial statements. As a result of this restatement, we recorded a $109.3 million non-operating loss related to the warrants. And our warrant liability was $83.6 million as of December 31, 2020. I'll now walk through the financial portion of the presentation that we posted today in conjunction with the earnings release. Looking on Slide 6, we highlight a few metrics for the subscriber portfolio, which continued to be strong across the board. Total subscribers grew 10.2% from 1.55 million to 1.71 million. Average monthly revenue per user our AMRU increase to $67.24 up 3% year-over-year. An increase in AMRU was driven by additional sales of new products, such as our latest generation of outdoor and doorbell cameras, as well as the recognition of deferred revenue. On Slide 7, we cover revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. For the first quarter of 2021 revenue grew by 13.2% with $343.3 million. The revenue growth is attributed to previously mentioned double-digit increase in total subscribers, as well as the increase in the average monthly revenue per user. Adjusted EBITDA grew nicely in the first quarter. The primary drivers for the scaling of service and expense, subscriber acquisition cost. For the quarter we increase our adjusted EBITDA margin by 270 basis points, the 47.2% of revenue, compared to 44.5% in the first quarter of 2020. Moving to Slide 8, we will highlight a few points on the subscribers originated in the first quarter of 2021. A subscriber originations led by a 29% year-over-year growth in our National Inside Sales Channel were 60,127 for the quarter. How and which subscribers we onboard is important to our success today and in the future, and we continue to redefine and boost the underwriting requirements and process to qualify and onboard new subscribers. One of the pauses of the enhanced underwriting requirements is that we are able to reduce the number of retail installment contracts or RICs that are financed on the company's balance sheet. For the first quarter of 2021, we saw a 77% reduction in the number of subscribers financed through retail installment contracts. By shifting a greater proportion of our subscribers away from RICs and towards third party financing partners and pay in full arrangements we're able to reduce our net subscriber acquisition cost and improve the company's cash flow dynamics. Speaking of our third party financing partners, I'm pleased to announce we recently completed a successful renegotiation of our agreement with Citizens Bank, our primary financing partner under the Vivint Flex Pay program. This renewal resulted in a contract extension of three years in the implementation of a new line of credit finance offering through our consumers, which will streamline the initial sales process and facilitate up sales and upgrades of additional and new equipment during a customer's lifecycle. Moving to the new line of credit finance offering changes the timing of when the merchant discount rate and loss your fees are incurred, which will impact the amount of cash in the near term. That said, we are fully committed and intend to operate the business on a cash flow positive basis this year and going forward. Moving to Slide 9, we will cover service costs per subscriber and new subscriber acquisition costs per subscriber. We continued our trend of year-over-year improvements in net service cost per subscriber moving from $11.76 in the first quarter of 2020 to $10.77 in the first quarter of 2021. This reiterates the advantage of Vivint's vertically integrated, smart home cloud platform, which encompasses the software, the hardware, the installation, and ongoing customer support. As we continue to make improvements in all these areas, we're seeing positive trends in both the cost of service as well as customer satisfaction. Our net service margin continued to be in the high 70% range at 77.7% for the first quarter of 2021. A drop in service cost per subscriber is driving a significant portion of the increased in adjusted EBITDA dollars, as well as adjusted EBITDA margin percentage. On the right hand of Slide 9, we highlight net subscriber acquisition costs for the last 12 month period. For the period ended March 31, 2021, net subscriber acquisition costs per new subscriber decreased to $66. That's 93% lower year-over-year, as we continue to drive down the number of new subscribers that are financed via RICs and shipped to a higher mix of customers utilizing our financing partners are paying in full, the purchase of their smart home products. During the quarter, we also continue to benefit from pricing leverage on the point of sale, purchase and installation of equipment. Slide 10 depicts our typical subscriber walk that illustrates some changes in total subscribers at quarter end. One of the pleasant surprises throughout the pandemic has been the performance of our subscriber portfolio. Once again, our attrition improved ending at 11.8%, which is 230 basis points lower year-over-year, and at a nine quarter low. Our portfolio continues to perform better than expected in terms of both attrition and other leading indicators. In terms of cash flow, we saw a nearly $19 million improvement in net cash used in operating activities during the quarter. We finished the first quarter with $274 million of cash on hand and a very strong liquidity position of approximately $600 million. Finally, moving toward guidance for the year on Slide 11. The top of the page highlight several fundamental characteristics of our financial model, including reoccurring monthly revenue from long-term subscriptions, a highly predictable business model and the ability to thrive in all economic environments. We are pleased with the momentum in the business on the strong start to the year. And we're bullish about our ability to operate the direct-to-home sales team during this summer selling season at full capacity. We are also aware of potential supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, and hiring constraints that could limit further upside. Taking all of these factors into consideration, we are confirming our original guidance as follows. We still expect in 2021 with 1.8 million to 1.85 million total subscribers. Our estimate for 2021 revenue continues to be $1.38 billion to $1.42 billion. And finally, we have firm our previous 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance of between $640 million and $655 million. This concludes our prepared remarks on the first quarter. Operator, please open the call for Q&A. Hey, Paul. It's Dale. Thanks for joining the call. We look at it a big part of our growth initiative and some of the stuff we're trying to do is really around camera attach rates. And as, we think that's one of the big selling points and why people really like smart home as one of the big advantages we think our systems have over others, integrated analytics, and the different things that we can do with that, in terms of notices, and so forth with customers. And so part of what we're doing with our pricing and how we're selling and what we're seeing in terms of take rate, or adoption of additional cameras, we're in good shape, we believe right now. But if adoption rates are higher than we think, and if there's any, disruption, in terms of chip manufacturing, and or the big thing, really, one of the big things is logistics frankly, supports and getting and then from the ports, it could be some where we may have to limit the number of cameras, we sell the second, maybe late in the third quarter or fourth quarter. But, we think we've addressed that we're doing some stuff with air spray and shipping. And so, we're just calling that out as to say, hey, based on, we're off to a good start. We think that the year we're going to have a good year. But with some stuff around supply chain, like there's some inflationary pressures out there, there's some hiring constraints, what we're probably no different than other companies as we try to continue to ramp up, especially in the field, in higher and in the markets that we service, have been able to hire enough installers and service professionals to be able to take care of the customers the way we want to take care of them. So, we just kind of put all that stuff together and said hey, based upon on where we are today, and what we see. We think, confirming our guidance, which we think is really good guidance for the year to begin with, is the best path at this point. Todd, I don't know anything you just want to add? Yes, I think the first part, Paul, [indiscernible] in terms of the extension with Citizens, we're very, very pleased with our partnership with Citizens, they've done a very good partner. We've had a relationship during consumer finance with him since early 2017. And so we were glad to be able to extend it, the changes that we're making in that program assistance really has, nothing in terms of the FTC. It was really part of the negotiations to move from the installment line into a, what we call a line of credit, which really is better for us long-term and better for our customers. It's easier for the onboarding process. And then really where we will see the benefit is the additional sales of hardware, either additional products that customers want to take or as we roll out new products, and customers want to have those systems, their line of credit allows for that in a way that the installment loan which was a kind of a fixed loan debt. And so, in reality, the way the terms are set with the line of credit or more standard terms, our terms are ahead with installment loan, we're probably not what with standard industry? We were able to do that, I think early on. So by moving to the line of credit, one of the things that was part of that was we've kind of go to more standard terms around how come, the users of these products pay for that the credit offering from Citizens or from other banks, and then Todd will pick this. That sounds great. Well, so a couple of things. We are \u2013 we agree that investment in continued product enhancement and quality and technologies is critical, so that we can keep our lead in the market and deliver the best services that we can to consumers and that's first and foremost. The quality has got to be there. The values got to be there or continue to drive that. We are investing in new tools and technologies from onboarding customers, underwriting customers; we've built these tools over the years. Some of them we feel need to be refreshed. You'll probably end up seeing within a year or so a platform kind of reinvestment in the platform. Again, we built out our operating system seven, eight years ago. And we believe that there's some updates that can be done and will be done to enhance that, that experience for the consumer, allow us to do more upgrades, have more content for consumers information, consumers and allow us to kind of deliver service to them through those enhanced \u2013 to be enhanced operating system. So, that's going to happen now we're super pleased with the results that have been are, it's early I mean, we started rebranding the marketing, really in Q4. But as you saw with our Q1 numbers, 13%, top line revenue growth compared to \u2013 we're starting to see some momentum there. Now, we are already mentioned earlier that with some supply chain constraints. We're not going to be off to the races, because we have to be, if we do add customers, we need product and hardware to be able to install. So although we're a great year passed out, and we take the numbers and projections we have are strong, the cash flow dynamics of the business, the attrition numbers, our net operating margins, our net SAC are all super strong and improving year-over-year. So, we're really excited about how the company is positioned. And, what the future looks like for this. What? Can you maybe expand? What do you mean? Yes, I mean, it's really within our area of information technology for that area, which we do allocate out the SAC, from that SAC some of that service. So yes, there'll be some of that there. And then some of the brands then that's directly contributed to the media that we're doing is actually being [indiscernible]. But, it's part of like, as we said earlier, when we did the fourth quarter call and talked about kind of what we expect 2021 said, hey, we're going to make investments in really three areas of Todd just talked about, you're going to see those really, you'll start seeing the impact of those in Q2. In terms of where we're kind of really starting to get some of the spend in terms of brand is, as we kind of rolled out the summer sales force. And then as we've hired up for some of the stuff we need to do in technology, and product development, you'll start seeing that kind of come through Q2, Q3. No, Jeff at this point, Jeff, no. I think what we're taught, like Todd said, I think as we get more time in here, and we continue to see how attrition performs, we may picked up, but at this point, I think we're going to stay where [Technical Difficulty] Yes, I think, again, a lot of things we're seeing improvement across the board, right, we're seeing better servicing costs, and as we can continue to drive down service costs, but while still providing really of such exceptional service for our customers, again, moderate \u2013 being able to leverage G&A in terms of what we're spending there. I think overall, we still think kind of in a mid-40s, whether that's 45% to 47%, is really kind of where we see margin that. For the near-term, I think, as we continue to invest in the business and make decisions that we think will help the business long-term being more successful in terms of products, technology, brand, as Todd has mentioned, so that's kind of where we're shooting for today. Thank you, Erik. Sure. I take it through. Our backwards attrition, I think we've kind of said, we think 12% to 13%. If I had the group attrition, I'd say attrition somewhere in the high 11%. That's probably low 13%. So, maybe its 12% to 12.5% is kind of where we think at this point. Again, as Todd said, as we continue to provide a better service, better value to our customer, that they really \u2013 they look at this and say, hey, I need this everyday as part of my life. I mean our interactions that we saw pre-COVID, during COVID, and post-COVID continuing to increase in terms of how many times people are interacting with their system via their app. And so that tells us that and I think one of the things that we actually found in our quarter is that those interactions went up. And I think, part of that's the being able to answer the door, get your deliveries without touchless deliveries, not have to talk to the person, but you can talk them through your video camera, your doorbell camera, those types of things. So, even when people go back to the office, which, I think people will at some point, they've got these uses probably used cases that they've discovered why they were at home, that actually it will be beneficial. And so we kind of \u2013 again, attrition, we're happy where it is. And the thing, I think it's important about attritional service, as somebody mentioned earlier, we're less than 10% of our portfolio is at the end of their initial term is that goes up that have the drop \u2013 that has an impact that will lift attrition, automatically, even though attrition is not really performing worse, is just as you the percent of customers at the end of term, you always see a little bit of a higher percentage of attrition related to those customers. If we can drive that down, then we can lower that long-term attrition number. In terms of the cap structure, I think Todd said, we'll be looking to address that, I think sooner than later, as we you know, want to go ahead and take care, I think we've got some 2022s, 2023s for sure that we'd like to take care of the maturities and extend those. And so I think you'll see us look to be out in the market at some point in the near future. Thank you. Have a good day."

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations.\nKevin Cole: Thank you, Josh. Good morning, and welcome to NRG Energy's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This morning's call will be 45 minutes in length and is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations and Webcasts.  Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements which are based upon assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the safe harbor in today's presentation as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law.  In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's presentation. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's President and CEO.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm joined this morning by Alberto Fornaro, Chief Financial Officer. And also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Home, Rob Gaudette, Head of Business and Market Officer; and Chris Moser, our Head of Competitive Markets and Policy.  Starting on Slide 4 with our key messages for today's presentation. We have made significant progress in advancing our strategic priorities in 2022. And while our financial results were lower than expected, our business is well positioned in 2023.  Today, we are reaffirming our 2023 financial guidance ranges. The Vivint Smart Home acquisition is on track to close by the end of the first quarter. Today, we are providing further disclosures around revenue synergies to ensure you have additional tools to properly value the transaction.  Finally, the core of NRG is strong, supported by favorable fundamentals. The acquisition of Vivint enhances our ability to achieve our free cash flow before growth per share targets.  Now turning to Slide 5 for the financial and operational results of 2022. Beginning with our scorecard for the year, we executed well across our strategic priorities. We delivered our second consecutive year of record safety performance. For me, it always starts and ends with the wellbeing of our people. I want to thank everyone at NRG for staying focused during a challenging year.  Our retail group took deliberate actions to manage price volatility and delivered record customer retention and extended the average term of a new customer to 2 years. Also, our bad debt remained below historical levels despite higher inflation and tightening financial conditions. Our plant operations performance was below expectations, primarily impacted by the outage at [indiscernible] Paris right before the summer.  We are taking additional steps to strengthen our supply and mitigate operational risk during specific conditions.  The direct energy integration is nearing completion and on track to deliver our run rate synergy targets in 2023. We executed on our test and learn program during the year, which culminated in the announcement of the Vivint Smart Home acquisition. We also continue our portfolio optimization with 2 gigawatts of coal retirements and asset sales.  Finally, on capital allocation, we executed $645 million of share repurchases out of the $1 billion program. We will execute the remaining amount when cash is available and when we have full visibility to achieve our targeted credit metrics.  We also increased our dividend by 8%. Since it was reestablished in 2020, we have raised our dividend more than 25% and returned almost $1 billion to shareholders this way. I view our dividend as an integral part of our return on capital policy.  Moving to financial results. We delivered $435 million of adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter bringing our 2022 full year result to $1.754 billion, below expectations. For the fourth quarter, we highlighted in our last earnings call that reaching the bottom end of the financial guidance included a little over $100 million of optimization opportunities. Specifically, making our natural gas units available to capture value during periods of high power prices.  This opportunity did not materialize as mild weather during the quarter, the power price is much lower than expected. We were also impacted by winter storm Elliott in late December primarily from PJM capacity performance payments, where we risk adjusted downward our bonus payments pending additional information from PJM. Alberto will provide more information on our financial results.  Turning to Slide 6, our 2023 outlook. We are reaffirming our 2023 financial guidance. We see improving fundamentals in our business, including more stable supply costs driven by lower natural gas prices, less supply chain issues for coal and chemicals, more favorable retail market conditions in the East and economic resilience in our customer base.  In the East, we see opportunity for customer growth given rising rates from public utilities, enabling competitive retailers to demonstrate the value of our services to customers on an equal playing field.  In Texas, the Public Utility Commission proposed market design improvements that will result in more dispatchable generation and greater reliability of the aircraft grid. I want to commend the Texas Governor's office, legislature, and for taking swift action to enhance grid resilience while ensuring the integrity of the competitive market.  Also, retail competition will open in , Texas in the fall, a city with more than 100,000 electric customers. We look forward to having the opportunity to earn and serve customers in that area later this year.  In 2023, we will continue executing on our strategic priorities focusing on strengthening our core business while growing ideation products and services, as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide. We continue our focus on optimizing our portfolio to better serve our customers. To that effect, we are targeting $500 million in net cash proceeds from asset sales by the end of the year.  Having completed our test and learn phase in 2022, we are now focused on the next phase of our strategic road map, growing the business. This includes completing the direct energy integration and increasing the number of customers that purchase multiple products from us.  Today, we have sold more than 1 product to 15% of our customers. We are making good progress on cross-selling and will provide additional disclosures as we integrate Vivint. To support this growth, we will continue to strengthen our power supply by expanding our capital-light PPA program for renewables to dispatchable generation at some of our existing sites.  Finally, we are on track to close dividend in the first quarter with all regulatory approvals received and no shareholder required. We expect to close financing soon and have begun day one integration efforts.  I want to provide additional insights on how Vivint enhances our core energy platform and brings additional capabilities at scale on Slide 7. Vivint is a leader in smart home solutions with nearly 2 million highly engaged customers with an average life of 9 years. Their system brings together automation, security and residential solar under a single proprietary technology and data platform. This business is highly complementary to our core energy offering. We will use their smart home ecosystem to connect all our currently isolated products and services, including green power, batteries, EVs and other products into a seamless experience that is highly engaging and personalized.  This engagement will provide tremendous insights into pricing, customer experience, a new solutions that create greater brand loyalty and longer average customer lifetime. As we leverage the smart home ecosystem, we expect to optimize energy demand inside the home, providing valuable services to the wholesale markets.  In other words, NRG will be the bridge between the home and energy markets with a unique ability to optimize and monetize value between the two. Vivint will also complement our existing energy product offerings and sales channels by adding home automation, security and residential solar at scale including a proven acquisition engine with a solid track record of growth and nearly 2 million customers.  On the right-hand side of the slide is the virtuous cycle that we have discussed in the past. By leveraging our existing platform, we can access meaningful cost synergies. This economic advantage, coupled with better insights and more personalization, resulting in a better experience for our customers. All of this translates into a deeper understanding of how consumers interact with their homes, additional margin and better retention on our core products and then the cycle repeats as we grow, creating a more valuable business.  Now I want to disclose the value of opportunities that this combination represents on Slide 8. We have identified 3 main areas of value, growing and optimizing our network of customers, leveraging the platform to achieve cost synergies and improving the value of our core energy customers.  With respect to the growth opportunity, we are targeting $300 million of incremental free cash flow before growth by 2025. We are encouraged by the preliminary work we have done on both sets of customers and look forward to fully optimize once the transaction closes.  As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, there is some overlap in our core energy markets, but it's relatively small. This is important because Vivint already has teams ready to be deployed in our core energy markets and because the addressable market opportunity for new customers will be even greater.  We expect to achieve this growth target in several ways as we target Tier 1 customers which we define as single-family homeowners with high credit scores within select urban areas. We will focus on 2 immediate and actionable opportunities. One, cross-selling existing products into our combined customer network of 7.5 million customers; two, selling bundle offers to new customers outside of our network representing 15 million potential households.  In addition, we will grow dividends organically in line with historical levels. These opportunities will be enhanced by optimizing our combined sales channels and best practices, leveraging the strength of both NRG and Vivint.  The capital required to achieve this growth is expected to range $500 million to $600 million over the next 3 years.  For gross synergies, we have identified $100 million to be achieved by 2025, primarily from combining 2 public companies. For these, we expect $160 million of onetime cost to achieve.  Finally, on our existing core energy customers, cross-selling means we can have direct access to our customers in the East and the opportunity to expand margin and extend customer lifetime value. In total, we see a $400 million opportunity by '25 and a larger opportunity beyond given the size of the smart home addressable market.  I am confident in our ability to deliver these targets as we have a strong history of integration and synergy achievement. Just to remind you, since 2016, we have achieved significant value on integration synergies, cost reductions and enhancement programs. This effort will be led by the same team as the transformation plan and direct energy integration. I look forward to providing you a more comprehensive update later this year during our Investor Day.  Now turning to Slide 9. We want to give you an update on our pro forma outlook and how the dividend transaction supports our growth targets. On the left-hand side of the slide is a free cash flow before growth pro forma walk from 2023 to 2025, including the expected growth contribution from Vivint that we just discussed on the previous slide.  This illustrates the earnings power of the company and will be further unpacked once the transaction is closed. On the right-hand side of the slide is the expected capital allocation through 2025. As you can see, the combined platform provides the financial flexibility to have a balanced approach between growth and return of capital while maintaining a strong balance sheet.  The acquisition of Vivint and more specifically, the growth opportunity that it represents will better support our per share growth targets while materially high-grading our earnings quality and customer lifetime value. So with that, I will pass it over to Alberto for the financial review.\nAlberto Fornaro: Thank you, Mauricio. I will now turn to Slide 11 for a review of 2022 results. During our third quarter call, we stated that higher profitability in the fourth quarter would enable us to deliver an adjusted EBITDA at the bottom of our 2022 full year guidance range. To realize this, we mentioned that the higher profitability was partly related to insurance proceeds for Limestone Unit 1 and Paris [indiscernible], additional synergies and other cost reductions and the remaining from the opportunity to generate additional gross margin from the planned utilization of our gas fleet.  Our forecasting process is based on forward market curves and at the time, the forward curves included higher power prices for the fourth quarter which would make the planned utilization of the gas fleet economical. Unfortunately, prices in the fourth quarter fell significantly below short of expectation.  On peak prices in Texas were 45% below expectation, resulting in lower profitability from our generation fleet. Near the end of December, winter storm Elliott brought sharp reduction in temperature for a short time, December 20-24. During the storm, flood surge was faster and significantly higher at the upper level of the expected range in both ERCOT and PJM for several hours. This drove spikes in power prices.  Our gas generation fleet in Texas, which was largely unutilized in the fourth quarter was called in to action. Given the significant gap between actual and expected load, the fleet was unable to completely match the additional demand. As a result, we portrayed additional power in the market at higher prices.  In the East, higher load led to a PJM reliability core for our units without any notice. Several of our larger units were reserved started the event and have longer startup times, which led to capacity performance, a negative impact given the lack of notice.  The lower-than-expected prices at the beginning of the quarter coupled with the impact of the winter storm drove unfavorable variances to our EBITDA expectation. The fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $435 million was below our implied guidance by $196 million. We estimated that the lower prices experienced for most of Q4 reduced the expected contribution of our gas generation by approximately $115 million. We also estimated a winter storm Elliott caused approximately $80 million in negative impact. This was primarily a result of the net impact of capacity performance in PJM as well as increased power purchases in ERCOT that were partially offset by an expected capacity performance bonds for the [indiscernible] plant.  When we look at the full year adjusted EBITDA of $1.754 billion, fell short of the midpoint of guidance at the beginning of 2022 by $346 million. There were 2 main drivers that impacted this result. First, the extended outage at Parish [indiscernible] with $220 million of lost margin that was partially offset by business interruption proceeds of $52 million; and second, the estimated $80 million impact of winter storm Elliott.  There was also an incremental $44 million of pension expenses resulting from reduced prices of financial assets in the second half of the year and some increased O&M expenses. Additional drivers include $15 million of reduced earnings for the divestiture of Watson and $16 million of growth expenses.  In 2022, free cash flow before growth came in at $568 million, with the deficit to our third quarter guidance driven primarily by the shortfall in EBITDA and two working capital drivers. First, that the insurance proceeds for Parish and Limestone that were forecasted for 2022 were accrued in the fourth quarter but received in January 2023, resulting at the end of the year in a $100 million increase in receivables.  Second working capital as an additional negative impact due to falling gas prices in the quarter which more rapidly impacted the account payables than the account received. Turning our attention to 2023, we are reaffirming our full year guidance for both adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth. Before we review the 2023 cash available for allocation, I would like to provide updates with winter storm Yuri and direct energy synergies.  The 2021 net impact of winter storm Yuri was $380 million. During 2022, we were able to increase mitigant proceeds and reduced the total net cost to approximately $259 million. For future years, there will still be some cost recoveries associated with Yuri, but within the amount to be immaterial, and we will no longer update to these fees.  For direct energy synergies, we achieved a total of $84 million of additional synergies in 2022 with the related integration cost of $74 million bringing the total synergy achieved from the acquisition to $259 million. We are confident that we can achieve the remaining synergies, which are related to specific projects that will be completed in 2023. Therefore, we will no longer provide quarterly updates on our direct energy synergy process -- progress, but we will provide a final summary at year-end.  Now turning to Slide 12 for a brief update on our 2023 capital allocation. Moving left to right, with blue shading indicating updates. Excess cash from 2022 is equal to $40 million at year-end, plus $209 million in proceeds from the sales of Astoria which totals $249 million in the bottom left.  Next, for Vivint, we continue to utilize its 2022 pro forma full year figures provided in our December call. Full year free cash flow below growth of $1.73 billion includes energy stand-alone guidance of $1.62 billion plus pro forma $110 million for EBIT. This includes the expected impact from debt financing. In addition, we included a $300 million of cash available from Vivint.  Next [indiscernible], we are targeting $500 million of leverage neutral net inflow from asset sales. The next investments are higher by $29 million following early realization of previously included winter storm Yuri [indiscernible] in 2022. Now moving to the far right bar, we expect a total of $434 million available for future allocation. This will fund the remaining share repurchase program upon full visibility of the achieving of our 2023 target credit metrics, which are detailed on the next slide.  Now quickly turning to Slide 13. We remain committed to a strong balance sheet. This slide has not changed since our last update. We are focused on achieving 2023 target credit metrics and investment grade credit metrics by late 2025 to 2026 through both debt reduction and growth. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mauricio.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Alberto. On Slide 15, I want to briefly outline our 2023 priorities and expectations. First and foremost is delivering on our core energy business goals. We will continue to strengthen our integrated platform and further optimize our portfolio. Second, we are focused on closing the dividend acquisition, integrating the business and delivering on our synergy commitments. Finally, we will stay disciplined on our capital allocation plan as we execute on our strategic priorities.  I am excited about this next phase of our evolution and look forward to providing you a comprehensive update at our Investor Day later this year. So with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. Josh, we're ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Listen, I wanted to talk to you guys about the '25 outlook and just clarify this. As it pertains to the original conversation around, call it, $12.50 a share of , is this an implicit increase in expectations or roughly in the same ballpark? As I look at sort of what's implied on the numerator and denominator, seems like there could be a slight increase there. I just want to come back and clarify that as best you guys see it. And I have a quick follow-up.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes. I mean let me see if I understand the question. The pro forma that we show here could source in line with the free cash flow before growth targets that we provided you at Investor Day of 15% to 20%. So as you mentioned, what Vivint does is complements our share buyback and capital allocation program with a very attractive growth engine that we articulated in the call today.  Now, the Vivint transaction, I'm expecting that it's going to produce $400 million of free cash flow before growth, on top of the 2023 pro forma or guidance for NRG. So when I think about the 2025 pro forma, I will say that I'm very comfortable with the energy pro forma now that we have communicated the contribution of dividend, I will tell you that we have pretty good line of sight to deliver on that commitment of 15% to 20% growth.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. And just clarifying this. I know you discussed an Analyst Day here, would you expect to roll that 25 forward at the time of the Analyst Day? Or could we get something sooner with the close and then considering that closed -- just super quick, if I can, we've seen some litigation out there around and what is possible, if you will, in recent days. Can you clarify how that may be impacting the process itself at this point? Just if you don't mind for a moment?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes. So I think what you should expect is at Investor Day, we'll provide you the 5-year plan that will go beyond 2025. I think that's the right time to articulate it obviously, the close and in subsequent weeks after the close and most likely on the earnings call, we will provide additional clarity in 2023 with respect to event, right? So with respect to the litigation that you're mentioning on the , we actually have looked at that, evaluated it, and we see very little risk in terms of closing the transaction. So keep in mind that this is not only for our industry, this is for all SPAC across all industry. And I see this more as just a clean of process than anything else. So the risk of impacting the closing of the transaction, I would say, is minimal.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport.\nAngie Storozynski: So maybe first on the '23 guidance. I mean it seems like it's a pretty good setup for the year. I mean power prices have fallen, you should have an advantage with gaining market share on the retail side, especially in the East, given the collapse in power prices and natural gas prices, there's been an improvement in working capital, there is the cost to replace the power for the WA Parish outage should have come down, and yet you kept the guidance range. So what's the offset to these positive drivers?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes. No, Angie, I mean I'm glad that you went down the list because when I think about 2023, I would say that it's more conservative than we have did in 2022. Not only from what we control. So if you think about the characteristics of our plans, the assumptions that we use in our forecast are more conservative we have also -- remember now this is the second year that we have increased maintenance CapEx around our plans. So we expect greater reliability on them. And there is a lot of tailwinds on our guidance.  You already mentioned the dynamics in the East where prices for the default service utility providers are much higher, and I think we're going to have a great opportunity to gain market share. With the falling gas prices, that creates really good environment for us for managing our retail margin. So all of this is positive.  Now, let's just -- it's only February, right? So I want to make sure that we see at least a couple of months, and we have greater visibility on the rest of the year before we can provide you additional adjustments. But I think it's fair to say that I feel very confident that we can achieve our guidance and perhaps we are hearing on the conservative side with the number. But I think it is -- I think it's prudent given the type of volatility and extreme weather that we have seen in the past couple of years.\nAngie Storozynski: That's good, especially after this whole year. Okay. And then on the PJM capacity penalties. So it's my understanding that the disclosures that the generation companies were provided by PJM on Slide 8 only talked about penalties. So any sort of bonus capacity payments haven't been disclosed or calculated. So I know that, that's a '22 issue. But just talk to us about how you accounted for those offsets to the penalties on the capacity side.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Sure. I'll let Alberto cover.\nAlberto Fornaro: Yes. No, I mean it is -- from the penalty side, it is relatively simple because we have considered based on our record, what is the potential penalties that they can [indiscernible] in to account. On the bonus side, there is a lot of variables, including potential bankruptcy that can change the amount that will be distributed. And therefore, what we have done with the limited information available, we have estimated what is the best case scenario, the worst-case scenario and we have chosen a level we are comfortable. And therefore, we have, at the end of the day, risk adjusted the bonus for -- that we could get at the end of this process.  We will know more in the in the next months, but we are comfortable with what we have done.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes. So I think it's fair to say that penalties -- we have taken all of that into consideration and bonuses, we need more information from PJM. So we have risk adjusted down for that.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And then lastly, so when you announced the event, there was a plan to execute on share buybacks a pretty meaningful $360 million. I mean, looking at the share count, you haven't done it. I understand that there is a plan for '23 to finish that $1 billion of the share buyback allocation. So just talk to me about the timing, why it hasn't happened yet. Were you waiting for the proceeds from Astoria? Is it somewhat of a reflection of the weak free cash flow generation for '22? And again, just roughly about when we should expect those buybacks to happen.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes. No, I mean that's correct. So my expectation is that it will happen this year and obviously being very consistent with our capital allocation principles, we want to focus first on achieving our credit metrics and then we will -- once we have the visibility in terms of achieving that and obviously, as we get cash proceeds in the door throughout the year, we will be executing on the share repurchases. So my commitment to everybody is that we will execute them, but we need to have first assurance is that we have -- that we meet our commitment on credit metrics and that we have the cash available. So that's how we're thinking about it.\nAngie Storozynski: So it's not like the fact that you deferred the buyback -- it's in no way does that reduce the amount of financing that you will need to raise for the Vivint transaction.\nMauricio Gutierrez: No.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Arcaro: I was wondering if you could elaborate on what assets might be considered for sale and what the potential timing might look like in terms of executing any processes related to that?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes, David. So as you know, we actually have been optimizing our portfolio for a number of years. I think we have a pretty good track record on doing that. And the way I think about it is you have core assets and non-core assets, right? So core assets are whatever helps us best serve our customers. And if there is an asset that doesn't do that function, then it becomes a non-core asset, and we'll look at monetizing that.  There is a second set of things that -- if there is an asset that is more valuable in somebody else's business, we will definitely take a look at that and evaluate all the options. So what I can tell you is, this is an ongoing process. We sold and monetized some assets last year. We're going to do that. What I wanted today was to provide you more specificity around the amount that we are targeting and that this will be executed throughout 2023. In terms of timing, obviously, these will require 2 people coming to an agreement and -- but we will be updating you as soon as we have available information.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay. That's helpful. And then I was wondering if you could speak a bit to just fleet reliability and resilience here. Wondering -- just if you could talk to the strategy to improve the risk profile of the business during extreme heat and cold events. Are there further investments that you could make in your fleet to improve their resilience or more you could do to beef up the supply side of the equation?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes, David. So when you think about the reliability and resiliency, I actually -- if you take a step back, and you think about our supply strategy to serve our retail loan, I think about it in 3 big buckets. The first one is the generation that we own, the second one is medium-term PPAs and then the third one is obviously, you complement that with market purchases.  Today, we are roughly 50% of the megawatts that we serve, we supply with our own generation, 50% with third-party either tools or purchases. So what we have done on the -- on our own generation is twofold. Number one, we have been a little bit more conservative when we run our forecast and what we use to hedge our node in terms of plan characteristics and that gives us a little bit more push on so we're self-insuring.  The second thing is we have actually invested additional maintenance CapEx to increase the reliability on the units, specifically in areas where we have seen issues during scarcity conditions. So those 2 things really mitigate what I described as the operational risk on our units.  The other tool, we actually trade these operational risk or counterparty risk, credit risk. So while it's perhaps more firmer in terms of the megawatts, it also -- we have to monitor the health of the entities that we're transacting with. So what I like about this approach is that we're diversifying our risk that is not a all-generation, all-operational risk. So we actually diversify the risk. And this one was one of the big lessons during winter storm Yuri. So I feel very comfortable the risk adjustment that we have made.  And then lastly, in terms of hedging our loans, we are being a little bit more conservative. So we're leaning perhaps longer than we have done in the past and to make sure that we manage some of the scarcity periods where we see higher load. But obviously, you cannot derisk completely the business because it would be cost prohibitive. So we've been very, very intentional and very thoughtful about.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Fleishman: I appreciate the time. Just a question on the 2023 kind of base pre-Vivint, what are you assuming in there, I guess, obviously, you're expecting a big recovery from '22 and some of the issues, just but what are you assuming in there for outages, any lingering outages and then the related insurance money? And then also are you including any asset sale gains or losses in the guidance for '23? I think you've sold Astoria already at a decent price. Can you talk about that?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes. So we already sold Astoria. And let me just give you my view on the 2023 guidance, which I started talking to and about it, and then I'll pass it on to Alberto to tell you exactly what's the amount. But the way to think about the 2023 speed is more conservative forecast that we have done in the past, both from an operational productivities of the power plants, how we're managing our retail load but also because of the dynamics that existed in 2022 that don't exist today, like if you remember, we have the supply chain issues on coal and chemicals. That has abated for the most part.  We are falling to stable natural gas prices now that allows us to better manage our retail margins. We have an environment in the East where we feel very comfortable that we can gain market share on our retail business. So I think in general, I would say that 2023 is a lot more conservative. The guidance is right on top of what we provided to you back at the Investor Day when you adjust for asset sales which we provided you the bridge back then. So actually, in the Investor Day deck, you have the ins and outs, given the portfolio optimization that we have done. And we're literally on top of where we should have been so -- 2 things. One, I feel very confident that this is in line with what we provided you. And two, that is taking -- we're taking a little bit more of our conservative approach in so the number.  Obviously, we will update you throughout the year. But just keep in mind that we're just at the beginning of the year. But I don't know if there is anything else that we need to add.\nSteven Fleishman: I mean Parish, part, like outage cost insurance and asset sales. Could you identify what's in the guidance for those?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes. So in the guidance, obviously, we have the Parish that is not in the first half of the year because it's on average. What I will tell you in Parish and I think that's probably the largest risk. The progress that we have made is pretty significant. As a matter of fact, I think just last week, we've had the generator now on site and has been listed and put in the deck. So we're making really, really good progress on what I'm seeing today, I'm confident that we will come back on time.  Obviously, the commercial team is monitoring very closely that with the plan. If there is any delays or there is any acceleration that we either mitigate the risk in the market or that we take advantage if it comes in earlier. But in fact, that it's already embedded in guidance but Alberto?\nAlberto Fornaro: Yes. And just to be a little bit more specific, Steve, regarding Parish outage, we said that there is no impact in 2023. And the reason is because of the impact of the availability of the plant was matched by business insurance. We have received a little bit more than the business insurance in 2022. However, we are recalculating the margin. And net-net, it's still completely hedged by -- the loss margin is hedged by what we're going to receive as insurance, and therefore, no change compared to the prior scenario, which was in the third quarter when we provided the guidance.\nSteven Fleishman: And then asset sales?\nAlberto Fornaro: The upsell, we have factored Astoria basically which happened in January. And we are -- for the moment, until there are news, obviously, we are not adjusting.\nMauricio Gutierrez: But it's already -- Astoria, it has already been taken into consideration.\nAlberto Fornaro: Astoria has been considered because it was a -- should have happened at the end of 2022. It happened just a few days after '23 and we took it into consideration in our guidance.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. And how much is that?\nAlberto Fornaro: It's fairly small at the full impact. Consider that we have a tool for the remaining short period. So it's very, very small.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. Great. Appreciate it. So it's really the core business, yes.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the Q&A session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mauricio Gutierrez for any closing remarks.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you. Thank you for your interest in NRG, and I look forward to updating you once we close the transaction on Vivint. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mauricio Gutierrez",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm joined this morning by Alberto Fornaro, Chief Financial Officer. And also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Home, Rob Gaudette, Head of Business and Market Officer; and Chris Moser, our Head of Competitive Markets and Policy.  Starting on Slide 4 with our key messages for today's presentation. We have made significant progress in advancing our strategic priorities in 2022. And while our financial results were lower than expected, our business is well positioned in 2023.  Today, we are reaffirming our 2023 financial guidance ranges. The Vivint Smart Home acquisition is on track to close by the end of the first quarter. Today, we are providing further disclosures around revenue synergies to ensure you have additional tools to properly value the transaction.  Finally, the core of NRG is strong, supported by favorable fundamentals. The acquisition of Vivint enhances our ability to achieve our free cash flow before growth per share targets.  Now turning to Slide 5 for the financial and operational results of 2022. Beginning with our scorecard for the year, we executed well across our strategic priorities. We delivered our second consecutive year of record safety performance. For me, it always starts and ends with the wellbeing of our people. I want to thank everyone at NRG for staying focused during a challenging year.  Our retail group took deliberate actions to manage price volatility and delivered record customer retention and extended the average term of a new customer to 2 years. Also, our bad debt remained below historical levels despite higher inflation and tightening financial conditions. Our plant operations performance was below expectations, primarily impacted by the outage at [indiscernible] Paris right before the summer.  We are taking additional steps to strengthen our supply and mitigate operational risk during specific conditions.  The direct energy integration is nearing completion and on track to deliver our run rate synergy targets in 2023. We executed on our test and learn program during the year, which culminated in the announcement of the Vivint Smart Home acquisition. We also continue our portfolio optimization with 2 gigawatts of coal retirements and asset sales.  Finally, on capital allocation, we executed $645 million of share repurchases out of the $1 billion program. We will execute the remaining amount when cash is available and when we have full visibility to achieve our targeted credit metrics.  We also increased our dividend by 8%. Since it was reestablished in 2020, we have raised our dividend more than 25% and returned almost $1 billion to shareholders this way. I view our dividend as an integral part of our return on capital policy.  Moving to financial results. We delivered $435 million of adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter bringing our 2022 full year result to $1.754 billion, below expectations. For the fourth quarter, we highlighted in our last earnings call that reaching the bottom end of the financial guidance included a little over $100 million of optimization opportunities. Specifically, making our natural gas units available to capture value during periods of high power prices.  This opportunity did not materialize as mild weather during the quarter, the power price is much lower than expected. We were also impacted by winter storm Elliott in late December primarily from PJM capacity performance payments, where we risk adjusted downward our bonus payments pending additional information from PJM. Alberto will provide more information on our financial results.  Turning to Slide 6, our 2023 outlook. We are reaffirming our 2023 financial guidance. We see improving fundamentals in our business, including more stable supply costs driven by lower natural gas prices, less supply chain issues for coal and chemicals, more favorable retail market conditions in the East and economic resilience in our customer base.  In the East, we see opportunity for customer growth given rising rates from public utilities, enabling competitive retailers to demonstrate the value of our services to customers on an equal playing field.  In Texas, the Public Utility Commission proposed market design improvements that will result in more dispatchable generation and greater reliability of the aircraft grid. I want to commend the Texas Governor's office, legislature, and for taking swift action to enhance grid resilience while ensuring the integrity of the competitive market.  Also, retail competition will open in , Texas in the fall, a city with more than 100,000 electric customers. We look forward to having the opportunity to earn and serve customers in that area later this year.  In 2023, we will continue executing on our strategic priorities focusing on strengthening our core business while growing ideation products and services, as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide. We continue our focus on optimizing our portfolio to better serve our customers. To that effect, we are targeting $500 million in net cash proceeds from asset sales by the end of the year.  Having completed our test and learn phase in 2022, we are now focused on the next phase of our strategic road map, growing the business. This includes completing the direct energy integration and increasing the number of customers that purchase multiple products from us.  Today, we have sold more than 1 product to 15% of our customers. We are making good progress on cross-selling and will provide additional disclosures as we integrate Vivint. To support this growth, we will continue to strengthen our power supply by expanding our capital-light PPA program for renewables to dispatchable generation at some of our existing sites.  Finally, we are on track to close dividend in the first quarter with all regulatory approvals received and no shareholder required. We expect to close financing soon and have begun day one integration efforts.  I want to provide additional insights on how Vivint enhances our core energy platform and brings additional capabilities at scale on Slide 7. Vivint is a leader in smart home solutions with nearly 2 million highly engaged customers with an average life of 9 years. Their system brings together automation, security and residential solar under a single proprietary technology and data platform. This business is highly complementary to our core energy offering. We will use their smart home ecosystem to connect all our currently isolated products and services, including green power, batteries, EVs and other products into a seamless experience that is highly engaging and personalized.  This engagement will provide tremendous insights into pricing, customer experience, a new solutions that create greater brand loyalty and longer average customer lifetime. As we leverage the smart home ecosystem, we expect to optimize energy demand inside the home, providing valuable services to the wholesale markets.  In other words, NRG will be the bridge between the home and energy markets with a unique ability to optimize and monetize value between the two. Vivint will also complement our existing energy product offerings and sales channels by adding home automation, security and residential solar at scale including a proven acquisition engine with a solid track record of growth and nearly 2 million customers.  On the right-hand side of the slide is the virtuous cycle that we have discussed in the past. By leveraging our existing platform, we can access meaningful cost synergies. This economic advantage, coupled with better insights and more personalization, resulting in a better experience for our customers. All of this translates into a deeper understanding of how consumers interact with their homes, additional margin and better retention on our core products and then the cycle repeats as we grow, creating a more valuable business.  Now I want to disclose the value of opportunities that this combination represents on Slide 8. We have identified 3 main areas of value, growing and optimizing our network of customers, leveraging the platform to achieve cost synergies and improving the value of our core energy customers.  With respect to the growth opportunity, we are targeting $300 million of incremental free cash flow before growth by 2025. We are encouraged by the preliminary work we have done on both sets of customers and look forward to fully optimize once the transaction closes.  As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, there is some overlap in our core energy markets, but it's relatively small. This is important because Vivint already has teams ready to be deployed in our core energy markets and because the addressable market opportunity for new customers will be even greater.  We expect to achieve this growth target in several ways as we target Tier 1 customers which we define as single-family homeowners with high credit scores within select urban areas. We will focus on 2 immediate and actionable opportunities. One, cross-selling existing products into our combined customer network of 7.5 million customers; two, selling bundle offers to new customers outside of our network representing 15 million potential households.  In addition, we will grow dividends organically in line with historical levels. These opportunities will be enhanced by optimizing our combined sales channels and best practices, leveraging the strength of both NRG and Vivint.  The capital required to achieve this growth is expected to range $500 million to $600 million over the next 3 years.  For gross synergies, we have identified $100 million to be achieved by 2025, primarily from combining 2 public companies. For these, we expect $160 million of onetime cost to achieve.  Finally, on our existing core energy customers, cross-selling means we can have direct access to our customers in the East and the opportunity to expand margin and extend customer lifetime value. In total, we see a $400 million opportunity by '25 and a larger opportunity beyond given the size of the smart home addressable market.  I am confident in our ability to deliver these targets as we have a strong history of integration and synergy achievement. Just to remind you, since 2016, we have achieved significant value on integration synergies, cost reductions and enhancement programs. This effort will be led by the same team as the transformation plan and direct energy integration. I look forward to providing you a more comprehensive update later this year during our Investor Day.  Now turning to Slide 9. We want to give you an update on our pro forma outlook and how the dividend transaction supports our growth targets. On the left-hand side of the slide is a free cash flow before growth pro forma walk from 2023 to 2025, including the expected growth contribution from Vivint that we just discussed on the previous slide.  This illustrates the earnings power of the company and will be further unpacked once the transaction is closed. On the right-hand side of the slide is the expected capital allocation through 2025. As you can see, the combined platform provides the financial flexibility to have a balanced approach between growth and return of capital while maintaining a strong balance sheet.  The acquisition of Vivint and more specifically, the growth opportunity that it represents will better support our per share growth targets while materially high-grading our earnings quality and customer lifetime value. So with that, I will pass it over to Alberto for the financial review. Thank you, Alberto. On Slide 15, I want to briefly outline our 2023 priorities and expectations. First and foremost is delivering on our core energy business goals. We will continue to strengthen our integrated platform and further optimize our portfolio. Second, we are focused on closing the dividend acquisition, integrating the business and delivering on our synergy commitments. Finally, we will stay disciplined on our capital allocation plan as we execute on our strategic priorities.  I am excited about this next phase of our evolution and look forward to providing you a comprehensive update at our Investor Day later this year. So with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. Josh, we're ready to open the line for questions. Yes. I mean let me see if I understand the question. The pro forma that we show here could source in line with the free cash flow before growth targets that we provided you at Investor Day of 15% to 20%. So as you mentioned, what Vivint does is complements our share buyback and capital allocation program with a very attractive growth engine that we articulated in the call today.  Now, the Vivint transaction, I'm expecting that it's going to produce $400 million of free cash flow before growth, on top of the 2023 pro forma or guidance for NRG. So when I think about the 2025 pro forma, I will say that I'm very comfortable with the energy pro forma now that we have communicated the contribution of dividend, I will tell you that we have pretty good line of sight to deliver on that commitment of 15% to 20% growth. Yes. So I think what you should expect is at Investor Day, we'll provide you the 5-year plan that will go beyond 2025. I think that's the right time to articulate it obviously, the close and in subsequent weeks after the close and most likely on the earnings call, we will provide additional clarity in 2023 with respect to event, right? So with respect to the litigation that you're mentioning on the , we actually have looked at that, evaluated it, and we see very little risk in terms of closing the transaction. So keep in mind that this is not only for our industry, this is for all SPAC across all industry. And I see this more as just a clean of process than anything else. So the risk of impacting the closing of the transaction, I would say, is minimal. Yes. No, Angie, I mean I'm glad that you went down the list because when I think about 2023, I would say that it's more conservative than we have did in 2022. Not only from what we control. So if you think about the characteristics of our plans, the assumptions that we use in our forecast are more conservative we have also -- remember now this is the second year that we have increased maintenance CapEx around our plans. So we expect greater reliability on them. And there is a lot of tailwinds on our guidance.  You already mentioned the dynamics in the East where prices for the default service utility providers are much higher, and I think we're going to have a great opportunity to gain market share. With the falling gas prices, that creates really good environment for us for managing our retail margin. So all of this is positive.  Now, let's just -- it's only February, right? So I want to make sure that we see at least a couple of months, and we have greater visibility on the rest of the year before we can provide you additional adjustments. But I think it's fair to say that I feel very confident that we can achieve our guidance and perhaps we are hearing on the conservative side with the number. But I think it is -- I think it's prudent given the type of volatility and extreme weather that we have seen in the past couple of years. Sure. I'll let Alberto cover. Yes. So I think it's fair to say that penalties -- we have taken all of that into consideration and bonuses, we need more information from PJM. So we have risk adjusted down for that. Yes. No, I mean that's correct. So my expectation is that it will happen this year and obviously being very consistent with our capital allocation principles, we want to focus first on achieving our credit metrics and then we will -- once we have the visibility in terms of achieving that and obviously, as we get cash proceeds in the door throughout the year, we will be executing on the share repurchases. So my commitment to everybody is that we will execute them, but we need to have first assurance is that we have -- that we meet our commitment on credit metrics and that we have the cash available. So that's how we're thinking about it. No. Yes, David. So as you know, we actually have been optimizing our portfolio for a number of years. I think we have a pretty good track record on doing that. And the way I think about it is you have core assets and non-core assets, right? So core assets are whatever helps us best serve our customers. And if there is an asset that doesn't do that function, then it becomes a non-core asset, and we'll look at monetizing that.  There is a second set of things that -- if there is an asset that is more valuable in somebody else's business, we will definitely take a look at that and evaluate all the options. So what I can tell you is, this is an ongoing process. We sold and monetized some assets last year. We're going to do that. What I wanted today was to provide you more specificity around the amount that we are targeting and that this will be executed throughout 2023. In terms of timing, obviously, these will require 2 people coming to an agreement and -- but we will be updating you as soon as we have available information. Yes, David. So when you think about the reliability and resiliency, I actually -- if you take a step back, and you think about our supply strategy to serve our retail loan, I think about it in 3 big buckets. The first one is the generation that we own, the second one is medium-term PPAs and then the third one is obviously, you complement that with market purchases.  Today, we are roughly 50% of the megawatts that we serve, we supply with our own generation, 50% with third-party either tools or purchases. So what we have done on the -- on our own generation is twofold. Number one, we have been a little bit more conservative when we run our forecast and what we use to hedge our node in terms of plan characteristics and that gives us a little bit more push on so we're self-insuring.  The second thing is we have actually invested additional maintenance CapEx to increase the reliability on the units, specifically in areas where we have seen issues during scarcity conditions. So those 2 things really mitigate what I described as the operational risk on our units.  The other tool, we actually trade these operational risk or counterparty risk, credit risk. So while it's perhaps more firmer in terms of the megawatts, it also -- we have to monitor the health of the entities that we're transacting with. So what I like about this approach is that we're diversifying our risk that is not a all-generation, all-operational risk. So we actually diversify the risk. And this one was one of the big lessons during winter storm Yuri. So I feel very comfortable the risk adjustment that we have made.  And then lastly, in terms of hedging our loans, we are being a little bit more conservative. So we're leaning perhaps longer than we have done in the past and to make sure that we manage some of the scarcity periods where we see higher load. But obviously, you cannot derisk completely the business because it would be cost prohibitive. So we've been very, very intentional and very thoughtful about. Yes. So we already sold Astoria. And let me just give you my view on the 2023 guidance, which I started talking to and about it, and then I'll pass it on to Alberto to tell you exactly what's the amount. But the way to think about the 2023 speed is more conservative forecast that we have done in the past, both from an operational productivities of the power plants, how we're managing our retail load but also because of the dynamics that existed in 2022 that don't exist today, like if you remember, we have the supply chain issues on coal and chemicals. That has abated for the most part.  We are falling to stable natural gas prices now that allows us to better manage our retail margins. We have an environment in the East where we feel very comfortable that we can gain market share on our retail business. So I think in general, I would say that 2023 is a lot more conservative. The guidance is right on top of what we provided to you back at the Investor Day when you adjust for asset sales which we provided you the bridge back then. So actually, in the Investor Day deck, you have the ins and outs, given the portfolio optimization that we have done. And we're literally on top of where we should have been so -- 2 things. One, I feel very confident that this is in line with what we provided you. And two, that is taking -- we're taking a little bit more of our conservative approach in so the number.  Obviously, we will update you throughout the year. But just keep in mind that we're just at the beginning of the year. But I don't know if there is anything else that we need to add. Yes. So in the guidance, obviously, we have the Parish that is not in the first half of the year because it's on average. What I will tell you in Parish and I think that's probably the largest risk. The progress that we have made is pretty significant. As a matter of fact, I think just last week, we've had the generator now on site and has been listed and put in the deck. So we're making really, really good progress on what I'm seeing today, I'm confident that we will come back on time.  Obviously, the commercial team is monitoring very closely that with the plan. If there is any delays or there is any acceleration that we either mitigate the risk in the market or that we take advantage if it comes in earlier. But in fact, that it's already embedded in guidance but Alberto? But it's already -- Astoria, it has already been taken into consideration. Thank you. Thank you for your interest in NRG, and I look forward to updating you once we close the transaction on Vivint. Thank you."

            "name": "Alberto Fornaro",
            "content": "Thank you, Mauricio. I will now turn to Slide 11 for a review of 2022 results. During our third quarter call, we stated that higher profitability in the fourth quarter would enable us to deliver an adjusted EBITDA at the bottom of our 2022 full year guidance range. To realize this, we mentioned that the higher profitability was partly related to insurance proceeds for Limestone Unit 1 and Paris [indiscernible], additional synergies and other cost reductions and the remaining from the opportunity to generate additional gross margin from the planned utilization of our gas fleet.  Our forecasting process is based on forward market curves and at the time, the forward curves included higher power prices for the fourth quarter which would make the planned utilization of the gas fleet economical. Unfortunately, prices in the fourth quarter fell significantly below short of expectation.  On peak prices in Texas were 45% below expectation, resulting in lower profitability from our generation fleet. Near the end of December, winter storm Elliott brought sharp reduction in temperature for a short time, December 20-24. During the storm, flood surge was faster and significantly higher at the upper level of the expected range in both ERCOT and PJM for several hours. This drove spikes in power prices.  Our gas generation fleet in Texas, which was largely unutilized in the fourth quarter was called in to action. Given the significant gap between actual and expected load, the fleet was unable to completely match the additional demand. As a result, we portrayed additional power in the market at higher prices.  In the East, higher load led to a PJM reliability core for our units without any notice. Several of our larger units were reserved started the event and have longer startup times, which led to capacity performance, a negative impact given the lack of notice.  The lower-than-expected prices at the beginning of the quarter coupled with the impact of the winter storm drove unfavorable variances to our EBITDA expectation. The fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $435 million was below our implied guidance by $196 million. We estimated that the lower prices experienced for most of Q4 reduced the expected contribution of our gas generation by approximately $115 million. We also estimated a winter storm Elliott caused approximately $80 million in negative impact. This was primarily a result of the net impact of capacity performance in PJM as well as increased power purchases in ERCOT that were partially offset by an expected capacity performance bonds for the [indiscernible] plant.  When we look at the full year adjusted EBITDA of $1.754 billion, fell short of the midpoint of guidance at the beginning of 2022 by $346 million. There were 2 main drivers that impacted this result. First, the extended outage at Parish [indiscernible] with $220 million of lost margin that was partially offset by business interruption proceeds of $52 million; and second, the estimated $80 million impact of winter storm Elliott.  There was also an incremental $44 million of pension expenses resulting from reduced prices of financial assets in the second half of the year and some increased O&M expenses. Additional drivers include $15 million of reduced earnings for the divestiture of Watson and $16 million of growth expenses.  In 2022, free cash flow before growth came in at $568 million, with the deficit to our third quarter guidance driven primarily by the shortfall in EBITDA and two working capital drivers. First, that the insurance proceeds for Parish and Limestone that were forecasted for 2022 were accrued in the fourth quarter but received in January 2023, resulting at the end of the year in a $100 million increase in receivables.  Second working capital as an additional negative impact due to falling gas prices in the quarter which more rapidly impacted the account payables than the account received. Turning our attention to 2023, we are reaffirming our full year guidance for both adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth. Before we review the 2023 cash available for allocation, I would like to provide updates with winter storm Yuri and direct energy synergies.  The 2021 net impact of winter storm Yuri was $380 million. During 2022, we were able to increase mitigant proceeds and reduced the total net cost to approximately $259 million. For future years, there will still be some cost recoveries associated with Yuri, but within the amount to be immaterial, and we will no longer update to these fees.  For direct energy synergies, we achieved a total of $84 million of additional synergies in 2022 with the related integration cost of $74 million bringing the total synergy achieved from the acquisition to $259 million. We are confident that we can achieve the remaining synergies, which are related to specific projects that will be completed in 2023. Therefore, we will no longer provide quarterly updates on our direct energy synergy process -- progress, but we will provide a final summary at year-end.  Now turning to Slide 12 for a brief update on our 2023 capital allocation. Moving left to right, with blue shading indicating updates. Excess cash from 2022 is equal to $40 million at year-end, plus $209 million in proceeds from the sales of Astoria which totals $249 million in the bottom left.  Next, for Vivint, we continue to utilize its 2022 pro forma full year figures provided in our December call. Full year free cash flow below growth of $1.73 billion includes energy stand-alone guidance of $1.62 billion plus pro forma $110 million for EBIT. This includes the expected impact from debt financing. In addition, we included a $300 million of cash available from Vivint.  Next [indiscernible], we are targeting $500 million of leverage neutral net inflow from asset sales. The next investments are higher by $29 million following early realization of previously included winter storm Yuri [indiscernible] in 2022. Now moving to the far right bar, we expect a total of $434 million available for future allocation. This will fund the remaining share repurchase program upon full visibility of the achieving of our 2023 target credit metrics, which are detailed on the next slide.  Now quickly turning to Slide 13. We remain committed to a strong balance sheet. This slide has not changed since our last update. We are focused on achieving 2023 target credit metrics and investment grade credit metrics by late 2025 to 2026 through both debt reduction and growth. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mauricio. Yes. No, I mean it is -- from the penalty side, it is relatively simple because we have considered based on our record, what is the potential penalties that they can [indiscernible] in to account. On the bonus side, there is a lot of variables, including potential bankruptcy that can change the amount that will be distributed. And therefore, what we have done with the limited information available, we have estimated what is the best case scenario, the worst-case scenario and we have chosen a level we are comfortable. And therefore, we have, at the end of the day, risk adjusted the bonus for -- that we could get at the end of this process.  We will know more in the in the next months, but we are comfortable with what we have done. Yes. And just to be a little bit more specific, Steve, regarding Parish outage, we said that there is no impact in 2023. And the reason is because of the impact of the availability of the plant was matched by business insurance. We have received a little bit more than the business insurance in 2022. However, we are recalculating the margin. And net-net, it's still completely hedged by -- the loss margin is hedged by what we're going to receive as insurance, and therefore, no change compared to the prior scenario, which was in the third quarter when we provided the guidance. The upsell, we have factored Astoria basically which happened in January. And we are -- for the moment, until there are news, obviously, we are not adjusting. Astoria has been considered because it was a -- should have happened at the end of 2022. It happened just a few days after '23 and we took it into consideration in our guidance. It's fairly small at the full impact. Consider that we have a tool for the remaining short period. So it's very, very small."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKevin Cole: Thank you, Katherine. Good morning and welcome to NRG Energy\u2019s third quarter 2022 earnings call. This morning\u2019s call will be 45 minutes in length and being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations and Webcast. Please note that today\u2019s discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor in today\u2019s presentation as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures, please see the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Please refer to today\u2019s presentation. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG\u2019s President and CEO.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone and thank you for your interest in NRG. I am joined this morning by Alberto Fornaro, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Home; Rob Gaudette, Head of Business and Market Operations; and Chris Moser, our Head of Competitive Markets and Policy. I\u2019d like to start with the three key messages for today\u2019s presentation on Slide 4. We are narrowing our 2022 EBITDA guidance to the bottom end of the range, as we indicated on our last earnings call and we are initiating 2023 financial guidance in line with our Investor Day plan. We continue to make good progress on our strategic priorities and have now completed the initial phase of our test and learn program. The insights that we have gained from this process will inform our next phase of growing from our core energy business into adjacent essential home services. Finally, as I committed to you, we are announcing our 2023 capital allocation plan, which includes an incremental $600 million share repurchase program, consistent with our long-term capital allocation principles. Our business performed well during the third quarter, which was characterized by extreme price volatility and record load in our key Texas market. I am very proud of our team which once again achieved another quarter of top decile safety performance despite these challenging market conditions. As you can see on Slide 5, we delivered $452 million of adjusted EBITDA entirety of the change compared to last year was previously identified with 60% coming from asset sales and transitory impacts and 40% from the unplanned outage at our W.A. Parish facility. With these results, we are narrowing our 2022 EBITDA guidance to the bottom end of the range. Alberto will provide additional details in his section. We also made good progress on all our key strategic priorities. We have now achieved our direct energy synergy target for 2022 and remain on track to achieve the full run-rate of $300 million by next year. We continue to optimize our generation portfolio by retiring uneconomic fossil fuel plants, monetizing non-core assets and partnering for brownfield development. As part of this effort, we are selling the Astoria side for approximately $200 million in net cash proceeds. On our growth program, we continue to focus on cross-selling power and gas to our existing customer network. And with respect to our test and learn program, we have gained significant insights and are ready to start executing on our plan. I will discuss in greater detail later in the presentation. We also have made good progress on our $1 billion share repurchase program for 2022 with $603 million completed to-date and $397 million yet to be completed. Finally, today, we are introducing 2023 financial guidance of $2.27 billion to $2.47 billion of adjusted EBITDA and $1.52 billion to $1.72 billion of free cash flow before growth in line with our Investor Day outlook. As I mentioned to you, weather conditions in Texas were extreme this past summer, with ERCOT surpassing the old peak demand record 39x driven by record heating the early part of the summer and a strong Texas economy. As you can see on the bottom left of the Slide 6, power price expectations, which are shown in the light blue bars were as wide as I have ever seen them. This volatility was the result of record low, coupled with uncertainty around production from non-dispatchable renewable generation. Importantly, it took record sustained hit coupled with low renewable production to materialize into the high real-time power prices we experienced in May and July. It is worth pointing out that even during these scarcity periods, we never triggered an emergency event, not even once. This is a testament that the Texas grid is strong and working as intended with enough capacity to meet current and future demand. Turning to the right hand side of the slide, we continue to see strong demand from our customers with no notable increase in bad debt levels. Retention has also remained strong, driven in part by our unmatched insights to pricing and customer preference, which enables us to navigate periods of high price and high volatility. We have also been successful in extending the average term of a new Texas customer contract to 2 years. This extension is good for both our customers and our shareholders, given it adds stability and predictability to customer bills and our earnings. On the supply side, our generation portfolio performed well during the summer while the team managed the impact of the W.A. Parish Unit 8 outage. We were able to expand our maintenance program ahead of the summer, which resulted in better operational performance. Looking ahead, and as I discussed in our last call, we will increase maintenance capital in our plants, given higher power prices. Now I\u2019d like to spend some time talking about our ongoing efforts in moving closer to the customer. We introduced the diagram on Slide 7 during our Investor Day to capture our vision of the smart home. As you can see from the table on the right, we have made substantial progress in laying the foundation to execute on our vision to become the leading provider of essential services at home. During the year, we evaluated over a dozen adjacent offerings and engaged in multiple partnership pilots for EVs on solar and other home services. By starting small, it allowed us to stay nimble, while gathering critical market intelligence to inform how we approach these new customer offerings. The result of these programs helps validate our assumptions and provides confidence in how to execute our customer-centric strategy. Now, let me put a finer point on our key findings on Slide 8. First, the Internet of Things is here and is enabling the smart home opportunity. People are connecting new devices everyday with an average of 25 devices per home. This number has more than doubled since 2019 and continues to grow rapidly, resulting in multiple interfaces that don\u2019t necessarily interact with each other. Customers want simple, connected and customized experiences. It is clear that a single interface for the home is of increasing importance and customer attitudes around these services are shifting from nice to have to need to have. Next, the electrification of the economy through smart technology and clean energy choices is real. We are seeing an increasing number of devices and appliances connected like HVAC, water heaters, battery, rooftop solar, and other, in addition to having greater penetration of electric vehicles. Finally, customers are demanding access to cleaner, affordable and more resilient solutions. This is in part driven by a desire to be a part of a more sustainable future, reinforced by a need for resiliency in the face of more extreme weather. And importantly, this has been accelerated by advancements in technology and policy. With this integrated ecosystem at home, there is a significant value opportunity as you can see on the right hand side of the slide. For NRG, we can offer adjacent products and services that leverages our existing energy operating platform, allowing us to access cost savings and provide superior customer experience. This advantage means broader insights into how customers interact with their homes, which translates into additional margin opportunities and increased brand loyalty. Now turning to Slide 9, in 2023, we will increase efforts to grow our bundled expansion products and services through a mix of existing offerings, strategic partnerships and vertical integration. All of them aimed at making NRG the leading provider of essential services at home. We are also providing our capital allocation plan for 2023, which is in line with our long-term capital allocation principles. Our plan is to return 50% of our capital available for allocation to our shareholders with an incremental $600 million share repurchase program and an 8% increase in our annual dividend. For the remaining 50%, we are allocating $331 million to identify growth investments and reserving $620 million to be deployed throughout the year to the highest return opportunity between growth and share repurchases. So with that, I will pass it over to Alberto for the financial review.\nAlberto Fornaro: Thank you, Mauricio. I will now turn to Slide 11 for a review of the third quarter results. Energy delivered $452 million in adjusted EBITDA, a $350 million decline versus prior year. Similar to our Q2 results, this year-over-year decline was the result of previously announced variances. As shown in the chart on the bottom left side of the slide, \u20ac190 million of the decline was from asset sales and retirements, plus the transitory items included in our initial guidance. The remaining $125 million variance is almost entirely due to the replacement power costs related to the unplanned Parish Unit 8 outage and maintenance expenses in the same unit for which we expect reimbursement from the property insurance company in Q4 of this year. Texas adjusted EBITDA declined $263 million compared to the third quarter of last year. July was the second hottest month of record dating back to 1895 which drove extreme price volatility and higher load. This amplified the financial impact of the unplanned outage given the need to replace this power with a mix of higher cost internal generation and market purchases to satisfy the weather-driven increase in demand. Q3 results in Texas were also impacted by higher operating costs in the form of increased maintenance expense. Approximately half of the increase was for work at W.A. Parish Unit 8 that will be reimbursed by insurance in Q4 and the remaining increase from our maintenance program that helped insurers\u2019 strong reliability of the rest of the fleet through a volatile summer. Turning to the East, West & other segment, the year-over-year decline of \u20ac52 million was primarily driven by the reduction from previously announced asset sales and retirement and supply chain constraints. Now after taking those items into account, adjusted EBITDA increased by $111 million compared to Q3 2021 from increased revenue rate, natural gas optimization and operations at Cato [ph]. Briefly referencing year-to-date results, Energy has delivered adjusted EBITDA of $1.39 billion, a $671 million decline versus prior year. The drivers of our year-to-date results are similar to that of the quarter with permanent and transitory items, the unplanned outage of W.A. Parish Unit 8 and increased maintenance expenses driving the decline versus prior year. The free cash flow before growth for both Q3 and year-to-date results have been impacted by reduced year-over-year EBITDA levels, as discussed earlier, and an increase in net working capital. Working capital requirements increased progressively during the year due to higher gas and power prices and in Q3 to the combined effect of higher seasonal power receivables and natural gas inventories. We have also seen a $32 million increase year-over-year in maintenance CapEx, driven entirely by spending to repay the Limestone and the W.A. Parish Unit 8 facility. This increased spend will be recovered by year end through property insurance proceeds. Next, I want to update you on the achievement of direct energy synergies. We have achieved our full year target of $50 million during the quarter and continue to remain focused on achieving the full $300 million run-rate next year. Now moving to the full year 2022 guidance, we are narrowing our adjusted EBITDA range to $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion. In line with my previous comment of success in partially offsetting the $220 million negative impact from Parish Unit 8 and planned outage. At this time, we are at the bottom of the range. Now given the implied strong Q4 results, let me provide additional details. We are expecting over a $200 million increase versus prior year, about $100 million coming from direct energy synergies, insurance proceeds for Limestone and Parish and other general cost reduction, the remaining coming from power and natural gas optimization opportunity leading us to make our natural gas fleet fully available in Q4. Now turning to 2022 free cash flow before growth guidance, we are reducing our full year guidance range to $950 million to $1.050 billion with one-third of the reduction from the narrowing of the adjusted EBITDA guidance and two-thirds from the temporary increase in working capital from higher prices and inventories. And so as we head into the winter season, we made a conscious decision to increase our inventory levels for both natural gas and coal to provide contingency against the transportation challenges and the potential for extreme winter weather driving a $50 million reduction in the free cash flow for the year. We have captured the reversal of these higher inventory quantities in our guidance for 2023, which I will discuss later in the call. In addition to the higher inventory quantities, prices for natural gas and power have also increased since the last call, resulting in an additional value of our inventories and net receivables for approximately $140 million. which will be reversed with lower commodity prices. The combined $190 million impact of these factors result in reduced expectation for 2022 and free cash flow before group. I will now turn to Slide 12 for an update on our planned 2022 capital allocation Consistent with past practice we have highlighted change from last quarter in blue. Starting from the left, we have updated the midpoint of our free cash flow before growth guidance by $290 million, $100 million EBITDA guidance and $190 million from increases in working capital. As you know, cash generation is a key objective for energy. And our team has been focused on offsetting this negative impact. We were able to assess a significant portion of those reductions by capturing $212 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of Astoria allowing us to utilize and distribute capital consistent with our commitments. Next, we expect to capture an additional $6 million from winter store remittance related to additional recovery. Next, we continue to make progress in executing our $1 billion share repurchase program. At the end of October, we have $397 million to be completed by around year end. And finally, we have committed $100 million of operating CapEx spend related to our $2 billion growth plan, which when coupled with our investments, other investments leads to $286 million of capital available for allocation. Moving to 2023, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth guidance, we are pleased to announce that our expectation for 2023, in line with previous targets. We\u2019re introducing strong 2023 financial guidance of $2.27 billion to $2.47 billion for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth of $1.52 billion to $1.72 billion. EBITDA guidance includes the full year impact of asset sales and other permanent banks that we captured in our guidance for 2022. Although we expect some continued impact from cold constraints, we are able to offset those and the other transitory items that impacted our 2022 guidance. I will now turn to Slide 14 for the introduction of our 2023 $1.9 billion capital allocation plan. As Mauricio mentioned, in his section, our capital allocation is directly in line with our long-standing principle and cadence of allocation. Today, we are starting the conversation by allocating 50% to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases and allocating a portion of the 50% opportunistic back to identified group, leaving 35% to be allocated throughout the year to the highest returning investments while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Now moving left to right, we start with the midpoint of our free cash flow before growth guidance range of $1.62 billion, plus $286 million of unallocated 2022 CAFA, capital available for allocation, totaling $1.9 million in capital for allocation. Next, we have allocated $220 million identified for our growth program and $111 million for other investment to fund additional investment to support the integration of Direct Energy, innovation projects and Small Book acquisition. Next, on return on capital, we are allocating $347 million to dividends, consistent with our 7% to 9% annual dividend per share growth target and announcing a new share repurchase program of $600 million to be executed immediately following the full execution of our current $1 billion program. Finally, this leaves $628 million of 2023 capital available for allocation to be allocated throughout the year. We look forward to providing you with updates to our progress throughout 2022. Back to you, Mauricio.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Alberto. I want to provide some closing thoughts on Slide 16. We have made significant progress across all of our key priorities this year, including the direct energy integration, portfolio optimization and our test and learn program and returning capital to shareholders. I\u2019m incredibly proud of the team\u2019s efforts and focus over the last 24 months on executing our strategy. As we look into 2023 and beyond, we remain on track to achieve our long-term goals of high grading our earnings quality by expanding our customer lifetime value. and providing a compelling annual total return to our shareholders of 15% to 20% free cash flow before growth per share and 7% to 9% annual dividend growth. Our platform is well positioned to deliver strong and predictable results and create significant shareholder value as the leading essential home services provider. I look forward to updating you on our progress along the way. So with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. Katherine, we\u2019re now ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, Mauricio and team, pleasure to speak here. Thank you, guys. \nMauricio Gutierrez: Hey, good morning, Julien.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning. I hope the parade made things okay this morning.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Well, it disrupted traffic a little bit, but there is nothing like a great celebration after that win.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Absolutely, absolutely. Well, hey, listen, I just wanted to start off strategically here. We\u2019ve been at it for a little bit here in the transformation, power prices remained relatively higher. How do you think about this state of the generation portfolio overall, how are you thinking about and evolving your decision tree on that? Obviously, we saw a story here in the quarter. But even beyond that, how are you seeing things, whether that\u2019s tied to or driven by IRA or otherwise here in terms of optimizing your generation portfolio?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Julian. Well, so let me take a little bit of a step back because obviously, you need to look at the generation portfolio in light of our integrated retail platform, right? I mean we have said that the goal of the generation portfolio now is to help better supply and serve our customer needs. So when I think about our generation portfolio, I think about our overall supply strategy, and that is one where we have decided to diversify our supply to have some internal generation to have third-party PPAs and obviously, market purchases. All of those three things make our supply strategy. Now with respect to the generation portfolio, as you mentioned, higher power prices have led us to basically self-insure to have greater reliability because the value of each megawatt is much higher today than it was just 10 months ago with higher power prices and higher gas prices. So that\u2019s why you\u2019re going to see an increase in our maintenance capital because we want to make sure that we have greater reliability on our fleet. Obviously, we\u2019re always optimizing our supply. And right now, the value that it provides for our integrated platform is very high. But if there is \u2013 there is always an opportunity to optimize that generation portfolio depending on market conditions and the opportunities that we see in the market.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Alright. Fair enough. I\u2019ll leave it there. Let me dive if I can to the other side of this equation, and that is just the guidance and sort of the cadence of the guidance. Great. Obviously, the implied fourth quarter is reasonably elevated. And certainly, that\u2019s despite some of the ongoing pressure points that we saw in the third quarter. Can you talk about what that implies to the cadence of results into \u201823 here? How do you think about the first half? How do you think about third quarter going forward, given the sort of evolution in your business model? Should third quarter into the future be perhaps a little bit more depressed relatively speaking? Can you just elaborate on what the implications are? Maybe that\u2019s been an Alberto question here?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes. Well, I\u2019ll turn to at but let me just give a little framework. I mean I think the big takeaway, I hope for everybody is that in 2023, we go back to the guidance or the outlook that we provided during our Investor Day. Our EBITDA guidance and our free cash flow guidance goes back in line with what we provided to you last year. We\u2019re turning the page. And we\u2019re just excited about the opportunities that we have to continue growing our business, our core energy business, but importantly, adjacent products and services. With respect to the seasonality of earnings, I think you should expect us going back to where we were perhaps in 2021. But Alberto, can you provide additional insights here.\nAlberto Fornaro: Yes. I think more than looking at first half versus the second half, I would say that probably you will see these two critical quarters have been the second and the third. And so you will see probably more balance and more in line, as Mauricio said, with the past and potentially even the fourth quarter that this year is higher than normal. So I would say, again, probably get back to 2021 profile is what we should expect.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. Excellent. And that\u2019s inclusive of some of these coal dynamics annualizing here in the first half and some of the outage dynamics still net-net-net \u201821 kind of profile?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes. I mean if you think about some of these coal supply issues, we were very transparent last year when we introduced them. And the team has done a tremendous job in mitigating these core supply chain issues, particularly in Texas, I mean we continue to have some things in the East, and team is just working through that. But as I mentioned to all of you when we introduced these are temporary. The call supply chain was significantly stretched because of the very rapid increase in natural gas prices. And I also said with time both coal suppliers and railroad providers scale off again their operations, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in our \u2013 with our key suppliers.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Alright, guys. I will leave it there. Go Stros.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Go Stros. Thank you, Julien.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Your line is open.\nJames Kennedy: Hey, guys. Good morning. It\u2019s actually James for Shar. Congrats on update, and thanks for taking the question.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Hey, good morning.\nJames Kennedy: So I guess just starting with the \u201823 capital allocation plan, what are the trigger points of the time line expectations for the balance of the uncommitted capital? Are you potentially looking at more growth as we get through the year? Or is this just simply a function of waiting to see how the business performs through the first half?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Well, yes, so two things. The first one is, as I committed to all of you, this year, we\u2019re actually announcing both our earnings guidance as well as our capital allocation. If you remember in the past, we used to provide the capital allocation in the fourth quarter earnings call. So the first thing is we\u2019re now providing these to much earlier than in the past. The second thing is always our capital allocation, we try to \u2013 the cadence happens with the cadence on when we generate cash, and this is not going to be any different. But as I said on my prepared remarks, the additional excess cash that we have available for allocation will be allocated throughout the year based on the highest return opportunity that we have. 2023, we start executing on our plan. We\u2019re evaluating opportunities. But if these opportunities don\u2019t yield a highest return compared to a share buyback, then we will allocate that to share buybacks, just that simple.\nJames Kennedy: Okay. And then I guess kind of a similar question on the growth CapEx. How should we think about the timing and shape of any EBITDA accretion as you ramp up that spend? Is it something that we get more color on in steps as we roll the coming quarters or just any color there?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes. Well, I mean, remember that as we execute on our plan, we always have three options, right? We either build them or grow organically, we partner or we buy them, we acquire something. So in the build or organic growth, there is always a lag between when you make the investment and when you receive some of those earnings. And in the \u2013 similar to the partner, and I would say the acquisition, that really accelerates earnings immediately, right? So we\u2019re right now evaluating options and our both our business model and our go to market. The one thing that I will say is, as I think about the growth, there are some areas that \u2013 well, first of all, it\u2019s a very narrow scope and I provided that scope in the slide that I present to you today. The second thing is there are some areas where we know that we\u2019re not going to do it, that the business model is such that we will partner, for example, home solar. We\u2019re not going to go into the entire value chain of home solar. We are going to partner. We have a lot of lessons learned here, and I have been very clear about that. So the pace of which the earnings are going to come in, it is really going to be dictated by how do we execute our strategy and we go to market. So it will be provided to you in the coming quarters as we start executing.\nJames Kennedy: Okay, I will leave it there. Thank you very much, guys.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, James.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Your line is open.\nAngie Storozynski: Thank you. So first, on the IRA, the Inflation Reduction Act. So I see that there is a $45 million increase in cash taxes in your \u201823 free cash flow guidance. So \u2013 and I know that we\u2019re still waiting for the IRS to provide some more clarity on cash taxes. But can you talk in general how you see it over the next couple of years?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Good morning. Angie, I\u2019ll pass it to Alberto.\nAlberto Fornaro: Yes. First of all, Angie, let me say that the increase in the taxes \u2013 the tax payment that you see for 2023 are really due to two factors. One, we are forecasting a higher net income for the year and therefore, higher federal and state taxes. And the other piece is we got a refund for the BE on the DT side in 2022, that will not happen in 2023. And therefore, they are more or less half and of that explained increase year-over-year. We have \u2013 from the IRA, we have factored in our forecast the impact of the 1% taxes on share buybacks. However, there is no impact for the higher \u2013 for the minimum tax because at this moment, we don\u2019t have any indication that the payment based on 2023 net income will be done in 2023. And so when we have more information regarding when this payment, if any, is due, then we will update you. In general, I would say, as we have said in the past that it\u2019s very difficult to do forecasting based on the level of information that we have. But so far, all the indication is for relatively modest impact and also is a temporary impact that will recover after a few years. As soon as we get more details, we will be more precise.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. Thank you. And then separately, also related to the same legislation, so I am assuming that you are seeing some pickup in renewable power growth, especially in Texas and I am just wondering if that means that you should soon announce some additional PPAs again, given that the availability of specialty solar assets should increase in Texas?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Sure. I will have Rob address that Angie.\nRob Gaudette: Hi Angie, good morning. So, when you think about the IRA, you are spot on, right. It provides clarity to the renewable developers. We are in the market all the time, right. So, it\u2019s not \u2013 we have been kind of at this for a while. So, there is a couple of factors in here that we think about. One is availability for them to get their panels on the ground and get them installed. It\u2019s the developers in the pipeline that they are kind of working through. And then the IRA provides them some clarity around their financing. So, what I would expect, I haven\u2019t seen it yet, but I would expect that some of this clarity starts coming into more certainty around offers into us. And as opportunities show up, we will lock those up as they make sense for our portfolio. But you are right, the IRA should push solar, wind and battery development across all markets in the U.S.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes. And particularly in Texas, when you look at the plan that ERCOT provides and what we are tracking, I mean most of the new generation is really renewable energy. So, this should help and accelerate. We have this capability pretty well. It\u2019s a well-oiled machine. We have been executing before there was a slowdown, and our expectation is going to pick up, and we have great visibility as to when that happens and also the economics around it.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And my last question is the maintenance expense, maintenance CapEx in 2023. So, I understand that you are spending more money in light of the higher level of power prices. But is this a level that we should actually expect going forward? Is this just a one-off year with like some major maintenance something that was either pulled forward or catch up from previous years?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Well, I mean I will ask Alberto to address some of it. I mean my take, remember, 2023 has two big components, right. I mean the first one is the money that goes into the Unit 8 at W.A. Parish. And then the second one, obviously, is the increase in maintenance because we want our self-insured given that every megawatt is more valuable with higher power prices. I mean that\u2019s something that the market is going to dictate. What I will tell you is Adam incredibly proud of the team that is so near on our generation fleet during years where gas prices were very low, they tightened the belt, they adjusted the maintenance. It was the right decision because not every megawatt was as valuable as it is today. We very quickly pivoted to that. And as I mentioned, we put some capital at work before the summer that yielded really good results. And we are going to continue to do that. So \u2013 but I don\u2019t know if there is anything else you want.\nAlberto Fornaro: Yes. I just would like to point you to in the appendix, there is a page in which we highlight the impact on our maintenance CapEx coming in 2022 from Limestone and Parish and also for 2023. Long story short, when you eliminate the impact of these specific CapEx that we spend, you will see that there is around $40 million to $50 million increase in the maintenance CapEx, and this is really due to the fact that Mauricio was mentioning that given the current prices, we think that it is appropriate to increase the reliability of our fleet to basically catch all the opportunity that the current price environment is offering to us.\nAngie Storozynski: Alright. Thank you.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Angie.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nMichael Lapides: Hey guy. Congrats on a good quarter.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Michael.\nMichael Lapides: I am looking at Slide 14. And I just want to make sure I understand some of this and a little bit of this may be more nuanced. So, the growth plan, the $220 million, can you \u2013 what asset \u2013 is that for one big asset, or is it for lots of little things?\nMauricio Gutierrez: No. It is a \u2013 I mean this is really to support our test and learn. So, we have identified a number of opportunities and the scope of those opportunities are actually on Slide 7, Michael. So, when you look at whether it is solar, storage, electric vehicles, energy management, protection, security, I mean the scope is really around essential services, and this is what we have been able to identify today. Obviously, we are working through the execution of our plan and we will provide updates as we \u2013 throughout the year.\nMichael Lapides: So, let me just \u2013 and this might be one for Alberto. So, the $220 million in the growth plan and the $111 million and the other investments, are these all \u2013 like when I look through the three statements at this time next year, are they going to flow through CapEx or are they going to flow through cash from operating activities, meaning is it working capital, or do some of these actually weigh on EBITDA until they start generating EBITDA? Like your guidance for EBITDA would be higher if you weren\u2019t \u2013 if you weren\u2019t doing the spin.\nAlberto Fornaro: No. Regarding \u2013 okay, regarding the other investments, these do not impact EBITDA, there outside EBITDA. When you look at the growth plans there is a series of initiatives, and we will update you about what is going to EBITDA or not. But for the moment, it\u2019s still \u2013 as Mauricio said, it\u2019s a series of different initiatives and depending on which one we will prioritize, it will have more CapEx impact or not.\nMichael Lapides: Meaning some of the \u2013 alright, so the $111 million is all based \u2013 about $111 million is all capitalized. And the $220 million, some of it is capitalized and some of it is flowing through G&A or O&M? And therefore, I am just trying to make sure because like I am trying to think about recurring versus non-recurring impacts on EBITDA.\nAlberto Fornaro: That is a very good question. And what you said is correct. The $111 million, they will not impact EBITDA, the $220 million. There are some initiatives that could have an impact on OpEx and others that have an impact on CapEx. And we will qualify that in the next quarter.\nMauricio Gutierrez: And just to put a finer point here, Michael. I mean the $220 million, and I want to highlight what could impact, right. But as we are in the process of executing and depending on how do we finalize the go-to-market will have an impact on whether it goes to CapEx and OpEx. So, that\u2019s as they say, CBD [ph] to be determined, Michael. But we will provide that transparency as we start executing on the plan.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Okay. Thanks guys. I will follow-up offline.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. We have a question from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nDavid Arcaro: Hi. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Hey. Good morning David.\nDavid Arcaro: I am wondering if you could talk a little bit to customer growth trends that you are seeing and any churn in the business? Are you still seeing kind of a flight to safety in this backdrop and this high commodity price backdrop, noticed that there was a slight decline in the total customer count versus the prior quarter? So, I am curious any information there.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Sure. Elizabeth?\nElizabeth Killinger: Yes. Thanks for the question, David. We were really pleased with our performance, the team and the engine during a really volatile third quarter. We did perform, continued to perform in third quarter as we had year-to-date better than our budget. You may recall from prior discussions, we do generally see customer attrition from large M&A, which was DE, which was very large as well as from small book acquisitions, which we have done a handful of those year-to-date. But the good news is we are performing better than expected on both DE and the customer books. From a sales engine perspective, we are \u2013 we have a very strong engine over-performance in the quarter occurred in both our face-to-face and our digital channels. And cross-serve also performed very well during the quarter, better than budget. And from a retention perspective, we also are seeing really strong performance given the backdrop of very high prices from both the cost increases associated with the power to fulfill for them as well as the higher usage during some of the weather that we experienced. So, really pleased with the attrition during the quarter and looking forward to continuing to deliver for you guys.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes. And just \u2013 I mean the team does a fantastic job on balancing customer account and margin. And that\u2019s what we do every day. We have tremendous insights from our customers. And as Elizabeth said, both our retention numbers and our bad debt numbers are pretty well in line, very robust and customer count is just a result of a very intentional strategy around balancing customer account and retail margins. So, I am very pleased with the team.\nDavid Arcaro: Got it. Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then I was wondering if \u2013 maybe two quicker ones, but does the 2023 outlook include business interruption insurance proceeds coming in? Wondering how much of that might be in the guidance? And then maybe just a little more higher level, Mauricio, is there still more to do in terms of portfolio and real estate optimization with where the business currently stands? Is that something you will be looking at into 2023 as well?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Sure, Alberto?\nAlberto Fornaro: Yes. Regarding the business insurance proceeds, I can confirm what we said in the prior year call and basically the negative impact of Parish 8 in the first half of 2023 will be absorbed by the insurance proceeds, and we have factored in our forecast.\nMauricio Gutierrez: And with respect to the portfolio optimization, again, I mean this is something that we are looking on a continuous basis. We haven\u2019t stopped. I mean the Astoria sale in Watson is an example of what we are doing. A couple of quarters ago, I said that we are going to move into evaluating brownfield development, both in our Midwest fleet as well as in Texas. The team has been working on looking at these opportunities. And what I will tell you is also we are looking at potential partnering opportunities because we want to make sure that we \u2013 the capital that we use is the right structure. I don\u2019t want to create friction in the system if we don\u2019t have to. So, both in terms of brownfield opportunities and in terms of partnering opportunities, we have been very busy, and I hope to give you a more fulsome update in the coming quarters.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay. Great. Thanks so much. I appreciate it.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, David.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nSteve Fleishman: Hi. Good morning. Thanks. So, just for the 2022 guidance, the \u2013 I think your Texas segment is down $275 million maybe from the initial guide. How much of that is attributed to the Parish, Limestone outages net of any money you are getting back this year?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Hey. Good morning Steve. I will turn it to Alberto.\nAlberto Fornaro: Yes. And it\u2019s almost entirely the full amount that we highlighted in $220 million, Steve. So, that\u2019s the main, okay.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And then the $175 million boost in East-West other. Could you just explain what\u2019s driving that?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes. Normally, Steve, we are very conservative of when we plan our gas optimization activity this year, given the fact there has been a lot of volatility, the performance has been very good in that area. And also, obviously, we are benefited so from some higher margin from prices coming from our generation fleet in the East. But normally, you will see that if we do better in the East is driven by the gas.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And then just as we think about the \u201823 guidance, are you assuming that, that better optimization continues or that, that\u2026\nMauricio Gutierrez: Now, we are more established.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes. It\u2019s always \u2013 I mean Steve, we always use market as an indication to guide us in terms of the profitability of our portfolio, right. So, if you look at the heat rates for 2023, we use market prices, market heat rates to inform our guidance.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Thank you. And then just the $400 million \u2013 $397 million of buyback, you intend to complete that fully in the market by year-end, not when you are going to do an ASR or something or?\nMauricio Gutierrez: I mean our intention is to complete towards the end of the year, and that\u2019s basically our plan right now.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And then on ERCOT market structure, I mean it\u2019s kind of gotten quiet, but I think there is a lot about to happen. So, just to the degree that they put in some kind of dispatchable market, separate market, how are you thinking about how that impacts your portfolio and how you manage that through the retail side?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Well, I mean, a couple of things. And I think you are absolutely right, Steve. It\u2019s going to get really busy. I think middle of November, there is going to be a recommendation from ERCOT and the PUCT. We have been working with them alongside throughout this entire time. We provided a number of initiatives. I know that they are evaluating. At the end of the day, I think that\u2019s also going to be informed by how the Texas grid has operated. And as I said, I mean we broke the load record 39x this summer. And not even once we went into EA1, emergency situation. So, I think the grid is, well, when I look at the pipeline, it is very robust with lots of new renewable generation, so enough to meet current demand and future demand. So, I think that\u2019s going to inform some of it. At the end of the day, they end up with some sort of dispatchable product. We have been working really hard in terms of the brownfield opportunities on our own sites. And obviously, that will play really well for participants like us who have sites in good locations already connected to the grid. And I think that gives us a cost advantage that we intend to fully utilize and monetize.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Thank you.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: Thank you. And there is no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the call back to Mauricio Gutierrez, President and CEO, for closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Catherine. Well, thank you all for your interest in NRG. And I look forward to continue updating you as we move to our next phase in the company. So, thank you all for your attention.\nOperator: And thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the call.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mauricio Gutierrez",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone and thank you for your interest in NRG. I am joined this morning by Alberto Fornaro, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Home; Rob Gaudette, Head of Business and Market Operations; and Chris Moser, our Head of Competitive Markets and Policy. I'd like to start with the three key messages for today's presentation on Slide 4. We are narrowing our 2022 EBITDA guidance to the bottom end of the range, as we indicated on our last earnings call and we are initiating 2023 financial guidance in line with our Investor Day plan. We continue to make good progress on our strategic priorities and have now completed the initial phase of our test and learn program. The insights that we have gained from this process will inform our next phase of growing from our core energy business into adjacent essential home services. Finally, as I committed to you, we are announcing our 2023 capital allocation plan, which includes an incremental $600 million share repurchase program, consistent with our long-term capital allocation principles. Our business performed well during the third quarter, which was characterized by extreme price volatility and record load in our key Texas market. I am very proud of our team which once again achieved another quarter of top decile safety performance despite these challenging market conditions. As you can see on Slide 5, we delivered $452 million of adjusted EBITDA entirety of the change compared to last year was previously identified with 60% coming from asset sales and transitory impacts and 40% from the unplanned outage at our W.A. Parish facility. With these results, we are narrowing our 2022 EBITDA guidance to the bottom end of the range. Alberto will provide additional details in his section. We also made good progress on all our key strategic priorities. We have now achieved our direct energy synergy target for 2022 and remain on track to achieve the full run-rate of $300 million by next year. We continue to optimize our generation portfolio by retiring uneconomic fossil fuel plants, monetizing non-core assets and partnering for brownfield development. As part of this effort, we are selling the Astoria side for approximately $200 million in net cash proceeds. On our growth program, we continue to focus on cross-selling power and gas to our existing customer network. And with respect to our test and learn program, we have gained significant insights and are ready to start executing on our plan. I will discuss in greater detail later in the presentation. We also have made good progress on our $1 billion share repurchase program for 2022 with $603 million completed to-date and $397 million yet to be completed. Finally, today, we are introducing 2023 financial guidance of $2.27 billion to $2.47 billion of adjusted EBITDA and $1.52 billion to $1.72 billion of free cash flow before growth in line with our Investor Day outlook. As I mentioned to you, weather conditions in Texas were extreme this past summer, with ERCOT surpassing the old peak demand record 39x driven by record heating the early part of the summer and a strong Texas economy. As you can see on the bottom left of the Slide 6, power price expectations, which are shown in the light blue bars were as wide as I have ever seen them. This volatility was the result of record low, coupled with uncertainty around production from non-dispatchable renewable generation. Importantly, it took record sustained hit coupled with low renewable production to materialize into the high real-time power prices we experienced in May and July. It is worth pointing out that even during these scarcity periods, we never triggered an emergency event, not even once. This is a testament that the Texas grid is strong and working as intended with enough capacity to meet current and future demand. Turning to the right hand side of the slide, we continue to see strong demand from our customers with no notable increase in bad debt levels. Retention has also remained strong, driven in part by our unmatched insights to pricing and customer preference, which enables us to navigate periods of high price and high volatility. We have also been successful in extending the average term of a new Texas customer contract to 2 years. This extension is good for both our customers and our shareholders, given it adds stability and predictability to customer bills and our earnings. On the supply side, our generation portfolio performed well during the summer while the team managed the impact of the W.A. Parish Unit 8 outage. We were able to expand our maintenance program ahead of the summer, which resulted in better operational performance. Looking ahead, and as I discussed in our last call, we will increase maintenance capital in our plants, given higher power prices. Now I'd like to spend some time talking about our ongoing efforts in moving closer to the customer. We introduced the diagram on Slide 7 during our Investor Day to capture our vision of the smart home. As you can see from the table on the right, we have made substantial progress in laying the foundation to execute on our vision to become the leading provider of essential services at home. During the year, we evaluated over a dozen adjacent offerings and engaged in multiple partnership pilots for EVs on solar and other home services. By starting small, it allowed us to stay nimble, while gathering critical market intelligence to inform how we approach these new customer offerings. The result of these programs helps validate our assumptions and provides confidence in how to execute our customer-centric strategy. Now, let me put a finer point on our key findings on Slide 8. First, the Internet of Things is here and is enabling the smart home opportunity. People are connecting new devices everyday with an average of 25 devices per home. This number has more than doubled since 2019 and continues to grow rapidly, resulting in multiple interfaces that don't necessarily interact with each other. Customers want simple, connected and customized experiences. It is clear that a single interface for the home is of increasing importance and customer attitudes around these services are shifting from nice to have to need to have. Next, the electrification of the economy through smart technology and clean energy choices is real. We are seeing an increasing number of devices and appliances connected like HVAC, water heaters, battery, rooftop solar, and other, in addition to having greater penetration of electric vehicles. Finally, customers are demanding access to cleaner, affordable and more resilient solutions. This is in part driven by a desire to be a part of a more sustainable future, reinforced by a need for resiliency in the face of more extreme weather. And importantly, this has been accelerated by advancements in technology and policy. With this integrated ecosystem at home, there is a significant value opportunity as you can see on the right hand side of the slide. For NRG, we can offer adjacent products and services that leverages our existing energy operating platform, allowing us to access cost savings and provide superior customer experience. This advantage means broader insights into how customers interact with their homes, which translates into additional margin opportunities and increased brand loyalty. Now turning to Slide 9, in 2023, we will increase efforts to grow our bundled expansion products and services through a mix of existing offerings, strategic partnerships and vertical integration. All of them aimed at making NRG the leading provider of essential services at home. We are also providing our capital allocation plan for 2023, which is in line with our long-term capital allocation principles. Our plan is to return 50% of our capital available for allocation to our shareholders with an incremental $600 million share repurchase program and an 8% increase in our annual dividend. For the remaining 50%, we are allocating $331 million to identify growth investments and reserving $620 million to be deployed throughout the year to the highest return opportunity between growth and share repurchases. So with that, I will pass it over to Alberto for the financial review. Thank you, Alberto. I want to provide some closing thoughts on Slide 16. We have made significant progress across all of our key priorities this year, including the direct energy integration, portfolio optimization and our test and learn program and returning capital to shareholders. I'm incredibly proud of the team's efforts and focus over the last 24 months on executing our strategy. As we look into 2023 and beyond, we remain on track to achieve our long-term goals of high grading our earnings quality by expanding our customer lifetime value. and providing a compelling annual total return to our shareholders of 15% to 20% free cash flow before growth per share and 7% to 9% annual dividend growth. Our platform is well positioned to deliver strong and predictable results and create significant shareholder value as the leading essential home services provider. I look forward to updating you on our progress along the way. So with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. Katherine, we're now ready to open the line for questions. Hey, good morning, Julien. Well, it disrupted traffic a little bit, but there is nothing like a great celebration after that win. Thank you, Julian. Well, so let me take a little bit of a step back because obviously, you need to look at the generation portfolio in light of our integrated retail platform, right? I mean we have said that the goal of the generation portfolio now is to help better supply and serve our customer needs. So when I think about our generation portfolio, I think about our overall supply strategy, and that is one where we have decided to diversify our supply to have some internal generation to have third-party PPAs and obviously, market purchases. All of those three things make our supply strategy. Now with respect to the generation portfolio, as you mentioned, higher power prices have led us to basically self-insure to have greater reliability because the value of each megawatt is much higher today than it was just 10 months ago with higher power prices and higher gas prices. So that's why you're going to see an increase in our maintenance capital because we want to make sure that we have greater reliability on our fleet. Obviously, we're always optimizing our supply. And right now, the value that it provides for our integrated platform is very high. But if there is \u2013 there is always an opportunity to optimize that generation portfolio depending on market conditions and the opportunities that we see in the market. Yes. Well, I'll turn to at but let me just give a little framework. I mean I think the big takeaway, I hope for everybody is that in 2023, we go back to the guidance or the outlook that we provided during our Investor Day. Our EBITDA guidance and our free cash flow guidance goes back in line with what we provided to you last year. We're turning the page. And we're just excited about the opportunities that we have to continue growing our business, our core energy business, but importantly, adjacent products and services. With respect to the seasonality of earnings, I think you should expect us going back to where we were perhaps in 2021. But Alberto, can you provide additional insights here. Yes. I mean if you think about some of these coal supply issues, we were very transparent last year when we introduced them. And the team has done a tremendous job in mitigating these core supply chain issues, particularly in Texas, I mean we continue to have some things in the East, and team is just working through that. But as I mentioned to all of you when we introduced these are temporary. The call supply chain was significantly stretched because of the very rapid increase in natural gas prices. And I also said with time both coal suppliers and railroad providers scale off again their operations, and that's what we're seeing in our \u2013 with our key suppliers. Go Stros. Thank you, Julien. Hey, good morning. Well, yes, so two things. The first one is, as I committed to all of you, this year, we're actually announcing both our earnings guidance as well as our capital allocation. If you remember in the past, we used to provide the capital allocation in the fourth quarter earnings call. So the first thing is we're now providing these to much earlier than in the past. The second thing is always our capital allocation, we try to \u2013 the cadence happens with the cadence on when we generate cash, and this is not going to be any different. But as I said on my prepared remarks, the additional excess cash that we have available for allocation will be allocated throughout the year based on the highest return opportunity that we have. 2023, we start executing on our plan. We're evaluating opportunities. But if these opportunities don't yield a highest return compared to a share buyback, then we will allocate that to share buybacks, just that simple. Yes. Well, I mean, remember that as we execute on our plan, we always have three options, right? We either build them or grow organically, we partner or we buy them, we acquire something. So in the build or organic growth, there is always a lag between when you make the investment and when you receive some of those earnings. And in the \u2013 similar to the partner, and I would say the acquisition, that really accelerates earnings immediately, right? So we're right now evaluating options and our both our business model and our go to market. The one thing that I will say is, as I think about the growth, there are some areas that \u2013 well, first of all, it's a very narrow scope and I provided that scope in the slide that I present to you today. The second thing is there are some areas where we know that we're not going to do it, that the business model is such that we will partner, for example, home solar. We're not going to go into the entire value chain of home solar. We are going to partner. We have a lot of lessons learned here, and I have been very clear about that. So the pace of which the earnings are going to come in, it is really going to be dictated by how do we execute our strategy and we go to market. So it will be provided to you in the coming quarters as we start executing. Thank you, James. Good morning. Angie, I'll pass it to Alberto. Sure. I will have Rob address that Angie. Yes. And particularly in Texas, when you look at the plan that ERCOT provides and what we are tracking, I mean most of the new generation is really renewable energy. So, this should help and accelerate. We have this capability pretty well. It's a well-oiled machine. We have been executing before there was a slowdown, and our expectation is going to pick up, and we have great visibility as to when that happens and also the economics around it. Well, I mean I will ask Alberto to address some of it. I mean my take, remember, 2023 has two big components, right. I mean the first one is the money that goes into the Unit 8 at W.A. Parish. And then the second one, obviously, is the increase in maintenance because we want our self-insured given that every megawatt is more valuable with higher power prices. I mean that's something that the market is going to dictate. What I will tell you is Adam incredibly proud of the team that is so near on our generation fleet during years where gas prices were very low, they tightened the belt, they adjusted the maintenance. It was the right decision because not every megawatt was as valuable as it is today. We very quickly pivoted to that. And as I mentioned, we put some capital at work before the summer that yielded really good results. And we are going to continue to do that. So \u2013 but I don't know if there is anything else you want. Thank you, Angie. Thank you, Michael. No. It is a \u2013 I mean this is really to support our test and learn. So, we have identified a number of opportunities and the scope of those opportunities are actually on Slide 7, Michael. So, when you look at whether it is solar, storage, electric vehicles, energy management, protection, security, I mean the scope is really around essential services, and this is what we have been able to identify today. Obviously, we are working through the execution of our plan and we will provide updates as we \u2013 throughout the year. And just to put a finer point here, Michael. I mean the $220 million, and I want to highlight what could impact, right. But as we are in the process of executing and depending on how do we finalize the go-to-market will have an impact on whether it goes to CapEx and OpEx. So, that's as they say, CBD [ph] to be determined, Michael. But we will provide that transparency as we start executing on the plan. Thank you, Michael. Hey. Good morning David. Sure. Elizabeth? Yes. And just \u2013 I mean the team does a fantastic job on balancing customer account and margin. And that's what we do every day. We have tremendous insights from our customers. And as Elizabeth said, both our retention numbers and our bad debt numbers are pretty well in line, very robust and customer count is just a result of a very intentional strategy around balancing customer account and retail margins. So, I am very pleased with the team. Sure, Alberto? And with respect to the portfolio optimization, again, I mean this is something that we are looking on a continuous basis. We haven't stopped. I mean the Astoria sale in Watson is an example of what we are doing. A couple of quarters ago, I said that we are going to move into evaluating brownfield development, both in our Midwest fleet as well as in Texas. The team has been working on looking at these opportunities. And what I will tell you is also we are looking at potential partnering opportunities because we want to make sure that we \u2013 the capital that we use is the right structure. I don't want to create friction in the system if we don't have to. So, both in terms of brownfield opportunities and in terms of partnering opportunities, we have been very busy, and I hope to give you a more fulsome update in the coming quarters. Thank you, David. Hey. Good morning Steve. I will turn it to Alberto. Yes. Normally, Steve, we are very conservative of when we plan our gas optimization activity this year, given the fact there has been a lot of volatility, the performance has been very good in that area. And also, obviously, we are benefited so from some higher margin from prices coming from our generation fleet in the East. But normally, you will see that if we do better in the East is driven by the gas. Now, we are more established. Yes. It's always \u2013 I mean Steve, we always use market as an indication to guide us in terms of the profitability of our portfolio, right. So, if you look at the heat rates for 2023, we use market prices, market heat rates to inform our guidance. I mean our intention is to complete towards the end of the year, and that's basically our plan right now. Well, I mean, a couple of things. And I think you are absolutely right, Steve. It's going to get really busy. I think middle of November, there is going to be a recommendation from ERCOT and the PUCT. We have been working with them alongside throughout this entire time. We provided a number of initiatives. I know that they are evaluating. At the end of the day, I think that's also going to be informed by how the Texas grid has operated. And as I said, I mean we broke the load record 39x this summer. And not even once we went into EA1, emergency situation. So, I think the grid is, well, when I look at the pipeline, it is very robust with lots of new renewable generation, so enough to meet current demand and future demand. So, I think that's going to inform some of it. At the end of the day, they end up with some sort of dispatchable product. We have been working really hard in terms of the brownfield opportunities on our own sites. And obviously, that will play really well for participants like us who have sites in good locations already connected to the grid. And I think that gives us a cost advantage that we intend to fully utilize and monetize. Thank you, Steve."

            "content": "Yes. Thanks for the question, David. We were really pleased with our performance, the team and the engine during a really volatile third quarter. We did perform, continued to perform in third quarter as we had year-to-date better than our budget. You may recall from prior discussions, we do generally see customer attrition from large M&A, which was DE, which was very large as well as from small book acquisitions, which we have done a handful of those year-to-date. But the good news is we are performing better than expected on both DE and the customer books. From a sales engine perspective, we are \u2013 we have a very strong engine over-performance in the quarter occurred in both our face-to-face and our digital channels. And cross-serve also performed very well during the quarter, better than budget. And from a retention perspective, we also are seeing really strong performance given the backdrop of very high prices from both the cost increases associated with the power to fulfill for them as well as the higher usage during some of the weather that we experienced. So, really pleased with the attrition during the quarter and looking forward to continuing to deliver for you guys."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Alberto Fornaro",
            "content": "Thank you, Mauricio. I will now turn to Slide 11 for a review of the third quarter results. Energy delivered $452 million in adjusted EBITDA, a $350 million decline versus prior year. Similar to our Q2 results, this year-over-year decline was the result of previously announced variances. As shown in the chart on the bottom left side of the slide, \u20ac190 million of the decline was from asset sales and retirements, plus the transitory items included in our initial guidance. The remaining $125 million variance is almost entirely due to the replacement power costs related to the unplanned Parish Unit 8 outage and maintenance expenses in the same unit for which we expect reimbursement from the property insurance company in Q4 of this year. Texas adjusted EBITDA declined $263 million compared to the third quarter of last year. July was the second hottest month of record dating back to 1895 which drove extreme price volatility and higher load. This amplified the financial impact of the unplanned outage given the need to replace this power with a mix of higher cost internal generation and market purchases to satisfy the weather-driven increase in demand. Q3 results in Texas were also impacted by higher operating costs in the form of increased maintenance expense. Approximately half of the increase was for work at W.A. Parish Unit 8 that will be reimbursed by insurance in Q4 and the remaining increase from our maintenance program that helped insurers' strong reliability of the rest of the fleet through a volatile summer. Turning to the East, West & other segment, the year-over-year decline of \u20ac52 million was primarily driven by the reduction from previously announced asset sales and retirement and supply chain constraints. Now after taking those items into account, adjusted EBITDA increased by $111 million compared to Q3 2021 from increased revenue rate, natural gas optimization and operations at Cato [ph]. Briefly referencing year-to-date results, Energy has delivered adjusted EBITDA of $1.39 billion, a $671 million decline versus prior year. The drivers of our year-to-date results are similar to that of the quarter with permanent and transitory items, the unplanned outage of W.A. Parish Unit 8 and increased maintenance expenses driving the decline versus prior year. The free cash flow before growth for both Q3 and year-to-date results have been impacted by reduced year-over-year EBITDA levels, as discussed earlier, and an increase in net working capital. Working capital requirements increased progressively during the year due to higher gas and power prices and in Q3 to the combined effect of higher seasonal power receivables and natural gas inventories. We have also seen a $32 million increase year-over-year in maintenance CapEx, driven entirely by spending to repay the Limestone and the W.A. Parish Unit 8 facility. This increased spend will be recovered by year end through property insurance proceeds. Next, I want to update you on the achievement of direct energy synergies. We have achieved our full year target of $50 million during the quarter and continue to remain focused on achieving the full $300 million run-rate next year. Now moving to the full year 2022 guidance, we are narrowing our adjusted EBITDA range to $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion. In line with my previous comment of success in partially offsetting the $220 million negative impact from Parish Unit 8 and planned outage. At this time, we are at the bottom of the range. Now given the implied strong Q4 results, let me provide additional details. We are expecting over a $200 million increase versus prior year, about $100 million coming from direct energy synergies, insurance proceeds for Limestone and Parish and other general cost reduction, the remaining coming from power and natural gas optimization opportunity leading us to make our natural gas fleet fully available in Q4. Now turning to 2022 free cash flow before growth guidance, we are reducing our full year guidance range to $950 million to $1.050 billion with one-third of the reduction from the narrowing of the adjusted EBITDA guidance and two-thirds from the temporary increase in working capital from higher prices and inventories. And so as we head into the winter season, we made a conscious decision to increase our inventory levels for both natural gas and coal to provide contingency against the transportation challenges and the potential for extreme winter weather driving a $50 million reduction in the free cash flow for the year. We have captured the reversal of these higher inventory quantities in our guidance for 2023, which I will discuss later in the call. In addition to the higher inventory quantities, prices for natural gas and power have also increased since the last call, resulting in an additional value of our inventories and net receivables for approximately $140 million. which will be reversed with lower commodity prices. The combined $190 million impact of these factors result in reduced expectation for 2022 and free cash flow before group. I will now turn to Slide 12 for an update on our planned 2022 capital allocation Consistent with past practice we have highlighted change from last quarter in blue. Starting from the left, we have updated the midpoint of our free cash flow before growth guidance by $290 million, $100 million EBITDA guidance and $190 million from increases in working capital. As you know, cash generation is a key objective for energy. And our team has been focused on offsetting this negative impact. We were able to assess a significant portion of those reductions by capturing $212 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of Astoria allowing us to utilize and distribute capital consistent with our commitments. Next, we expect to capture an additional $6 million from winter store remittance related to additional recovery. Next, we continue to make progress in executing our $1 billion share repurchase program. At the end of October, we have $397 million to be completed by around year end. And finally, we have committed $100 million of operating CapEx spend related to our $2 billion growth plan, which when coupled with our investments, other investments leads to $286 million of capital available for allocation. Moving to 2023, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth guidance, we are pleased to announce that our expectation for 2023, in line with previous targets. We're introducing strong 2023 financial guidance of $2.27 billion to $2.47 billion for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth of $1.52 billion to $1.72 billion. EBITDA guidance includes the full year impact of asset sales and other permanent banks that we captured in our guidance for 2022. Although we expect some continued impact from cold constraints, we are able to offset those and the other transitory items that impacted our 2022 guidance. I will now turn to Slide 14 for the introduction of our 2023 $1.9 billion capital allocation plan. As Mauricio mentioned, in his section, our capital allocation is directly in line with our long-standing principle and cadence of allocation. Today, we are starting the conversation by allocating 50% to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases and allocating a portion of the 50% opportunistic back to identified group, leaving 35% to be allocated throughout the year to the highest returning investments while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Now moving left to right, we start with the midpoint of our free cash flow before growth guidance range of $1.62 billion, plus $286 million of unallocated 2022 CAFA, capital available for allocation, totaling $1.9 million in capital for allocation. Next, we have allocated $220 million identified for our growth program and $111 million for other investment to fund additional investment to support the integration of Direct Energy, innovation projects and Small Book acquisition. Next, on return on capital, we are allocating $347 million to dividends, consistent with our 7% to 9% annual dividend per share growth target and announcing a new share repurchase program of $600 million to be executed immediately following the full execution of our current $1 billion program. Finally, this leaves $628 million of 2023 capital available for allocation to be allocated throughout the year. We look forward to providing you with updates to our progress throughout 2022. Back to you, Mauricio. Yes. I think more than looking at first half versus the second half, I would say that probably you will see these two critical quarters have been the second and the third. And so you will see probably more balance and more in line, as Mauricio said, with the past and potentially even the fourth quarter that this year is higher than normal. So I would say, again, probably get back to 2021 profile is what we should expect. Yes. First of all, Angie, let me say that the increase in the taxes \u2013 the tax payment that you see for 2023 are really due to two factors. One, we are forecasting a higher net income for the year and therefore, higher federal and state taxes. And the other piece is we got a refund for the BE on the DT side in 2022, that will not happen in 2023. And therefore, they are more or less half and of that explained increase year-over-year. We have \u2013 from the IRA, we have factored in our forecast the impact of the 1% taxes on share buybacks. However, there is no impact for the higher \u2013 for the minimum tax because at this moment, we don't have any indication that the payment based on 2023 net income will be done in 2023. And so when we have more information regarding when this payment, if any, is due, then we will update you. In general, I would say, as we have said in the past that it's very difficult to do forecasting based on the level of information that we have. But so far, all the indication is for relatively modest impact and also is a temporary impact that will recover after a few years. As soon as we get more details, we will be more precise. Yes. I just would like to point you to in the appendix, there is a page in which we highlight the impact on our maintenance CapEx coming in 2022 from Limestone and Parish and also for 2023. Long story short, when you eliminate the impact of these specific CapEx that we spend, you will see that there is around $40 million to $50 million increase in the maintenance CapEx, and this is really due to the fact that Mauricio was mentioning that given the current prices, we think that it is appropriate to increase the reliability of our fleet to basically catch all the opportunity that the current price environment is offering to us. No. Regarding \u2013 okay, regarding the other investments, these do not impact EBITDA, there outside EBITDA. When you look at the growth plans there is a series of initiatives, and we will update you about what is going to EBITDA or not. But for the moment, it's still \u2013 as Mauricio said, it's a series of different initiatives and depending on which one we will prioritize, it will have more CapEx impact or not. That is a very good question. And what you said is correct. The $111 million, they will not impact EBITDA, the $220 million. There are some initiatives that could have an impact on OpEx and others that have an impact on CapEx. And we will qualify that in the next quarter. Yes. Regarding the business insurance proceeds, I can confirm what we said in the prior year call and basically the negative impact of Parish 8 in the first half of 2023 will be absorbed by the insurance proceeds, and we have factored in our forecast. Yes. And it's almost entirely the full amount that we highlighted in $220 million, Steve. So, that's the main, okay."

So, it's not \u2013 we have been kind of at this for a while. So, there is a couple of factors in here that we think about. One is availability for them to get their panels on the ground and get them installed. It's the developers in the pipeline that they are kind of working through. And then the IRA provides them some clarity around their financing. So, what I would expect, I haven't seen it yet, but I would expect that some of this clarity starts coming into more certainty around offers into us. And as opportunities show up, we will lock those up as they make sense for our portfolio. But you are right, the IRA should push solar, wind and battery development across all markets in the U.S."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to today\u2019s speaker, Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKevin Cole: Thank you, Felicia. Good morning and welcome to NRG Energy's second quarter 2022 earnings call.

And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's President and CEO.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone and thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm joined this morning by Alberto Fornaro, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions we have Liza Killinger, Head of Home; Rob Gaudette, Head of Business and Market Operations; and Chris Moser, Head of Competitive Markets and Policy.  I'd like to start with the three key takeaways of today's presentation on Slide 4. We are maintaining our financial guidance ranges as we continue to navigate through volatile market conditions and are increasing our capital available for allocation by $140 million. We continue to make good progress in achieving our strategic growth priorities particularly on direct energy integration. And finally, our share repurchase program continues with approximately $600 million in remaining capacity to be executed this year.  Moving to the second quarter financial and operational results on Slide 5, we delivered $358 million of adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter. 70% of the difference compared to last year are items that we previously identified, including asset sales and transitory items. The remaining variance is primarily driven by the forced outage of our 610 megawatt coal unit at the W.A. Parish facility. This outage began on May 9th, and is expected to be back for summer operation next year. The unit is covered by both business interruption and property damage insurance. I am pleased to report that we once again achieved top decile safety performance for the quarter and that we published our 12th sustainability report, a testament to our commitment to transparency and accountability.  We also continued to realize strong customer retention which I will discuss in more detail shortly. We continue to make progress on our five key strategic priorities. Integrate direct energy, perfect our integrated platform by better matching retail with supply, grow our core electricity and natural gas businesses, integrate adjacent products or services that will allow us to expand margins and term from our customers, and return capital to our shareholders. I'd like to give you a quick update on those priorities. The direct energy integration is going well and we are on track to achieve our run rate synergies of $300 million by the end of 2023. In late June, we received ERCOT securitization proceeds related to Winter Storm Uri in line with our expectations. We have continued to make progress on our mitigation efforts, and now expect an additional $80 million in recovery, bringing our total mitigation efforts to 70% of the original impact. We continue to optimize our supply portfolio through monetization of the Watson Generation facility in California and retirements of fossil assets in PJM. We have also expanded our capital like PPA strategy to focus on energy storage and quick start natural gas generation. I expect PPA market conditions to improve into year-end, especially if the proposed Inflation Reduction Act is passed.  Our retail brands continue to perform well with the strong customer count, retention metrics, and an unmatched ability to generate insights on price elasticity. We remain focused on expanding our product offerings and improving our digital customer experience. I am proud that one of our flagship brands, Reliant Energy was also recognized as the best electricity company in Houston, our hometown. Last quarter, I spoke about Goal Zero, our resilience and battery storage business and the significant opportunity it represents given growing grid instability and extreme weather events. During the quarter, we launched a marketing campaign in one of its core markets, California to increase awareness for the product and brand with very strong results.  As a result of these targeted campaigns, web traffic increased 400% and the average order increased by almost a third. We continued to make progress in other areas, but remain keenly focused on pacing our investments as we navigate ongoing supply chain constraints and recessionary environment. Finally, we are maintaining our financial guidance range, but due to the impact of the W.A. Parish unit outage, we're currently trending towards the bottom end. We have been focused on taking steps like one time cost savings and incremental direct energy synergies to improve our results. Alberto will provide details on this and the additional capital available for allocation.  Turning to Slide 6 for our market review in Texas. ERCOT experienced record hit during the quarter, 32% above the 10-year average, resulting in record peak demand. However, real-time power prices were mixed versus what the forward indicated, driven primarily by the performance of renewable energy on any given day. As we look into the summer, we expect prices to remain volatile and highly dependent on renewable performance. Turning to the right-hand side of the slide, beginning with retail. We saw a strong performance through the quarter with retention 5% ahead of expectations and customer count increasing 1.2%. We also extended term length of customer offers, which enables new [ph] management and improves margin predictability. This occurred while consumers grappled with inflation, only further demonstrating the resilience of our retail brands and pricing strategy. On supply, the unplanned outage at W.A. Parish Unit 8 impacted performance. While there is an earnings recognition delayed given the time line to receive business interruption insurance proceeds, insurance is an effective tool to mitigate this risk. Beyond that, we have seen strong operational performance from our fleet due to our expanded spring outage maintenance plan and opportunistic maintenance outages, that best positions our fleet to perform through these extreme and extended summer conditions. Finally, our balanced hedging strategy that uses both own generation and third-party contracts further derisks our portfolio through optimizing operational versus counterparty risk, which are important attributes through current market conditions. Now moving to Slide 7. Just like we did last quarter on Goal Zero, today I want to focus on one area of growth that is complementary to our core offerings and presents an exciting opportunity, heating and pulling our HVAC maintenance and installation. Airtron is our Home Services HVAC company, which was acquired as part of Direct Energy. It represents a complementary offering to our existing core products as HVAC systems use the most energy of any single home appliance, responsible for up to 50% of a home energy consumption. The HVAC industry with a total U.S. addressable market of $100 billion is highly fragmented and traditionally served by local providers with limited scope and reach. In contrast, Airtron operates in nine states, which represents a $10 billion serviceable market, including Texas, where they hold leadership positions in both Houston and Dallas with a single recognizable brand and scale that is unmet. Combined with our existing consumer services platform, we can grow both within our existing customer base and through expansion into new territories, creating a significant and compelling opportunity. In the last three years, Airtron has grown revenues 11% per year to $450 million with gross margins of 30% or more. The revenues come from residential new construction, services and maintenance, as well as direct-to-consumer home replacement. Our early insights suggest that there is significant growth potential in direct-to-consumer home replacement, given energy efficiency initiatives and extreme weather that shortens the lifetime of HVAC systems. The ability to leverage our existing consumer base and sales channels to augment the direct-to-consumer growth while cross-selling with our electricity and gas customers is precisely the type of value opportunity that increases margin and retention that we highlighted during our Investor Day. I look forward to providing you updates on their progress as we integrate these solutions closer with our core energy offerings. So with that, I will pass it over to Alberto for the financial review.\nAlberto Fornaro: Thank you, Mauricio. I will now turn to Slide 9 for a review of the second quarter results. NRG delivered $358 million in adjusted EBITDA, a $298 million decrease versus prior year, excluding the impact of Winter Storm Uri. As you can see in the waterfall chart, this decrease is primarily due to the previously guided impact of the 4.8 gigawatt fossil asset sales completed in December, PJM assets retirement in the second quarter, New York capacity revenue, and early settlement of demand response revenue in the second quarter of 2021. In addition, not included in our expectation where the extended unplanned outage at Parish Unit 8 and the modest amount of growth expenses.  From a regional perspective, adjusted EBITDA in Texas declined $61 million compared to the second quarter of last year. As Mauricio said in his scripted remarks, summer came early with record setting temperatures beginning in May raising both market prices and build volumes. On May 9th, a fire at the Parish facility caused an extended outage at Unit 8 and a 10-day outage at Unit center. We were therefore forced to replace the power with the combination of our more expensive out of the many generation hedges, and some opportunistic market purchase, which together impacted EBITDA by an estimated $70 million. In addition, the benefit normally associated to higher build volumes with our home and business customers, affect the impact of additional outages on our remaining Texas fleet and higher maintenance expenses recorded in the quarter. Finally, we were able to fully offset the previously disclosed transitory items, which includes the limestone outage and the ancillary costs for a total negative $61 million with some nonrecurring items of $79 million, which include an earlier-than-anticipated partial insurance reimbursement of the business interruption expenses aligned to Unit 1 and the early testament of an online PPA. Turning on the East, West, and other segments, the year-over-year decline was primarily driven by the $63 million EBITDA reduction from asset divestiture and retirement, as well as by the decline in demand response revenue associated with an early settlement in the second quarter of 2021. Next, compared to Texas where the impact of coal constraints was minimal, generation in this continues to be impacted by coal availability for a $23 million impact during the quarter. After accounting for these previously guided items, the remaining $63 million negative variance versus 2021 was driven by the combination of lower power volumes, reduced profitability at our Watson facility, which was monetized during the quarter, an intra-year timing related to C&I customer hedge monetization, which will be recovered through the second half of this year as we associated to retain hedges cycle and the balance by higher supply costs. Next, I will provide you a brief update regarding our progress in achieving Direct Energy savings and mitigating Winter Storm Uri impact. Direct Energy, incremental synergies from the beginning of the year reached $39 million. We remain on track to achieve our full year target of $50 million in 2022 and $225 million since the acquisition of Direct Energy. We also expect to improve the recovery of our 2021 losses from Winter Storm Uri. You may recall that at the end of the last year, we estimated that the final impact net recovery was going to be $380 million. During Q2, we were able to make progress in several areas where we have remaining gross losses and therefore, we have improved our estimates by $80 million, bringing the net impact to $300 million. Now let's move to the full year guidance. As Mauricio mentioned, we are maintaining our guidance range but based on the recent events, we are trending to the bottom of the guidance ranges. The full year impact from the Parish Unit 8 outage based on current prices, is estimated to be a little over $200 million. The fleet carries both business interruption insurance for lost earnings and property damage insurer to cover the cost of returning the unit to full operation. Given that the outage started at the beginning of May, the second quarter impact reflects the deductible period. As of today, we're assuming the business interruption insurance proceeds will not be collected until 2023. However, the property damage proceeds will more closely match the expenses and the maintenance CAPEX deployed throughout the time needed to restore the unit. Additionally, for free cash flow before growth, we continue to closely manage the impact to working capital from higher commodity prices, primarily in our natural gas business. To be clear, as for the transitory items disclosed at the end of last year, we have taken and we will continue to take steps aimed to improve our position. In particular, we have identified a serious opportunity in managing our costs and operating expenses, including early realization of synergies and onetime reduction of expenses. And as you know, we manage our business for cash so we have also incorporated action to improve cash generation and mitigate our net working capital increases, including through the recovery of property damage proceeds and noncore asset sales. We look forward to providing you additional updates throughout the year. I will turn now to Slide 10 for a brief update of our 2022 capital allocation. Moving left to right, the midpoint of our free cash flow before growth guidance remains unchanged at $1.290 billion. Next, we received $689 million of securitization proceeds from ERCOT related to Winter Storm Uri in late June, which net of the bill credit issued to C&I customers brings the total net inflow for 2022 to $599 million. As mentioned before, we expect to receive an incremental $80 million of cash proceeds from some additional recovery. Focusing next on change from last quarter, since mid of this year we have repurchased an additional 143 million of shares towards our $1 billion repurchase program, leaving a robust $595 million to be completed by year-end. Next, we have reduced the amount of expected other investments by the net cash proceeds of the sale of our interest in the Watson facility for $59 million. Lastly, given the additional Uri recovery and asset sales net cash proceeds, we have increased capital available for allocation by $141 million. As you see in the far right column, the total remaining capital available for allocation is $456 million, of which we have earmarked approximately $100 million to fund the initial project in our $2 billion growth plan, including the initiatives that are being launched to accelerate the growth of our Goal Zero business. The remaining $356 million will be allocated later in the year as we earn the cash. Back to you, Mauricio.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Alberto. I want to provide some closing thoughts on Slide 13. During the quarter, we continued to make progress on all our strategic priorities. As we have done in the past, over the remainder of 2022, our team will work tirelessly to improve our results. I am confident we have built the right platform and have the right strategy to deliver strong and predictable earnings and create significant shareholder value. So with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. Felicia, we're now ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead. \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning team. Thanks for the time. How are you guys doing? \nMauricio Gutierrez: Good morning Julien.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah, hey. So Mauricio, I'd love to hear -- I want a couple of strategy questions to you today. As you think about this year, how do you think about the desire to continue with the generation portfolio, have the latest events pushed you towards saying maybe we should reevaluate the integrated strategy and the pivot towards retail or actually, are you even more convinced in this strategy and could we see you engaging in more contracting? And maybe to that end, could you also marry this up with some of the comments around PPA strategy you guys have been undertaking in prior periods, are you thinking about doubling down on that considering the higher energy price environment today?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Sure. Well Julien, let me start with the retail engine. I mean, as you can see on the numbers, it is incredibly, incredibly strong. Customers are in this environment, I described them as a flight to safety and obviously, Elizabeth can talk a little bit more about that. But when I think about the supply strategy, you really need to think about, okay, what is the retail that I need to serve and what is the supply that better serves that retail. It always starts with that. Now we have been in a path where we don't want to rely completely on our own generation to supply our retail. We want to make sure that we have a supply strategy that is diversified. And that was the big lesson learned from Winter Storm Uri. We don't want to have a single point of play there [ph]. So what you should expect in the future is a combination of our own generation and third-party megawatts to supply our retail loan.  Now on the generation side, obviously we are -- we always have invested in the fleet. Right now, I think the maintenance CAPEX that we have on the fleet per year is in the order of $200 million. But we have to recognize that the generation fleet has been going through a period, almost a 10-year period of very low gas prices. And our maintenance CAPEX is sized according to that, right. Not every megawatt matter in a $2 or $3 gas price environment. Now that it is resetting itself to much higher natural gas and power prices we're going to right size our maintenance CAPEX to make sure that every megawatt is available because every megawatt matters at a dollar per MMBtu. So that's the first thing that I will say on the generation side.  Now on the third-party megawatts, we actually use a combination of things. The first one is we have PPAs. We started that with wind and solar and now we have expanded that to storage and some gas peakers. And I can talk to you about the opportunities that we have within our own fleet for those gas peakers and how do we partner with other people on that. We have tolling agreements, we have bilateral physical contracts, we have financial hedges. So it is a combination of things that allow us to just have a very diverse supply strategy. Now remember, the main difference between own generation and third party is that on our own generation, we are exposed to operational risk. And on the third-party megawatts, we're exposed to counterparty risk. But the attributes of those megawatts are basically the same. It is just what type of risk you want to carry.  So as I think about in the future, the strategy of relying on third-party megawatts is completely consistent with how we see things in the future. We're seeing more wind, more solar, we're going to start seeing more storage, and we want to make sure that our supply is keeping up with the transition that we're seeing in the electric grid, right. So just relying on our generation portfolio, is not keeping up with the transition that we're seeing in the market. And that's why this combined strategy of own generation and third-party megawatts, I think, is the right strategy to better serve our load.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: And just to clarify and boil that down to make sure I heard that essence of the last one. Are you talking about contracting out more gas peakers and could that result in new gas peakers in for instance, ERCOT here, just to make sure I'm hearing this right?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Correct. So when you think about the PPA strategy, we started with wind and solar, and this is really bringing new megawatts to the market. We provide them long-term contracts because our retail supply, our retail low, and we can actually bring these new megawatts to market because they can now finance those power plants. We're now extending that to storage, and we actually are running RFPs on storage that gives us a lot of visibility in terms of what's in the market. For now, we have expanded that to gas peaking. And the gas peaking, not only we need to -- we can rely on developers but keep in mind, we already have a lot of brownfield opportunities within our sites. And I will tell you today that we've been working over the last year and half in identifying new projects. We actually have one that is show already fully permitted. Another one is right behind it. And right now, we want to explore potential partnerships where we can bring capital from other entities, we can take the offtake and we can be also the developer since we have a long history of power plant development. So I think it can be a win-win for everybody. So we don't need to use our own capital to develop these plans and still benefit from this incremental megawatts in the grid.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. And just to make sure I'm hearing you right, this would be effectively monetizing upfront the development rights that you have on your brownfield to another party that you're developing megawatts, not taking the operational risk, but ultimately enabling new assets to be developed in ERCOT.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Exactly.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Alright, excellent. I have asked you enough here, but thank you so much for elaborating on that, really critical here. Thank you. \nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you Julien.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. \nShahriar Pourreza: Hey guys, good morning. \nMauricio Gutierrez: Good morning Shar.\nShahriar Pourreza: Mauricio, as we look at sort of the balance of the year, how should we sort of think about maybe the size and shaping of the lever as you laid out to maybe help get you back to that midpoint, could sort of that synergy upside from Direct Energy health there?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes. I mean there will be a combination of things, Shar. As Alberto pointed out, I mean, we're looking at -- and we've been working on this because as part of the transitory items, we wanted to mitigate also those transitory items. So we've been working on this throughout the year. That is -- do we have the opportunity for onetime cost savings, obviously, the Direct Energy synergies, we feel very comfortable with the number, but we are now looking at spicing that and working on it. Obviously, we need to make insurance proceeds and whether we can accelerate some of these insurance proceeds, and Alberto already mentioned some of that. Look, I mean, that's not completely dependent on us, but that doesn't mean that we're going to work hard to accelerate that. And then -- so I would say that some are some of them are levered. I also want to mention that we run this business for cash. And I think the sale of Watson, it is an example of us being completely focused in monetizing the value of our portfolio. And if we can accelerate some of the divestitures of noncore assets, we're going to continue to do that, to bring cash in this year to make up for the cost of the unit insurance outage. So there is a number of things that we're doing Shar to make up for the lost earnings of the Unit 8 outage.\nShahriar Pourreza: Okay, perfect, that helps there. And then just lastly, I know you guys mentioned retention is exceeding your internal targets. Just is this split fairly evenly between East Texas or is it skewed? And then just curious how East has held up with a heavier C&I book? Thanks.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Sure. I'll turn it over to Elizabeth for kind of the East Texas split, but I will tell you that the -- I mean, the retail engine is really, really strong. And as I said in the previous answer, we're seeing a flight to safety and our brands are that flight to safety. So we're seeing really, really strong numbers, but Elizabeth, can you provide additional detail.\nElizabeth Killinger: Yes. Thanks for the question, Shar. We are seeing really strong retention Mauricio mentioned, 5% above expectations. That's really driven by our unmatched analytics and care capabilities. We also have a significant amount of customer and community loyalty and of course, the compelling products. From a Texas versus East, pretty consistent, maybe a slight advantage in Texas, but it's not dramatic. And we're also seeing retention better than expected from the DE acquisition. So really, our -- the strength of our platform right now, especially during the -- with the volatility in the COGS. I mean, we're so pleased with how resilient our platform is through this. And frankly, the strength of our channel, both sales and marketing channels to pivot within regions and between regions. So yes, it really is a strong platform.\nShahriar Pourreza: Perfect, that is super helpful. Very good color this morning guys. Thanks. \nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you Shar.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Lapides: Hey, guys thank you for taking my questions. And congrats for being able to keep the guidance range during a tough operational time given the Parish outage. Just curious [Multiple Speakers] the history of Texas, shows that there are power price and heat rate blowouts that happened in an unusual time. I mean if I go back in time, you own the Reliant business because of what I thought was an April heatwave blowout that happened 12-14 years ago or so. Just curious, with Parish, one of your base load units out through the second quarter next year, can you just talk about how much gas fire generation you have under contract for next year, meaning whether it's a hedge from a gas-fired unit or whether it's a PPA or a toll from a gas-fired unit, we've seen some periods recently where some of the renewable units were running fine and then all of a sudden due to cloud cover shut down and it caused a price blowout, happened a couple of some days ago in Texas, so just trying to think about how much backup you've got from third-party fossil for the period when Parish is out?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes, Michael. So I think in the last earnings, I provided an indication of our hedge for 2023. And if you recall, that one had against the expected law that we have for 2023 half comes from third-party megawatts about half comes from our economic generation. And then we have an economic generation that is maintained as insurance, our own uneconomic generation. So there is a co -- it's just a lot of combination in that third-party megawatts. We have some tolling agreements with combined cycle plants. We have some heat rate options with peakers, we actually have some heat rate options with -- or actually out-of-the-money call options from the financial market. So there is a combination of tools that we have to be able to manage weather variability in any given year. Now as you mentioned, I mean, the second quarter was pretty extreme. We always plan for some weather variability but what we actually saw in the Spring and July is record-breaking heat in Texas. And while we manage for some variability, it is incredibly expensive to manage for all weather variability now. Now perhaps one of the lessons learned here is as we think about 2023 and given that we have a lot of time to plan for how to set up the portfolio for that year, I expect that we're going to buy a little bit more insurance for extreme weather than in the past. And I think that's -- I mean, that's going to be the prudent thing to do given what we're seeing in Texas. I mean the peak -- the record peak was broken by, I think, 5,000 megawatts. I mean the old peak was 75,000. Now the new peak is close to 80,000 megawatts. I mean year-over-year 7%, 8% increase. I mean, that's pretty significant. And I think we need to recognize that. Perhaps we're going to see greater weather, extreme weather events, and we need to plan for it.\nMichael Lapides: Well -- and Texas is showing massive robust demand growth, way above the national average. Part of that is just residential new connect, people moving there. Part of that is [indiscernible] chem industrial demand. Part of it is probably crypto mining, which they're all kinds of dockets that are patents PCT [ph] discussing the impact of that. If we enter a sustained period where Texas load -- peak load growth is in the 3% to 5% range for a number of years, would that alter your power procurement strategy and your asset ownership strategy at all, meaning if demand comes in for a multiyear period, way above what we saw in the last three to five years?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes, well, absolutely. So two things on that, if demand is growing at 3% to 4% a year, that's really good for us because if we maintain our market share, that means we're growing our retail business, and that's really, really good, and that's what we want to see. Now obviously, we need to make sure that we keep up our supply strategy with that incremental demand. And the way we're going to do it is, one, as I mentioned, I think there is an opportunity for us to bring new megawatts in some of our current sites and those would be primarily gas peaking and energy storage. And we are -- as I mentioned, we already have at least one project that is being fully permitted and is shovel-ready and now it's just a matter of what's the right partner to bring into the table. We have another one that is right behind it and is in the process of getting permitted. And I'm sure that -- and I will tell you, the team is already looking at other opportunities where we can bring storage there. So I think you're going to see us participate on that new dispatchable quick-start generation opportunity in our sites, but not necessarily with our capital. And we will be the off-taker. In addition to that, we're going to continue bringing new wind and solar and energy storage as we have done already with our current PPA. So we're looking at these in kind of these two ways, bring new megawatts that are viable [ph] cost in the form of wind, solar and perhaps storage. And bring contract also with new gas peaking dispatchable generation in our existing sites, but not necessarily with our capital.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. And one last one in this probably in Elizabeth question. Just curious, over the last year or so, can you talk about what your Texas customer count has done since the Direct Energy acquisition, so January of 2021, like how much is your mass market customer count up since the Direct deal meaning if I did it apples-to-apples? And then what are you seeing on the residential level at a usage per customer basis?\nElizabeth Killinger: So from a customer count perspective, year-over-year between -- since the DE acquisitions, relatively steady, a slight decline. And as I have mentioned before on calls, from a customer count perspective, year-over-year between -- since the DE acquisition, relatively steady, a slight decline. And as I have mentioned before on calls, when we do both book acquisitions and large acquisitions, there's a bit of a settling period in the first year or two. And so we've seen that. But as I mentioned earlier, we're performing better than we expected and modeled from those acquisitions. From customer usage perspective, in the ERCOT market relatively steady, although with weather we're seeing an increase especially in this second quarter versus prior period. So we do expect customer usage to be either steady or growing with the electrification of people\u2019s lives and communities.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Right. I mean, I think, Michael, you need to think about that usage in two contexts weather normalize and then weather affected. And I think what you saw in Q2 is a significant increase in usage per customer because of weather. But we're also seeing an increase in usage per customer because of the electrification of the economy, right. So you can point to electric vehicles, you can point to a lot of different things that are driving this electrification that will increase the usage per capita.\nMichael Lapides: Got it, thank you guys. Much appreciated Mauricio.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Michael.\nOperator: The next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Seaport.\nAgnieszka Storozynski: Good morning. So I wanted to change the topic just for a moment. The pending inflation bill and the benefits that your nuclear plants could get some nuclear PTCs. I'm just struggling to gauge what is the price that STP is hedged at say for the next year or two, as we're trying to calculate the delta between that and the $44 per megawatt hour that this bill would rank?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes, good morning Angie. Well, I mean, so clearly, this deal could potentially be a positive for nuclear owners, including us. And as you mentioned, I mean, I think everybody is looking at, okay, what is that trigger that will allow us to get the PTCs or not. So that's a moving target. And obviously, that's a moving target with the market, right, like everybody else. So I'm not sure if I can give you that level of specificity in terms of what price is hedged because we look at it on a portfolio basis. But I mean, this is something that we'll start to -- I guess, outlined as this bill progresses and if passed, then we will need to have that level of clarity to ensure that we can support and justify the incremental PTC, but that's something to be worked on.\nAgnieszka Storozynski: Okay. And then going back to the hedging of your retail book. So one thing that sort of surprised me is that, I mean, you -- when you hedge your retail book, you always have all kinds of delta hedges and options in order to protect you against unplanned outages also spikes in usage. So I would have thought that Parish was not a big component of the supply stack to start with, given coal supply constraints, and then you should have had those additional hedges, so I'm a little bit surprised that the impact is this big? And then lastly, when you show your drivers for the year, I don't see any comments about any uptick and bad debt expense and we see it at regulated utilities, so I was just wondering how you manage that?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes, Angie. So as you mentioned, we always plan for some forced outages and some weather variability. I think the impact here is that the outage was in a pretty large coal unit close to 600 megawatts with prices where they were in the forward market starting in May. That unit is pretty deep in the money. So as you mentioned, I mean, the coal conservation that we have was really in the shorter months and perhaps in some of these shorter hours. But in the peak hours, this unit was expected to be there to help manage and supply our load. The unique situation here is both happened at the same time. We had a forced outage on a large coal unit exactly at the time when we had record-breaking heat, and that really goes outside of kind of this planning area that we look at. So this was the combination of these two very extreme conditions. And it's not like we don't plan for it, but we don't plan the intersection of both of them exactly as we're leading into the summer.  Now we use some of our uneconomic generation, and it was very effective, but this uneconomic generation that we have, some of the gas peakers, they come at a really high cost given where the natural gas price is today. So if you're at $8, $9 gas and you're deploying 12, 13 peak rate peakers, the cost of that is pretty high, although it -- us from buying the cap, for example, but it's still pretty high compared to where the cost of generation is for our coal plant. Anything to add, Alberto.\nAlberto Fornaro: Yes, Angie, so regarding your question regarding -- related to bad debt expenses, we are not seeing any pickup in the bad debt expenses considered now the level of receivables is much higher, given the level of gas prices and power. So when we see percentage is absolutely in line. And even we look at late payment fees and so on, and it's pretty normal, particularly in Texas. So for the time being, we are not seeing any sign of deterioration of the quality of our receivable portfolio.\nAgnieszka Storozynski: Great, thank you. \nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you Angie.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research.\nSteven Fleishman: Yeah hi, good morning everyone. \nMauricio Gutierrez: Good morning Steve.\nSteven Fleishman: Hey Mauricio. The -- you mentioned increasing the maintenance CAPEX on the fleet from the $200 million, how much higher might that go going forward.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Well, I mean we're a value -- yes, Steve I mean we're going to evaluate these. But obviously, if your plants are a lot more profitable than they were, let's say the last five to six years under a low gas environment, they can support incremental maintenance CAPEX. And not only they can support, it's advisable, right. Because right now, every megawatt counts. Before we had a lot more megawatts that were marginal and we don't necessarily need it to have that maximize the output of the plant. Now we really need to maximize the output of the plant. And look, the capacity factors, the amount of time that these plants are going to run are going to be more than they have been in the past, and we need to take that into consideration. So I would say that there will be an increase. I don't think it's a step-up change from the maintenance CAPEX. But it is -- we need to right size it to the amount of run hours that the unit is going to have, number one. And number two, for the profitability of the plant, right. So every megawatt counts, and I want to make sure that we have it available when we need them.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. Great. On the Parish outage and the insurance, so I assume you're not assuming you're going to book any business interruption proceeds this year, it will be next year?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Alberto?\nAlberto Fornaro: Yes, it is correct. However, based also on the experience with Limestone, we're trying to accelerate the property damage, insurance proceeds, and link it basically to the expenses and the CAPEX that we're going to deploy this year. So that's the area where we see more opportunity.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. So just high level, you have the $200 million plus cost this year. Then next year, there will be some cost that continues in the first half, but then you'll have a benefit for business interruption that should offset -- should be more meaningful than the cost in 2023?\nAlberto Fornaro: Correct.\nSteven Fleishman: Yes. Okay. And then just a high level, I know somebody asked about the impact of IRA for the nuclear plant. But just maybe more broadly, could you -- there's a lot of provisions in this bill in different ways that could impact the business, so just could you just talk to anything else that particularly you're particularly focused on?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Sure. I mean the -- I mean the two big ones is what is the impact on wind and solar, renewable energy, and what is the impact on nuclear, right. So, on wind and solar we can see a reengagement and an acceleration of renewable development which we have benefited from and our team is ready to start the conversation with developers again. And then on the nuclear side, we're going to be looking at what is the benefit that we can have with our SPP facility. And like every other nuclear generator in the country, I'm sure that they're starting to do the math to figure out how do we benefit from these production tax credits. So I would say those are the two big areas where we are focused on and that can impact our business.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay, thank you. \nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you Steve.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes today's program. I will now turn the call back over to Mauricio.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Felicia, and I look forward to speaking with you shortly. Thank you.",

            "name": "Mauricio Gutierrez",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone and thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm joined this morning by Alberto Fornaro, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions we have Liza Killinger, Head of Home; Rob Gaudette, Head of Business and Market Operations; and Chris Moser, Head of Competitive Markets and Policy.  I'd like to start with the three key takeaways of today's presentation on Slide 4. We are maintaining our financial guidance ranges as we continue to navigate through volatile market conditions and are increasing our capital available for allocation by $140 million. We continue to make good progress in achieving our strategic growth priorities particularly on direct energy integration. And finally, our share repurchase program continues with approximately $600 million in remaining capacity to be executed this year.  Moving to the second quarter financial and operational results on Slide 5, we delivered $358 million of adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter. 70% of the difference compared to last year are items that we previously identified, including asset sales and transitory items. The remaining variance is primarily driven by the forced outage of our 610 megawatt coal unit at the W.A. Parish facility. This outage began on May 9th, and is expected to be back for summer operation next year. The unit is covered by both business interruption and property damage insurance. I am pleased to report that we once again achieved top decile safety performance for the quarter and that we published our 12th sustainability report, a testament to our commitment to transparency and accountability.  We also continued to realize strong customer retention which I will discuss in more detail shortly. We continue to make progress on our five key strategic priorities. Integrate direct energy, perfect our integrated platform by better matching retail with supply, grow our core electricity and natural gas businesses, integrate adjacent products or services that will allow us to expand margins and term from our customers, and return capital to our shareholders. I'd like to give you a quick update on those priorities. The direct energy integration is going well and we are on track to achieve our run rate synergies of $300 million by the end of 2023. In late June, we received ERCOT securitization proceeds related to Winter Storm Uri in line with our expectations. We have continued to make progress on our mitigation efforts, and now expect an additional $80 million in recovery, bringing our total mitigation efforts to 70% of the original impact. We continue to optimize our supply portfolio through monetization of the Watson Generation facility in California and retirements of fossil assets in PJM. We have also expanded our capital like PPA strategy to focus on energy storage and quick start natural gas generation. I expect PPA market conditions to improve into year-end, especially if the proposed Inflation Reduction Act is passed.  Our retail brands continue to perform well with the strong customer count, retention metrics, and an unmatched ability to generate insights on price elasticity. We remain focused on expanding our product offerings and improving our digital customer experience. I am proud that one of our flagship brands, Reliant Energy was also recognized as the best electricity company in Houston, our hometown. Last quarter, I spoke about Goal Zero, our resilience and battery storage business and the significant opportunity it represents given growing grid instability and extreme weather events. During the quarter, we launched a marketing campaign in one of its core markets, California to increase awareness for the product and brand with very strong results.  As a result of these targeted campaigns, web traffic increased 400% and the average order increased by almost a third. We continued to make progress in other areas, but remain keenly focused on pacing our investments as we navigate ongoing supply chain constraints and recessionary environment. Finally, we are maintaining our financial guidance range, but due to the impact of the W.A. Parish unit outage, we're currently trending towards the bottom end. We have been focused on taking steps like one time cost savings and incremental direct energy synergies to improve our results. Alberto will provide details on this and the additional capital available for allocation.  Turning to Slide 6 for our market review in Texas. ERCOT experienced record hit during the quarter, 32% above the 10-year average, resulting in record peak demand. However, real-time power prices were mixed versus what the forward indicated, driven primarily by the performance of renewable energy on any given day. As we look into the summer, we expect prices to remain volatile and highly dependent on renewable performance. Turning to the right-hand side of the slide, beginning with retail. We saw a strong performance through the quarter with retention 5% ahead of expectations and customer count increasing 1.2%. We also extended term length of customer offers, which enables new [ph] management and improves margin predictability. This occurred while consumers grappled with inflation, only further demonstrating the resilience of our retail brands and pricing strategy. On supply, the unplanned outage at W.A. Parish Unit 8 impacted performance. While there is an earnings recognition delayed given the time line to receive business interruption insurance proceeds, insurance is an effective tool to mitigate this risk. Beyond that, we have seen strong operational performance from our fleet due to our expanded spring outage maintenance plan and opportunistic maintenance outages, that best positions our fleet to perform through these extreme and extended summer conditions. Finally, our balanced hedging strategy that uses both own generation and third-party contracts further derisks our portfolio through optimizing operational versus counterparty risk, which are important attributes through current market conditions. Now moving to Slide 7. Just like we did last quarter on Goal Zero, today I want to focus on one area of growth that is complementary to our core offerings and presents an exciting opportunity, heating and pulling our HVAC maintenance and installation. Airtron is our Home Services HVAC company, which was acquired as part of Direct Energy. It represents a complementary offering to our existing core products as HVAC systems use the most energy of any single home appliance, responsible for up to 50% of a home energy consumption. The HVAC industry with a total U.S. addressable market of $100 billion is highly fragmented and traditionally served by local providers with limited scope and reach. In contrast, Airtron operates in nine states, which represents a $10 billion serviceable market, including Texas, where they hold leadership positions in both Houston and Dallas with a single recognizable brand and scale that is unmet. Combined with our existing consumer services platform, we can grow both within our existing customer base and through expansion into new territories, creating a significant and compelling opportunity. In the last three years, Airtron has grown revenues 11% per year to $450 million with gross margins of 30% or more. The revenues come from residential new construction, services and maintenance, as well as direct-to-consumer home replacement. Our early insights suggest that there is significant growth potential in direct-to-consumer home replacement, given energy efficiency initiatives and extreme weather that shortens the lifetime of HVAC systems. The ability to leverage our existing consumer base and sales channels to augment the direct-to-consumer growth while cross-selling with our electricity and gas customers is precisely the type of value opportunity that increases margin and retention that we highlighted during our Investor Day. I look forward to providing you updates on their progress as we integrate these solutions closer with our core energy offerings. So with that, I will pass it over to Alberto for the financial review. Thank you, Alberto. I want to provide some closing thoughts on Slide 13. During the quarter, we continued to make progress on all our strategic priorities. As we have done in the past, over the remainder of 2022, our team will work tirelessly to improve our results. I am confident we have built the right platform and have the right strategy to deliver strong and predictable earnings and create significant shareholder value. So with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. Felicia, we're now ready to open the line for questions. Good morning Julien. Sure. Well Julien, let me start with the retail engine. I mean, as you can see on the numbers, it is incredibly, incredibly strong. Customers are in this environment, I described them as a flight to safety and obviously, Elizabeth can talk a little bit more about that. But when I think about the supply strategy, you really need to think about, okay, what is the retail that I need to serve and what is the supply that better serves that retail. It always starts with that. Now we have been in a path where we don't want to rely completely on our own generation to supply our retail. We want to make sure that we have a supply strategy that is diversified. And that was the big lesson learned from Winter Storm Uri. We don't want to have a single point of play there [ph]. So what you should expect in the future is a combination of our own generation and third-party megawatts to supply our retail loan.  Now on the generation side, obviously we are -- we always have invested in the fleet. Right now, I think the maintenance CAPEX that we have on the fleet per year is in the order of $200 million. But we have to recognize that the generation fleet has been going through a period, almost a 10-year period of very low gas prices. And our maintenance CAPEX is sized according to that, right. Not every megawatt matter in a $2 or $3 gas price environment. Now that it is resetting itself to much higher natural gas and power prices we're going to right size our maintenance CAPEX to make sure that every megawatt is available because every megawatt matters at a dollar per MMBtu. So that's the first thing that I will say on the generation side.  Now on the third-party megawatts, we actually use a combination of things. The first one is we have PPAs. We started that with wind and solar and now we have expanded that to storage and some gas peakers. And I can talk to you about the opportunities that we have within our own fleet for those gas peakers and how do we partner with other people on that. We have tolling agreements, we have bilateral physical contracts, we have financial hedges. So it is a combination of things that allow us to just have a very diverse supply strategy. Now remember, the main difference between own generation and third party is that on our own generation, we are exposed to operational risk. And on the third-party megawatts, we're exposed to counterparty risk. But the attributes of those megawatts are basically the same. It is just what type of risk you want to carry.  So as I think about in the future, the strategy of relying on third-party megawatts is completely consistent with how we see things in the future. We're seeing more wind, more solar, we're going to start seeing more storage, and we want to make sure that our supply is keeping up with the transition that we're seeing in the electric grid, right. So just relying on our generation portfolio, is not keeping up with the transition that we're seeing in the market. And that's why this combined strategy of own generation and third-party megawatts, I think, is the right strategy to better serve our load. Correct. So when you think about the PPA strategy, we started with wind and solar, and this is really bringing new megawatts to the market. We provide them long-term contracts because our retail supply, our retail low, and we can actually bring these new megawatts to market because they can now finance those power plants. We're now extending that to storage, and we actually are running RFPs on storage that gives us a lot of visibility in terms of what's in the market. For now, we have expanded that to gas peaking. And the gas peaking, not only we need to -- we can rely on developers but keep in mind, we already have a lot of brownfield opportunities within our sites. And I will tell you today that we've been working over the last year and half in identifying new projects. We actually have one that is show already fully permitted. Another one is right behind it. And right now, we want to explore potential partnerships where we can bring capital from other entities, we can take the offtake and we can be also the developer since we have a long history of power plant development. So I think it can be a win-win for everybody. So we don't need to use our own capital to develop these plans and still benefit from this incremental megawatts in the grid. Exactly. Thank you Julien. Good morning Shar. Yes. I mean there will be a combination of things, Shar. As Alberto pointed out, I mean, we're looking at -- and we've been working on this because as part of the transitory items, we wanted to mitigate also those transitory items. So we've been working on this throughout the year. That is -- do we have the opportunity for onetime cost savings, obviously, the Direct Energy synergies, we feel very comfortable with the number, but we are now looking at spicing that and working on it. Obviously, we need to make insurance proceeds and whether we can accelerate some of these insurance proceeds, and Alberto already mentioned some of that. Look, I mean, that's not completely dependent on us, but that doesn't mean that we're going to work hard to accelerate that. And then -- so I would say that some are some of them are levered. I also want to mention that we run this business for cash. And I think the sale of Watson, it is an example of us being completely focused in monetizing the value of our portfolio. And if we can accelerate some of the divestitures of noncore assets, we're going to continue to do that, to bring cash in this year to make up for the cost of the unit insurance outage. So there is a number of things that we're doing Shar to make up for the lost earnings of the Unit 8 outage. Sure. I'll turn it over to Elizabeth for kind of the East Texas split, but I will tell you that the -- I mean, the retail engine is really, really strong. And as I said in the previous answer, we're seeing a flight to safety and our brands are that flight to safety. So we're seeing really, really strong numbers, but Elizabeth, can you provide additional detail. Thank you Shar. Yes, Michael. So I think in the last earnings, I provided an indication of our hedge for 2023. And if you recall, that one had against the expected law that we have for 2023 half comes from third-party megawatts about half comes from our economic generation. And then we have an economic generation that is maintained as insurance, our own uneconomic generation. So there is a co -- it's just a lot of combination in that third-party megawatts. We have some tolling agreements with combined cycle plants. We have some heat rate options with peakers, we actually have some heat rate options with -- or actually out-of-the-money call options from the financial market. So there is a combination of tools that we have to be able to manage weather variability in any given year. Now as you mentioned, I mean, the second quarter was pretty extreme. We always plan for some weather variability but what we actually saw in the Spring and July is record-breaking heat in Texas. And while we manage for some variability, it is incredibly expensive to manage for all weather variability now. Now perhaps one of the lessons learned here is as we think about 2023 and given that we have a lot of time to plan for how to set up the portfolio for that year, I expect that we're going to buy a little bit more insurance for extreme weather than in the past. And I think that's -- I mean, that's going to be the prudent thing to do given what we're seeing in Texas. I mean the peak -- the record peak was broken by, I think, 5,000 megawatts. I mean the old peak was 75,000. Now the new peak is close to 80,000 megawatts. I mean year-over-year 7%, 8% increase. I mean, that's pretty significant. And I think we need to recognize that. Perhaps we're going to see greater weather, extreme weather events, and we need to plan for it. Yes, well, absolutely. So two things on that, if demand is growing at 3% to 4% a year, that's really good for us because if we maintain our market share, that means we're growing our retail business, and that's really, really good, and that's what we want to see. Now obviously, we need to make sure that we keep up our supply strategy with that incremental demand. And the way we're going to do it is, one, as I mentioned, I think there is an opportunity for us to bring new megawatts in some of our current sites and those would be primarily gas peaking and energy storage. And we are -- as I mentioned, we already have at least one project that is being fully permitted and is shovel-ready and now it's just a matter of what's the right partner to bring into the table. We have another one that is right behind it and is in the process of getting permitted. And I'm sure that -- and I will tell you, the team is already looking at other opportunities where we can bring storage there. So I think you're going to see us participate on that new dispatchable quick-start generation opportunity in our sites, but not necessarily with our capital. And we will be the off-taker. In addition to that, we're going to continue bringing new wind and solar and energy storage as we have done already with our current PPA. So we're looking at these in kind of these two ways, bring new megawatts that are viable [ph] cost in the form of wind, solar and perhaps storage. And bring contract also with new gas peaking dispatchable generation in our existing sites, but not necessarily with our capital. Right. I mean, I think, Michael, you need to think about that usage in two contexts weather normalize and then weather affected. And I think what you saw in Q2 is a significant increase in usage per customer because of weather. But we're also seeing an increase in usage per customer because of the electrification of the economy, right. So you can point to electric vehicles, you can point to a lot of different things that are driving this electrification that will increase the usage per capita. Thank you, Michael. Yes, good morning Angie. Well, I mean, so clearly, this deal could potentially be a positive for nuclear owners, including us. And as you mentioned, I mean, I think everybody is looking at, okay, what is that trigger that will allow us to get the PTCs or not. So that's a moving target. And obviously, that's a moving target with the market, right, like everybody else. So I'm not sure if I can give you that level of specificity in terms of what price is hedged because we look at it on a portfolio basis. But I mean, this is something that we'll start to -- I guess, outlined as this bill progresses and if passed, then we will need to have that level of clarity to ensure that we can support and justify the incremental PTC, but that's something to be worked on. Yes, Angie. So as you mentioned, we always plan for some forced outages and some weather variability. I think the impact here is that the outage was in a pretty large coal unit close to 600 megawatts with prices where they were in the forward market starting in May. That unit is pretty deep in the money. So as you mentioned, I mean, the coal conservation that we have was really in the shorter months and perhaps in some of these shorter hours. But in the peak hours, this unit was expected to be there to help manage and supply our load. The unique situation here is both happened at the same time. We had a forced outage on a large coal unit exactly at the time when we had record-breaking heat, and that really goes outside of kind of this planning area that we look at. So this was the combination of these two very extreme conditions. And it's not like we don't plan for it, but we don't plan the intersection of both of them exactly as we're leading into the summer.  Now we use some of our uneconomic generation, and it was very effective, but this uneconomic generation that we have, some of the gas peakers, they come at a really high cost given where the natural gas price is today. So if you're at $8, $9 gas and you're deploying 12, 13 peak rate peakers, the cost of that is pretty high, although it -- us from buying the cap, for example, but it's still pretty high compared to where the cost of generation is for our coal plant. Anything to add, Alberto. Thank you Angie. Good morning Steve. Well, I mean we're a value -- yes, Steve I mean we're going to evaluate these. But obviously, if your plants are a lot more profitable than they were, let's say the last five to six years under a low gas environment, they can support incremental maintenance CAPEX. And not only they can support, it's advisable, right. Because right now, every megawatt counts. Before we had a lot more megawatts that were marginal and we don't necessarily need it to have that maximize the output of the plant. Now we really need to maximize the output of the plant. And look, the capacity factors, the amount of time that these plants are going to run are going to be more than they have been in the past, and we need to take that into consideration. So I would say that there will be an increase. I don't think it's a step-up change from the maintenance CAPEX. But it is -- we need to right size it to the amount of run hours that the unit is going to have, number one. And number two, for the profitability of the plant, right. So every megawatt counts, and I want to make sure that we have it available when we need them. Alberto? Sure. I mean the -- I mean the two big ones is what is the impact on wind and solar, renewable energy, and what is the impact on nuclear, right. So, on wind and solar we can see a reengagement and an acceleration of renewable development which we have benefited from and our team is ready to start the conversation with developers again. And then on the nuclear side, we're going to be looking at what is the benefit that we can have with our SPP facility. And like every other nuclear generator in the country, I'm sure that they're starting to do the math to figure out how do we benefit from these production tax credits. So I would say those are the two big areas where we are focused on and that can impact our business. Thank you Steve. Thank you, Felicia, and I look forward to speaking with you shortly. Thank you."

            "name": "Elizabeth Killinger",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks for the question, Shar. We are seeing really strong retention Mauricio mentioned, 5% above expectations. That's really driven by our unmatched analytics and care capabilities. We also have a significant amount of customer and community loyalty and of course, the compelling products. From a Texas versus East, pretty consistent, maybe a slight advantage in Texas, but it's not dramatic. And we're also seeing retention better than expected from the DE acquisition. So really, our -- the strength of our platform right now, especially during the -- with the volatility in the COGS. I mean, we're so pleased with how resilient our platform is through this. And frankly, the strength of our channel, both sales and marketing channels to pivot within regions and between regions. So yes, it really is a strong platform. So from a customer count perspective, year-over-year between -- since the DE acquisitions, relatively steady, a slight decline. And as I have mentioned before on calls, from a customer count perspective, year-over-year between -- since the DE acquisition, relatively steady, a slight decline. And as I have mentioned before on calls, when we do both book acquisitions and large acquisitions, there's a bit of a settling period in the first year or two. And so we've seen that. But as I mentioned earlier, we're performing better than we expected and modeled from those acquisitions. From customer usage perspective, in the ERCOT market relatively steady, although with weather we're seeing an increase especially in this second quarter versus prior period. So we do expect customer usage to be either steady or growing with the electrification of people's lives and communities."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Alberto Fornaro",
            "content": "Thank you, Mauricio. I will now turn to Slide 9 for a review of the second quarter results. NRG delivered $358 million in adjusted EBITDA, a $298 million decrease versus prior year, excluding the impact of Winter Storm Uri. As you can see in the waterfall chart, this decrease is primarily due to the previously guided impact of the 4.8 gigawatt fossil asset sales completed in December, PJM assets retirement in the second quarter, New York capacity revenue, and early settlement of demand response revenue in the second quarter of 2021. In addition, not included in our expectation where the extended unplanned outage at Parish Unit 8 and the modest amount of growth expenses.  From a regional perspective, adjusted EBITDA in Texas declined $61 million compared to the second quarter of last year. As Mauricio said in his scripted remarks, summer came early with record setting temperatures beginning in May raising both market prices and build volumes. On May 9th, a fire at the Parish facility caused an extended outage at Unit 8 and a 10-day outage at Unit center. We were therefore forced to replace the power with the combination of our more expensive out of the many generation hedges, and some opportunistic market purchase, which together impacted EBITDA by an estimated $70 million. In addition, the benefit normally associated to higher build volumes with our home and business customers, affect the impact of additional outages on our remaining Texas fleet and higher maintenance expenses recorded in the quarter. Finally, we were able to fully offset the previously disclosed transitory items, which includes the limestone outage and the ancillary costs for a total negative $61 million with some nonrecurring items of $79 million, which include an earlier-than-anticipated partial insurance reimbursement of the business interruption expenses aligned to Unit 1 and the early testament of an online PPA. Turning on the East, West, and other segments, the year-over-year decline was primarily driven by the $63 million EBITDA reduction from asset divestiture and retirement, as well as by the decline in demand response revenue associated with an early settlement in the second quarter of 2021. Next, compared to Texas where the impact of coal constraints was minimal, generation in this continues to be impacted by coal availability for a $23 million impact during the quarter. After accounting for these previously guided items, the remaining $63 million negative variance versus 2021 was driven by the combination of lower power volumes, reduced profitability at our Watson facility, which was monetized during the quarter, an intra-year timing related to C&I customer hedge monetization, which will be recovered through the second half of this year as we associated to retain hedges cycle and the balance by higher supply costs. Next, I will provide you a brief update regarding our progress in achieving Direct Energy savings and mitigating Winter Storm Uri impact. Direct Energy, incremental synergies from the beginning of the year reached $39 million. We remain on track to achieve our full year target of $50 million in 2022 and $225 million since the acquisition of Direct Energy. We also expect to improve the recovery of our 2021 losses from Winter Storm Uri. You may recall that at the end of the last year, we estimated that the final impact net recovery was going to be $380 million. During Q2, we were able to make progress in several areas where we have remaining gross losses and therefore, we have improved our estimates by $80 million, bringing the net impact to $300 million. Now let's move to the full year guidance. As Mauricio mentioned, we are maintaining our guidance range but based on the recent events, we are trending to the bottom of the guidance ranges. The full year impact from the Parish Unit 8 outage based on current prices, is estimated to be a little over $200 million. The fleet carries both business interruption insurance for lost earnings and property damage insurer to cover the cost of returning the unit to full operation. Given that the outage started at the beginning of May, the second quarter impact reflects the deductible period. As of today, we're assuming the business interruption insurance proceeds will not be collected until 2023. However, the property damage proceeds will more closely match the expenses and the maintenance CAPEX deployed throughout the time needed to restore the unit. Additionally, for free cash flow before growth, we continue to closely manage the impact to working capital from higher commodity prices, primarily in our natural gas business. To be clear, as for the transitory items disclosed at the end of last year, we have taken and we will continue to take steps aimed to improve our position. In particular, we have identified a serious opportunity in managing our costs and operating expenses, including early realization of synergies and onetime reduction of expenses. And as you know, we manage our business for cash so we have also incorporated action to improve cash generation and mitigate our net working capital increases, including through the recovery of property damage proceeds and noncore asset sales. We look forward to providing you additional updates throughout the year. I will turn now to Slide 10 for a brief update of our 2022 capital allocation. Moving left to right, the midpoint of our free cash flow before growth guidance remains unchanged at $1.290 billion. Next, we received $689 million of securitization proceeds from ERCOT related to Winter Storm Uri in late June, which net of the bill credit issued to C&I customers brings the total net inflow for 2022 to $599 million. As mentioned before, we expect to receive an incremental $80 million of cash proceeds from some additional recovery. Focusing next on change from last quarter, since mid of this year we have repurchased an additional 143 million of shares towards our $1 billion repurchase program, leaving a robust $595 million to be completed by year-end. Next, we have reduced the amount of expected other investments by the net cash proceeds of the sale of our interest in the Watson facility for $59 million. Lastly, given the additional Uri recovery and asset sales net cash proceeds, we have increased capital available for allocation by $141 million. As you see in the far right column, the total remaining capital available for allocation is $456 million, of which we have earmarked approximately $100 million to fund the initial project in our $2 billion growth plan, including the initiatives that are being launched to accelerate the growth of our Goal Zero business. The remaining $356 million will be allocated later in the year as we earn the cash. Back to you, Mauricio. Yes, Angie, so regarding your question regarding -- related to bad debt expenses, we are not seeing any pickup in the bad debt expenses considered now the level of receivables is much higher, given the level of gas prices and power. So when we see percentage is absolutely in line. And even we look at late payment fees and so on, and it's pretty normal, particularly in Texas. So for the time being, we are not seeing any sign of deterioration of the quality of our receivable portfolio. Yes, it is correct. However, based also on the experience with Limestone, we're trying to accelerate the property damage, insurance proceeds, and link it basically to the expenses and the CAPEX that we're going to deploy this year. So that's the area where we see more opportunity. Correct."

To that end, I am pleased to report that our strong track record of execution as a public company continued through the first quarter of 2022 as we grew total revenue by nearly 15% and adjusted EBITDA by almost 26%. We originated over 66,000 new smart home subscribers, which is a record for the first quarter period. Our last 12-month attrition rate was 11.2%, which was a 15-quarter low and a 60 basis point improvement versus the prior year. We believe our attrition rate is the lowest among national smart home companies by a significant margin. Our improving customer retention is a result of years of work and collaboration to improve the overall credit quality of our customers as well as performance enhancements across our portfolio of products and services. We ended Q1 with net service cost per subscriber near all-time lows, a strong indication that we are operating the business efficiently and effectively while delighting our customers. Our recurring revenue model has proven resilient during challenging economic times. And we believe the peace of mind and security we provide is relevant in any environment. We believe the momentum in the first quarter sets the stage for us to meet our full year targets for total subscribers, revenue and adjusted EBITDA that we communicated to the market in late February. Given the challenges presented by rising interest rates and supply chain constraints, we are lowering the bottom end of our guidance range for free cash flow while leaving the top end of the range unchanged. Dale will speak to the specifics of this change in his remarks. We are focused on redefining the home experience with technology, products and services that create a smarter, greener, safer home, while saving our customers' money every month. Our integrated platform is the core enabler that allows us to deliver on this mission. We process more than 1.1 billion events per day across our subscriber portfolio. Our average customer has about 15 devices in their home and interacts with their system nearly 11 times per day and stays with us for approximately 9 years. Our proprietary platform allows us to not only protect our customers' homes and families, but to make their homes more enjoyable and intelligent as we integrate solutions with artificial intelligence to make smart decisions on their behalf. As we work to also bundle Smart Energy and Smart Insurance, we will leverage our integrated, easy-to-use operating system to help customers save money on their electric bills and insurance premiums. We believe our strategy provides distinct advantages that will allow us to increase the lifetime value of our customers, which in turn should drive strong economic value for our shareholders. We expect that the unit economics of our customers should also improve, further enhancing the cash flow generation of the company and allowing us to reinvest in compelling value-accretive initiatives. We are confident in our strategy as our data indicates that at scale, a customer who bundles smart home with Smart Energy and/or Smart Insurance has a greater lifetime value than a smart home customer alone. Moreover, the lifetime value of a smart home customer increases by $200 to $400 with each additional year they remain on the platform. And we believe that customers who bundle services will remain with us longer than the current 9-year average. We believe our broader platform strategy will further cement Vivint as being in a Category of One. And as we leverage the advantages from our intelligent and integrated platform, we will further extend our leadership in the do-it-for-me smart home segment. Of course, executing on our strategy of making smart homes smarter, leaner and safer requires us to focus on operational excellence, continuous product innovation and a commitment to enhancing the experience of our customers. I am pleased to welcome Rasesh Patel, our new Chief Operating Officer, to the Vivint team. Rasesh would join us in mid-May, and he brings to Vivint 20-plus years of experience in building technology service businesses, driving innovation and improving the customer experience, most recently as the Chief Product and Platform Officer of AT&T Business, a segment with $35 billion in annual revenue. He will oversee all of our customer-facing operations as well as our technology and product platform. We look forward to Rasesh helping us refine our approach to expanding the lifetime value of our customers. Turning to our key strategic adjacencies. As one of the first smart home companies to expand into Smart Energy, we are very encouraged by the momentum we saw in the first quarter. Due to the seasonality of our business, we would expect the majority of our sales to come in the back half of the year. And we remain on track to double the 45 megawatts we sold in 2021. Our Vivint sales force and strategic partners who seamlessly bundle a Vivint smart home system with solar are seeing a considerably better sales realization rate than those who are only selling solar. This is an incredible demonstration of the power we bring by offering a bundled solution. And it strikes directly at one of the issues that solar industry struggles with, wasted upfront costs on the sales of a solar system that never get installed. Our long-term vision is to combine energy production and consumption into an integrated platform that uses data-infused AI to manage power consumption more intelligently. Our nationwide footprint and ability to install our award-winning smart home solution within a day or 2 of a customer signing up for solar, we believe, is a game changer for the industry and for our customers. We believe that as we grow and solidify our go-to-market partnerships, we will prove to be a powerful and differentiated combination to grow and retain smart home customers. Even Pack, who I've worked with for several years at Vivint Solar, joined the Vivint leadership team a few months back to lead our smart home energy initiative and manage our relationships with these key partners. I'm confident he is the right person to lead our smart home energy business in this next phase of growth. Surveys show that less than 4% of the addressable homes in the U.S. have adopted solar at this point with our nearly 1.9 million customers across North America. We believe there is a significant opportunity to provide bundled Smart Energy to our existing customers as well as the hundreds of thousands of new subscribers we add to our portfolio every year. Now to briefly discuss our Smart Insurance initiative, we continue to believe that our data-rich platform can help better price the risk of a customer who has a professionally installed and actively monitored smart home system that can potentially mitigate the severity of loss events. We believe Vivint customers present a lower risk than homeowners without a smart home system or with an unmonitored DIY system that was inadequately scoped and poorly installed. We continue to invest in this initiative. And in March, we welcomed Ron Davies to a newly created role as the Chief Insurance Officer. In this role, Ron leads all aspects of the Smart Insurance business, including the development of our marketing strategy as well as the process of becoming a Managing General Agent, which will allow us to develop specific homeowner coverages and enables us to provide proprietary insurance offerings. Ron is a proven leader that has showcased his ability to transform and build insurance companies over a career spanning more than 2 decades at universally recognized brands such as Progressive, Allstate and most recently, Safe Auto, which was recently purchased by Allstate. In closing, we're extremely pleased with our performance in the first quarter of 2022, and we're excited about the future. The markets in which we operate are large, they're growing and provides significant headroom for growth. Our business model provides a platform for growth in smart home as well as adjacencies like Smart Energy, Smart Insurance and more. We believe that we'll continue to grow at a much faster rate than our do-it-for-me peers and do so in a profitable way while generating positive free cash flow that we can invest in value-accretive opportunities. With that, I will turn the call over to Dale to further discuss our first quarter results and our outlook for the year.\nDale Gerard: Thank you, David. Good afternoon, everyone. My comments will refer to information in our earnings presentation that was posted to the Investor Relations section of our website at vivint.com prior to this call. Following my prepared remarks, we will open the call for a Q&A session. Our key subscriber portfolio metrics continued to perform well and showed year-over-year improvement in the quarter. During the first quarter of 2022, we had growth in total subscribers of 9.6% and versus the prior year period, decreasing from 1.71 million to 1.87 million. Our average monthly recurring revenue per user, or AMRRU, in the first quarter increased 3.1% year-over-year to $67.87. The average in AMRRU was driven by customers purchasing incremental smart home products at the initial point of sale, a trend that we have seen over the past several quarters. The year-over-year growth in total subscribers and AMRRU drove a 12.9% increase in total monthly recurring revenue or total MRR. For the first quarter of 2022, total MRR was $126.5 million, up from $112 million reported in the prior year period. Moving on to revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Revenue grew by 14.7% to $392.7 million in the first quarter of 2022. The growth in revenue was attributable to the previously mentioned double-digit increase in total subscribers and the increase in AMRRU as well as a solid contribution from our Smart Energy initiative. We are very pleased with the first quarter's revenue growth, and we remain on track to meet or exceed our revenue guidance for the full year. Like revenue, adjusted EBITDA grew nicely in the first quarter of 2022, finishing at $202.3 million, up 25.9% from the same period in 2021 with a margin of 51.5%. The scaling of service costs and lower G&A expenses were the primary drivers of the 25.9% year-over-year increase. I would note that in the first quarter of 2021, we incurred a onetime legal expense, and this was the primary driver of the decrease in year-over-year G&A cost. We are happy with the growth in adjusted EBITDA and our ability to increase adjusted EBITDA margin in the face of continued economic challenges and supply chain restraints. Next, I will highlight a few metrics on subscriber originations in the first quarter of 2022, led by 8.9% year-over-year growth in our National Inside Sales. We installed a first quarter record of 66,734 new subscribers. Additionally, our Smart Energy partnership continues to show the benefits of bundling smart home with solar, adding 2,940 new Vivint Smart Home subscribers in the quarter. Nearly all of the customers originated in the quarter either paid in full or financed the purchase of their equipment through one of our financing partners. As we have discussed on prior earnings calls, the timing of the payment of fees to our primary financing partner has changed from over the term of the loan to upfront and netted from the gross proceeds received from that partner. Due to this change, we are updating how we report average proceeds collected at point of sale and net subscriber acquisition cost for a new subscriber. These metrics will now include the fees paid to our financing partners for all periods shown, whether the fees are paid over the term of the loan or upfront at the point of sale. Net of fees paid to our financing partners, average proceeds collected grew by $93 from $1,556 in the last 12-month period ended March 31, 2021, to $1,649 in the same period in 2022. Average proceeds collected at point of sale, excluding finance fees, increased from $2,067 in 2021 to $2,185 in 2022. I will next cover our net service cost per subscriber and net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber for the quarter. We continued our trend of year-over-year improvement in net service cost per subscriber, dropping from $10.77 in the first quarter of 2021 to $10.18 in the first quarter of 2022. Our net service cost per subscriber for the first quarter remained near an all-time low. Our net service margin retained -- remained strong at 78.2%. These results reinforce the advantage of Vivint's fully integrated platform, which encompasses the entire customer journey as well as the constant feedback loop that enables us to continuously improve the performance of our products and platform. Before I discuss net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber, as mentioned earlier, we are now including the fees paid to our financing partners in the reporting of this metric, whether those fees are paid over the term of the loan or upfront at the point of sale. Including financing fees, net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber for the last 12 months ended March 31, 2022, was $618, up slightly from $577 in the prior year period, but down $635 or approximately 50% from the same period in 2019. The marginal year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher equipment and housing-related expenses. Net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber, excluding financing fees, was $82, up slightly from $66 in the prior period, but down $878 from the same period in 2019. Our customer financing model, Vivint Flex Pay, has been instrumental in our transition from using cash, taking on debt to grow the business, to producing cash, reducing debt and having the flexibility to invest in new initiatives that we believe will be value accretive for our shareholders. Another metric we are happy to report is our last 12-month attrition rate. For the period ended March 31, 2022, our attrition rate improved for the eighth consecutive quarter to 11.2%, a 15-quarter low. Our enhanced underwriting standards improved product and service performance and the high level of customer engagement with our platform continue to drive what we believe is the lowest attrition rate among national smart home companies. In terms of net cash used in operating activities, we used $31.1 million -- excuse me, $36.1 million during the first quarter of 2022, up $21.9 million from the first quarter of 2021, which was primarily driven by a change in the timing of interest payments due to the refinancing of our debt last year and a change in the timing of financing fees paid to our lead financing partner. We finished the quarter with $153.2 million of cash on hand and a very strong liquidity position of approximately $510 million. In conclusion, we are proud of our consistent execution across our key financial and operational metrics, particularly since becoming a public company in January of 2020. The fundamentals of the business remain strong. We are pleased with our momentum going into the second quarter, and we are bullish about the opportunities that lie ahead of us. We are also aware of the continuing supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, rising interest rates and challenging labor dynamics. Taking all of these into consideration, we are reaffirming our original guidance issued during our fourth quarter of 2021 earnings call for total subscribers, revenue and adjusted EBITDA. And we are lowering the bottom end of our guidance range for free cash flow by $17 million to $50 million, while leaving the top end of the range unchanged at $77 million. We expect to end the year with total subscribers within the range of 1.95 million and 2 million, total revenue within the range of $1.6 billion and $1.63 billion, adjusted EBITDA within the range of $725 million and $745 million and free cash flow within the range of $50 million and $77 million. This concludes our prepared remarks for the first quarter.  Operator, please open the call for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs.\nMax Gamperl: This is Max Gamperl on for Rod. First question would be on just if you could just elaborate on the attrition trends in the quarter and kind of how that compares to your expectations heading into the quarter? And from a longer-term perspective, where we should expect attrition to go from here for the rest of the year and maybe even beyond some of the older cohorts come to an end?\nDale Gerard: Yes. I'll start with that. This is Dale. And then, David, you can jump in here and add anything. I think we're continuing to see attrition or retention of our customers perform really well. They're probably ahead of our -- again, our expectation in the first quarter. But again, we think when you have the interaction 11 times a day that individuals are acting with our system -- interacting with our system, they're using the system, they're finding value in it, they're more likely to keep staying with the system they're paying for. And I think that's what we're seeing. And I think over time, our product and our service also continues to get better, and there's more functionality that they're able to get out of it. And so that's leading to, again, customers that are wanting the system and wanting this service that we provide. In terms of what we see, I think we've said, hey, guidance-wise, we expect attrition to probably be in the 12% range for the full year. And I think that's what we said coming into this year in terms of guidance there. I think we still expect that. We're cautious. I mean there's lots going on with the economy, as you know, Max, and why we think the attrition will continue to perform really well, and we believe it will, I think for guidance-wise, what we said we're expecting. A part of that is we have -- we know that the end of term percentage of customers will go up from where it is today as we go through renewals here later in the year. I think we're at 10.2% of customers that are at their initial end of contract for this last 12-month period. We expect that to go up higher than that as we go through 2022. And so that's why we're saying, hey, based upon the hydraulics, when you have more customers at end of turn, the attrition usually of those cohorts at that point in time or higher, then we expect 12% or somewhere in that range for full year guidance. The one thing I would point out and then, David, you can jump in if there's anything else, is the last time we were at this type -- this low was in, I think, the second quarter of 2018, and we had a -- we have 10.8%, like I said, of customers during the term this period. It was 12.2% or 12.3% at that point. So we've got -- we're performing better across the board. And so we're really excited about where that is and continue to perform better than what we expect. And we continue to think that will happen throughout the year. David, I don't know if you have anything more.\nDavid Bywater: No, I think that point is just I wanted to make. The other thing is, Max, I do think this is a good illustration of the integrated model. I see the collaboration between our operations teams and our innovation teams. And we own the product, we own the IP. And seeing those 2 teams work well together to root cause anything that is causing friction with the customers and how they collaborate to knock down those issues proactively is great to see. And those 2 teams worked really, really well together. It's very close. So it's not this large disparate set of solutions from across a large array of parties. It's -- the majority of it is what we own and do internally. So I think we're really pleased with the results coming from the integrated model. So, so far, so good. And I think as I mentioned in my comments, from everything we can see, I think we're materially ahead of a lot of our peers. And we're proud of that, and we'll continue to work hard to continue to widen that gap.\nMax Gamperl: Got it. That's helpful. And then another question would be, just from a macro perspective, how are you thinking about direct-to-home sales heading into the summer? With COVID largely in the rearview mirror for the first time in, I guess, 2 years, I guess that should probably help your direct-to-home sales, but we also have a tough operating environment with rising labor costs. So wondering about your direct-to-home sales strategy for this year?\nDavid Bywater: Yes. No, great question. Direct-to-home is a very important channel for us. We launched the summer about 2.5, almost 3 weeks ago. We're off to a great start. Actually, we've been very pleased with the first few weeks. They're performing better than we expected. And it's probably one of our best launches in years. So we're very encouraged by that. It's a collaborative sell. It's an informative sell. And so we're very good at this. I think we're best in class at this. We've been doing this for decades now. And our teams know how to sell, where to sell. They're very pleased with the platform and services that we have to offer. And I think our productivity, we're very encouraged what we've seen in the first few weeks. So we're very bullish, and I'm very, very encouraged by the results we've seen. You usually know within the first 4 or 5 weeks of the summer how the summer is going to trend out. And thus far, all the data seems to be a very strong summer for us. So very, very encouraged.\nDale Gerard: Yes. Having COVID behind us is a great thing, but also, we're seeing the sales productivity hasn't really been hurt by kind of the economic chaos going on. So we're still cautious, but so far, so good. So let's see how a few more weeks stack up, and we'll report in August, but feeling good about it.\nOperator: Our next question goes to Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital.\nAshish Sabadra: So maybe just a quick question on the free cash flow guidance. I was just wondering what takes you to the high end versus the low end of the guidance range. And maybe just a follow-up question there. Like why do we see that impact on the free cash flow, but haven't really seen those headwinds impacting the EBITDA or other line items? So any color there will be helpful as well.\nDale Gerard: Yes. So with the rising interest rates, we have 2 pieces of kind of debt. I would say we have the term loan that's on our balance sheet. And then the bigger component is really the Citizens financing. As you know, we offer that to consumers for 0% APR. And so our costs associated to do that as the rates rise will increase. And so we're trying to do some forecasting there around what we think will happen around rates in the different swap curves. And so that's why we said, hey, based upon where we see rates today and what we expect, the increases will be at the next 2 or 3 or 4 fed meetings. We factored that into kind of our estimates and said, \"Hey, we think that there will be potentially a greater use of cash than we originally anticipated when we did our models for the beginning of the year.\" The reason why you don't see that into like EBITDA, for example, is when that comes through, it comes through as a reduction to revenue. And so as we put it on -- so if you take the gross amount less the fee, that net amounts what we put into deferred revenue and we recognize over, say, 60 months period of the loan. And so while it will be a lot -- could be $10 million, $20 million in incremental cash, depending on what happens with rates here, it's very small when you look at it on a revenue basis because it gets spread out over, I think, about 5 years. So in any one period of time for revenue, it's not going to be material to change the numbers. But on a cash basis, because it's the cash that we get in this period related to those new sales, it will have some impact there. So that's why we're just -- we're being -- realizing what's really happening in the economy. We're seeing these rates go up, and they're going up a lot faster. I think maybe when you look at the yield curves in the out 2, 3 years -- you've got to remember most of our loans we put on the Citizens are 60-month loans. And so that cost, while the rates have not increased that dramatically when you look at it just quarter-over-quarter, 1 year rates, but the calculation used to figure out what our cost is with them, it uses longer-term periods, and those rates have -- went up higher than what they were the last time when we put out our guidance.\nAshish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. And maybe just on my follow-up. Thanks for that disclosure on the Smart Energy partners and the new subscribers which are generated from that channel. And just given the higher energy prices, it seems to be a strong demand for solar energy. So I was wondering what are you seeing on that front. And how should we think that partnership helping drive accelerated subscriber growth going forward?\nDavid Bywater: Yes. We are seeing some strong demand there. I think the work that the team did 2 years ago, that partnership that we really brought to market last summer, was fortuitous because we knew that there was a strong desire to bundle the 2. We've known that for years. But we really saw the benefits of it at the end of last summer and then throughout this last fall and winter. We have forecast that we will double our megawatts. We may do more than that. We also see that there are some challenges on the solar side. There's some challenges with regards to supply constraints to their own panels that is causing some concern. And so we're also just being realistic around the access to panels there. And there's also financing costs that impact solar, just like there is across all consumer products. But having said that, those headwinds are real. They're similar to what we see on the smart home side. But there is this desire, obviously, to control your energy costs. And I think with the rising cost of petroleum, there are people who are saying, \"Hey, net-net, long term, I want to be able to be in control of that.\" And so I think they have that longer vision, and they are pushing forward to adopt solar. There is a strong desire there. And as we mentioned, we're seeing a very -- a much higher pull-through of those sells that actually go to install, which at the end of the day is what really matters when they bundle smart home. We knew from the work that we had done from all of the survey work that there was a strong desire to bundle them. And in fact, in practice, we're seeing a materially higher pull-through rate. So we think we're on to something pretty special, and our partners agree. And so there's a ying and yang and a pro and a con in the current environment. But net-net, we think that the demand for solar will continue to be strong, and the demand to bundle what we have will be even stronger. And those that provide the bundled solution would [like] the customers even more and provide them more value. And as a result, we think we can actually do a better job in winning in that market space. But yes, it will continue to be very strong in solar.\nAshish Sabadra: That's great color. And again, solid results and good to see the great momentum in both subscriber and revenue growth.\nDavid Bywater: Yes. Thank you. It was a great quarter, and we're optimistic for the full year.\nOperator: Our next question goes to Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.\nErik Woodring: I just want to echo the congrats, really strong quarter across the board really. So -- and that kind of gets to my question, which is you saw a nice upside in 1Q, kept your full year guidance unchanged. Just want to understand, is that more a function of trying to embed some conservatism in the model for the rest of the year, given what's going on? Or has there been any change in outlook as we think about the remainder of the year? And then I have a follow-up.\nDale Gerard: Thanks for the question. It's really embedding conservatism. I don't know if it's conservatism or it's being cautious to what we're seeing in the marketplaces, frankly, right? It was a great first quarter. And as David just mentioned, we're bullish on the full year prospect. But we're also -- there's lots of things going on in the economy that we just don't know how consumer behavior, if it will change. We haven't seen it today. And as David -- we're feeling good about the start of the direct-to-home sales season. That's a couple of weeks in. But for where we are today, we're 5 months into the year, I think we feel pretty good saying, \"Hey, that's where we think we'll be.\" And as we get deeper into the year and we get second quarter credit, if there's a need to make any revisions, and I'm sure we will. But it's really just thoughtful about everything that's going on out there. With supply chain, David, you can jump in this, but I think everyone with supply chain in 2022 -- like we went through 2021 and were like, supply chain, you can't get any worse from that or it's going to get better in '22. And we're not. We're still seeing it's -- every day, it's a battle to make sure we got de-commenced from subcomponents and suppliers, and we've got to work then to get those components recommitted or we've got to go out and find other suppliers to bring us those components. You've got -- they've got labor constraints. I think you got China shut down, which is where a lot of subcomponents actually come out of. We don't really manufacture finished goods in China, but a lot of the subcomponents that go into our finished cameras and panels and so forth come out of there. And so after disruption, we don't know what's -- I don't know what's going to -- how long that's going to go on or what that really will look like. And it's not only in just timing, it does, but it's also in cost. There's got to be more cost. They have to use more air freight. It's going to be higher manufacturing costs because they're going to have to use more labor and overtime to catch -- keep the volumes that we need to come into production. So there's just a lot of things out there that we see, but don't have like full visibility to what those could -- how those could impact us. And so that's why we're kind of leaving that full year kind of where it is today from what we know and what we see. David, I don't know if you have to say anything else.\nDavid Bywater: No, I agree. We have a gentleman named [Indiscernible] that runs our direct-to-home. And I've been talking to him. It's interesting, you think about this year, we're encouraged by the start of direct-to-home this year. And the reason why I bring that up is because I think the solutions that we have this year, that we're bringing forth with our sales force to our customers, it resonates. These bundled stations, they resonate. The fact that we're trying to make homes safer, more efficient and also more cost effective, they resonate. We talked about the road map of our company, we're trying to extend how long we are with customers to pull our high service margins we have in our current business plus bundle and incremental margin, and we're trying to create more value for our customers. I mean you take all of that -- and we're encouraged by the year. So -- and Q1 was a great manifestation of that. I mean the work we're doing with our inside sells, our direct-to-home really kicks off in the spring and summer, but our inside sales was relatively strong. So we feel good about the refinement of our strategy and our execution of our strategy. Our operations teams, I mean, they continue to dial in on their ability to execute even in a more leveraged way than they have in the past. So we're encouraged. But yes, to Dale's point, I'm not sure the Ukrainian conflict with Russia, not sure oil price is going to end up. Still I'm concerned about the supply chain constraints. And then interest rates, we have the 3-year curve. Not exactly sure if it goes to try to beat them. So it's that unknown. We just thought it was prudent just the [holds] where we are. And our goal with you guys is give it to you how we see it. We beat -- we've done a really good job performing ever since we did the IPO. We don't want to blow that. We want you to believe in what we say, and that's kind of how we roll. So...\nErik Woodring: I appreciate all that color, and I think you're taking the right strategy, so kudos to you. Maybe just my follow-up. David, I think you mentioned a comment earlier where you said the customer stays for 9 years. Is that just a subtle hint that you think your long-term attrition rate, which was originally thought to be closer to 12%, could actually be lower than that because you now see customers staying kind of 9 years versus the high end of 7 or 8 years? That was kind of the prior estimation. I just want to make sure if that was just a comment in passing or if that's something that you think has fundamentally changed, where now the long-term attrition rate might now be lower than it was -- than you were thinking maybe 3, 6, 9, 12 months ago?\nDavid Bywater: No, Erik, we're very explicit about this. I mean our aspiration is very much to turn long-term customers into lifetime customers. I mean it's very aspirational. But our goal here is to have it be 12 years, 15 years. A solar relationship is 35 years. If you bring to them a better insurance solution that they benefit from because of their smart home solution, why would they go anywhere else? If we can continue to make their home more efficient today and more enjoyable, and they interact with that whole more and more on, why would they go anywhere else. So it very much is our stated desire and objective to bring them value so that it goes from 9 to 12 to 13, and that would very much reduce attrition. I talk about this internally a fair bit, we're trying to have the entire bundled solution be a lower cost than they have today. And when you do that and you help educate the consumer about the value you're bringing, I really do hope that we're dropping out hundreds of basis points of attrition over time. And by math, you extend that relationship. It's so interesting. 10 years ago, when you were just in the security business, you sold a system and people hoped that they never had to use it. They hope they never got -- had an instance where they had an alarm go off. By default, they never knew if it was really working. And we've completely flipped that. We are trying to drive interaction with them every day. We're reminding them every day of the value that we bring. So we always talk about that 11 times per day. We hope that we can get that to 13 times a day, 15 times a day, where you're so integral into their family. It's so funny, my wife, she hates it. But I will often get on my phone. I will see her on our -- my cameras in the house. And I'll talk to her over the phone, and she's like, David, I hate this, you can now see what I'm doing at home. But I'm interacting with my family at different times if I'm late for dinner. I'll actually -- I'll be having dinner, and I'll be talking to them. There's new ways that I'm interacting with my family that I never thought about a year ago. So we're always trying to think about ways that we can become more central to who they are so that they can't live without us. So yes, very much, Erik, I hope that, that average lifetime continues to go up. And like I said, on just the smart home alone, not even including insurance or so, just the smart home, for every year we extend it, it depends on how big the package is, it's $200 to $400 more of lifetime value. And then when you add in solar and you add in insurance, my goal here is to show you guys over time, the lifetime value of the customer is expanding nicely. So you as investors are saying, wait a minute, this is a superior investment option for us. [Indiscernible] so that's what we're trying to prove to you.\nOperator: Our next question goes to Paul Chung with JPMorgan.\nPaul Chung: So just on 1Q, what kind of drove the big uptick there? Typically seasonally slower. What were some pockets of demand, what regions you saw strength? And then how is competition kind of faring? Are more and more people becoming aware of your brand?\nDavid Bywater: Well, Paul, it's David. In Q1, most of that was driven through our inside sales. So the seasonality of our direct home, they really kick in as we've diversified our channels. You really see the strength of direct-to-home in Q2 and Q3 and then part of Q4. But -- so really Q1, the majority of that is from inside sales. And I really think that's a function of many things. One, once again, I think our product is getting better. And so that's folks who are researching our product, they're seeing the accolade that we have from our product. We call ourselves a Category of One. We really do think that we have the best product out there for the money. And so I think people see that. The success of our direct-to-home, you see all the advertisers, all the homes that have the signs out front, you know that -- we benefit from that. So there's a symbiotic relationship here between the 2. But that was really around just digital marketing and the effectiveness of that and just the brand awareness. We've done a fair bit of survey work around our brand awareness. It's surprisingly high for how little we spend on brand. And we think that's earned brand. That's from doing this now for 20 years and really earning that on a word-of-mouth basis, which is the most valuable brand awareness you can possibly have. So once again, it's hard earned. And that was really largely from inside sales, which I think stands on the merit of the efficacy of the product.\nDale Gerard: The other thing I'd just layer in that, too, is inside sales is really, really strong in the quarter. We did pick up almost 3,000 additional new subscribers from that partnership that we've created. As David said, groundwork was laid 18, 24 months ago, really started coming to fruition in '21, and we're continuing to see that really come full circle, so to speak, in 2022. And so we got almost 3,000 new business from smart homes, from a channel that didn't exist previously. And we think there's lots of -- because solar largely sold year around, right? And the team has helped them understand the value of bundling. And as we train them, and they've seen the benefits, that's true, that engine has also helped us, yes. So inside sales and that new channel coming online. Yes, good point.\nDavid Bywater: And you see that in the numbers.\nPaul Chung: Right, yes. From the solar stuff -- yes, the solar stuff. So nice momentum there. How do we think about kind of the new subs growth relative to the doubling of the megawatts you mentioned and kind of the revenue and margin contribution per sub kind of moving forward on that basis? And then, I guess, the same kind of question for smart insurance, kind of the unit economics per sub there.\nDale Gerard: Yes. So I'll start with Smart Insurance and work our way back. Paul, this is Dale. We're not really giving out -- we haven't given out. I think we're still very early into the life cycle of the insurance business and building out. I mean we got 7,000 or so sold policies last year. So that's very early, continue to build out. We're spending and investing there. That's one of the investments that we're making in 2022 to build out the MGA that we're working on. Ron has been in place -- Ron Davies, who we brought in to lead, has been in place for 60 days, I think, at this point. So very early there. We think -- we definitely believe it's accretive to our EBITDA margin and definitely drives extended and increased lifetime value of the customer. But we'll give those down when I think it's appropriate, when we have a better feel for what those really look like because there's a lot of movement there still today. I think on the Smart Energy side, I think that 45 megawatts that we did last year would be -- that's probably 5,000 homes or so. So if you double that this year, you get to 90, you're probably in the 9,500 to 10,000 homes. And we believe that we'll be able to drive incremental value and margin out of that business. And then what I think comes -- there's 2 pieces of that, right? There's the revenue that's generated from the selling of that solar to that customer and we get the margin from that. And then there's also, from this partnership, the development and increased Vivint Smart Home customers that have very strong margins in terms of lifetime value. So there's kind of 2 pieces to that. I think we want to make sure we think of it that way. I think we can drive 10,000-ish or more new subs from that, smart home subs. And then you'll have -- last year, I think we said that 45 megawatts was, call it, $45 million to $50 million of revenue. And so you can kind of back in, if we're doubling where we are this year, then we're probably looking at somewhere between, call it, $85 million and $95 million of revenue from that. And then we're still working. It's early. I think we feel good about where our cost structure will come out there. But it's probably a little still early, but I think it will be somewhere north of 10%, what we'd say, as the margin on that. And I think our goal is to get into the mid- to high teens, but there's -- we're still working on that.\nDavid Bywater: On our investments. We're making investments now to make sure that we scale it directly.\nDale Gerard: Again, I think, Paul, to make sure it's incremental to what we've done today, so it's positive to whatever we've done today in terms of EBITDA we're getting from that. And I think it's really about, as David said previously, it's about the lifetime value of the customer. And if you can take that customer that has a 75% to 80% service margin from the smart home side, you can add incremental revenue that you're getting to net customer related to a solar sale or the annual insurance premiums coming in from that customer, it really expands out, we believe, the lifetime value of that customer.\nDavid Bywater: And pull the margin from smart home in other peers.\nDale Gerard: That right. It's really quite powerful. We saw some people were saying, hey, the margin is dilutive. And I'm like, you've got to open your aperture. If you're one of this business on your own, you make your investment because you're protecting and elongating and adding and, most importantly, you're adding value to the customer, which makes you a must-own asset. So as you open your aperture and think about value of the customer, defending your base and incrementally adding margin on a very risk-adjusted basis, it is a no-brainer to do. And the way we're doing it in an asset-light friendly way, it's very, very...\nOperator: Our next question goes to Brian Ruttenbur with Imperial Capital.\nBrian Ruttenbur: First of all, in terms of second quarter, can you talk a little bit about where you see G&A going because you had a dramatic drop in G&A year-over-year sequentially in the first quarter. Where do you see that going in the second quarter?\nDale Gerard: Yes. So sequentially, it will go up from Q1 to Q2, it will go up. I think when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, it's going to be, call it, 5%, 6% growth. So again, one of the things we've really focused on is really trying to drive efficiencies out of the dollars that we're investing. And G&A is an investment. I mean it's like -- it's a capital allocation, like anything else, whether it's new subscribers or technology or products. And so we're really focused on that, Brian, making sure that where we're spending our dollars in G&A, whether that's in finance, legal, marketing, exactly where is it that we're actually getting a return on those dollars. So there will be some year-over-year. I mean there's going to be some -- as you know, Brian, there's going to be some inflationary pressure just on some of the core things that we have in that, whether it's travel. We're starting to see a little bit more travel, David and I have been to conferences and so forth. So there are certain things like that, that we're starting to see. But we're going to try our best to maintain and really drive scale across the G&A.\nBrian Ruttenbur: Okay. Very good. The other question is more macro. It's kind of your road map. Can you talk a little bit more about the insurance offering, where you are now in terms of the rollout, are you going to be farming this out? Are you self-insuring your customers here? How -- what's the structure? And then maybe what other offerings could you potentially be selling through your channel?\nDavid Bywater: Right. Brian, thanks for the question. I'll take that one. So yes, first and foremost, we believe this is a platform play. And we're really seeing that come to fruition last year and then this year. So this ecosystem we have and the home relationship we have with the customers, they're asking us to say, \"Hey, bring us other solutions.\" So we talked about [Indiscernible]. The insurance is a great manifestation of that. So where we are? This last 1.5 years, we really were working on just making sure that we could actually be relevant and the customers [Indiscernible]. We've just been actually just selling policies, reselling policies, just making sure the system is in place, the compliance apparatus to be able to sell to our 2 million customers. And so there wasn't anything terribly creative about that. It was just trying to get the ability to sell correctly through an agency piece. We've been working to actually develop an MGA model, where we can then take the data that we have and underwrite with partners, with a reinsurer to actually be able to have them underwrite a lot of the risks to actually bring data to bear that the customers have on their behalf to underwrite a product that would benefit them. And so this year, our goal is to be into 3 states. We should be into our first state as an MGA later this summer and then hopefully be in 2 more states by the end of the year. And the states we're going into is a function of where our partners want us to go, where we have a large customer base and the risk profile works for our product. So [we want to be thoughtful], Dale mentioned this, this is not be a material piece of our economics probably for a year or 2, what we're trying to do now is just make sure that we do it correctly, methodically working with our partners. There is a very large interest level because we own the data. With our customers, we have the platform. And so we're just making sure we're doing it correctly. We're not relying upon this to be a large revenue lift or a large EBITDA lift or large cash lift or [grain]. We're doing this to be able to prove out value to our customers, and this will be a nice growth engine in the years to come. But most importantly, it's a great manifestation of the platform play [Indiscernible]. The second part of your -- so to answer your question there, Brian, we're partnering with some large, large industry players. We're making sure the risk falls appropriately where it should be, relying upon their expertise and our expertise. We're not trying to play in areas of risk that we're not confident in. We're relying upon them, and we're relying upon what we're really good at to do our part. And that really is the data we have, the installation we have and the servicing we have. And they're helping make sure that we price the risk [Indiscernible]. With regards to where else we can go, we've done a fair bit of work on this, on one of the platforms. We feel right now our plate is pretty full not only with the continued expansion of Smart Home and Smart Energy and Smart Insurance, but also the expansion of channels and how we bring this to market. There's a fair bit on our plate. And for the next 18 to 24 months, we're really digesting and scaling that. But we've mentioned in prior calls that we're interested in aging in place. It's an area and marketplace we think we have a really strong product offering to bring to bear there. And we can really drive out a lot of costs and bring a lot of comfort and value to folks who want to age in their home, where they are happier, healthier and do it in a much more cost-effective way and connect their families. So that's an area that we're doing some work around. And I can see that being an area that we'll probably invest in the future. But right now, we're focused on what we have. And that might be through partnerships -- that may be through partnerships, that may be through organic. And we're still trying to manage exactly how we want to approach that marketplace and when we'll do it. But that's another example of where the platform will most likely go down the road.\nOperator: All questions have been exhausted. So I will turn the conference back over to David Bywater for closing remarks.\nDavid Bywater: Great. We appreciate you guys' interest. Like I said, I think we had a great Q1. We're looking forward to a solid year. We appreciate you guys' ongoing interest in us. We're focused on delighting the customers, taking care of our shareholders, taking care of our employees. I did want to mention to all of you guys that we really appreciate our employees. We think they're world class. I hear often from our customers how well our employees take care of them, whether it's how they sell or how they service them, whether it's calls over the phone or when they're in their homes, a number of incredible employees. And I appreciate how they innovate. I appreciate how they take care of each other and how they come through this COVID crisis with respect to one another and to [help] each other and how they treat our customers. So once again, thanks for your time and your interest, and we look forward to talking to you guys on our next call. Take care.\nOperator: That concludes today's Vivint Smart Home First Quarter 2021 Financial Results Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You can now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Bywater",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Nate, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your ongoing interest in the Vivint story. We continue to work hard every day to earn your confidence and your support. To that end, I am pleased to report that our strong track record of execution as a public company continued through the first quarter of 2022 as we grew total revenue by nearly 15% and adjusted EBITDA by almost 26%. We originated over 66,000 new smart home subscribers, which is a record for the first quarter period. Our last 12-month attrition rate was 11.2%, which was a 15-quarter low and a 60 basis point improvement versus the prior year. We believe our attrition rate is the lowest among national smart home companies by a significant margin. Our improving customer retention is a result of years of work and collaboration to improve the overall credit quality of our customers as well as performance enhancements across our portfolio of products and services. We ended Q1 with net service cost per subscriber near all-time lows, a strong indication that we are operating the business efficiently and effectively while delighting our customers. Our recurring revenue model has proven resilient during challenging economic times. And we believe the peace of mind and security we provide is relevant in any environment. We believe the momentum in the first quarter sets the stage for us to meet our full year targets for total subscribers, revenue and adjusted EBITDA that we communicated to the market in late February. Given the challenges presented by rising interest rates and supply chain constraints, we are lowering the bottom end of our guidance range for free cash flow while leaving the top end of the range unchanged. Dale will speak to the specifics of this change in his remarks. We are focused on redefining the home experience with technology, products and services that create a smarter, greener, safer home, while saving our customers' money every month. Our integrated platform is the core enabler that allows us to deliver on this mission. We process more than 1.1 billion events per day across our subscriber portfolio. Our average customer has about 15 devices in their home and interacts with their system nearly 11 times per day and stays with us for approximately 9 years. Our proprietary platform allows us to not only protect our customers' homes and families, but to make their homes more enjoyable and intelligent as we integrate solutions with artificial intelligence to make smart decisions on their behalf. As we work to also bundle Smart Energy and Smart Insurance, we will leverage our integrated, easy-to-use operating system to help customers save money on their electric bills and insurance premiums. We believe our strategy provides distinct advantages that will allow us to increase the lifetime value of our customers, which in turn should drive strong economic value for our shareholders. We expect that the unit economics of our customers should also improve, further enhancing the cash flow generation of the company and allowing us to reinvest in compelling value-accretive initiatives. We are confident in our strategy as our data indicates that at scale, a customer who bundles smart home with Smart Energy and/or Smart Insurance has a greater lifetime value than a smart home customer alone. Moreover, the lifetime value of a smart home customer increases by $200 to $400 with each additional year they remain on the platform. And we believe that customers who bundle services will remain with us longer than the current 9-year average. We believe our broader platform strategy will further cement Vivint as being in a Category of One. And as we leverage the advantages from our intelligent and integrated platform, we will further extend our leadership in the do-it-for-me smart home segment. Of course, executing on our strategy of making smart homes smarter, leaner and safer requires us to focus on operational excellence, continuous product innovation and a commitment to enhancing the experience of our customers. I am pleased to welcome Rasesh Patel, our new Chief Operating Officer, to the Vivint team. Rasesh would join us in mid-May, and he brings to Vivint 20-plus years of experience in building technology service businesses, driving innovation and improving the customer experience, most recently as the Chief Product and Platform Officer of AT&T Business, a segment with $35 billion in annual revenue. He will oversee all of our customer-facing operations as well as our technology and product platform. We look forward to Rasesh helping us refine our approach to expanding the lifetime value of our customers. Turning to our key strategic adjacencies. As one of the first smart home companies to expand into Smart Energy, we are very encouraged by the momentum we saw in the first quarter. Due to the seasonality of our business, we would expect the majority of our sales to come in the back half of the year. And we remain on track to double the 45 megawatts we sold in 2021. Our Vivint sales force and strategic partners who seamlessly bundle a Vivint smart home system with solar are seeing a considerably better sales realization rate than those who are only selling solar. This is an incredible demonstration of the power we bring by offering a bundled solution. And it strikes directly at one of the issues that solar industry struggles with, wasted upfront costs on the sales of a solar system that never get installed. Our long-term vision is to combine energy production and consumption into an integrated platform that uses data-infused AI to manage power consumption more intelligently. Our nationwide footprint and ability to install our award-winning smart home solution within a day or 2 of a customer signing up for solar, we believe, is a game changer for the industry and for our customers. We believe that as we grow and solidify our go-to-market partnerships, we will prove to be a powerful and differentiated combination to grow and retain smart home customers. Even Pack, who I've worked with for several years at Vivint Solar, joined the Vivint leadership team a few months back to lead our smart home energy initiative and manage our relationships with these key partners. I'm confident he is the right person to lead our smart home energy business in this next phase of growth. Surveys show that less than 4% of the addressable homes in the U.S. have adopted solar at this point with our nearly 1.9 million customers across North America. We believe there is a significant opportunity to provide bundled Smart Energy to our existing customers as well as the hundreds of thousands of new subscribers we add to our portfolio every year. Now to briefly discuss our Smart Insurance initiative, we continue to believe that our data-rich platform can help better price the risk of a customer who has a professionally installed and actively monitored smart home system that can potentially mitigate the severity of loss events. We believe Vivint customers present a lower risk than homeowners without a smart home system or with an unmonitored DIY system that was inadequately scoped and poorly installed. We continue to invest in this initiative. And in March, we welcomed Ron Davies to a newly created role as the Chief Insurance Officer. In this role, Ron leads all aspects of the Smart Insurance business, including the development of our marketing strategy as well as the process of becoming a Managing General Agent, which will allow us to develop specific homeowner coverages and enables us to provide proprietary insurance offerings. Ron is a proven leader that has showcased his ability to transform and build insurance companies over a career spanning more than 2 decades at universally recognized brands such as Progressive, Allstate and most recently, Safe Auto, which was recently purchased by Allstate. In closing, we're extremely pleased with our performance in the first quarter of 2022, and we're excited about the future. The markets in which we operate are large, they're growing and provides significant headroom for growth. Our business model provides a platform for growth in smart home as well as adjacencies like Smart Energy, Smart Insurance and more. We believe that we'll continue to grow at a much faster rate than our do-it-for-me peers and do so in a profitable way while generating positive free cash flow that we can invest in value-accretive opportunities. With that, I will turn the call over to Dale to further discuss our first quarter results and our outlook for the year. No, I think that point is just I wanted to make. The other thing is, Max, I do think this is a good illustration of the integrated model. I see the collaboration between our operations teams and our innovation teams. And we own the product, we own the IP. And seeing those 2 teams work well together to root cause anything that is causing friction with the customers and how they collaborate to knock down those issues proactively is great to see. And those 2 teams worked really, really well together. It's very close. So it's not this large disparate set of solutions from across a large array of parties. It's -- the majority of it is what we own and do internally. So I think we're really pleased with the results coming from the integrated model. So, so far, so good. And I think as I mentioned in my comments, from everything we can see, I think we're materially ahead of a lot of our peers. And we're proud of that, and we'll continue to work hard to continue to widen that gap. Yes. No, great question. Direct-to-home is a very important channel for us. We launched the summer about 2.5, almost 3 weeks ago. We're off to a great start. Actually, we've been very pleased with the first few weeks. They're performing better than we expected. And it's probably one of our best launches in years. So we're very encouraged by that. It's a collaborative sell. It's an informative sell. And so we're very good at this. I think we're best in class at this. We've been doing this for decades now. And our teams know how to sell, where to sell. They're very pleased with the platform and services that we have to offer. And I think our productivity, we're very encouraged what we've seen in the first few weeks. So we're very bullish, and I'm very, very encouraged by the results we've seen. You usually know within the first 4 or 5 weeks of the summer how the summer is going to trend out. And thus far, all the data seems to be a very strong summer for us. So very, very encouraged. Yes. We are seeing some strong demand there. I think the work that the team did 2 years ago, that partnership that we really brought to market last summer, was fortuitous because we knew that there was a strong desire to bundle the 2. We've known that for years. But we really saw the benefits of it at the end of last summer and then throughout this last fall and winter. We have forecast that we will double our megawatts. We may do more than that. We also see that there are some challenges on the solar side. There's some challenges with regards to supply constraints to their own panels that is causing some concern. And so we're also just being realistic around the access to panels there. And there's also financing costs that impact solar, just like there is across all consumer products. But having said that, those headwinds are real. They're similar to what we see on the smart home side. But there is this desire, obviously, to control your energy costs. And I think with the rising cost of petroleum, there are people who are saying, \"Hey, net-net, long term, I want to be able to be in control of that.\" And so I think they have that longer vision, and they are pushing forward to adopt solar. There is a strong desire there. And as we mentioned, we're seeing a very -- a much higher pull-through of those sells that actually go to install, which at the end of the day is what really matters when they bundle smart home. We knew from the work that we had done from all of the survey work that there was a strong desire to bundle them. And in fact, in practice, we're seeing a materially higher pull-through rate. So we think we're on to something pretty special, and our partners agree. And so there's a ying and yang and a pro and a con in the current environment. But net-net, we think that the demand for solar will continue to be strong, and the demand to bundle what we have will be even stronger. And those that provide the bundled solution would [like] the customers even more and provide them more value. And as a result, we think we can actually do a better job in winning in that market space. But yes, it will continue to be very strong in solar. Yes. Thank you. It was a great quarter, and we're optimistic for the full year. No, I agree. We have a gentleman named [Indiscernible] that runs our direct-to-home. And I've been talking to him. It's interesting, you think about this year, we're encouraged by the start of direct-to-home this year. And the reason why I bring that up is because I think the solutions that we have this year, that we're bringing forth with our sales force to our customers, it resonates. These bundled stations, they resonate. The fact that we're trying to make homes safer, more efficient and also more cost effective, they resonate. We talked about the road map of our company, we're trying to extend how long we are with customers to pull our high service margins we have in our current business plus bundle and incremental margin, and we're trying to create more value for our customers. I mean you take all of that -- and we're encouraged by the year. So -- and Q1 was a great manifestation of that. I mean the work we're doing with our inside sells, our direct-to-home really kicks off in the spring and summer, but our inside sales was relatively strong. So we feel good about the refinement of our strategy and our execution of our strategy. Our operations teams, I mean, they continue to dial in on their ability to execute even in a more leveraged way than they have in the past. So we're encouraged. But yes, to Dale's point, I'm not sure the Ukrainian conflict with Russia, not sure oil price is going to end up. Still I'm concerned about the supply chain constraints. And then interest rates, we have the 3-year curve. Not exactly sure if it goes to try to beat them. So it's that unknown. We just thought it was prudent just the [holds] where we are. And our goal with you guys is give it to you how we see it. We beat -- we've done a really good job performing ever since we did the IPO. We don't want to blow that. We want you to believe in what we say, and that's kind of how we roll. So... No, Erik, we're very explicit about this. I mean our aspiration is very much to turn long-term customers into lifetime customers. I mean it's very aspirational. But our goal here is to have it be 12 years, 15 years. A solar relationship is 35 years. If you bring to them a better insurance solution that they benefit from because of their smart home solution, why would they go anywhere else? If we can continue to make their home more efficient today and more enjoyable, and they interact with that whole more and more on, why would they go anywhere else. So it very much is our stated desire and objective to bring them value so that it goes from 9 to 12 to 13, and that would very much reduce attrition. I talk about this internally a fair bit, we're trying to have the entire bundled solution be a lower cost than they have today. And when you do that and you help educate the consumer about the value you're bringing, I really do hope that we're dropping out hundreds of basis points of attrition over time. And by math, you extend that relationship. It's so interesting. 10 years ago, when you were just in the security business, you sold a system and people hoped that they never had to use it. They hope they never got -- had an instance where they had an alarm go off. By default, they never knew if it was really working. And we've completely flipped that. We are trying to drive interaction with them every day. We're reminding them every day of the value that we bring. So we always talk about that 11 times per day. We hope that we can get that to 13 times a day, 15 times a day, where you're so integral into their family. It's so funny, my wife, she hates it. But I will often get on my phone. I will see her on our -- my cameras in the house. And I'll talk to her over the phone, and she's like, David, I hate this, you can now see what I'm doing at home. But I'm interacting with my family at different times if I'm late for dinner. I'll actually -- I'll be having dinner, and I'll be talking to them. There's new ways that I'm interacting with my family that I never thought about a year ago. So we're always trying to think about ways that we can become more central to who they are so that they can't live without us. So yes, very much, Erik, I hope that, that average lifetime continues to go up. And like I said, on just the smart home alone, not even including insurance or so, just the smart home, for every year we extend it, it depends on how big the package is, it's $200 to $400 more of lifetime value. And then when you add in solar and you add in insurance, my goal here is to show you guys over time, the lifetime value of the customer is expanding nicely. So you as investors are saying, wait a minute, this is a superior investment option for us. [Indiscernible] so that's what we're trying to prove to you. Well, Paul, it's David. In Q1, most of that was driven through our inside sales. So the seasonality of our direct home, they really kick in as we've diversified our channels. You really see the strength of direct-to-home in Q2 and Q3 and then part of Q4. But -- so really Q1, the majority of that is from inside sales. And I really think that's a function of many things. One, once again, I think our product is getting better. And so that's folks who are researching our product, they're seeing the accolade that we have from our product. We call ourselves a Category of One. We really do think that we have the best product out there for the money. And so I think people see that. The success of our direct-to-home, you see all the advertisers, all the homes that have the signs out front, you know that -- we benefit from that. So there's a symbiotic relationship here between the 2. But that was really around just digital marketing and the effectiveness of that and just the brand awareness. We've done a fair bit of survey work around our brand awareness. It's surprisingly high for how little we spend on brand. And we think that's earned brand. That's from doing this now for 20 years and really earning that on a word-of-mouth basis, which is the most valuable brand awareness you can possibly have. So once again, it's hard earned. And that was really largely from inside sales, which I think stands on the merit of the efficacy of the product. And you see that in the numbers. On our investments. We're making investments now to make sure that we scale it directly. And pull the margin from smart home in other peers. Right. Brian, thanks for the question. I'll take that one. So yes, first and foremost, we believe this is a platform play. And we're really seeing that come to fruition last year and then this year. So this ecosystem we have and the home relationship we have with the customers, they're asking us to say, \"Hey, bring us other solutions.\" So we talked about [Indiscernible]. The insurance is a great manifestation of that. So where we are? This last 1.5 years, we really were working on just making sure that we could actually be relevant and the customers [Indiscernible]. We've just been actually just selling policies, reselling policies, just making sure the system is in place, the compliance apparatus to be able to sell to our 2 million customers. And so there wasn't anything terribly creative about that. It was just trying to get the ability to sell correctly through an agency piece. We've been working to actually develop an MGA model, where we can then take the data that we have and underwrite with partners, with a reinsurer to actually be able to have them underwrite a lot of the risks to actually bring data to bear that the customers have on their behalf to underwrite a product that would benefit them. And so this year, our goal is to be into 3 states. We should be into our first state as an MGA later this summer and then hopefully be in 2 more states by the end of the year. And the states we're going into is a function of where our partners want us to go, where we have a large customer base and the risk profile works for our product. So [we want to be thoughtful], Dale mentioned this, this is not be a material piece of our economics probably for a year or 2, what we're trying to do now is just make sure that we do it correctly, methodically working with our partners. There is a very large interest level because we own the data. With our customers, we have the platform. And so we're just making sure we're doing it correctly. We're not relying upon this to be a large revenue lift or a large EBITDA lift or large cash lift or [grain]. We're doing this to be able to prove out value to our customers, and this will be a nice growth engine in the years to come. But most importantly, it's a great manifestation of the platform play [Indiscernible]. The second part of your -- so to answer your question there, Brian, we're partnering with some large, large industry players. We're making sure the risk falls appropriately where it should be, relying upon their expertise and our expertise. We're not trying to play in areas of risk that we're not confident in. We're relying upon them, and we're relying upon what we're really good at to do our part. And that really is the data we have, the installation we have and the servicing we have. And they're helping make sure that we price the risk [Indiscernible]. With regards to where else we can go, we've done a fair bit of work on this, on one of the platforms. We feel right now our plate is pretty full not only with the continued expansion of Smart Home and Smart Energy and Smart Insurance, but also the expansion of channels and how we bring this to market. There's a fair bit on our plate. And for the next 18 to 24 months, we're really digesting and scaling that. But we've mentioned in prior calls that we're interested in aging in place. It's an area and marketplace we think we have a really strong product offering to bring to bear there. And we can really drive out a lot of costs and bring a lot of comfort and value to folks who want to age in their home, where they are happier, healthier and do it in a much more cost-effective way and connect their families. So that's an area that we're doing some work around. And I can see that being an area that we'll probably invest in the future. But right now, we're focused on what we have. And that might be through partnerships -- that may be through partnerships, that may be through organic. And we're still trying to manage exactly how we want to approach that marketplace and when we'll do it. But that's another example of where the platform will most likely go down the road. Great. We appreciate you guys' interest. Like I said, I think we had a great Q1. We're looking forward to a solid year. We appreciate you guys' ongoing interest in us. We're focused on delighting the customers, taking care of our shareholders, taking care of our employees. I did want to mention to all of you guys that we really appreciate our employees. We think they're world class. I hear often from our customers how well our employees take care of them, whether it's how they sell or how they service them, whether it's calls over the phone or when they're in their homes, a number of incredible employees. And I appreciate how they innovate. I appreciate how they take care of each other and how they come through this COVID crisis with respect to one another and to [help] each other and how they treat our customers. So once again, thanks for your time and your interest, and we look forward to talking to you guys on our next call. Take care."

            "name": "Dale Gerard",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good afternoon, everyone. My comments will refer to information in our earnings presentation that was posted to the Investor Relations section of our website at vivint.com prior to this call. Following my prepared remarks, we will open the call for a Q&A session. Our key subscriber portfolio metrics continued to perform well and showed year-over-year improvement in the quarter. During the first quarter of 2022, we had growth in total subscribers of 9.6% and versus the prior year period, decreasing from 1.71 million to 1.87 million. Our average monthly recurring revenue per user, or AMRRU, in the first quarter increased 3.1% year-over-year to $67.87. The average in AMRRU was driven by customers purchasing incremental smart home products at the initial point of sale, a trend that we have seen over the past several quarters. The year-over-year growth in total subscribers and AMRRU drove a 12.9% increase in total monthly recurring revenue or total MRR. For the first quarter of 2022, total MRR was $126.5 million, up from $112 million reported in the prior year period. Moving on to revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Revenue grew by 14.7% to $392.7 million in the first quarter of 2022. The growth in revenue was attributable to the previously mentioned double-digit increase in total subscribers and the increase in AMRRU as well as a solid contribution from our Smart Energy initiative. We are very pleased with the first quarter's revenue growth, and we remain on track to meet or exceed our revenue guidance for the full year. Like revenue, adjusted EBITDA grew nicely in the first quarter of 2022, finishing at $202.3 million, up 25.9% from the same period in 2021 with a margin of 51.5%. The scaling of service costs and lower G&A expenses were the primary drivers of the 25.9% year-over-year increase. I would note that in the first quarter of 2021, we incurred a onetime legal expense, and this was the primary driver of the decrease in year-over-year G&A cost. We are happy with the growth in adjusted EBITDA and our ability to increase adjusted EBITDA margin in the face of continued economic challenges and supply chain restraints. Next, I will highlight a few metrics on subscriber originations in the first quarter of 2022, led by 8.9% year-over-year growth in our National Inside Sales. We installed a first quarter record of 66,734 new subscribers. Additionally, our Smart Energy partnership continues to show the benefits of bundling smart home with solar, adding 2,940 new Vivint Smart Home subscribers in the quarter. Nearly all of the customers originated in the quarter either paid in full or financed the purchase of their equipment through one of our financing partners. As we have discussed on prior earnings calls, the timing of the payment of fees to our primary financing partner has changed from over the term of the loan to upfront and netted from the gross proceeds received from that partner. Due to this change, we are updating how we report average proceeds collected at point of sale and net subscriber acquisition cost for a new subscriber. These metrics will now include the fees paid to our financing partners for all periods shown, whether the fees are paid over the term of the loan or upfront at the point of sale. Net of fees paid to our financing partners, average proceeds collected grew by $93 from $1,556 in the last 12-month period ended March 31, 2021, to $1,649 in the same period in 2022. Average proceeds collected at point of sale, excluding finance fees, increased from $2,067 in 2021 to $2,185 in 2022. I will next cover our net service cost per subscriber and net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber for the quarter. We continued our trend of year-over-year improvement in net service cost per subscriber, dropping from $10.77 in the first quarter of 2021 to $10.18 in the first quarter of 2022. Our net service cost per subscriber for the first quarter remained near an all-time low. Our net service margin retained -- remained strong at 78.2%. These results reinforce the advantage of Vivint's fully integrated platform, which encompasses the entire customer journey as well as the constant feedback loop that enables us to continuously improve the performance of our products and platform. Before I discuss net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber, as mentioned earlier, we are now including the fees paid to our financing partners in the reporting of this metric, whether those fees are paid over the term of the loan or upfront at the point of sale. Including financing fees, net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber for the last 12 months ended March 31, 2022, was $618, up slightly from $577 in the prior year period, but down $635 or approximately 50% from the same period in 2019. The marginal year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher equipment and housing-related expenses. Net subscriber acquisition cost per new subscriber, excluding financing fees, was $82, up slightly from $66 in the prior period, but down $878 from the same period in 2019. Our customer financing model, Vivint Flex Pay, has been instrumental in our transition from using cash, taking on debt to grow the business, to producing cash, reducing debt and having the flexibility to invest in new initiatives that we believe will be value accretive for our shareholders. Another metric we are happy to report is our last 12-month attrition rate. For the period ended March 31, 2022, our attrition rate improved for the eighth consecutive quarter to 11.2%, a 15-quarter low. Our enhanced underwriting standards improved product and service performance and the high level of customer engagement with our platform continue to drive what we believe is the lowest attrition rate among national smart home companies. In terms of net cash used in operating activities, we used $31.1 million -- excuse me, $36.1 million during the first quarter of 2022, up $21.9 million from the first quarter of 2021, which was primarily driven by a change in the timing of interest payments due to the refinancing of our debt last year and a change in the timing of financing fees paid to our lead financing partner. We finished the quarter with $153.2 million of cash on hand and a very strong liquidity position of approximately $510 million. In conclusion, we are proud of our consistent execution across our key financial and operational metrics, particularly since becoming a public company in January of 2020. The fundamentals of the business remain strong. We are pleased with our momentum going into the second quarter, and we are bullish about the opportunities that lie ahead of us. We are also aware of the continuing supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, rising interest rates and challenging labor dynamics. Taking all of these into consideration, we are reaffirming our original guidance issued during our fourth quarter of 2021 earnings call for total subscribers, revenue and adjusted EBITDA. And we are lowering the bottom end of our guidance range for free cash flow by $17 million to $50 million, while leaving the top end of the range unchanged at $77 million. We expect to end the year with total subscribers within the range of 1.95 million and 2 million, total revenue within the range of $1.6 billion and $1.63 billion, adjusted EBITDA within the range of $725 million and $745 million and free cash flow within the range of $50 million and $77 million. This concludes our prepared remarks for the first quarter.  Operator, please open the call for Q&A. Yes. I'll start with that. This is Dale. And then, David, you can jump in here and add anything. I think we're continuing to see attrition or retention of our customers perform really well. They're probably ahead of our -- again, our expectation in the first quarter. But again, we think when you have the interaction 11 times a day that individuals are acting with our system -- interacting with our system, they're using the system, they're finding value in it, they're more likely to keep staying with the system they're paying for. And I think that's what we're seeing. And I think over time, our product and our service also continues to get better, and there's more functionality that they're able to get out of it. And so that's leading to, again, customers that are wanting the system and wanting this service that we provide. In terms of what we see, I think we've said, hey, guidance-wise, we expect attrition to probably be in the 12% range for the full year. And I think that's what we said coming into this year in terms of guidance there. I think we still expect that. We're cautious. I mean there's lots going on with the economy, as you know, Max, and why we think the attrition will continue to perform really well, and we believe it will, I think for guidance-wise, what we said we're expecting. A part of that is we have -- we know that the end of term percentage of customers will go up from where it is today as we go through renewals here later in the year. I think we're at 10.2% of customers that are at their initial end of contract for this last 12-month period. We expect that to go up higher than that as we go through 2022. And so that's why we're saying, hey, based upon the hydraulics, when you have more customers at end of turn, the attrition usually of those cohorts at that point in time or higher, then we expect 12% or somewhere in that range for full year guidance. The one thing I would point out and then, David, you can jump in if there's anything else, is the last time we were at this type -- this low was in, I think, the second quarter of 2018, and we had a -- we have 10.8%, like I said, of customers during the term this period. It was 12.2% or 12.3% at that point. So we've got -- we're performing better across the board. And so we're really excited about where that is and continue to perform better than what we expect. And we continue to think that will happen throughout the year. David, I don't know if you have anything more. Yes. Having COVID behind us is a great thing, but also, we're seeing the sales productivity hasn't really been hurt by kind of the economic chaos going on. So we're still cautious, but so far, so good. So let's see how a few more weeks stack up, and we'll report in August, but feeling good about it. Yes. So with the rising interest rates, we have 2 pieces of kind of debt. I would say we have the term loan that's on our balance sheet. And then the bigger component is really the Citizens financing. As you know, we offer that to consumers for 0% APR. And so our costs associated to do that as the rates rise will increase. And so we're trying to do some forecasting there around what we think will happen around rates in the different swap curves. And so that's why we said, hey, based upon where we see rates today and what we expect, the increases will be at the next 2 or 3 or 4 fed meetings. We factored that into kind of our estimates and said, \"Hey, we think that there will be potentially a greater use of cash than we originally anticipated when we did our models for the beginning of the year.\" The reason why you don't see that into like EBITDA, for example, is when that comes through, it comes through as a reduction to revenue. And so as we put it on -- so if you take the gross amount less the fee, that net amounts what we put into deferred revenue and we recognize over, say, 60 months period of the loan. And so while it will be a lot -- could be $10 million, $20 million in incremental cash, depending on what happens with rates here, it's very small when you look at it on a revenue basis because it gets spread out over, I think, about 5 years. So in any one period of time for revenue, it's not going to be material to change the numbers. But on a cash basis, because it's the cash that we get in this period related to those new sales, it will have some impact there. So that's why we're just -- we're being -- realizing what's really happening in the economy. We're seeing these rates go up, and they're going up a lot faster. I think maybe when you look at the yield curves in the out 2, 3 years -- you've got to remember most of our loans we put on the Citizens are 60-month loans. And so that cost, while the rates have not increased that dramatically when you look at it just quarter-over-quarter, 1 year rates, but the calculation used to figure out what our cost is with them, it uses longer-term periods, and those rates have -- went up higher than what they were the last time when we put out our guidance. Thanks for the question. It's really embedding conservatism. I don't know if it's conservatism or it's being cautious to what we're seeing in the marketplaces, frankly, right? It was a great first quarter. And as David just mentioned, we're bullish on the full year prospect. But we're also -- there's lots of things going on in the economy that we just don't know how consumer behavior, if it will change. We haven't seen it today. And as David -- we're feeling good about the start of the direct-to-home sales season. That's a couple of weeks in. But for where we are today, we're 5 months into the year, I think we feel pretty good saying, \"Hey, that's where we think we'll be.\" And as we get deeper into the year and we get second quarter credit, if there's a need to make any revisions, and I'm sure we will. But it's really just thoughtful about everything that's going on out there. With supply chain, David, you can jump in this, but I think everyone with supply chain in 2022 -- like we went through 2021 and were like, supply chain, you can't get any worse from that or it's going to get better in '22. And we're not. We're still seeing it's -- every day, it's a battle to make sure we got de-commenced from subcomponents and suppliers, and we've got to work then to get those components recommitted or we've got to go out and find other suppliers to bring us those components. You've got -- they've got labor constraints. I think you got China shut down, which is where a lot of subcomponents actually come out of. We don't really manufacture finished goods in China, but a lot of the subcomponents that go into our finished cameras and panels and so forth come out of there. And so after disruption, we don't know what's -- I don't know what's going to -- how long that's going to go on or what that really will look like. And it's not only in just timing, it does, but it's also in cost. There's got to be more cost. They have to use more air freight. It's going to be higher manufacturing costs because they're going to have to use more labor and overtime to catch -- keep the volumes that we need to come into production. So there's just a lot of things out there that we see, but don't have like full visibility to what those could -- how those could impact us. And so that's why we're kind of leaving that full year kind of where it is today from what we know and what we see. David, I don't know if you have to say anything else. The other thing I'd just layer in that, too, is inside sales is really, really strong in the quarter. We did pick up almost 3,000 additional new subscribers from that partnership that we've created. As David said, groundwork was laid 18, 24 months ago, really started coming to fruition in '21, and we're continuing to see that really come full circle, so to speak, in 2022. And so we got almost 3,000 new business from smart homes, from a channel that didn't exist previously. And we think there's lots of -- because solar largely sold year around, right? And the team has helped them understand the value of bundling. And as we train them, and they've seen the benefits, that's true, that engine has also helped us, yes. So inside sales and that new channel coming online. Yes, good point. Yes. So I'll start with Smart Insurance and work our way back. Paul, this is Dale. We're not really giving out -- we haven't given out. I think we're still very early into the life cycle of the insurance business and building out. I mean we got 7,000 or so sold policies last year. So that's very early, continue to build out. We're spending and investing there. That's one of the investments that we're making in 2022 to build out the MGA that we're working on. Ron has been in place -- Ron Davies, who we brought in to lead, has been in place for 60 days, I think, at this point. So very early there. We think -- we definitely believe it's accretive to our EBITDA margin and definitely drives extended and increased lifetime value of the customer. But we'll give those down when I think it's appropriate, when we have a better feel for what those really look like because there's a lot of movement there still today. I think on the Smart Energy side, I think that 45 megawatts that we did last year would be -- that's probably 5,000 homes or so. So if you double that this year, you get to 90, you're probably in the 9,500 to 10,000 homes. And we believe that we'll be able to drive incremental value and margin out of that business. And then what I think comes -- there's 2 pieces of that, right? There's the revenue that's generated from the selling of that solar to that customer and we get the margin from that. And then there's also, from this partnership, the development and increased Vivint Smart Home customers that have very strong margins in terms of lifetime value. So there's kind of 2 pieces to that. I think we want to make sure we think of it that way. I think we can drive 10,000-ish or more new subs from that, smart home subs. And then you'll have -- last year, I think we said that 45 megawatts was, call it, $45 million to $50 million of revenue. And so you can kind of back in, if we're doubling where we are this year, then we're probably looking at somewhere between, call it, $85 million and $95 million of revenue from that. And then we're still working. It's early. I think we feel good about where our cost structure will come out there. But it's probably a little still early, but I think it will be somewhere north of 10%, what we'd say, as the margin on that. And I think our goal is to get into the mid- to high teens, but there's -- we're still working on that. Again, I think, Paul, to make sure it's incremental to what we've done today, so it's positive to whatever we've done today in terms of EBITDA we're getting from that. And I think it's really about, as David said previously, it's about the lifetime value of the customer. And if you can take that customer that has a 75% to 80% service margin from the smart home side, you can add incremental revenue that you're getting to net customer related to a solar sale or the annual insurance premiums coming in from that customer, it really expands out, we believe, the lifetime value of that customer. That right. It's really quite powerful. We saw some people were saying, hey, the margin is dilutive. And I'm like, you've got to open your aperture. If you're one of this business on your own, you make your investment because you're protecting and elongating and adding and, most importantly, you're adding value to the customer, which makes you a must-own asset. So as you open your aperture and think about value of the customer, defending your base and incrementally adding margin on a very risk-adjusted basis, it is a no-brainer to do. And the way we're doing it in an asset-light friendly way, it's very, very... Yes. So sequentially, it will go up from Q1 to Q2, it will go up. I think when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, it's going to be, call it, 5%, 6% growth. So again, one of the things we've really focused on is really trying to drive efficiencies out of the dollars that we're investing. And G&A is an investment. I mean it's like -- it's a capital allocation, like anything else, whether it's new subscribers or technology or products. And so we're really focused on that, Brian, making sure that where we're spending our dollars in G&A, whether that's in finance, legal, marketing, exactly where is it that we're actually getting a return on those dollars. So there will be some year-over-year. I mean there's going to be some -- as you know, Brian, there's going to be some inflationary pressure just on some of the core things that we have in that, whether it's travel. We're starting to see a little bit more travel, David and I have been to conferences and so forth. So there are certain things like that, that we're starting to see. But we're going to try our best to maintain and really drive scale across the G&A."

And with that, I will now turn the call over to Larry Coben, NRG\u2019s Chair and Interim President and CEO.\nLarry Coben: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm Larry Coben, and I am the Chairman, Interim President and CEO. I'm joined this morning by Bruce Chung, our Chief Financial Officer and we also have members of the management team on the call and available for question. While I have been CEO for three months, I have been Chairman for seven and on the Board for 20 years. I have never been more excited about NRG as a company than I am today.  Let's begin with the NRG value proposition on Slide four. We are the trusted partner to almost eight million residential customers earned every day through unique and differentiated offerings that simplify and improve our customers lives. We have 5.9 million energy and 2 million smart home customers and manage the second largest C&I Energy and Natural Gas retail portfolio in the country. We have taken the necessary steps to position NRG to win the energy transition. At the convergence of energy and technology in the home and grid, with the evolution of smart devices and generative AI data centers.  We generate significant excess cash well beyond our current business needs, resulting in financial flexibility to return significant capital to our shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our business and financial outlook has never been stronger. And I've never been more excited about the future of the company than I am today.  Turning to Slide five. First, in 2023 we delivered record free cash flow before growth and near record adjusted EBITDA. We exceeded our Investor Day outlook and our previously increased 2023 guidance ranges. This is the direct result of the strategic initiatives and actions we've taken in recent years to strengthen and stabilize our business. Our outlook continues to get better and better, and today we are reaffirming our 2024 financial guidance ranges.  Next, we made significant progress advancing our long term energy transition and electrification strategy. We have line of sight to achieving our current $550 million by 2025. And we are now turning our attention to the next phase of our growth. Lastly, we continue to execute our disciplined capital allocation strategy, which involves both a strong balance sheet and returning significant capital to you, our shareholders.  Turning to Slide six. We delivered $844 million of adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter, 82% higher than the prior year. This brings our full year results to $3.282 billion of adjusted EBITDA, 76% higher than last year, primarily driven by improved operational performance of our Integrated Energy platform and the addition of our Smart Home Business.  Our 2023 adjusted EBITDA was $152 million above our original guidance midpoint, and at the high end of our adjusted guidance, while free cash flow before growth came in above the high end of our increased guidance range at $1.92 billion, or $185 million above our original guidance midpoint. This resulted in $9.25 of free cash flow before growth per share in 2023, well ahead of the $8.50 per target provided at our June Investor Day.  Bruce will provide more details certainly, but again, this performance is the direct result of our strategic initiatives and actions taken to strengthen and grow our business. And I know that these took place even with share purchases occurring at higher levels than projected about Investor Day.  Turning to our 2023 scorecard, we delivered across our strategic priorities. As you know, safety is our top priority, and I'm pleased to share that we achieve top decile safety performance through a year with many distractions. I'd like to thank all of our employees for their focus, and dedication and hard work to making this happen, as well as the making our financial results happen.  Next, we made progress in our continuous improvement goals for cost excellence. We completed the $300 million Direct Energy Synergy program announced earlier in the year, and we quickly turned our attention to identify and execute our previously announced next phase of cost initiatives $250 million by the end of 2025.  Turning to growth, our success in achieving the $9.25 of free cash flow before growth per share versus our $8.50 target was primarily driven by faster execution of our growth plan. We are incredibly pleased with the results of our Smart Home acquisition and believe our current growth plan is just the beginning. We are only starting to scratch the surface. Lastly, on capital allocation, we executed over $1.5 billion in debt paid down and returned another $1.5 billion to shareholders.  Turning to Slide seven, let's take a look at our 2024, outlook. Today, we are reaffirming our 2024 financial guidance ranges, and our Investor Day 15% to 20% growth strategic roadmap. We are well positioned across each of our businesses to deliver on our commitments. In consumer energy we expect the momentum gained in 2023, to continue into 2024, with volume margins and earnings growing across residential and small commercial as well as commercial and industrial customer segments.  They success will be driven by our diverse and efficient marketing and sales engines, our leading care and retention capabilities, and our best-in-class innovative digital experience. We are also seizing numerous opportunities as they arise or as we create them. An exciting example is Lubbock, Texas, a market of just over 100,000 customers that opened in early January, with 65% of customers having already made their electricity provider choice. So far we are exceeding expectations for our success and winning customers and look forward to bring our innovative offerings and experiences to that market. We also continue to see momentum with Community Choice programs, as a way for customers to experience the benefits of electricity competition in markets that don't have favorable political and regulatory sentiment that would allow customers to have the ability to freely choose their electricity providers.  Next, our diversified supply strategy manages our retail exposure in multiple scenarios to include events, like the extreme summer of 2023 and Winter Storm Heather this past January, well, at the same time handling the mild weather that we have seen most of this winter. Our targeted investments for reliability and flexibility across our fleet led to material improvements in the performance of our generation when we needed it, and we expect to realize continued improvements. We continue to evaluate various ways to enhance our supply strategy.  We have three brownfield sites ready to go in Texas with dispatch flexibility, and we are considering additional storage options for the portfolio, primarily through longer term structured transactions, rather than outright ownership. And finally, the smart home business delivered a strong year driving impressive top and bottom line growth, recurring revenue and margin per customer increased through selling more products and services while simultaneously reducing net service costs per customer, we will continue to drive toward the horizontal expansion of our eight million customers wallet.  Our customer retention is the best in the industry with an average customer life in the Smart Home Business of nine years, driven by unmatched customer engagement and world class, product performance and reliability. We continue to focus on integrating Smart Home and Energy in achieving the initiatives we have previously communicated to you.  Turning to Slide 8, for a closer look at growth and cost initiatives. In 2023, we advanced our energy transition electrification, and continuous improvement strategy and delivered $138 million of incremental earnings, which was more times than twice our original $65 million target. We exceeded our goals for both growth and cost savings resulting in more than $100 million of growth in our core businesses and sales channel optimization and more than $35 million in cost savings. This outperformance was primarily the result of realizing synergies faster than originally anticipated. And today, we are reaffirming the full plan target of $550 million of growth and cost initiatives by the end of 2025.  Outside of this $550 million program, we have also identified additional attractive initiatives that are in early development, leveraging the significant value creation opportunity from the convergence of energy and technology in the home in the grid. First, is for example, Virtual Power Plants are VPP, where we are uniquely positioned given our customers scale and reach, our data science, proficiency and decades of commercial market -- commercial and market experience. Importantly, VPP will increase in value as the grid tightens, and our Integrated Energy Business will allow us to monetize this value without requiring regulatory change.  Second on data centers and AI. Today, we are one of the largest competitive providers of power to the hyperscalers and other data center managers. And we have been in direct conversations with several of these customers about using more load. We see this as a significant opportunity for NRG and for competitive markets more broadly.  Finally, we continue to evaluate strategic dispatchable new build, with 1.5 gigawatts of brownfield projects in Texas ready to go. As you may know in November, Texas voters approved the Texas Energy Fund, which provides support for new dispatchable generation. We expect the rules for that to be adopted earlier this year with applications beginning mid-year. We anticipate providing an update on these projects over the coming months.  With that I'd like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bruce Chung, for a financial review. \nBruce Chung: Thank you, Larry. Moving to Slide 10. For 2023, NRG produced adjusted EBITDA of $3.282 billion, exceeding our original guidance and at the high end of our upward revised guidance range. And free cash flow before growth of $1.925 billion, exceeding the high end of our upward revised guidance range. Our 2023 free cash flow before growth and adjusted EBITDA represent the highest and second highest respectively in NRG\u2019s history. This strong financial performance is a direct result of excellent execution across our businesses, and made possible by the continued focus and effort from each of our employees in a year full of potential distractions.  Our 2023 adjusted EBITDA improved by $1.4 billion as compared to 2022, driven by strong performance in our Texas region, the addition of the Vivint Smart Home Business and execution of our growth and cost efficiency plans. Taking a closer look at the drivers within our segments, and beginning with Texas. Our full year adjusted EBITDA increased by $806 million over 2022. This was driven by higher revenue rates coupled with lower supply costs. Our diversified supply strategy worked as designed throughout a volatile year, lowering our supply costs during the mild start to the year and providing stable pricing through the summer's extreme heat.  As we discussed throughout 2023, the margin expansion we saw across both our residential and C&I energy businesses, was produced through a combination of careful revenue rate management, and providing our customers with differentiated products that address their needs for affordability, comfort and peace of mind. We believe this margin expansion will be durable over the foreseeable future, and this view is reflected in our 2024 guidance.  In addition to improved margins, our Residential Energy business delivered strong customer retention of nearly 80%, while maintaining average customer tenure of six years. This is a testament to the strength of our brands, and customer experience. Our East/West services segments were lower by $142 million versus the prior year. This was due to $60 million from asset retirements in sales, with the remainder of the variance from the combination of lower average realized pricing at the Cottonwood facility, as well as a challenging housing market and more conservative consumer discretionary spending impacting our HVAC and Goal Zero services businesses.  Finally, the addition of Smart Home contributed $753 million in adjusted EBITDA, finishing above the high end of our upward revised guidance for this segment. Throughout 2023, Smart Home delivered across all of its key metrics. Most notably, Smart Home achieved 6%, ending subscriber growth in an otherwise challenging macro environment. In addition to improving monthly recurring service margins at 9%, through increasing average monthly revenue per subscriber coupled with a continued focus on cost efficiency.  Turning to free cash flow before growth. NRG achieved $1.925 billion in 2023, setting a new record for the company. This represents an improvement of $1.4 billion over the prior year, primarily driven by our stronger EBITDA performance, along with improved working capital initiatives across our businesses.  At our Investor Day in June, we communicated the 2023 target of $8.50 of free cash flow before growth per share. Our strong performance in 2023 resulted in $9.25 of free cash flow before growth per share, even after repurchasing shares, at a 25% premium to what we had originally assumed in our Investor Day plan. Our platform is designed to generate significant cash flow, and based on that $9.25 per share, and our current share price that represents an implied free cash flow yield of 18%. Given this dislocation repurchasing our shares remains one of the best investments we can make. And as such, we remain firmly committed to staying the course with our capital allocation framework.  Throughout 2023, we have demonstrated the strength and resiliency of our strategy, and coupled with the compelling long term macro tailwinds for the increasing electrification of the economy, and convergence of energy with smart technologies, we are confident in the outlook for our share price.  Turning to the next slide, I'd like to provide some additional context for 2023 financial results. On the left side of the page, we highlight the resiliency of our core energy business. Our Texas fleet performed well through the second hottest summer in Texas history, and most recently continued to perform through the volatility experienced during January's Winter Storm Heather.  Over the last few years, we have strategically invested capital in improving the reliability of our facilities and anticipation of volatility across both summer and winter conditions. And we are seeing the impact of those investments through material improvement in our -- in the money availability factor. This is a performance measure illustrating the availability of our generation assets during periods when we need them the most.  As you can see in the bar chart, we realized a 14% and 13% improvement in summer and winter respectively in this metric. Furthermore, we saw a nearly 20% improvement in this metric on comparing the fleet performance during a Winter Storm Heather versus Winter Storm Elliott. This level of improvement was and will be critical to ensuring we're able to serve our retail load cost effectively.  Moving to the right side of the page, our Smart Home Business surpassing original expectations, primarily driven by expanded monthly recurring service margins. Notably, the margin expansion was a function of both higher average revenues per subscriber coupled with lower cost to serve. We're also seeing higher take rates on Smart Home products and services at the point of sale, which is a testament to the effectiveness of our Smart Home sales channels, and Smart Home customers recognizing the benefit of increasing the intelligence of their homes through additional seamlessly integrated devices.  Turning to Slide 12, for an updated view of our 2024 capital allocation. As you can see from the slide, not much has changed since our third quarter earnings call, where we provided our initial view on 2024 capital allocation. We are still planning on $500 million of debt paid down in 2024, and expect to return nearly $1.2 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and common dividends. Coupled with the 2023 share repurchase program, we will have executed nearly 75% of the current $2.7 billion authorization by the end of 2024. We expect the 2023 accelerated share repurchase program to conclude by the end of Q1 this year, at which point we will begin executing our 2024 repurchase plan on a more regular and programmatic basis throughout the year.  As I mentioned earlier, at an implied yield of 18%, we see our shares as an excellent investment for shareholder capital. And as such, remain committed to the 80-20 principle we rolled out during an Investor Day. In terms of incremental changes since our last earnings call and moving from left to right, 2024 excess cash increased $74 million because of the over performance in 2023. Other investments increased $33 million, primarily from a calendar year shift in integration costs and capital deployed to small book acquisitions in our Residential Retail business.  Finally, we have $41 million of unallocated capital available for allocation in 2024, which we will evaluate the use of as we move along the year. Before I hand it back to Larry, I'd like to point out that we included some new slides in the appendix of today's presentation, which provide more disclosure around our energy business.  We believe this disclosure will enable investors to model our energy business with a level of granularity they did not have before. These slides will be updated with each earnings call we have going forward. We hope you find them helpful, and our Investor Relations team is more than happy to answer any questions you may have regarding the new disclosures.  With that, I will turn it back to you, Larry. \nLarry Coben: Thank you, Bruce. On Slide 14, I want to provide a few closing thoughts about 2024, our priorities and our expectations. We are laser focused on delivering on our financial and operational commitments and adhering to our capital allocation principles. We will continue to integrate Smart Home with our energy businesses and deliver on our growth and cost initiatives. All while advancing our energy transition and electrification strategy. I have never been more excited about the future of energy. We are seeing signs of step change improvement in fundamentals across our platform, including the convergence of energy and technology in the home and grid through smart devices and generative AI. We believe this will put a spotlight on the scarcity of the critical products and services we sell and the durability of our platform.  Said bluntly, I believe this step change will signify a change in the depressed valuations for NRG in our sector that have resulted in 20% plus cash flow yields. This will be good for NRG and the sector and its very exciting times. I look forward to updating you on our progress along the way.  With that thank you for your time and your interest in NRG. We're now ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is now open. \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Excellent. Good morning, guys. Thank you very much for the time. I appreciate it. Look, I know you said it somewhat explicitly in the comments. But I wanted to come back to this. Obviously, with the shares materially higher here, how are you think about where you're positioned relative to the 15% to 20% FCF per share target through the forecast period? I just wanted to kind of tackle that, obviously doing very well against those targets here out of the gate year 1. I just wanted to elaborate on that.  And then secondly, just wanted to come back to '24, here. Start of the year, looks like probably robust load. How do you think about that positioning you and as you think about reflecting that within what you've provided -- what would you have out there on targets, just in terms of the colder weather in Texas, specifically? \nBruce Chung: Sure, hey, Julian, it's Bruce here. So with respect to the 15% to 20%, we still are committed to achieving that 15% to 20% growth in free cash flow before growth per share. We believe that we're increasing both the free cash flow and the EBITDA, as you know. If you look at the '24 number, that's about $150 million above what we had already kind of indicated, as part of the Investor Day plan. So we are seeing drivers, both in the numerator, and then obviously, we remain committed to the capital allocation plan. And so, we're going to also be driving that denominator. So we still remain committed to that 15% to 20%.  With respect to the other question, as we think about 2024, we are basically positioned in the same way as we were in 2023. And so that gives us a lot of comfort, in terms of being able to handle what may be on the -- what may be coming for us from a load perspective. Winter Storm Heather, we performed very well, the fleet performed very well. And so we're pretty confident about where we stand at this stage.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Wonderful, excellent. If I could just nitpick a little bit on the comments from the -- you provided a second ago. You talked about longer term storage contract opportunities, this would presumably be an offtake arrangement, which you're an offtaker to some sort of battery investment that someone else makes. If I'm hearing you right, I just want to make sure I understood how you are thinking about batteries, and presumably are ERCOT here?\nLarry Coben: Look, I think that, yes that is the answer. But we'll always come back and take a look at the capital that we do have to allocate. But there's an awful lot of people here in Texas who are willing to spend their money on putting -- on providing storage for us. And that will probably be the optimal use of capital. But as you know, Julien, we always evaluate and reevaluated as we put our supply strategy together to optimize our capital structure.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Excellent. All right, guys. We'll leave it there. Thank you guys very much. Congrats again. Nicely done.\nBruce Chung : Thank you, Julien. \nOperator: Thank you, one moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open. \nShar Pourreza : Hey, Larry. Good morning. \nLarry Coben: Good morning, Shar. How are you? \nShar Pourreza: Not too bad. Good morning. I wanted to ask a bit of a higher level question and it's obviously building off of Bruce's due disclose your comments and in light of the sort of maybe that step function change in valuation we saw with one of your peers yesterday. Have you given any consideration to maybe transitioning to EPS at some point in the future and providing maybe a bit of a longer range look? \nLarry Coben: Yes. \nShar Pourreza: All right. I'll leave it at that one.\nLarry Coben: The answer, sorry, is yes. Yes. Stay tuned.\nShar Pourreza: Right. I love it. And then, perhaps maybe just going back to the CEO search process. I mean, obviously, it's gotten a little bit more competitive recently with sort of on the power and utility headhunting side. Can you just give us some more color on where things stand today in terms of down selecting and curious if you're now a bit more focused on a power person, or retail consumer person? Thanks.\nLarry Coben: Sure, Shar. I won't take it personally that you seem to be anxious to get rid of me. \nShar Pourreza: I want you to stay. But there\u2019s no reality.\nLarry Coben: No, look Shar, I don't think -- I think we're still looking for a bit person who spans the two types of things that we're doing, consumer and energy, as we said before. We have a terrific committee that's working exceptionally hard. And as I said to you, we had a huge list of candidates when we started, and they are whittling away at that. I think when we talked three months ago, I said three to nine months, and I still would stand by that time frame.  So I guess that would be 0 to 6 months from now, if I do the math correctly. And there's a tremendous number of people who are looking at NRG, are excited by the prospects, are excited by the ability to drive valuation given the incredible cash flow yield given the incredible prospects that we have at the confluence of NRG and Smart Home. And so I'm excited by the people that we're seeing, and I think you will be, too.\nShar Pourreza: Perfect. And thank you guys and for the record, Larry, I personally would like you to just stay, but that's not reality to be sure.\nLarry Coben: Thank you, Shar.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Your line is now open.\nAngie Storozynski : Good morning. So just also a big picture question. So -- I mean if there's one thing that we've learned over the last couple of weeks is that investors increasingly value physical power plants, especially those that don't get a participation medal for just showing up. So I'm just wondering how does that fit in your strategy of being asset-light on the generation side in light of the tightening supply demand fundamentals and power. Again, I understand that there is the demand response and other ways to probably fit in, in this new picture. But I'm just wondering, just simplistically speaking, how do you deal with that?\nLarry Coben: Sure. Angie, I'm going to let Rob expand on that, but I've never -- I don't think we're asset-light, we're asset optimal and will always be asset optimal and that maybe semantics, but I think they're important semantics. We have three brownfield projects that are ready to go, and you'll get some updates on those pretty soon, but that's 1.5 gigawatts of dispatchable capacity, and we have some more potential in the pipeline. Maybe, Rob, you want to expand on that, please?\nRobert Gaudette: Sure. So Angie, look, we're excited by the growing demand for power. Like I think that it's real. We know it's real because we talk to a lot of the growth guys, so it's the hyperscalers and others that you've all heard about. We talk to them a lot. And it's exciting for NRG for a couple of reasons. One, we sit in competitive markets, which is where I believe most of this demand growth is going to be. We're going to see expanded margins on our existing fleet, right? So as the product goes up, we're going to see more earnings off of our generation, and we've spent and invested inside of those plants so that we can capture that.  Like Larry said, we've got the three projects that are ready to go. And the other thing to think about, Angie is we've got 21 plant sites across the country. So if this growth continues and we see it mix economic sense, then there's an opportunity there. But ultimately, these guys are going to turn to partners like NRG. As the market tightens, they're going to look for people who've got the expertise that we have. So it's going to be good for the industry, but it's definitely going to be good for us.\nAngie Storozynski : But does that mean that in a sense you're shifting a bit of the growth on the energy side towards C&I customers? Because I remember that historically, that was a very small portion of the business and not -- well, meaningfully lower margins than the rest of the business. So anyway, is there like a different earnings or margin profile for those tech companies versus the traditional C&I load that you used to serve?\nRobert Gaudette: So generally, C&I margins themselves over the last few years have gone up. The difference in the margin from a hyperscaler versus a traditional C&I customer, there isn't -- we haven't seen a growth in margin on the hyperscalers. The way you should probably think about it is if you're going to get a bunch of demand into the system, which we believe is real. That's going to create tightness for all customers. And so C&I customers across the board not just data center customers are going to be looking for expertise, which means they're going to turn to the bigger players who can help them manage the risk in a higher price, tighter commodity environment. Does that help?\nAngie Storozynski : Okay. Yes. Thanks. And then changing topics and your IG aspiration. So I obviously see the metrics or the targeted metrics at the end of '24. Can you tell us if you've had any discussions with credit agencies how they see the business risks besides just hitting the numerical thresholds vis-a-vis the investment-grade ratings?\nLarry Coben: Larry, Angie. So just to clarify, we are not chasing an investment-grade rating. As we've always said, we are making sure that we want to hit the metrics that we believe correspond with an investment-grade rating, but that's not to say that we're necessarily going to be chasing it because ultimately, that is up to the agencies. We talk to the agencies very regularly and they like the path on which we are heading from a credit perspective. It's important to note that when you think about our credit metrics, it's not just debt to EBITDA that the agency is focused on.  They obviously also look at cash flow driven metrics. And so we're kind of triangulating around all of that. Ultimately, whether we get the rating or not, like I said, is not necessarily within our control. But what is within our control is being able to hit those metrics. I'd say, as we sit here today, given as you note where we're going to end up at the end of 2024, we think there's probably some flexibility in 2025 with respect to what our original deleveraging plans were as part of the Investor Day plan, but more to come on that as we move along in the year.\nAngie Storozynski: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for giving me time. I just wanted to kind of go over the cost improvements and the growth opportunity, the $550 million target that you have by 2025. So obviously, this year, you've kind of hit the ground running, exceeded expectations. Maybe can you sort of help us break that apart, the $100 million in growth opportunities? How much of that is cross-selling versus how much of that is actual margin expansion within your existing services? And then as you think about cost improvements, there's a big step change from $37 million this year to about $100 million. Maybe just walk through the drivers of that?\nBruce Chung: Yes, you bet. So in terms of the growth synergies, we feel obviously very good about where we set one year into the plan through 2025. You can think about the mix as roughly 50% is actually driven by organic growth in the business units. We had obviously a strong year in the base business. And the other 50%, driven by a combination of cross-sell and think of it as a share of wallet type initiatives that improved the revenue and margin profile per customer. And so we've had a strong start.  We have a very high degree of confidence for the $300 million given we exceeded our initial guidance in year 1. And then as it relates to the cost side of things. The $100 million in cost synergies are really a function of elimination of two publicly traded companies, and we also exceeded our year 1 target for the cost side. And we have full line of sight to the $100 million by 2025. In fact, we will probably exceed our 2024 target towards that $100 million. And so as we sit here, we feel good on both ends, Durgesh.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Thank you. And then maybe just a 1.5 gigawatt dispatchable generation opportunity. Can you maybe walk us through your thought process here? It sounds like you'll be making decisions in the second half of this year? How do you kind of gauge that versus buying back shares as I'm thinking about the long-term outlook, 2025 and beyond?\nLarry Coben: Look, let me just say, it will not impact one iota our capital allocation strategy or the buyback of shares. I want to make that clear again and again and again, and you can put that down as a headline. So very, very clear on that. Strategically, it's really -- we have a supply strategy that Rob has laid out on several occasions and looking at how these plants fit into that supply strategy, both for our existing customers, but also for the customers who are coming online with things like data centers like generative AI and some of the other things we've been talking about that are growth and tightening opportunities. Rob, do you want to add anything?\nRobert Gaudette: So the only thing I would tell you is, recall, we've been working on these for a while. We continue to work today. So we continue to get closer to being able to make final commitments in March, the rules for Texas come out. And then you can expect people to put their names in for the Texas Energy Fund probably June. I would expect that you guys will hear from us as to what we decide. But like Larry said, we're going to -- our capital allocation plan sticks and it all comes down to the financial opportunities that we see in either building the plants or doing something different. And right now, and as you guys have all seen, those plants have flexibility, which is good for how we manage our portfolio and ultimately good for what the grid needs in Texas.\nDurgesh Chopra: Very clear. Thank you again. \nOperator: Our next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nDavid Arcaro: Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Maybe on the Smart Home side of things, again, strong KPIs in 2023. I was wondering if you could comment on how you're expecting a couple of those like subscriber growth and recurring revenue. How do you see those trending now heading into 2024?\nRobert Gaudette: Yes. Thank you. We feel really good about how we exited the year end '23. As you mentioned, with 6% subscriber growth, 11% revenue growth, 17% adjusted EBITDA growth. And really, that's a function of a few things. First is the unit economics of the business are in great shape. If you look at the revenue per customer, the service cost reduction per customer up 21% that really drives an expansion of our service margin. And we expect that increased elevated margin to continue into 2024. As it relates to retention and brand loyalty, we are -- we had amongst our best years ever in terms of retaining our customers with a strong and durable customer relationships. We expect that to continue as well.  And then in terms of the subscriber growth, we expect to be in the mid-single digits from a subscriber growth perspective as well. So we feel good about how the business is set up in '24. If you zoom out, we operate in a large, growing and fragmented market. And our products and services have a very high degree of engagement and loyalty relative to peers. And so we think there is a lot of room ahead for us to continue to grow the business.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay. Got it. Thanks for that color. That's helpful. Then I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate a bit more on the data center impact to the business. Am I understanding you correctly that as you see load growth from these data centers happen in ERCOT, for example, you could see, I guess, potentially higher pricing, more volatile pricing. And over time, that could lead to higher margins across the board, higher retail margins across customer classes for your business. Is that the right way to think about it?\nRobert Gaudette : It's Rob. Yes. So generative AI is going to load or created additional demand across the markets. The way to think about how that affects the businesses generally is let's start with that expands the margins on our existing generation portfolio and also makes that 1.5 gigawatts more interesting. And then when you think across the other parts of the business, C&I, you're going to see people turning towards bigger players like us, where we've seen it historically, when things get tighter, they run to quality providers.  We're there. And then from a home perspective, a consumer perspective, we've had a retail platform that has historically and will in the future, manage through different commodity cycles. And as prices move, our retail platform, because of the experience we have beyond just being a commodity provider, we do well in those markets, too.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay, great. Thanks for that. Much appreciated. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe. Your line is now open.\nMichael Sullivan : Hey, everyone. Good morning. Appreciate the new disclosures on the Energy business, by the way. But I wanted to just go back to Texas and new build there. And just maybe if you could just frame the broader political dynamic there, where things stand just in light of the Lieutenant Governor making some comments, I think, asking for new bill, do you kind of continue to see these headlines noise around the ECRS. I know we're not in a legislative session this year, but just kind of where the politics stand on market structure and the like?\nLarry Coben : If I could understand Texas politics, I'd be in a different business probably, Michael, but there's not a legislative session. I think it's fair to say that people are now looking to see whether everything that was passed in the last session is actually going to generate capacity in the state before people start breaking it up again and starting over. The PUC has a lot -- awful lot of work to do just to implement the many things that were passed in the legislature. And I think a combination of those measures plus the tightening market and the improving economics in the market and the expanding margins will probably generate the capacity that Texas will need to meet growth in the foreseeable future. At least that's our view of what's happening in politics. That doesn't mean that people from time to time won't try to use the energy business as a political football. But on balance, we actually see a fair amount of stability on the legislative front.\nMichael Sullivan : Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate that's a tough one. And just if you do move forward with these brownfield plants, how long would it take to complete?\nRobert Gaudette : So the -- if you recall, the portfolio is 3 different projects, the speakers, we could get in, in 2 years and starting from whenever we broke ground and then a CCGT takes about 4. So you could expect if we were to go soon 2026 and 2028 would kind of be good years to think about from an additional capacity perspective.\nMichael Sullivan : Okay. Great. And then just last 1 quick. You mentioned the new Lubbock market, any like rough sense of size of the opportunity set there? And is any of that baked into your plan? Or is that all upside?\nElizabeth Killinger : Yes. So this is Elizabeth. Thanks for the question. So we are really excited about the Lubbock opening. Two things about it. One, 65% of consumers made a choice. And if you have a reference point like when the Texas market opened, 5% made a choice. So demonstrating that consumers actually care who they do business with in Energy. NRG participated in the presale process.  That's where the 65% made the choice and those customers will come on flow in March, and that is baked into our 2024 and beyond growth plan. The only other thing I would say is so far, NRG is over performed, we have about 39% share of customers in Texas on the home front, and we are over performing relative to that. So again -- and Larry mentioned it, but about 100,000 customers in the marketplace that are making a choice. And so they'll start and be our and other retailer customers in March.\nMichael Sullivan: Great. Thanks for all the color. Appreciated. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Levine with Citi. Your line is now open. \nRyan Levine: Good morning. I am hoping to touch on retail energy gross margin outlook. It looks like your guidance is assuming about 100 basis points degradation there. How much is that weather normalized for '24? And is there any conservatism embedded in that forecast in light of your comments? Any color you could share around potential upside there, in particular, in Texas?\nBruce Chung: So Ryan, it's Bruce. The 2024 number is certainly on a weather-normalized basis. But the '24 number does reflect a higher assumption on COGS for the retail business. And so there's just a bit of a timing lag between the realization of that COGS relative to when that gets pushed through in revenue rate.  But Elizabeth, if you want to provide a little bit more color to that?\nElizabeth Killinger: Yes. So we've demonstrated margin stability over the years in the home space. And that comes from -- and most of you were there, from some of the AI machine learning revenue management tools and models we created back in the transformation program and since have continuously improved them. The other thing I would highlight is that over this, call it, the last decade, we've been able to deliver stable and growing margins in a variety of supply cost environment. So this one, Bruce mentioned, where costs have significantly increased over the last few years, and we've either grown or held margins through that time frame, aside from the weather normalization that you mentioned.\nRyan Levine: How much cost escalation are you assuming for 2024 that's being offset by these other measures?\nBruce Chung: Ryan, that's probably one that we'll have to just get back to you on to make sure that we get you the right numbers on that.\nRyan Levine: Okay. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I will now pass it back to Larry Coben for closing remarks.\nLarry Coben: I want to thank all of you for joining us on the call today and for your interest in NRG. And I think you can see we are at the most exciting point probably in NRG's history. I think you can hear in the voices of the management and in our actual results, what we have and are planning to achieve going forward. We look forward to speaking with you more in the days ahead. We'll be at the conferences in New York next week. In the meantime, please feel free to reach out to Kevin and Brendan with any further questions that you might have. Thank you all.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program.",

            "name": "Larry Coben",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm Larry Coben, and I am the Chairman, Interim President and CEO. I'm joined this morning by Bruce Chung, our Chief Financial Officer and we also have members of the management team on the call and available for question. While I have been CEO for three months, I have been Chairman for seven and on the Board for 20 years. I have never been more excited about NRG as a company than I am today.  Let's begin with the NRG value proposition on Slide four. We are the trusted partner to almost eight million residential customers earned every day through unique and differentiated offerings that simplify and improve our customers lives. We have 5.9 million energy and 2 million smart home customers and manage the second largest C&I Energy and Natural Gas retail portfolio in the country. We have taken the necessary steps to position NRG to win the energy transition. At the convergence of energy and technology in the home and grid, with the evolution of smart devices and generative AI data centers.  We generate significant excess cash well beyond our current business needs, resulting in financial flexibility to return significant capital to our shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our business and financial outlook has never been stronger. And I've never been more excited about the future of the company than I am today.  Turning to Slide five. First, in 2023 we delivered record free cash flow before growth and near record adjusted EBITDA. We exceeded our Investor Day outlook and our previously increased 2023 guidance ranges. This is the direct result of the strategic initiatives and actions we've taken in recent years to strengthen and stabilize our business. Our outlook continues to get better and better, and today we are reaffirming our 2024 financial guidance ranges.  Next, we made significant progress advancing our long term energy transition and electrification strategy. We have line of sight to achieving our current $550 million by 2025. And we are now turning our attention to the next phase of our growth. Lastly, we continue to execute our disciplined capital allocation strategy, which involves both a strong balance sheet and returning significant capital to you, our shareholders.  Turning to Slide six. We delivered $844 million of adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter, 82% higher than the prior year. This brings our full year results to $3.282 billion of adjusted EBITDA, 76% higher than last year, primarily driven by improved operational performance of our Integrated Energy platform and the addition of our Smart Home Business.  Our 2023 adjusted EBITDA was $152 million above our original guidance midpoint, and at the high end of our adjusted guidance, while free cash flow before growth came in above the high end of our increased guidance range at $1.92 billion, or $185 million above our original guidance midpoint. This resulted in $9.25 of free cash flow before growth per share in 2023, well ahead of the $8.50 per target provided at our June Investor Day.  Bruce will provide more details certainly, but again, this performance is the direct result of our strategic initiatives and actions taken to strengthen and grow our business. And I know that these took place even with share purchases occurring at higher levels than projected about Investor Day.  Turning to our 2023 scorecard, we delivered across our strategic priorities. As you know, safety is our top priority, and I'm pleased to share that we achieve top decile safety performance through a year with many distractions. I'd like to thank all of our employees for their focus, and dedication and hard work to making this happen, as well as the making our financial results happen.  Next, we made progress in our continuous improvement goals for cost excellence. We completed the $300 million Direct Energy Synergy program announced earlier in the year, and we quickly turned our attention to identify and execute our previously announced next phase of cost initiatives $250 million by the end of 2025.  Turning to growth, our success in achieving the $9.25 of free cash flow before growth per share versus our $8.50 target was primarily driven by faster execution of our growth plan. We are incredibly pleased with the results of our Smart Home acquisition and believe our current growth plan is just the beginning. We are only starting to scratch the surface. Lastly, on capital allocation, we executed over $1.5 billion in debt paid down and returned another $1.5 billion to shareholders.  Turning to Slide seven, let's take a look at our 2024, outlook. Today, we are reaffirming our 2024 financial guidance ranges, and our Investor Day 15% to 20% growth strategic roadmap. We are well positioned across each of our businesses to deliver on our commitments. In consumer energy we expect the momentum gained in 2023, to continue into 2024, with volume margins and earnings growing across residential and small commercial as well as commercial and industrial customer segments.  They success will be driven by our diverse and efficient marketing and sales engines, our leading care and retention capabilities, and our best-in-class innovative digital experience. We are also seizing numerous opportunities as they arise or as we create them. An exciting example is Lubbock, Texas, a market of just over 100,000 customers that opened in early January, with 65% of customers having already made their electricity provider choice. So far we are exceeding expectations for our success and winning customers and look forward to bring our innovative offerings and experiences to that market. We also continue to see momentum with Community Choice programs, as a way for customers to experience the benefits of electricity competition in markets that don't have favorable political and regulatory sentiment that would allow customers to have the ability to freely choose their electricity providers.  Next, our diversified supply strategy manages our retail exposure in multiple scenarios to include events, like the extreme summer of 2023 and Winter Storm Heather this past January, well, at the same time handling the mild weather that we have seen most of this winter. Our targeted investments for reliability and flexibility across our fleet led to material improvements in the performance of our generation when we needed it, and we expect to realize continued improvements. We continue to evaluate various ways to enhance our supply strategy.  We have three brownfield sites ready to go in Texas with dispatch flexibility, and we are considering additional storage options for the portfolio, primarily through longer term structured transactions, rather than outright ownership. And finally, the smart home business delivered a strong year driving impressive top and bottom line growth, recurring revenue and margin per customer increased through selling more products and services while simultaneously reducing net service costs per customer, we will continue to drive toward the horizontal expansion of our eight million customers wallet.  Our customer retention is the best in the industry with an average customer life in the Smart Home Business of nine years, driven by unmatched customer engagement and world class, product performance and reliability. We continue to focus on integrating Smart Home and Energy in achieving the initiatives we have previously communicated to you.  Turning to Slide 8, for a closer look at growth and cost initiatives. In 2023, we advanced our energy transition electrification, and continuous improvement strategy and delivered $138 million of incremental earnings, which was more times than twice our original $65 million target. We exceeded our goals for both growth and cost savings resulting in more than $100 million of growth in our core businesses and sales channel optimization and more than $35 million in cost savings. This outperformance was primarily the result of realizing synergies faster than originally anticipated. And today, we are reaffirming the full plan target of $550 million of growth and cost initiatives by the end of 2025.  Outside of this $550 million program, we have also identified additional attractive initiatives that are in early development, leveraging the significant value creation opportunity from the convergence of energy and technology in the home in the grid. First, is for example, Virtual Power Plants are VPP, where we are uniquely positioned given our customers scale and reach, our data science, proficiency and decades of commercial market -- commercial and market experience. Importantly, VPP will increase in value as the grid tightens, and our Integrated Energy Business will allow us to monetize this value without requiring regulatory change.  Second on data centers and AI. Today, we are one of the largest competitive providers of power to the hyperscalers and other data center managers. And we have been in direct conversations with several of these customers about using more load. We see this as a significant opportunity for NRG and for competitive markets more broadly.  Finally, we continue to evaluate strategic dispatchable new build, with 1.5 gigawatts of brownfield projects in Texas ready to go. As you may know in November, Texas voters approved the Texas Energy Fund, which provides support for new dispatchable generation. We expect the rules for that to be adopted earlier this year with applications beginning mid-year. We anticipate providing an update on these projects over the coming months.  With that I'd like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bruce Chung, for a financial review. Thank you, Bruce. On Slide 14, I want to provide a few closing thoughts about 2024, our priorities and our expectations. We are laser focused on delivering on our financial and operational commitments and adhering to our capital allocation principles. We will continue to integrate Smart Home with our energy businesses and deliver on our growth and cost initiatives. All while advancing our energy transition and electrification strategy. I have never been more excited about the future of energy. We are seeing signs of step change improvement in fundamentals across our platform, including the convergence of energy and technology in the home and grid through smart devices and generative AI. We believe this will put a spotlight on the scarcity of the critical products and services we sell and the durability of our platform.  Said bluntly, I believe this step change will signify a change in the depressed valuations for NRG in our sector that have resulted in 20% plus cash flow yields. This will be good for NRG and the sector and its very exciting times. I look forward to updating you on our progress along the way.  With that thank you for your time and your interest in NRG. We're now ready to open the line for questions. Look, I think that, yes that is the answer. But we'll always come back and take a look at the capital that we do have to allocate. But there's an awful lot of people here in Texas who are willing to spend their money on putting -- on providing storage for us. And that will probably be the optimal use of capital. But as you know, Julien, we always evaluate and reevaluated as we put our supply strategy together to optimize our capital structure. Good morning, Shar. How are you? Yes. The answer, sorry, is yes. Yes. Stay tuned. Sure, Shar. I won't take it personally that you seem to be anxious to get rid of me. No, look Shar, I don't think -- I think we're still looking for a bit person who spans the two types of things that we're doing, consumer and energy, as we said before. We have a terrific committee that's working exceptionally hard. And as I said to you, we had a huge list of candidates when we started, and they are whittling away at that. I think when we talked three months ago, I said three to nine months, and I still would stand by that time frame.  So I guess that would be 0 to 6 months from now, if I do the math correctly. And there's a tremendous number of people who are looking at NRG, are excited by the prospects, are excited by the ability to drive valuation given the incredible cash flow yield given the incredible prospects that we have at the confluence of NRG and Smart Home. And so I'm excited by the people that we're seeing, and I think you will be, too. Thank you, Shar. Sure. Angie, I'm going to let Rob expand on that, but I've never -- I don't think we're asset-light, we're asset optimal and will always be asset optimal and that maybe semantics, but I think they're important semantics. We have three brownfield projects that are ready to go, and you'll get some updates on those pretty soon, but that's 1.5 gigawatts of dispatchable capacity, and we have some more potential in the pipeline. Maybe, Rob, you want to expand on that, please? Larry, Angie. So just to clarify, we are not chasing an investment-grade rating. As we've always said, we are making sure that we want to hit the metrics that we believe correspond with an investment-grade rating, but that's not to say that we're necessarily going to be chasing it because ultimately, that is up to the agencies. We talk to the agencies very regularly and they like the path on which we are heading from a credit perspective. It's important to note that when you think about our credit metrics, it's not just debt to EBITDA that the agency is focused on.  They obviously also look at cash flow driven metrics. And so we're kind of triangulating around all of that. Ultimately, whether we get the rating or not, like I said, is not necessarily within our control. But what is within our control is being able to hit those metrics. I'd say, as we sit here today, given as you note where we're going to end up at the end of 2024, we think there's probably some flexibility in 2025 with respect to what our original deleveraging plans were as part of the Investor Day plan, but more to come on that as we move along in the year. Look, let me just say, it will not impact one iota our capital allocation strategy or the buyback of shares. I want to make that clear again and again and again, and you can put that down as a headline. So very, very clear on that. Strategically, it's really -- we have a supply strategy that Rob has laid out on several occasions and looking at how these plants fit into that supply strategy, both for our existing customers, but also for the customers who are coming online with things like data centers like generative AI and some of the other things we've been talking about that are growth and tightening opportunities. Rob, do you want to add anything? If I could understand Texas politics, I'd be in a different business probably, Michael, but there's not a legislative session. I think it's fair to say that people are now looking to see whether everything that was passed in the last session is actually going to generate capacity in the state before people start breaking it up again and starting over. The PUC has a lot -- awful lot of work to do just to implement the many things that were passed in the legislature. And I think a combination of those measures plus the tightening market and the improving economics in the market and the expanding margins will probably generate the capacity that Texas will need to meet growth in the foreseeable future. At least that's our view of what's happening in politics. That doesn't mean that people from time to time won't try to use the energy business as a political football. But on balance, we actually see a fair amount of stability on the legislative front. I want to thank all of you for joining us on the call today and for your interest in NRG. And I think you can see we are at the most exciting point probably in NRG's history. I think you can hear in the voices of the management and in our actual results, what we have and are planning to achieve going forward. We look forward to speaking with you more in the days ahead. We'll be at the conferences in New York next week. In the meantime, please feel free to reach out to Kevin and Brendan with any further questions that you might have. Thank you all."

            "name": "Bruce Chung",
            "content": "Thank you, Larry. Moving to Slide 10. For 2023, NRG produced adjusted EBITDA of $3.282 billion, exceeding our original guidance and at the high end of our upward revised guidance range. And free cash flow before growth of $1.925 billion, exceeding the high end of our upward revised guidance range. Our 2023 free cash flow before growth and adjusted EBITDA represent the highest and second highest respectively in NRG's history. This strong financial performance is a direct result of excellent execution across our businesses, and made possible by the continued focus and effort from each of our employees in a year full of potential distractions.  Our 2023 adjusted EBITDA improved by $1.4 billion as compared to 2022, driven by strong performance in our Texas region, the addition of the Vivint Smart Home Business and execution of our growth and cost efficiency plans. Taking a closer look at the drivers within our segments, and beginning with Texas. Our full year adjusted EBITDA increased by $806 million over 2022. This was driven by higher revenue rates coupled with lower supply costs. Our diversified supply strategy worked as designed throughout a volatile year, lowering our supply costs during the mild start to the year and providing stable pricing through the summer's extreme heat.  As we discussed throughout 2023, the margin expansion we saw across both our residential and C&I energy businesses, was produced through a combination of careful revenue rate management, and providing our customers with differentiated products that address their needs for affordability, comfort and peace of mind. We believe this margin expansion will be durable over the foreseeable future, and this view is reflected in our 2024 guidance.  In addition to improved margins, our Residential Energy business delivered strong customer retention of nearly 80%, while maintaining average customer tenure of six years. This is a testament to the strength of our brands, and customer experience. Our East/West services segments were lower by $142 million versus the prior year. This was due to $60 million from asset retirements in sales, with the remainder of the variance from the combination of lower average realized pricing at the Cottonwood facility, as well as a challenging housing market and more conservative consumer discretionary spending impacting our HVAC and Goal Zero services businesses.  Finally, the addition of Smart Home contributed $753 million in adjusted EBITDA, finishing above the high end of our upward revised guidance for this segment. Throughout 2023, Smart Home delivered across all of its key metrics. Most notably, Smart Home achieved 6%, ending subscriber growth in an otherwise challenging macro environment. In addition to improving monthly recurring service margins at 9%, through increasing average monthly revenue per subscriber coupled with a continued focus on cost efficiency.  Turning to free cash flow before growth. NRG achieved $1.925 billion in 2023, setting a new record for the company. This represents an improvement of $1.4 billion over the prior year, primarily driven by our stronger EBITDA performance, along with improved working capital initiatives across our businesses.  At our Investor Day in June, we communicated the 2023 target of $8.50 of free cash flow before growth per share. Our strong performance in 2023 resulted in $9.25 of free cash flow before growth per share, even after repurchasing shares, at a 25% premium to what we had originally assumed in our Investor Day plan. Our platform is designed to generate significant cash flow, and based on that $9.25 per share, and our current share price that represents an implied free cash flow yield of 18%. Given this dislocation repurchasing our shares remains one of the best investments we can make. And as such, we remain firmly committed to staying the course with our capital allocation framework.  Throughout 2023, we have demonstrated the strength and resiliency of our strategy, and coupled with the compelling long term macro tailwinds for the increasing electrification of the economy, and convergence of energy with smart technologies, we are confident in the outlook for our share price.  Turning to the next slide, I'd like to provide some additional context for 2023 financial results. On the left side of the page, we highlight the resiliency of our core energy business. Our Texas fleet performed well through the second hottest summer in Texas history, and most recently continued to perform through the volatility experienced during January's Winter Storm Heather.  Over the last few years, we have strategically invested capital in improving the reliability of our facilities and anticipation of volatility across both summer and winter conditions. And we are seeing the impact of those investments through material improvement in our -- in the money availability factor. This is a performance measure illustrating the availability of our generation assets during periods when we need them the most.  As you can see in the bar chart, we realized a 14% and 13% improvement in summer and winter respectively in this metric. Furthermore, we saw a nearly 20% improvement in this metric on comparing the fleet performance during a Winter Storm Heather versus Winter Storm Elliott. This level of improvement was and will be critical to ensuring we're able to serve our retail load cost effectively.  Moving to the right side of the page, our Smart Home Business surpassing original expectations, primarily driven by expanded monthly recurring service margins. Notably, the margin expansion was a function of both higher average revenues per subscriber coupled with lower cost to serve. We're also seeing higher take rates on Smart Home products and services at the point of sale, which is a testament to the effectiveness of our Smart Home sales channels, and Smart Home customers recognizing the benefit of increasing the intelligence of their homes through additional seamlessly integrated devices.  Turning to Slide 12, for an updated view of our 2024 capital allocation. As you can see from the slide, not much has changed since our third quarter earnings call, where we provided our initial view on 2024 capital allocation. We are still planning on $500 million of debt paid down in 2024, and expect to return nearly $1.2 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and common dividends. Coupled with the 2023 share repurchase program, we will have executed nearly 75% of the current $2.7 billion authorization by the end of 2024. We expect the 2023 accelerated share repurchase program to conclude by the end of Q1 this year, at which point we will begin executing our 2024 repurchase plan on a more regular and programmatic basis throughout the year.  As I mentioned earlier, at an implied yield of 18%, we see our shares as an excellent investment for shareholder capital. And as such, remain committed to the 80-20 principle we rolled out during an Investor Day. In terms of incremental changes since our last earnings call and moving from left to right, 2024 excess cash increased $74 million because of the over performance in 2023. Other investments increased $33 million, primarily from a calendar year shift in integration costs and capital deployed to small book acquisitions in our Residential Retail business.  Finally, we have $41 million of unallocated capital available for allocation in 2024, which we will evaluate the use of as we move along the year. Before I hand it back to Larry, I'd like to point out that we included some new slides in the appendix of today's presentation, which provide more disclosure around our energy business.  We believe this disclosure will enable investors to model our energy business with a level of granularity they did not have before. These slides will be updated with each earnings call we have going forward. We hope you find them helpful, and our Investor Relations team is more than happy to answer any questions you may have regarding the new disclosures.  With that, I will turn it back to you, Larry. Sure, hey, Julian, it's Bruce here. So with respect to the 15% to 20%, we still are committed to achieving that 15% to 20% growth in free cash flow before growth per share. We believe that we're increasing both the free cash flow and the EBITDA, as you know. If you look at the '24 number, that's about $150 million above what we had already kind of indicated, as part of the Investor Day plan. So we are seeing drivers, both in the numerator, and then obviously, we remain committed to the capital allocation plan. And so, we're going to also be driving that denominator. So we still remain committed to that 15% to 20%.  With respect to the other question, as we think about 2024, we are basically positioned in the same way as we were in 2023. And so that gives us a lot of comfort, in terms of being able to handle what may be on the -- what may be coming for us from a load perspective. Winter Storm Heather, we performed very well, the fleet performed very well. And so we're pretty confident about where we stand at this stage. Thank you, Julien. Yes, you bet. So in terms of the growth synergies, we feel obviously very good about where we set one year into the plan through 2025. You can think about the mix as roughly 50% is actually driven by organic growth in the business units. We had obviously a strong year in the base business. And the other 50%, driven by a combination of cross-sell and think of it as a share of wallet type initiatives that improved the revenue and margin profile per customer. And so we've had a strong start.  We have a very high degree of confidence for the $300 million given we exceeded our initial guidance in year 1. And then as it relates to the cost side of things. The $100 million in cost synergies are really a function of elimination of two publicly traded companies, and we also exceeded our year 1 target for the cost side. And we have full line of sight to the $100 million by 2025. In fact, we will probably exceed our 2024 target towards that $100 million. And so as we sit here, we feel good on both ends, Durgesh. So Ryan, it's Bruce. The 2024 number is certainly on a weather-normalized basis. But the '24 number does reflect a higher assumption on COGS for the retail business. And so there's just a bit of a timing lag between the realization of that COGS relative to when that gets pushed through in revenue rate.  But Elizabeth, if you want to provide a little bit more color to that? Ryan, that's probably one that we'll have to just get back to you on to make sure that we get you the right numbers on that."

            "name": "Robert Gaudette",
            "content": "Sure. So Angie, look, we're excited by the growing demand for power. Like I think that it's real. We know it's real because we talk to a lot of the growth guys, so it's the hyperscalers and others that you've all heard about. We talk to them a lot. And it's exciting for NRG for a couple of reasons. One, we sit in competitive markets, which is where I believe most of this demand growth is going to be. We're going to see expanded margins on our existing fleet, right? So as the product goes up, we're going to see more earnings off of our generation, and we've spent and invested inside of those plants so that we can capture that.  Like Larry said, we've got the three projects that are ready to go. And the other thing to think about, Angie is we've got 21 plant sites across the country. So if this growth continues and we see it mix economic sense, then there's an opportunity there. But ultimately, these guys are going to turn to partners like NRG. As the market tightens, they're going to look for people who've got the expertise that we have. So it's going to be good for the industry, but it's definitely going to be good for us. So generally, C&I margins themselves over the last few years have gone up. The difference in the margin from a hyperscaler versus a traditional C&I customer, there isn't -- we haven't seen a growth in margin on the hyperscalers. The way you should probably think about it is if you're going to get a bunch of demand into the system, which we believe is real. That's going to create tightness for all customers. And so C&I customers across the board not just data center customers are going to be looking for expertise, which means they're going to turn to the bigger players who can help them manage the risk in a higher price, tighter commodity environment. Does that help? So the only thing I would tell you is, recall, we've been working on these for a while. We continue to work today. So we continue to get closer to being able to make final commitments in March, the rules for Texas come out. And then you can expect people to put their names in for the Texas Energy Fund probably June. I would expect that you guys will hear from us as to what we decide. But like Larry said, we're going to -- our capital allocation plan sticks and it all comes down to the financial opportunities that we see in either building the plants or doing something different. And right now, and as you guys have all seen, those plants have flexibility, which is good for how we manage our portfolio and ultimately good for what the grid needs in Texas. Yes. Thank you. We feel really good about how we exited the year end '23. As you mentioned, with 6% subscriber growth, 11% revenue growth, 17% adjusted EBITDA growth. And really, that's a function of a few things. First is the unit economics of the business are in great shape. If you look at the revenue per customer, the service cost reduction per customer up 21% that really drives an expansion of our service margin. And we expect that increased elevated margin to continue into 2024. As it relates to retention and brand loyalty, we are -- we had amongst our best years ever in terms of retaining our customers with a strong and durable customer relationships. We expect that to continue as well.  And then in terms of the subscriber growth, we expect to be in the mid-single digits from a subscriber growth perspective as well. So we feel good about how the business is set up in '24. If you zoom out, we operate in a large, growing and fragmented market. And our products and services have a very high degree of engagement and loyalty relative to peers. And so we think there is a lot of room ahead for us to continue to grow the business. It's Rob. Yes. So generative AI is going to load or created additional demand across the markets. The way to think about how that affects the businesses generally is let's start with that expands the margins on our existing generation portfolio and also makes that 1.5 gigawatts more interesting. And then when you think across the other parts of the business, C&I, you're going to see people turning towards bigger players like us, where we've seen it historically, when things get tighter, they run to quality providers.  We're there. And then from a home perspective, a consumer perspective, we've had a retail platform that has historically and will in the future, manage through different commodity cycles. And as prices move, our retail platform, because of the experience we have beyond just being a commodity provider, we do well in those markets, too. So the -- if you recall, the portfolio is 3 different projects, the speakers, we could get in, in 2 years and starting from whenever we broke ground and then a CCGT takes about 4. So you could expect if we were to go soon 2026 and 2028 would kind of be good years to think about from an additional capacity perspective."

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Kevin Cole, Head of Treasury and Investor Relations to read the Safe Harbor and introduce the call.\nKevin Cole: Great. Thank you, Darren. Good morning. And welcome to NRG Energy\u2019s third quarter 2023 earnings call. This morning\u2019s call will be 45 minutes in length and is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations and Webcast. Please note that today\u2019s discussion may contain forward-looking statements which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor in today\u2019s presentation, as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today\u2019s presentation. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG\u2019s President and CEO.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I am joined this morning by Bruce Chung, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have members of the management team. Before we go into the quarterly review, I\u2019d like to start with an overview of our value proposition. Over the last six years we have taken the necessary steps to position NRG at the center of the energy transition. Our Consumer Energy business that benefits from the increasing electrification of our economy, while generating significant excess cash well beyond its business needs. A complementary Smart Home business, that increases the lifetime value of our customers and enable greater optimization of our customer\u2019s energy demand and the financial flexibility to return significant capital to our shareholders, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. As you can see, we delivered compelling value today, and importantly, we have positioned our business to deliver value well into the future. So, with that, I\u2019d like to turn to the three key messages of our earnings presentation on slide five. First, we are raising our 2023 financial guidance, driven by strong financial and operational results, both in the third quarter and year-to-date. Second, we are initiating 2024 financial guidance above the plan we shared with you at our June Investor Day. And finally, with line-of-sight to achieving our 2025 growth roadmap, we are accelerating our focus on behind-the-meter load management opportunities for homes and businesses. Starting with our third quarter results on slide six. We delivered top decile safety performance and $973 million of adjusted EBITDA, 103% improvement from the same period last year, driven primarily by strong operational performance across the business and the addition of Vivint. This brings our year-to-date results to $2.438 billion of adjusted EBITDA, a 74% increase above the prior year. On our last earnings call, we indicated that we were trending towards the top end of the guidance range. With strong third quarter performance and our current outlook for the balance of the year, we are increasing and narrowing our 2023 financial guidance ranges, which includes the close of STP and that increase in the company\u2019s annual incentive plan given the expected outperformance for the year. During the quarter, we continue to make good progress on our strategic priorities. Vivint integration is well underway and with early success on our growth initiatives, we are raising again our 2023 target from $60 million to $75 million. This is 150% increase from our original $30 million target set in May. Also during the quarter, we continue executing on our portfolio optimization efforts with the retirement of the Joliet power station and the sale of Gregory and our interest in STP. Turning to capital allocation. We are raising our 2023 share repurchase target by 15% to $1.5 billion. We have completed $200 million of share repurchases year-to-date and with the close of STP, expect to execute the remaining $950 million under an accelerated share repurchase program. Next, we have executed $800 million of debt reduction, as part of our liability management program. Bruce will provide more details in his section. Finally, we are initiating 2024 financial guidance ahead of our June Investor Day plan. These earnings expansion is durable and represents high quality growth and overall strengthening of our business. On capital allocation, we allocated $500 million to debt reduction and the remaining excess cash allocated 80% to return on capital and 20% growth. Now turning to slide seven for an update on our Integrated Energy Business. We experienced the hottest summer on record in our core Texas market, breaking the previous peak demand record 10 times. While the power grid was given the record demand, it performed quite well with only a few periods of scarcity pricing when renewable output was low. Important thing, the efforts we undertook in our summer readiness and spring outage program resulted in a significant increase in our plan reliability. In the bottom left hand chart is our in-the-money availability. Indicating the availability of our units during periods when they are profitable, which is the relevant metric for our business and shows a significant improvement. Retail saw strong performance through the quarter with in-line customer growth and better-than-expected retention. We continue to improve our digital experience with customers engaging more, increasing monthly average app usage by 20%. Moving to retail supply. The steps we have taken to enhance our diversified supply strategy was successful in providing predictable supply costs under different load and price scenarios. Beyond investing in our plans, we adjusted our hedge ratios to lean long in key summer and winter months. Finally, we are beginning our efforts in residential demand response and have increased participation by 10% this year. We also manage a large C&I demand response business, with 2.5 gigawatts of capacity under management. I will provide more color on the behind-the-meter opportunity later in the presentation. Our Smart Home Business also performed well with strong customer growth and margin expansion as you can see on slide eight. We continue to advance our technology platform with the launch of new innovative products, improving our customer experience, that is constantly recognized as the best in the industry by consumer publications. On the right hand side of the slide, you will see the key performance indicators that we introduced in our last earnings call. We continue to see exceptional performance in Smart Home, with 7% subscriber growth, 9% revenue growth and 9% service margin improvement versus the same period last year, consistent with the improvements we reported in our second quarter results. Acquisition costs are higher due to the impact of more products being sold and higher interest rates, but were more than offset by higher revenue on new subscribers. Our customers are engaging more with our platform and are staying for a longer period of time. We are very encouraged by the performance we are seeing across the business and the opportunities that are arising inside the Home. Now, I want to provide an update on the opportunity for the management we see behind-the-meter or Virtual Power Plants on slide nine. We have been managing energy optimization programs for commercial and industrial customers for years and now we are seeing the growing opportunity in the residential space. New distributed technologies and a growing penetration of connected smart devices in the home have materially changed the industry, providing greater control to the consumer. Grid reliability has also played a role in accelerating adoption. As flexible demand represents instantaneous peaking capacity when the grid is at peak load or in scarcity conditions. We think the primary pathways for us to create value in these markets. First, through optimizing our existing customer peak demand in ERCOT and PJM, where we can benefit from both energy and capacity value, as well as reduced market risks. Second, through VPP services for Smart Home and Utility customers, both in regulated and competitive markets. We are uniquely positioned to win this space, we have the scale with 7.6 million customers, decades of commercial and market expertise and then Integrated Energy Business that allows NRG to monetize the value without having to go to the wholesale market or requiring regulatory change. We also have that data and insights from running the third largest commercial and industrial demand response program in the country. While our focus in the near-term, continues to be optimizing our core and integrating driven, over the medium- and long-term we see a significant value opportunity from these programs. These value is not included in our June Investor Day plan and. I look forward to providing you updates on our progress in the future. Moving to slide 10 for anomaly by integration efforts. We are making good progress across our initiatives and are reaffirming the full plan targets, totaling $550 million of recurring free cash flow before growth by the end of 2025. Our growth and cross-sell efforts have yielded strong results, allowing us to increase our 2023 growth target, $75 million. On the right-hand side of the slide, you will see the increasing number of customers buying two or more products. I want to highlight that this is not exclusively cross-sell between energy and Smart Home, but includes other consumer products sold across NRG that generate recurring revenues. We have been hard at work executing pilots and collecting critical insights as we prepare to scale energy and Smart Home cross-selling in 2024 and beyond. In the appendix of today\u2019s presentation, you will find our latest growth and cost plan score card. So you can track our progress. So, with that, I will pass it over to Bruce for the financial review.\nBruce Chung: Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to slide 12, NRG\u2019s third quarter and year-to-date financial performance significantly exceeded the same periods last year. NRG produced adjusted EBITDA of $973 million in the quarter, which is $493 million higher than the third quarter of 2022. As you can see in the chart at the bottom of the page, even when normalizing 2022 results for transitory items and the WA Parish outage, 2023 adjusted EBITDA still exceeded the prior year, by $350 million. Compared to a normalized 2022, third quarter 2023 performance was driven by $125 million of improved operations and margin expansion in our core energy business and $225 million of Vivint EBITDA which was not included in our 2022 results. Similar to the first two quarters of the year. Our core energy business continued to benefit from expanded margins, near record retention and increased customer count. Our diversified supply strategy and solid performance continue to provide predictable supply costs through a volatile load and freight conditions in Texas. Looking at our segments and starting with Texas. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $356 million versus the prior year on the back of higher gross margin of $378 million. Continued unit margin expansion from lower supply costs coupled with improved plant performance were the primary drivers for the increase in gross margin. This increase in gross margin was partially offset by increased OpEx from higher selling and marketing in Home Energy, where we increased 50,000 customer\u2019s year-over-year. In the East/West segment, adjusted EBITDA declined $88 million versus last year, driven primarily by lower spark-spreads of Cottonwood, discontinuation of equity earnings treatment for Ivanpah and an increase in accruals as part of the company\u2019s annual incentive plan, reflecting the expected financial outperformance for the year. In Q3, Vivint continued to deliver strong financial results, contributing $225 million in adjusted EBITDA. Revenue grew 9% year-over-year, driven by subscriber growth of 7%, favorable retention and higher recurring monthly revenue per subscriber, which combined with reductions in monthly service cost per customer, drove a 15% increase in adjusted EBITDA compared to 3Q 2022. NRG\u2019s free cash flow before growth was $355 million for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $983 million. This represents a significant improvement over 2022 totals, driven by growth in adjusted EBITDA. As a result of our year-to-date financial performance, we are raising and narrowing our full year 2023 guidance ranges, $3.15 billion to $3.3 billion for adjusted EBITDA and $1.725 billion to $1.875 billion of free cash flow before growth. The midpoint of our new guidance represents a $95 million increase in adjusted EBITDA and a $60 million increase in free cash flow before growth to the midpoint of our original guidance ranges. Turning to slide 13 for an update on our 2023 capital allocation. We have updated our 2023 excess cash to reflect the final net proceeds of divesting our interest in STP. The net proceeds from the sale of Gregory and the increase to our free cash flow midpoint for the year. The remaining numbers on this slide are largely consistent with the update we gave on the second quarter earnings call with a few notable exceptions. Moving from left to right, we have updated the capital we will spend on Vivint integration from $145 million to $50 million. This does not reflect lower cost associated with the integration, but rather a shifting of those dollars to 2024 and 2025. Much of the move is driven by systems integration decisions which shifted the timeline for those costs to be incurred. Continuing on, as you can see in the debt reduction column, we have made significant progress toward our target of $1.4 billion in debt reduction, with $800 million achieved through October 31st of this year. With the closing of the STP transaction, we will complete the remaining $600 million of debt reduction by the end of 2023 through a targeted liability management program. Finally, moving to the share repurchases column. You will see that we have completed $200 million of share repurchases thus far in 2023. This includes a $50 million we completed at the time of the second quarter earnings call and $150 million we recently completed on October 31st. With the closing of the STP transaction, we intend to launch a $950 million accelerated share repurchase program imminently. Between the $200 million already completed and the $950 million accelerated share repurchase program, our total share repurchases for the year will be $1.15 billion, which is $150 million more than what we had communicated at Investor Day and 2Q earnings. Moving to slide 14, we are excited to introduce our guidance for 2024. We are guiding 2024 full year adjusted EBITDA with a range of $3.3 billion to $3.55 billion, representing a midpoint of $3.425 billion. We are also guiding 2024 free cash-flow before growth, with a range of $1.825 billion to $2.075 billion, representing a midpoint of $1.95 billion. As you can see in the chart at the bottom of the page, there are several drivers of year-over-year guidance. Incremental Vivint EBITDA reflecting a full year\u2019s worth of ownership is effectively offset by the lost EBITDA from the Greg -- from the STP and Gregory asset sales. Our growth plan and cost synergies contribute $240 million of incremental EBITDA, but it\u2019s partially offset by an increase in the Vivint EBITDA harmonization adjustments. The final driver reflects a continuation of the improved operations and margin expansion, impacting our 2023 results and contributes to $160 million to our 2024 midpoint. As you can see with the impact of improved operations and margin expansion, our 2024 guidance midpoint exceeds the pro forma, we provided in our Investor Day plan. On slide 15, we are providing our 2024 capital allocation plan. As you can see, our capital allocation plan adheres to the 80-20 principal of return on capital versus growth, while ensuring we continue to meet our debt reduction commitments. Our plan currently calls for a debt reduction of $500 million in 2024. As we have always said, we are committed to a strong balance sheet and this debt reduction ensures that we remain on the path to achieving our target credit metrics by the end of 2025. Our return of capital plan is comprised of $825 million of share repurchases and $330 million of common dividends. The common dividends reflect an 8% increase in the common dividend per share from a $1.51 to a $1.63. Between capital return in 2023 and the expected capital return in 2024, we will have executed over 70% of our current share repurchase authorization and return to $2.65 billion to shareholders. In summary, our third quarter and year-to-date results show robust financial performance across the company, and with our increased 2023 guidance, we are poised to close out the year in a strong position and enter 2024 on a similarly high note. We remain committed to executing the Investor Day plan we shared back in June and our focus on maintaining a high level of operational performance will not waver as we head into the end of the year. With that, I will turn it back to you, Mauricio.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Bruce. I want to provide a few closing thoughts on today\u2019s presentation on slide 17. As you can see, we have made significant progress across all of our key priorities and are also ahead of the five-year plan we provided to you during our Investor Day. I want to take a moment to thank all my colleagues at NRG for keeping focused on execution and for their hard work in achieving these results. We have the right strategy and the right team to deliver exceptional value today and well into the future. So, with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. Darren, we are now ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim. Your line is now open.\nShar Pourreza: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Hey. Good morning, Shar.\nShar Pourreza: Good morning. Bruce, can we just unpack the $160 million in improved ops and margins that you are calling out in the 2024 EBITDA guidance, walk a little more? How much of that is margin expansion and how sticky is that overall as we look to refine our models for 2025 and beyond?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Sure. Bruce?\nBruce Chung: Sure. Hey, Shar. Good morning.\nShar Pourreza: Good morning.\nBruce Chung: So. I would say that, really when you think about the $160 million, it\u2019s pretty much margin expansion across the entirety of the complex. So if we think about our Home Energy business, we are really seeing margin expansion, there is really on two fronts, one is on revenue management and on the cost of supply. So when you think about the durability of that, the revenue management side of it is really a function of the efforts we have done over the past several years around data-driven analysis to really make sure that we are targeting proper revenue rate for customers and then on the cost of supply, that\u2019s really representing the benefits of our diversified supply strategy and just a general better plant performance relative to history. On the C&I side, we are seeing margin expansion there, which we would also believe is terrible. As we know, there has been volatility in the market and customers are locking in higher revenue rates reflecting that volatility, and obviously, those contracts tend to be longer tenor and so that should also provide durability. And then lastly on the Smart Home side. As you saw with the KPIs, we are seeing margin expansion both on the revenue front and higher revenue per subscriber, as well as lower cost to serve as we continue to optimize that piece of the business, and again, given the long duration nature of those customers, we would expect that to also continue to be durable. So, all-in-all, higher expansion on the margin side with durability.\nMauricio Gutierrez: So, Shar, I mean, this is really just a reflection of the improvements we have done in the business and I see them as durable sustainable for the foreseeable future.\nShar Pourreza: Perfect. And we should -- 2024 free cash flow conversion rate, it looks like it\u2019s in the mid-to-high 50s. I know you have indicated at the Analyst Day, your target is to step-up through the plan into the mid=to-high 60s. Can you just walk us through how you see that stepping up and what kind of shape that may take, i.e., linear as we also continue to update our models? Thanks.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Sure. Bruce, do you want to?\nBruce Chung: Yeah. I would say, Shar, I think, we continue to remain focused on that conversion rate. I don\u2019t think it will be linear, because if you -- most of that conversion improvement is going to come from increasing the conversion at Vivint, right? And so if you remember, we provided some information that showed a free cash flow growth profile at Vivint going from $140 million to $445 million. by the end of 2025, so that\u2019s a pretty steep increase in the cash flow at Vivint which is really going to help to drive that conversion higher on a go-forward basis.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. And lastly, Mauricio, just on a -- just a strategy question, I guess. Can you just update us on how you are kind of approaching the prospects for newbuilds in ERCOT? I know there\u2019s obviously a lot of the existing assets in the market right now, we have seen in Carolina and we have seen in Texas gen, would you have any interest in second hand plants? Thanks guys. I appreciate it.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Sure. Well, as you know, Shar. We actually improve our diversified supply strategy. Some of it will be through own generation, some moving into rent and to complement with market purchases. So the team is constantly looking at the economics between buying from the market, renting or buying assets from other and creating options internally to develop those facilities either as brownfield development. So we are looking at all of it. We are evaluating the economics. At the end of the day, we are balancing operational risk, market risk, counterparty risk, that criteria permeates the evaluation that we are doing on all of these options. We are still awaiting to see changes in market design and other improvements to incentivize dispatchable generation. That also is going to shape the decisions that we are going to make. So as you can tell, this is not just a linear and a myopic view on assets to be bought in the market and development, we really also need to see what incentives are available given the changes in the regulatory construct in ERCOT. So I have said before that towards, I would say, the end of the year, we are going to have more visibility on those changes in ERCOT that is going to inform the next steps we are going to take.\nShar Pourreza: Fantastic guys. Congrats on your results. See you soon.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Shar. Appreciate that.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thank you very much for taking the time. Appreciate it. Look, just checking in first on the buyback here just a technicality. Can we talk a little bit -- you have a big portion remaining for what you call 2023? You want to talk about your ability to get that done and then also how that might proves to be additive to kind of 2024 here, especially given the higher numbers that your guidance versus initial plan?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Sure, Julien. So\u2026\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: \u2026you get it done.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yeah. As we mentioned, we are going to do the ASR imminently, that means as soon as possible. And what I will characterize the execution of that ASR, we are going to do it as fast and as efficient as we can. So I think that\u2019s the spirit and the intent launching this ASR as soon as possible.\nBruce Chung: Julien, I would just add that as you know, when you do an ASR, we obviously realize the vast majority of the shares having been bought in pretty much on an immediate basis, but it takes time for the banks to be able to go and purchase those shares properly. And so my guess is, we would probably anticipate that the program will be completed inside of the first quarter of next year. But to us, that\u2019s actually a pretty good situation because then that provides the ability to then roll into a regular way share of repurchase program related to our 2024 capital allocation plan to really continue to maintain the momentum on the repurchase front.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it, guys. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Maybe just pivoting a little bit back here. I mean, obviously, very nicely done on 2024, nicely done on the comments on keeping it sticky. And then, Mauricio, next piece of this is, you have talked up this virtual Power Plant distributed opportunity on the call today in prior remarks, how do you see that feeding into, A, what you are talking about in 2024? I presume that\u2019s not really necessarily reflected in size. But at the same time, you talk up an opportunity there, I presume that there\u2019s a certain degree of customer election and choice in that. But how do you see that scaling here? When does that really meaningfully impacting and how meaningful are we talking here? I mean, I have heard some of your comments earlier, if you could elaborate.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yeah. So, well, the first thing that I will say is that, this opportunity is not included in the investor -- in the plan that we provided at Investor Day. The second thing I will say is, just given the focus and the availability of technologies today, we are accelerating the scale-up of this opportunity. I initially thought that this was going to be a five-plus year opportunity. What we are experiencing is that this is going to be able to be implemented and scaled up faster than that. I would say it\u2019s probably a three-plus year. And I provided some initial numbers that I think are very realistic on what we can accomplish. So if you look at a 1 gigawatt VI [ph] position in Texas this past summer, it represented close to $200 million of gross margin. And 1 gigawatt for our portfolio is basically less than 10% of the load -- of the peak load that we currently serve. So it\u2019s very achievable and that gives you just some indication that you are not talking here about a small opportunity, you are talking here about a very large opportunity. The other thing that I will say is that, this product that we are talking about is really leveraging the devices that we use to protect homes plus the distributed technologies available today to help consumers optimize demand. Don\u2019t think of this as a conservation effort -- opt-in conservation effort. This is about optimizing and about convenience for our customers. So it is a very different product from the traditional VI. That\u2019s why we are calling it more as an optimization of the energy demand behind the meter as opposed to a traditional demand response. That\u2019s why we are so excited because this is something that consumers want and this is something that NRG is uniquely positioned not only to provide to consumers, but to be able to monetize that value in the wholesale market. There is no other entity with the scale of NRG that can do that today. That\u2019s why we are an early mover on this.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Awesome. Excellent. Thank you. Just a quick clarification from the last question from Shar. When he asked you about acquisitions or divestments on gas, I presume that what we saw with Gregory here is perhaps an indication of the margin of continued divestment on the margin of your portfolio as you move over time, right? We should set the expectation that more of these kinds of transactions are in the wings. Again, I get that Gregory was a very specific pattern here we assume.\nMauricio Gutierrez: I think we are, for the most part, done on the optimization front. I mean remember, the optimization of our portfolio is driven by what we need to serve our load in the best possible way. STP, I already talked at great length, it\u2019s block power, it is not necessarily, it is not flexible, it doesn\u2019t move. We can replace that in the market. Gregory was also very specific. This is basically a plan that was built to provide steam to our host. So they really didn\u2019t do provided the attributes of characteristics that we wanted from a flexible asset. I think after Gregory and STP I would say our optimization efforts are largely done.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Thanks guys.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you. Julien.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski of Seaport. Your line is now open.\nAngie Storozynski: Good morning, guys.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Good morning, Angie.\nAngie Storozynski: Good morning. So first on Vivint. So one I was just wondering if you have heard any feedback from your activist investor about how holding onto Vivint is working out for you in the stock, so that\u2019s one. And number two is, so you mentioned a number of positive updates on Vivint. One of the main ones, at least that\u2019s stuck-up with me is the, basically lower attrition. So is it fair to say that the higher interest rates and thus lower migration is actually what\u2019s benefiting your platform. Again not something that would everything to link higher interest rates as a benefit for a business like yours, but it\u2019s deals that way.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes, Angie. So let me take the first one and then I am going to ask Rasesh to answer your second question. The focus of the management team and the company is to execute on our consumer strategy. And I think what you are seeing in the last two quarters is that, we basically delivering on the commitments that we provided to all of you on Investor Day. That\u2019s our focus. I have been in -- on the road talking to investors to help them better understand the strategy, to help them better understand the value proposition that this consumer strategy represents and not just to the activist, but to all shareholders. And that has been our focus, that\u2019s what we can do as a company, as a management team and I am very pleased with the results that we are delivering and I think shareholders in general are appreciating the value of our consumer strategy. And what I will say that also market participants as a whole, whether it\u2019s ISOs or whether it is the regulators, they are starting to see the benefit and the opportunity that demand represents to better manage the entire power grid given the greater electrification that we are going to see in the years to come. So I think thus finally happening. But Rasesh the second question can you address?\nRasesh Patel: You bet. Angie, good morning. I think the results reflect the strong value proposition that we provide to consumers. If you think about 7% subscriber growth. We are also seeing an increase in the number of products each subscriber is actually taking into 5% growth in recurring revenue, simultaneously the cost-to-serve customers is down 19% on a unit basis year-over-year. And as you mentioned, one of the most powerful aspects of the value proposition is the near -- I think that a record-low attrition rate for us and this economy to have a nine-year customer life. When you bring these things together, combined with the fact that the average consumer is engaging with our products, 33% more than they were this time last year. It\u2019s a really robust flywheel that results in just improving customer lifetime value and so we feel really good about the business and we think there\u2019s a long runway ahead forward.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. Just one follow-up on Vivint. So, Rasesh, you remember, as you said yourself, you are bringing forward this DR [ph] driven this growth on the Vivint side, I thought that the reason why we had expected the growth to materialize on the 2025 and beyond was because you actually needed some software upgrades, some sort of investment to facilitate that growth. So have you put those forward, hence the growth is materializing earlier?\nRasesh Patel: Yeah. So, I will say, and we literally just finish a pilot where we are connecting our Smart Home technology to our commercial operations. So let me take a little bit of a step-back. We already cover residential demand response program on our traditional energy business and that is connected to the backbone of our commercial operations to make sure that we optimize the system. What we have been doing the last couple of weeks and then is to connect now the Smart Home technology platform to our commercial operations backbone. That was very successful. That\u2019s why I said that, we are accelerating those efforts and instead of being a five-plus-year opportunity, I see that as a three-plus-year opportunity. The improvements and investments that we need to do on the technology backbone is included in that 20% of growth, we are not going to increase that. What I am saying is that, there is the need and the -- by the consumer and quite candidly by the power grid to accelerate these efforts. So really, really good progress there, Angie.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And then the last question, and again, I understand the explanation behind the divestiture of STP and I see that the EBITDA contribution from Gregory was very small, but you are getting shorter and shorter power in Texas. And again I know that not for a given summer because you hedge, but we just survive this the summer, I mean, better than survived, but anyway. I mean, all of these conservation alerts from ERCOT are causing anxiety among us and new investors, I am sure. So just strategically speaking, getting rid of more power plants in Texas, how do we manage this risk of matching the retail load with self-generation in Texas?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yeah. So, Angie, let me just say two things. Number one, we are -- when we serve our customers we are not short. We are actually leaning long. We don\u2019t have to own every megawatt or produce every megawatt that we sell to our customers. That will be the first thing. The second thing is, and perhaps, to your point about, ERCOT. When I think about the market, my view is that, the marginal unit, which means the most cost-efficient today is renewable energy. It\u2019s going to be wind and solar, intermit and generation. That\u2019s zero variable cost generation. What that means is that, for the most part of ours in the market is quite clear at a very low price, except for those periods where perhaps renewable is not performing as normal, because the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining. So you are going to see very few periods of scarcity conditions. But for the most part, the rest of the intervals, the rest of the hours are going to be very low price. So that\u2019s why demand response and the optimizing demand management is so, so important, because that basically gives you instantaneous peaking capacity exactly for the duration that you want, which is very short durations. I think we have the improvement that we have made on our supply strategy is very consistent with what we expect the market will be paid in the future and the opportunity around the management is again completely consistent with that expectation in terms of price formation and market behavior. So I believe we have positioned the company very, very well for the foreseeable future. And I will just say one more thing, we literally experienced the hottest summer on record in Texas and the grid handled it very well. The only time when we saw scarcity pricing was really at phase where we have low renewable output and even there ERCOT was managing the grid very conservatively. So I will say that, for those of you who really wanted to test the ERCOT market and the improved supply strategy that we have at NRG. This was the test and we passed with high flying colors I think.\nAngie Storozynski: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our -- please wait one moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Michael Sullivan of Wolfe. Your line is now open.\nMichael Sullivan: Hey, everyone. Good morning.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Good morning, Michael.\nMichael Sullivan: Hey. Just wanted to follow-on one of the questions from earlier in terms of the growth target realization looks like that\u2019s coming little bit sooner than expected. Does that indicate any potential upsides to the 2025 number of $300 million run rate?\nMauricio Gutierrez: I think right now we are comfortable accelerating the 2023 targets, just given the success on our growth and cross-sell. Yeah, I think, it\u2019s early to start thinking about moving the $300 million by 2025. What I will say is that, that roadmap does not include the VPP or demand side management potential and that\u2019s something that we are going to be talking to all of you, quantifying it and how big it be and when can we start realizing it. So that\u2019s more to come there.\nMichael Sullivan: Okay. Great. And then just specifically on the ERCOT portfolio, next week\u2019s vote on the loan bill, does that drive any decision-making in terms of optimization of the fleet or newbuild or anything like that?\nMauricio Gutierrez: I mean, it is one more data point that we are going to take into consideration. I think the first step for the loan program, it is the vote and then the second step is the rules around how the loan program is going to work. Obviously, all market participants are looking at it and we will -- again, it will be one more data point for us to inform our supply strategy, but it is only one more data point.\nMichael Sullivan: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our final question comes from the line of Ryan Levine of Citi. Your line is now open.\nRyan Levine: Good morning. I am hoping to start off saying more on the strategic side. At the Analyst Day, you indicated an aversion to larger strategic acquisitions. Given that the pre-capsule picture is becoming more favorable and maybe pricing for assets is going down. How committed are you to that vision and you think you highlight some potential VPP and power plant opportunities? Is there any scope around what type of incremental capital that could enable?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Well, the first thing I will say is, as I mentioned on Investor Day, we don\u2019t see any more acquisitions. Second, we are completely committed to this capital allocation framework of 80% of return, 20% of growth. And third, the 20% is inclusive of the opportunity that we see on VPP. So, we will continue unpacking what that opportunity is and the investment, but it will be contained within the 20% during the planning period that we provided to you.\nRyan Levine: Okay. I appreciate the clarification. And then one more on the modeling side in terms of the Vivint, subscriber acquisition cost coming up and that subscriber acquisition cost coming up, what\u2019s driving that and what do you think from a trend standpoint in terms of customer acquisitions?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yeah. It is really a function of two things. One is the increase in interest rates year-over-year and two is a function of the consumer buying more products when they take our service. And on the second point, we feel very good about both the payback period, as well as the IRR. You see the boost in recurring revenue per subscriber that\u2019s disclosed in the KPIs. I want to remind you that that\u2019s across the entire 2.1 million subscriber base. If you would only look at the new customer acquisition cohort, the revenue increase -- the service revenue increase is even more substantive than that. And so, we feel very good about the payback of that incremental investment in the consumer as they take more products from us.\nRyan Levine: Is the customer composition or the customer mix evolving or any comments you are able to make around the characteristics of your new subscriber cost?\nMauricio Gutierrez: No. Other than the new customers are sort of taking more product as we continue to expand our product portfolio. There\u2019s no change in the mix. We have a very, very high quality subscriber base and high credit scores. And so it\u2019s a very resilient business from that standpoint.\nRyan Levine: Okay. I appreciate you taking my question.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Ryan.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to Mauricio Gutierrez for closing remarks.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Darren. Well, I would like to thank all of you for your interest in the company and your support and look forward to providing you updates in the future. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program.",

            "name": "Mauricio Gutierrez",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I am joined this morning by Bruce Chung, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have members of the management team. Before we go into the quarterly review, I'd like to start with an overview of our value proposition. Over the last six years we have taken the necessary steps to position NRG at the center of the energy transition. Our Consumer Energy business that benefits from the increasing electrification of our economy, while generating significant excess cash well beyond its business needs. A complementary Smart Home business, that increases the lifetime value of our customers and enable greater optimization of our customer's energy demand and the financial flexibility to return significant capital to our shareholders, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. As you can see, we delivered compelling value today, and importantly, we have positioned our business to deliver value well into the future. So, with that, I'd like to turn to the three key messages of our earnings presentation on slide five. First, we are raising our 2023 financial guidance, driven by strong financial and operational results, both in the third quarter and year-to-date. Second, we are initiating 2024 financial guidance above the plan we shared with you at our June Investor Day. And finally, with line-of-sight to achieving our 2025 growth roadmap, we are accelerating our focus on behind-the-meter load management opportunities for homes and businesses. Starting with our third quarter results on slide six. We delivered top decile safety performance and $973 million of adjusted EBITDA, 103% improvement from the same period last year, driven primarily by strong operational performance across the business and the addition of Vivint. This brings our year-to-date results to $2.438 billion of adjusted EBITDA, a 74% increase above the prior year. On our last earnings call, we indicated that we were trending towards the top end of the guidance range. With strong third quarter performance and our current outlook for the balance of the year, we are increasing and narrowing our 2023 financial guidance ranges, which includes the close of STP and that increase in the company's annual incentive plan given the expected outperformance for the year. During the quarter, we continue to make good progress on our strategic priorities. Vivint integration is well underway and with early success on our growth initiatives, we are raising again our 2023 target from $60 million to $75 million. This is 150% increase from our original $30 million target set in May. Also during the quarter, we continue executing on our portfolio optimization efforts with the retirement of the Joliet power station and the sale of Gregory and our interest in STP. Turning to capital allocation. We are raising our 2023 share repurchase target by 15% to $1.5 billion. We have completed $200 million of share repurchases year-to-date and with the close of STP, expect to execute the remaining $950 million under an accelerated share repurchase program. Next, we have executed $800 million of debt reduction, as part of our liability management program. Bruce will provide more details in his section. Finally, we are initiating 2024 financial guidance ahead of our June Investor Day plan. These earnings expansion is durable and represents high quality growth and overall strengthening of our business. On capital allocation, we allocated $500 million to debt reduction and the remaining excess cash allocated 80% to return on capital and 20% growth. Now turning to slide seven for an update on our Integrated Energy Business. We experienced the hottest summer on record in our core Texas market, breaking the previous peak demand record 10 times. While the power grid was given the record demand, it performed quite well with only a few periods of scarcity pricing when renewable output was low. Important thing, the efforts we undertook in our summer readiness and spring outage program resulted in a significant increase in our plan reliability. In the bottom left hand chart is our in-the-money availability. Indicating the availability of our units during periods when they are profitable, which is the relevant metric for our business and shows a significant improvement. Retail saw strong performance through the quarter with in-line customer growth and better-than-expected retention. We continue to improve our digital experience with customers engaging more, increasing monthly average app usage by 20%. Moving to retail supply. The steps we have taken to enhance our diversified supply strategy was successful in providing predictable supply costs under different load and price scenarios. Beyond investing in our plans, we adjusted our hedge ratios to lean long in key summer and winter months. Finally, we are beginning our efforts in residential demand response and have increased participation by 10% this year. We also manage a large C&I demand response business, with 2.5 gigawatts of capacity under management. I will provide more color on the behind-the-meter opportunity later in the presentation. Our Smart Home Business also performed well with strong customer growth and margin expansion as you can see on slide eight. We continue to advance our technology platform with the launch of new innovative products, improving our customer experience, that is constantly recognized as the best in the industry by consumer publications. On the right hand side of the slide, you will see the key performance indicators that we introduced in our last earnings call. We continue to see exceptional performance in Smart Home, with 7% subscriber growth, 9% revenue growth and 9% service margin improvement versus the same period last year, consistent with the improvements we reported in our second quarter results. Acquisition costs are higher due to the impact of more products being sold and higher interest rates, but were more than offset by higher revenue on new subscribers. Our customers are engaging more with our platform and are staying for a longer period of time. We are very encouraged by the performance we are seeing across the business and the opportunities that are arising inside the Home. Now, I want to provide an update on the opportunity for the management we see behind-the-meter or Virtual Power Plants on slide nine. We have been managing energy optimization programs for commercial and industrial customers for years and now we are seeing the growing opportunity in the residential space. New distributed technologies and a growing penetration of connected smart devices in the home have materially changed the industry, providing greater control to the consumer. Grid reliability has also played a role in accelerating adoption. As flexible demand represents instantaneous peaking capacity when the grid is at peak load or in scarcity conditions. We think the primary pathways for us to create value in these markets. First, through optimizing our existing customer peak demand in ERCOT and PJM, where we can benefit from both energy and capacity value, as well as reduced market risks. Second, through VPP services for Smart Home and Utility customers, both in regulated and competitive markets. We are uniquely positioned to win this space, we have the scale with 7.6 million customers, decades of commercial and market expertise and then Integrated Energy Business that allows NRG to monetize the value without having to go to the wholesale market or requiring regulatory change. We also have that data and insights from running the third largest commercial and industrial demand response program in the country. While our focus in the near-term, continues to be optimizing our core and integrating driven, over the medium- and long-term we see a significant value opportunity from these programs. These value is not included in our June Investor Day plan and. I look forward to providing you updates on our progress in the future. Moving to slide 10 for anomaly by integration efforts. We are making good progress across our initiatives and are reaffirming the full plan targets, totaling $550 million of recurring free cash flow before growth by the end of 2025. Our growth and cross-sell efforts have yielded strong results, allowing us to increase our 2023 growth target, $75 million. On the right-hand side of the slide, you will see the increasing number of customers buying two or more products. I want to highlight that this is not exclusively cross-sell between energy and Smart Home, but includes other consumer products sold across NRG that generate recurring revenues. We have been hard at work executing pilots and collecting critical insights as we prepare to scale energy and Smart Home cross-selling in 2024 and beyond. In the appendix of today's presentation, you will find our latest growth and cost plan score card. So you can track our progress. So, with that, I will pass it over to Bruce for the financial review. Thank you, Bruce. I want to provide a few closing thoughts on today's presentation on slide 17. As you can see, we have made significant progress across all of our key priorities and are also ahead of the five-year plan we provided to you during our Investor Day. I want to take a moment to thank all my colleagues at NRG for keeping focused on execution and for their hard work in achieving these results. We have the right strategy and the right team to deliver exceptional value today and well into the future. So, with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. Darren, we are now ready to open the line for questions. Hey. Good morning, Shar. Sure. Bruce? So, Shar, I mean, this is really just a reflection of the improvements we have done in the business and I see them as durable sustainable for the foreseeable future. Sure. Bruce, do you want to? Sure. Well, as you know, Shar. We actually improve our diversified supply strategy. Some of it will be through own generation, some moving into rent and to complement with market purchases. So the team is constantly looking at the economics between buying from the market, renting or buying assets from other and creating options internally to develop those facilities either as brownfield development. So we are looking at all of it. We are evaluating the economics. At the end of the day, we are balancing operational risk, market risk, counterparty risk, that criteria permeates the evaluation that we are doing on all of these options. We are still awaiting to see changes in market design and other improvements to incentivize dispatchable generation. That also is going to shape the decisions that we are going to make. So as you can tell, this is not just a linear and a myopic view on assets to be bought in the market and development, we really also need to see what incentives are available given the changes in the regulatory construct in ERCOT. So I have said before that towards, I would say, the end of the year, we are going to have more visibility on those changes in ERCOT that is going to inform the next steps we are going to take. Thank you, Shar. Appreciate that. Sure, Julien. So... Yeah. As we mentioned, we are going to do the ASR imminently, that means as soon as possible. And what I will characterize the execution of that ASR, we are going to do it as fast and as efficient as we can. So I think that's the spirit and the intent launching this ASR as soon as possible. Yeah. So, well, the first thing that I will say is that, this opportunity is not included in the investor -- in the plan that we provided at Investor Day. The second thing I will say is, just given the focus and the availability of technologies today, we are accelerating the scale-up of this opportunity. I initially thought that this was going to be a five-plus year opportunity. What we are experiencing is that this is going to be able to be implemented and scaled up faster than that. I would say it's probably a three-plus year. And I provided some initial numbers that I think are very realistic on what we can accomplish. So if you look at a 1 gigawatt VI [ph] position in Texas this past summer, it represented close to $200 million of gross margin. And 1 gigawatt for our portfolio is basically less than 10% of the load -- of the peak load that we currently serve. So it's very achievable and that gives you just some indication that you are not talking here about a small opportunity, you are talking here about a very large opportunity. The other thing that I will say is that, this product that we are talking about is really leveraging the devices that we use to protect homes plus the distributed technologies available today to help consumers optimize demand. Don't think of this as a conservation effort -- opt-in conservation effort. This is about optimizing and about convenience for our customers. So it is a very different product from the traditional VI. That's why we are calling it more as an optimization of the energy demand behind the meter as opposed to a traditional demand response. That's why we are so excited because this is something that consumers want and this is something that NRG is uniquely positioned not only to provide to consumers, but to be able to monetize that value in the wholesale market. There is no other entity with the scale of NRG that can do that today. That's why we are an early mover on this. I think we are, for the most part, done on the optimization front. I mean remember, the optimization of our portfolio is driven by what we need to serve our load in the best possible way. STP, I already talked at great length, it's block power, it is not necessarily, it is not flexible, it doesn't move. We can replace that in the market. Gregory was also very specific. This is basically a plan that was built to provide steam to our host. So they really didn't do provided the attributes of characteristics that we wanted from a flexible asset. I think after Gregory and STP I would say our optimization efforts are largely done. Thank you. Julien. Good morning, Angie. Yes, Angie. So let me take the first one and then I am going to ask Rasesh to answer your second question. The focus of the management team and the company is to execute on our consumer strategy. And I think what you are seeing in the last two quarters is that, we basically delivering on the commitments that we provided to all of you on Investor Day. That's our focus. I have been in -- on the road talking to investors to help them better understand the strategy, to help them better understand the value proposition that this consumer strategy represents and not just to the activist, but to all shareholders. And that has been our focus, that's what we can do as a company, as a management team and I am very pleased with the results that we are delivering and I think shareholders in general are appreciating the value of our consumer strategy. And what I will say that also market participants as a whole, whether it's ISOs or whether it is the regulators, they are starting to see the benefit and the opportunity that demand represents to better manage the entire power grid given the greater electrification that we are going to see in the years to come. So I think thus finally happening. But Rasesh the second question can you address? Yeah. So, Angie, let me just say two things. Number one, we are -- when we serve our customers we are not short. We are actually leaning long. We don't have to own every megawatt or produce every megawatt that we sell to our customers. That will be the first thing. The second thing is, and perhaps, to your point about, ERCOT. When I think about the market, my view is that, the marginal unit, which means the most cost-efficient today is renewable energy. It's going to be wind and solar, intermit and generation. That's zero variable cost generation. What that means is that, for the most part of ours in the market is quite clear at a very low price, except for those periods where perhaps renewable is not performing as normal, because the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining. So you are going to see very few periods of scarcity conditions. But for the most part, the rest of the intervals, the rest of the hours are going to be very low price. So that's why demand response and the optimizing demand management is so, so important, because that basically gives you instantaneous peaking capacity exactly for the duration that you want, which is very short durations. I think we have the improvement that we have made on our supply strategy is very consistent with what we expect the market will be paid in the future and the opportunity around the management is again completely consistent with that expectation in terms of price formation and market behavior. So I believe we have positioned the company very, very well for the foreseeable future. And I will just say one more thing, we literally experienced the hottest summer on record in Texas and the grid handled it very well. The only time when we saw scarcity pricing was really at phase where we have low renewable output and even there ERCOT was managing the grid very conservatively. So I will say that, for those of you who really wanted to test the ERCOT market and the improved supply strategy that we have at NRG. This was the test and we passed with high flying colors I think. Good morning, Michael. I think right now we are comfortable accelerating the 2023 targets, just given the success on our growth and cross-sell. Yeah, I think, it's early to start thinking about moving the $300 million by 2025. What I will say is that, that roadmap does not include the VPP or demand side management potential and that's something that we are going to be talking to all of you, quantifying it and how big it be and when can we start realizing it. So that's more to come there. I mean, it is one more data point that we are going to take into consideration. I think the first step for the loan program, it is the vote and then the second step is the rules around how the loan program is going to work. Obviously, all market participants are looking at it and we will -- again, it will be one more data point for us to inform our supply strategy, but it is only one more data point. Thank you, Michael. Well, the first thing I will say is, as I mentioned on Investor Day, we don't see any more acquisitions. Second, we are completely committed to this capital allocation framework of 80% of return, 20% of growth. And third, the 20% is inclusive of the opportunity that we see on VPP. So, we will continue unpacking what that opportunity is and the investment, but it will be contained within the 20% during the planning period that we provided to you. Yeah. It is really a function of two things. One is the increase in interest rates year-over-year and two is a function of the consumer buying more products when they take our service. And on the second point, we feel very good about both the payback period, as well as the IRR. You see the boost in recurring revenue per subscriber that's disclosed in the KPIs. I want to remind you that that's across the entire 2.1 million subscriber base. If you would only look at the new customer acquisition cohort, the revenue increase -- the service revenue increase is even more substantive than that. And so, we feel very good about the payback of that incremental investment in the consumer as they take more products from us. No. Other than the new customers are sort of taking more product as we continue to expand our product portfolio. There's no change in the mix. We have a very, very high quality subscriber base and high credit scores. And so it's a very resilient business from that standpoint. Thank you, Ryan. Thank you, Darren. Well, I would like to thank all of you for your interest in the company and your support and look forward to providing you updates in the future. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to slide 12, NRG's third quarter and year-to-date financial performance significantly exceeded the same periods last year. NRG produced adjusted EBITDA of $973 million in the quarter, which is $493 million higher than the third quarter of 2022. As you can see in the chart at the bottom of the page, even when normalizing 2022 results for transitory items and the WA Parish outage, 2023 adjusted EBITDA still exceeded the prior year, by $350 million. Compared to a normalized 2022, third quarter 2023 performance was driven by $125 million of improved operations and margin expansion in our core energy business and $225 million of Vivint EBITDA which was not included in our 2022 results. Similar to the first two quarters of the year. Our core energy business continued to benefit from expanded margins, near record retention and increased customer count. Our diversified supply strategy and solid performance continue to provide predictable supply costs through a volatile load and freight conditions in Texas. Looking at our segments and starting with Texas. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $356 million versus the prior year on the back of higher gross margin of $378 million. Continued unit margin expansion from lower supply costs coupled with improved plant performance were the primary drivers for the increase in gross margin. This increase in gross margin was partially offset by increased OpEx from higher selling and marketing in Home Energy, where we increased 50,000 customer's year-over-year. In the East/West segment, adjusted EBITDA declined $88 million versus last year, driven primarily by lower spark-spreads of Cottonwood, discontinuation of equity earnings treatment for Ivanpah and an increase in accruals as part of the company's annual incentive plan, reflecting the expected financial outperformance for the year. In Q3, Vivint continued to deliver strong financial results, contributing $225 million in adjusted EBITDA. Revenue grew 9% year-over-year, driven by subscriber growth of 7%, favorable retention and higher recurring monthly revenue per subscriber, which combined with reductions in monthly service cost per customer, drove a 15% increase in adjusted EBITDA compared to 3Q 2022. NRG's free cash flow before growth was $355 million for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $983 million. This represents a significant improvement over 2022 totals, driven by growth in adjusted EBITDA. As a result of our year-to-date financial performance, we are raising and narrowing our full year 2023 guidance ranges, $3.15 billion to $3.3 billion for adjusted EBITDA and $1.725 billion to $1.875 billion of free cash flow before growth. The midpoint of our new guidance represents a $95 million increase in adjusted EBITDA and a $60 million increase in free cash flow before growth to the midpoint of our original guidance ranges. Turning to slide 13 for an update on our 2023 capital allocation. We have updated our 2023 excess cash to reflect the final net proceeds of divesting our interest in STP. The net proceeds from the sale of Gregory and the increase to our free cash flow midpoint for the year. The remaining numbers on this slide are largely consistent with the update we gave on the second quarter earnings call with a few notable exceptions. Moving from left to right, we have updated the capital we will spend on Vivint integration from $145 million to $50 million. This does not reflect lower cost associated with the integration, but rather a shifting of those dollars to 2024 and 2025. Much of the move is driven by systems integration decisions which shifted the timeline for those costs to be incurred. Continuing on, as you can see in the debt reduction column, we have made significant progress toward our target of $1.4 billion in debt reduction, with $800 million achieved through October 31st of this year. With the closing of the STP transaction, we will complete the remaining $600 million of debt reduction by the end of 2023 through a targeted liability management program. Finally, moving to the share repurchases column. You will see that we have completed $200 million of share repurchases thus far in 2023. This includes a $50 million we completed at the time of the second quarter earnings call and $150 million we recently completed on October 31st. With the closing of the STP transaction, we intend to launch a $950 million accelerated share repurchase program imminently. Between the $200 million already completed and the $950 million accelerated share repurchase program, our total share repurchases for the year will be $1.15 billion, which is $150 million more than what we had communicated at Investor Day and 2Q earnings. Moving to slide 14, we are excited to introduce our guidance for 2024. We are guiding 2024 full year adjusted EBITDA with a range of $3.3 billion to $3.55 billion, representing a midpoint of $3.425 billion. We are also guiding 2024 free cash-flow before growth, with a range of $1.825 billion to $2.075 billion, representing a midpoint of $1.95 billion. As you can see in the chart at the bottom of the page, there are several drivers of year-over-year guidance. Incremental Vivint EBITDA reflecting a full year's worth of ownership is effectively offset by the lost EBITDA from the Greg -- from the STP and Gregory asset sales. Our growth plan and cost synergies contribute $240 million of incremental EBITDA, but it's partially offset by an increase in the Vivint EBITDA harmonization adjustments. The final driver reflects a continuation of the improved operations and margin expansion, impacting our 2023 results and contributes to $160 million to our 2024 midpoint. As you can see with the impact of improved operations and margin expansion, our 2024 guidance midpoint exceeds the pro forma, we provided in our Investor Day plan. On slide 15, we are providing our 2024 capital allocation plan. As you can see, our capital allocation plan adheres to the 80-20 principal of return on capital versus growth, while ensuring we continue to meet our debt reduction commitments. Our plan currently calls for a debt reduction of $500 million in 2024. As we have always said, we are committed to a strong balance sheet and this debt reduction ensures that we remain on the path to achieving our target credit metrics by the end of 2025. Our return of capital plan is comprised of $825 million of share repurchases and $330 million of common dividends. The common dividends reflect an 8% increase in the common dividend per share from a $1.51 to a $1.63. Between capital return in 2023 and the expected capital return in 2024, we will have executed over 70% of our current share repurchase authorization and return to $2.65 billion to shareholders. In summary, our third quarter and year-to-date results show robust financial performance across the company, and with our increased 2023 guidance, we are poised to close out the year in a strong position and enter 2024 on a similarly high note. We remain committed to executing the Investor Day plan we shared back in June and our focus on maintaining a high level of operational performance will not waver as we head into the end of the year. With that, I will turn it back to you, Mauricio. Sure. Hey, Shar. Good morning. So. I would say that, really when you think about the $160 million, it's pretty much margin expansion across the entirety of the complex. So if we think about our Home Energy business, we are really seeing margin expansion, there is really on two fronts, one is on revenue management and on the cost of supply. So when you think about the durability of that, the revenue management side of it is really a function of the efforts we have done over the past several years around data-driven analysis to really make sure that we are targeting proper revenue rate for customers and then on the cost of supply, that's really representing the benefits of our diversified supply strategy and just a general better plant performance relative to history. On the C&I side, we are seeing margin expansion there, which we would also believe is terrible. As we know, there has been volatility in the market and customers are locking in higher revenue rates reflecting that volatility, and obviously, those contracts tend to be longer tenor and so that should also provide durability. And then lastly on the Smart Home side. As you saw with the KPIs, we are seeing margin expansion both on the revenue front and higher revenue per subscriber, as well as lower cost to serve as we continue to optimize that piece of the business, and again, given the long duration nature of those customers, we would expect that to also continue to be durable. So, all-in-all, higher expansion on the margin side with durability. Yeah. I would say, Shar, I think, we continue to remain focused on that conversion rate. I don't think it will be linear, because if you -- most of that conversion improvement is going to come from increasing the conversion at Vivint, right? And so if you remember, we provided some information that showed a free cash flow growth profile at Vivint going from $140 million to $445 million. by the end of 2025, so that's a pretty steep increase in the cash flow at Vivint which is really going to help to drive that conversion higher on a go-forward basis. Julien, I would just add that as you know, when you do an ASR, we obviously realize the vast majority of the shares having been bought in pretty much on an immediate basis, but it takes time for the banks to be able to go and purchase those shares properly. And so my guess is, we would probably anticipate that the program will be completed inside of the first quarter of next year. But to us, that's actually a pretty good situation because then that provides the ability to then roll into a regular way share of repurchase program related to our 2024 capital allocation plan to really continue to maintain the momentum on the repurchase front."

            "name": "Rasesh Patel",
            "content": "You bet. Angie, good morning. I think the results reflect the strong value proposition that we provide to consumers. If you think about 7% subscriber growth. We are also seeing an increase in the number of products each subscriber is actually taking into 5% growth in recurring revenue, simultaneously the cost-to-serve customers is down 19% on a unit basis year-over-year. And as you mentioned, one of the most powerful aspects of the value proposition is the near -- I think that a record-low attrition rate for us and this economy to have a nine-year customer life. When you bring these things together, combined with the fact that the average consumer is engaging with our products, 33% more than they were this time last year. It's a really robust flywheel that results in just improving customer lifetime value and so we feel really good about the business and we think there's a long runway ahead forward. Yeah. So, I will say, and we literally just finish a pilot where we are connecting our Smart Home technology to our commercial operations. So let me take a little bit of a step-back. We already cover residential demand response program on our traditional energy business and that is connected to the backbone of our commercial operations to make sure that we optimize the system. What we have been doing the last couple of weeks and then is to connect now the Smart Home technology platform to our commercial operations backbone. That was very successful. That's why I said that, we are accelerating those efforts and instead of being a five-plus-year opportunity, I see that as a three-plus-year opportunity. The improvements and investments that we need to do on the technology backbone is included in that 20% of growth, we are not going to increase that. What I am saying is that, there is the need and the -- by the consumer and quite candidly by the power grid to accelerate these efforts. So really, really good progress there, Angie."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKevin Cole: Thank you, Jana. Good morning and welcome to NRG Energy's second quarter 2023 earnings call. This morning's call will be 45 minutes in length and is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations and Webcast. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the safe harbor in today's presentation, as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's presentation. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's President and CEO.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone and thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm joined this morning by Bruce Chung, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions are other members of our management team including the heads of Home, Smart Home Business and Policy. Just over a month ago we held our Investor Day, where we provided an update on our long-term consumer strategy. We outlined the strength of our core energy business, how the acquisition of Vivint further enhances our energy platform and position us to capitalize on the convergence of electricity and smart technologies in the home. Today, I am going to focus on the results for the second quarter, starting on Slide 4 with our three key messages. First, our business delivered strong quarterly results and we are now trending towards the end \u2013 the high end of our 2023 EBITDA guidance range. Next, the Vivint Smart Home integration is well underway and we are realizing early wins in our combined sales efforts. Finally, we are executing on our consumer strategy to deliver significant value to our shareholders. Moving to the second quarter results on Slide 5. We delivered top decile safety performance and $819 million of adjusted EBITDA, a 112% increase from the same period last year, driven by excellent performance on our core energy business and the addition of Vivint Smart Home. Bruce will provide additional details on specific drivers but our business benefited from strong plant operations, our enhanced supply strategy, customer growth and favorable market conditions. During the quarter, we began the integration of Vivint Smart Home, which has yielded solid early results. Our revenue and cost synergy programs are well underway and we are reaffirming the full plan targets. As a result of early wins in our growth initiatives, we are increasing our 2023 growth target to $60 million, doubling our previous expectation. Finally, we hosted our Investor Day in June, which included our five-year strategic plan and an update on our capital allocation framework. As a result of the sale of South Texas Project and our revised capital allocation plan we are executing on a $2.7 billion share repurchase authorization and a $2.6 billion debt reduction plan. Through July we were able to complete $50 million of share repurchases and $200 million of debt reduction. As a result of the strong quarterly results and our position for the rest of the year we are reaffirming our 2023 financial guidance with our EBITDA currently trading at the higher end of the range. Now turning to Slide six for an update on our Energy business. ERCOT has experienced record peak demand this summer demonstrating robust load growth in our core Texas region on a weather-normalized basis. The electric grid has been stable through these record demand. During the quarter thermal and wind generation performed close to expected levels which kept our prices relatively muted. As I mentioned during Investor Day we implemented changes to our supply strategy that have worked well for us. We were more conservative on our plant operations and took additional maintenance outages that resulted in better performance from our fleet. We also purchased additional power above our expected low to give us more cushion against extreme weather. All of these have positioned us well this summer and for balance of the year. Parish Unit eight is in testing mode and expected to come back to full service by the end of this month. On the regulatory front the PUCT last week approved a much discussed bridge solution which establishes positive price floors at various levels of operating reserves. This eliminates negative pricing during many hours and should help existing dispatchable units. Looking forward ERCOT and the PUCT are moving ahead with the market design changes stemming from the recent legislative session. These changes were meant to increase reliability and incentivize new dispatchable generation. Key among these programs is PCM the Performance Credit Mechanism which will now go through our rule-making process prior to being implemented.  Another major program coming from the legislator was the Texas Energy Fund a program of low interest rate loans and completion bonuses for new generation. Prior to its implementation the Texas Energy Fund must first be approved as a ballot measure by the public in November election. On Slide 7 we are introducing our new scorecard for the growth and cost initiatives. These will be updated on a quarterly basis with our progress. I have been very impressed with the level of collaboration and integration between our Energy and Smart Home teams. During the Investor Day we discussed the makeup of our $300 million growth program 50% coming from organic growth at historical levels and 50% from cross-sell activities. For the quarter Energy and Smart Home grew at historical target levels and in line with our plan. For the cross-sell activities we have seen some early successes. As such we are increasing our growth target in 2023 from $30 million to $60 million. Our Energy and Smart Home call centers have begun transferring more leads to each other and we are seeing positive customer conversion rates on qualified leads of around 6%. And with the addition of the DIY system introduced during the quarter conversion rates are now moving closer to 10%, as this system is a good entry point to upsell and create more stickiness with the customer. One of the best examples of cross-selling and leveraging capabilities across NRG is the Vivint Protection Plan. This is an equipment protection plan that leverages NRG's current capabilities. Vivint launched this program in the second quarter, and we are already at 120,000 plans sold. This is a new revenue stream with very little cost. Our focus for the remainder of the year is to continue testing different bundles and offers before we scale it up in 2024. We are very encouraged on what we're seeing across the two businesses and the opportunities that are arising inside the home. One of the commitments during our Investor Day was to provide additional disclosures on our Vivint Smart Home business. On slide 8, we have provided key performance indicators, comparing quarter-over-quarter. As you can see, we have performed exceptionally well during the quarter, with subscribers growing 7% and recurring service margins up 9%. Our customers are engaging more with our platform and are staying for a longer period of time. Acquisition costs are higher due to the impact of higher interest rates and more products being sold, but they were more than offset by higher revenue on new subscribers. Overall, the profitability of the business is very strong. On the right-hand side is our Vivint Smart Home pro forma, free cash flow projection through 2025. Our target is to grow customer count in line with historical performance around 7%, while we continue to increase margin contribution and reduce overall cost of acquiring and servicing customers. We expect to more than triple the cash flow generator from the business over the next three years. It will provide NRG an earnings stream that is stable, predictable over a long period of time and importantly, diversified from our current Energy business. Turning to slide 9. Our Investor Day focused on our commitment to operating excellence, disciplined growth, and maximizing shareholder returns. I want to provide you some of the key highlights of the event. We outlined a three-part strategic plan to optimize our Integrated Energy model, grow Energy and Smart Home and increased return of capital, while achieving an investment-grade balance sheet. Our Integrated Energy model has evolved in the last seven years, providing more durable earnings. We have strengthened our supply portfolio with the right mix of assets to better serve our customer load. The recent sale of our interest in South Texas Project is a great example of our ability to optimize our platform and maximize shareholder value, through monetizing an asset whose attributes can be readily replicated and replaced in the market. At the same time, we are signing renewable PPAs and evaluating dispatchable capacity development projects, that better match our hedging needs. We outlined our growth program for Energy and Smart Home, capitalizing on the convergence of electricity and smart technologies inside the home. We are going to use Vivint Smart Home technology platform to connect all of our products and services into a seamless experience for our customers. These will result in higher customer lifetime value. Finally, we announced an update to our capital allocation framework with 80% of capital available for allocation now returned to shareholders. With the acquisition of Vivint complete, we have line of sight to the investment needs of the company going forward with growth investments using only 20% of capital available for allocation. Consistent with this change we increased our share repurchase authorization to $2.7 billion to be completed through 2025. We also accelerated the achievement of our investment-grade credit metrics targets to 2025. I will pass it over to Bruce for the financial review.\nBruce Chung: Thank you, Mauricio. NRG built on a solid first quarter with strong results in the second quarter that materially exceeded performance from last year. The company generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $819 million in the quarter, which is $433 million higher than the second quarter of 2022. As you can see in the chart at the bottom of the page, legacy NRG results once again included the impact of asset sales and retirements in the second quarter of 2022 totaling $30 million. The quarter also reflected $60 million of benefit compared to 2Q 2022 from the reversal of transitory items such as coal constraints and increased ancillary expenses. Strong performance in our core Energy business resulted in $186 million of uplift from the prior year. That uplift was driven by lower supply costs and improved plant performance relative to 2022. Finally, the remaining year-over-year increase to consolidated results is attributable to Vivint EBITDA of $217 million, which was not included in our 2022 results. Looking at our segments, and starting with Texas, adjusted EBITDA increased by $241 million versus the prior year on the back of higher gross margin of $273 million. As outlined earlier, meaningful unit margin expansion from lower supply costs, coupled with improved plant performance, were the primary drivers for the increase in gross margin. This increase in gross margin was partially offset by increased OpEx from the timing of planned outages and higher insurance premiums. In the East/West segment, adjusted EBITDA declined $25 million versus last year driven primarily by asset sales and retirements. Similar to Texas, gross margin increased year-over-year and lower power supply costs more than offset the negative impact of volume declines due to mild weather. In Q2, Vivint continued to deliver strong financial results contributing $217 million in adjusted EBITDA. Revenue grew 12% year-over-year driven by favorable retention and higher recurring monthly revenue per subscriber which combined with reductions in monthly service cost per customer drove a 14% increase in adjusted EBITDA compared to Q2 2022. Lastly, with average subscriber growth of 7% year-over-year, Vivint recently achieved a key milestone surpassing two million customers. NRG's free cash flow before growth for the quarter was $425 million, a year-over-year increase of $328 million, primarily driven by the increase in adjusted EBITDA. In addition to improved EBITDA, falling gas prices have reduced cash outflows for gas inventory that is typically built in the second quarter. Finally, building on our strong year-to-date results, we are reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth guidance for 2023. Now turning to Slide 12 for a brief update on our 2023 allocation, capital allocation. You will notice that the numbers shown on this slide align with the guidance we gave during our June Investor Day presentation. I would call your attention to the progress we have made so far on debt reduction and share repurchases. Through July 31st, we have paid down $200 million of debt and remain on track to complete our target of $1.4 billion in debt reduction for 2023. Additionally we executed $50 million of share repurchases in July as part of our $2.7 billion share repurchase authorization through 2025. Quickly turning to Slide 13. Our credit profile has not changed meaningfully since our last earnings call. As a result this slide has not substantially changed since our last update except for an update to the adjustments to capture the non-cash fulfillment amortization costs that are included in adjusted EBITDA as a result of the EBITDA harmonization we did last quarter. We remain on track to achieve our 2023 targeted leverage ratio and we reiterate our commitment to achieving investment-grade credit metrics by the end of 2025. Before turning it back to Mauricio, I wanted to be sure to augment his earlier comments regarding our commitment to enhance disclosure especially with respect to Vivint. As part of that commitment, you will see in the appendix of the presentation some new disclosure providing key metrics related to Vivint. We will continue to provide these key metrics on a quarterly basis and we look forward to working with you to help you understand how these metrics drive the financial results of the business. With that, I'll turn it back to you Mauricio.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you Bruce. Turning to Slide 15. I want to provide a few closing thoughts on our 2023 priority score card. As you can see, our team has remained focused on execution as evidenced by our strong results for the quarter. Our core energy business is well-positioned for the summer. The integration of Vivint is off to a good start and we're working towards closing the sale of STP by the end of the year. We will remain focused on executing our strategic plan that creates significant shareholder value. I look forward to updating you on our progress. So with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. Jana, we're now ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of BofA. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning, team. Thank you very much for the time. I appreciate it as always. Maybe just first off just -- thank you for all the details on Vivint. Can you talk a little bit about your 6% conversion rate in terms of -- here? Just how does that compare versus expectations, and just perhaps provide a little bit of context?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Sure. Good morning, Julien. So, in\u2026\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: \u2026of KPIs.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Right. So Julien in terms of the conversion rates, this is what we've been able to achieve on qualified leads so far. This is higher than what we expected. If you recall our cross-sell target was around a 3% penetration so this is above that. Obviously, this is early, but we're very encouraged by the success that we've had so far. This is Smart Home customers buying Energy and Energy buying Smart Home. With the addition of the DIY system that Vivint introduced we're actually seeing an increase on those conversion rates, because it allows us to have an entry point a cheaper entry point that we can use to up-sell and create more stickiness with the customers. So we're very, very encouraged by what we're seeing so far. At the same time, some of the secondary products like the Protection Plan from Vivint had tremendous success. And that's why when you combine all these with our organic growth we -- I felt compelled to increase our targets for 2023. So we are seeing results faster than what we expected initially. Very, very encouraging. \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you so much, again, really appreciate, over the phone. And then related can you talk a little bit about your commitment to building new generation in Texas? I mean, obviously, you want to see this corresponding support from the state here. Just where do we stand on that investment follow through? As well as just the ROFR or any potential commentary around the petition from your coders on STP? \nMauricio Gutierrez: So, let me start with the development projects. As you know, we have three development projects that are in late stages of development. I mean, one of them is short already. We have positioned ourselves to capitalize on the market design changes that ERCOT has put forward both in PCM and the new loan program. As I mentioned, we need more clarity on both of these fronts before we can actually move forward with these projects, but I am very pleased with how the team has positioned these projects and they're ready. This is exactly the type of generation exactly the right attributes that we need to manage our loan. This is mid-merit and peaking capacity, so loan following type of attributes. And I'm just very pleased that, the team has put us in this position to be able to make that decision. I think, your second question was around the claims of our partners at STP. Let me be very clear. We believe that, the claims are without merit and we expect to close the sale of our interest in STP by the end of the year.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And just to clarify, it says you're not committed yet on making the repowering investments here?\nMauricio Gutierrez: No not yet. \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: All right. Fair enough. I will leave it there. Thank you, guys.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Julien.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nShar Pourreza: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Good morning, Shar.\nShar Pourreza: Good morning. Just one on STP just a quick follow-up on Julien's question. If -- for instance if there is a delay and we have to book in this right? I mean, obviously, there's a level of confidence. We heard the prepared remarks. Could a delay impact anything on the capital allocation slide as we're thinking about it? So even on the buyback side assuming there could be a delay?\nA - Mauricio Gutierrez: Well, I mean, I'm not going to speculate on that. Like I said, the claims are without merit. Our plan is to close by the end of the year. I think is \u2013 and as we have done in the past, we will deploy capital when we have it, right? So right now our focus is on the share buyback and the debt reduction program that we have for 2023. As you saw, since we overperformed during the second quarter, we were able to allocate $50 million to share buybacks. If that overperformance continues, we will continue to allocate in capital to share buybacks until we have the \u2013 until we close the sale of STP, which is really an event that will increase substantially, the capital that we have available to redeploy.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. Okay. Perfect. And then Mauricio, you guys obviously booked some significant margin expansion this quarter. Could we just dig a little bit further into the $186 million, you're calling out? Maybe just both geographically, Texas versus East and/or by function. So does that also include near-term portfolio optimization with trading, or is it really true longer-term margin expansion? So put it all together how durable is that? Thanks.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes. Let me start, and then I'll pass it over to Bruce for the specifics. I think the team did just a fantastic job in managing margins, both in terms of revenue optimization and also the enhanced supply \u2013 diversified supply strategy that we have on our commercial team, allowed us to realize lower supply cost. So really, really good management all around and our plants performed as expected, which I think that's what we expect going forward but Bruce, any other additional details? \nBruce Chung: Yes, sure. So when you think about the $186 million, the preponderance of that really came out of Texas, not surprisingly as you think about year-over-year. With the improved plant performance, that's going to translate into a much better setup for us to be able to service our supply obligations appropriately. Just to give you a little bit of context, as you look at the power price landscape year-over-year between the two quarters, you'll see that around-the-clock prices in ERCOT were about 50% lower, which really helped us optimize how we service our load. And then to your point about the question on durability, look, the reality is as long as our plants perform, our margins should be durable and so that's what we continue to intend to do and continue to plan around. So on the East, there was a little bit of \u2013 there was some margin expansion as well on the C&I side. We have seen C&I customers sign up contracts at better margins for us, alongside the optimization activities that Mauricio had referred to. So overall, preponderance of it came from Texas but some amount in the East as well.\nShahriar Pourreza: Perfect. Fantastic job guys. I appreciate it. Have a good morning.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Shar.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Seaport. Please go ahead.\nAngie Storozynski: Thank you. Good morning. So you guys maintained the guidance range but is it fair to assume that you are tracking above the midpoint both from the EBITDA and free cash flow perspective? \nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes. Good morning, Angie. So yes we are keeping \u2013 we're affirming our guidance ranges at this point. I have indicated that we're trending toward the high-end of the guidance. Obviously, the third quarter is a very important quarter. We are well positioned for it, our plants are performing well, our supply strategy is working well for us, but we'll have an opportunity to update you on our results in the third quarter call. So far, I am very pleased with how the business has performed across all business segments: Generation Retail Smart Home. And -- but third quarter the summer is very important. Thus you appreciate given the extreme weather that we have seen. But so far, the business is performing very well.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. Moving on to the margin expansion on the retail side and I appreciate that most of it comes from Texas. But we've heard from some other retailers comments about the particular margin expansion for full requirement contracts. Remind us please if you actually have any of those? Probably more in the East, but again just -- I don't even recall.\nMauricio Gutierrez: I mean we have -- remember the full requirement is really C&I. We share C&I customers across Texas and the East. I think Bruce already mentioned that what we are seeing is higher margins because there is greater volatility in the market right both in Texas and in the East. So greater volatility means higher load following premiums which means higher margins on the customers. This is a trend that we are also seeing in our business and again, the changes that we made to our diversified supply strategy are working really well both for C&I, but also for residential customers.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And then on Vivint, why is there such a meaningful increase in the acquisition costs for customers?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yeah. So I mean the increase is twofold. Number one, you have higher interest rates. And then number two, the customers are buying more products and that's a really good thing. Now what you also should be able to see on the KPIs that we're providing you, our revenues are also higher. And by the way much higher than that increase so net-net is an increase on profitability. But Rasesh perhaps you want to just provide a little bit more color? \nRasesh Patel: Yeah. Thank you, Mauricio. You said it well. What we're seeing is customers are more engaged in buying more services in the home. I think you can see through the KPIs that the monthly recurring service margin per customer is up 9% and that's 9% across the entire customer base. When we look at our customer acquisition cohort, it's up more substantively than that and so you can think of this as the increased acquisition cost will drive over $250 of incremental revenue over the life of the customer. And so we feel very good about the engagement level and the margin expansion in the base.\nAngie Storozynski: Great. Thank you.\nMauricio Gutierrez : Thank you, Angie.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, team good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. \nMauricio Gutierrez: Hey, good morning, Durgesh.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning, Mauricio. You've answered all the other questions I had. Just maybe real quick, obviously, you're very confident in 2023 here. So Parish Unit 8 probably you don't see that as a meaningful impact, but the in-service is getting pushed. I think the last target was end of July, you moved it slightly to this month. Just can you talk to that what's going on there?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes. So I mean, we\u2019re seeing top the unit in middle of July. We are working right now through additional testing and as you can appreciate this was basically a rebuild of the entire generator. But I'm confident that we're going to come back end of August. In terms of planning, you're correct. We actually took all the necessary steps to manage our low in the market at really good economics. So I feel that even if Parish comes back at the end of the month, it's not going to have an impact on the guidance that we provided you today.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay. That's all I had. I appreciate the color. Thank you, Mauricio.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Durgesh.\nOperator: One moment for our next question please. Your next question comes from David Arcaro of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDavid Arcaro: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Good morning, David.\nDavid Arcaro: On the Smart Home business, I was wondering if you could speak to what the free cash flow before growth was for the quarter there, or any color on the free cash flow conversion you're seeing from EBITDA? Wondering how you're trending versus the full year $140 million pro forma target there?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Sure. Bruce?\nBruce Chung: Yeah, David. So as you know, we don't report free cash flow before growth for any individual segment of the company. But based on what we are seeing given the outperformance on the EBITDA side, we would expect to achieve the free cash flow before growth guidance that we had provided in our first quarter earnings call.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay, great. And then on the retail side of the -- Retail Energy side of the business, wondering if you could give an update on how customer retention and overall customer additions were trending in the quarter? And curious if you've seen any new entrants start to pop up particularly in ERCOT? And any, kind of, change in the competitive landscape there recently?\nMauricio Gutierrez: Sure. I'll pass it over to Elizabeth, but I will say that our KPIs on our Retail Energy business are pretty much in line with our expectation, including customer growth. But Elizabeth can you provide more details?\nElizabeth Killinger: Sure. Thanks David. We actually saw really strong customer retention rates consistent with last year's performance consistent with what we expected in the budget. And for customer acquisition, we have a little bit of overperformance for the quarter and we're really building that momentum to achieve that low single-digit customer growth between year-end 2022 and 2023. As far as competitive landscape, we see a normal healthy competitive market in Texas. It's pretty consistent that every year we'll see a new player add billboards in the market or start doing something different, but there isn't anything materially different. We do see competitors like Shell and others that are larger competitors, which we appreciate, because overall that strengthens the market. But our performance is strong and our leading digital experience and leading customer acquisition and retention help us win in the marketplace.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s really appreciated.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our last question. Our final question comes from Ryan Levine of Citi. Please go ahead.\nRyan Levine: Good morning.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Good morning, Ryan.\nRyan Levine: Good morning. What drove the monthly recurring net service cost per subscriber reduction by 22%? And was that largely in line with what you were anticipating, or is there any outsized movements this quarter?\nBruce Chung: Yes, Ryan. So, the primary drivers of that reduction, about 50% of that really is a function of fewer truck rolls and reduced supply chain constraints. We probably realized about 25% fewer truck rolls than we had in the past. The other 50% or the other 50% of the favorability really results from the ending of our payments to Alarm.com, which had started towards the -- towards the second half of last year.\nRyan Levine: Is Q2 '23 number more likely to continue on a go-forward basis, or are there any trends that we should look for as we look into forecast factors?\nBruce Chung: Yes. So Rasesh, why don't you take that one? \nRasesh Patel: Yes, you bet. We feel very good about where net service cost per subscriber is and we would expect the current rate at which we are to continue. The favorability we've seen is durable and it's a perfect thing when you see customers buying more products and you see higher penetration of your service, while simultaneously you see the cost to serve going down and that's exactly what's driving the margin expansion. And so, we feel really good about the trends and we think that is sustainable.\nRyan Levine: So, if I'm hearing you correctly, you continue to see fewer truck rolls and decreasing number of truck rolls on a go-forward basis as a driver, or am I misinterpreting that?\nRasesh Patel: That's right. So, you can see, if we think -- when you look at this on a per customer basis and we would expect to see this lower rate that we have achieved for both contact rate calls, as well as truck rolls to continue. We've recently started a virtual technician pilot, which really allows us to serve the customers' needs without ever rolling a truck and we're seeing very promising results from that. And so, this is sort of a new benchmark for the business.\nRyan Levine: Thanks for the clarity.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Ryan.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back to Mauricio Gutierrez, President and CEO for closing remarks.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Jana. And thank you everyone for your interest and your time today and I look forward to speaking with all of you in the days and weeks to come. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.",

I think is \u2013 and as we have done in the past, we will deploy capital when we have it, right? So right now our focus is on the share buyback and the debt reduction program that we have for 2023. As you saw, since we overperformed during the second quarter, we were able to allocate $50 million to share buybacks. If that overperformance continues, we will continue to allocate in capital to share buybacks until we have the \u2013 until we close the sale of STP, which is really an event that will increase substantially, the capital that we have available to redeploy."

            "name": "Mauricio Gutierrez",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone and thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm joined this morning by Bruce Chung, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions are other members of our management team including the heads of Home, Smart Home Business and Policy. Just over a month ago we held our Investor Day, where we provided an update on our long-term consumer strategy. We outlined the strength of our core energy business, how the acquisition of Vivint further enhances our energy platform and position us to capitalize on the convergence of electricity and smart technologies in the home. Today, I am going to focus on the results for the second quarter, starting on Slide 4 with our three key messages. First, our business delivered strong quarterly results and we are now trending towards the end \u2013 the high end of our 2023 EBITDA guidance range. Next, the Vivint Smart Home integration is well underway and we are realizing early wins in our combined sales efforts. Finally, we are executing on our consumer strategy to deliver significant value to our shareholders. Moving to the second quarter results on Slide 5. We delivered top decile safety performance and $819 million of adjusted EBITDA, a 112% increase from the same period last year, driven by excellent performance on our core energy business and the addition of Vivint Smart Home. Bruce will provide additional details on specific drivers but our business benefited from strong plant operations, our enhanced supply strategy, customer growth and favorable market conditions. During the quarter, we began the integration of Vivint Smart Home, which has yielded solid early results. Our revenue and cost synergy programs are well underway and we are reaffirming the full plan targets. As a result of early wins in our growth initiatives, we are increasing our 2023 growth target to $60 million, doubling our previous expectation. Finally, we hosted our Investor Day in June, which included our five-year strategic plan and an update on our capital allocation framework. As a result of the sale of South Texas Project and our revised capital allocation plan we are executing on a $2.7 billion share repurchase authorization and a $2.6 billion debt reduction plan. Through July we were able to complete $50 million of share repurchases and $200 million of debt reduction. As a result of the strong quarterly results and our position for the rest of the year we are reaffirming our 2023 financial guidance with our EBITDA currently trading at the higher end of the range. Now turning to Slide six for an update on our Energy business. ERCOT has experienced record peak demand this summer demonstrating robust load growth in our core Texas region on a weather-normalized basis. The electric grid has been stable through these record demand. During the quarter thermal and wind generation performed close to expected levels which kept our prices relatively muted. As I mentioned during Investor Day we implemented changes to our supply strategy that have worked well for us. We were more conservative on our plant operations and took additional maintenance outages that resulted in better performance from our fleet. We also purchased additional power above our expected low to give us more cushion against extreme weather. All of these have positioned us well this summer and for balance of the year. Parish Unit eight is in testing mode and expected to come back to full service by the end of this month. On the regulatory front the PUCT last week approved a much discussed bridge solution which establishes positive price floors at various levels of operating reserves. This eliminates negative pricing during many hours and should help existing dispatchable units. Looking forward ERCOT and the PUCT are moving ahead with the market design changes stemming from the recent legislative session. These changes were meant to increase reliability and incentivize new dispatchable generation. Key among these programs is PCM the Performance Credit Mechanism which will now go through our rule-making process prior to being implemented.  Another major program coming from the legislator was the Texas Energy Fund a program of low interest rate loans and completion bonuses for new generation. Prior to its implementation the Texas Energy Fund must first be approved as a ballot measure by the public in November election. On Slide 7 we are introducing our new scorecard for the growth and cost initiatives. These will be updated on a quarterly basis with our progress. I have been very impressed with the level of collaboration and integration between our Energy and Smart Home teams. During the Investor Day we discussed the makeup of our $300 million growth program 50% coming from organic growth at historical levels and 50% from cross-sell activities. For the quarter Energy and Smart Home grew at historical target levels and in line with our plan. For the cross-sell activities we have seen some early successes. As such we are increasing our growth target in 2023 from $30 million to $60 million. Our Energy and Smart Home call centers have begun transferring more leads to each other and we are seeing positive customer conversion rates on qualified leads of around 6%. And with the addition of the DIY system introduced during the quarter conversion rates are now moving closer to 10%, as this system is a good entry point to upsell and create more stickiness with the customer. One of the best examples of cross-selling and leveraging capabilities across NRG is the Vivint Protection Plan. This is an equipment protection plan that leverages NRG's current capabilities. Vivint launched this program in the second quarter, and we are already at 120,000 plans sold. This is a new revenue stream with very little cost. Our focus for the remainder of the year is to continue testing different bundles and offers before we scale it up in 2024. We are very encouraged on what we're seeing across the two businesses and the opportunities that are arising inside the home. One of the commitments during our Investor Day was to provide additional disclosures on our Vivint Smart Home business. On slide 8, we have provided key performance indicators, comparing quarter-over-quarter. As you can see, we have performed exceptionally well during the quarter, with subscribers growing 7% and recurring service margins up 9%. Our customers are engaging more with our platform and are staying for a longer period of time. Acquisition costs are higher due to the impact of higher interest rates and more products being sold, but they were more than offset by higher revenue on new subscribers. Overall, the profitability of the business is very strong. On the right-hand side is our Vivint Smart Home pro forma, free cash flow projection through 2025. Our target is to grow customer count in line with historical performance around 7%, while we continue to increase margin contribution and reduce overall cost of acquiring and servicing customers. We expect to more than triple the cash flow generator from the business over the next three years. It will provide NRG an earnings stream that is stable, predictable over a long period of time and importantly, diversified from our current Energy business. Turning to slide 9. Our Investor Day focused on our commitment to operating excellence, disciplined growth, and maximizing shareholder returns. I want to provide you some of the key highlights of the event. We outlined a three-part strategic plan to optimize our Integrated Energy model, grow Energy and Smart Home and increased return of capital, while achieving an investment-grade balance sheet. Our Integrated Energy model has evolved in the last seven years, providing more durable earnings. We have strengthened our supply portfolio with the right mix of assets to better serve our customer load. The recent sale of our interest in South Texas Project is a great example of our ability to optimize our platform and maximize shareholder value, through monetizing an asset whose attributes can be readily replicated and replaced in the market. At the same time, we are signing renewable PPAs and evaluating dispatchable capacity development projects, that better match our hedging needs. We outlined our growth program for Energy and Smart Home, capitalizing on the convergence of electricity and smart technologies inside the home. We are going to use Vivint Smart Home technology platform to connect all of our products and services into a seamless experience for our customers. These will result in higher customer lifetime value. Finally, we announced an update to our capital allocation framework with 80% of capital available for allocation now returned to shareholders. With the acquisition of Vivint complete, we have line of sight to the investment needs of the company going forward with growth investments using only 20% of capital available for allocation. Consistent with this change we increased our share repurchase authorization to $2.7 billion to be completed through 2025. We also accelerated the achievement of our investment-grade credit metrics targets to 2025. I will pass it over to Bruce for the financial review. Thank you Bruce. Turning to Slide 15. I want to provide a few closing thoughts on our 2023 priority score card. As you can see, our team has remained focused on execution as evidenced by our strong results for the quarter. Our core energy business is well-positioned for the summer. The integration of Vivint is off to a good start and we're working towards closing the sale of STP by the end of the year. We will remain focused on executing our strategic plan that creates significant shareholder value. I look forward to updating you on our progress. So with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. Jana, we're now ready to open the line for questions. Sure. Good morning, Julien. So, in... Right. So Julien in terms of the conversion rates, this is what we've been able to achieve on qualified leads so far. This is higher than what we expected. If you recall our cross-sell target was around a 3% penetration so this is above that. Obviously, this is early, but we're very encouraged by the success that we've had so far. This is Smart Home customers buying Energy and Energy buying Smart Home. With the addition of the DIY system that Vivint introduced we're actually seeing an increase on those conversion rates, because it allows us to have an entry point a cheaper entry point that we can use to up-sell and create more stickiness with the customers. So we're very, very encouraged by what we're seeing so far. At the same time, some of the secondary products like the Protection Plan from Vivint had tremendous success. And that's why when you combine all these with our organic growth we -- I felt compelled to increase our targets for 2023. So we are seeing results faster than what we expected initially. Very, very encouraging. So, let me start with the development projects. As you know, we have three development projects that are in late stages of development. I mean, one of them is short already. We have positioned ourselves to capitalize on the market design changes that ERCOT has put forward both in PCM and the new loan program. As I mentioned, we need more clarity on both of these fronts before we can actually move forward with these projects, but I am very pleased with how the team has positioned these projects and they're ready. This is exactly the type of generation exactly the right attributes that we need to manage our loan. This is mid-merit and peaking capacity, so loan following type of attributes. And I'm just very pleased that, the team has put us in this position to be able to make that decision. I think, your second question was around the claims of our partners at STP. Let me be very clear. We believe that, the claims are without merit and we expect to close the sale of our interest in STP by the end of the year. No not yet. Thank you, Julien. Good morning, Shar. Yes. Let me start, and then I'll pass it over to Bruce for the specifics. I think the team did just a fantastic job in managing margins, both in terms of revenue optimization and also the enhanced supply \u2013 diversified supply strategy that we have on our commercial team, allowed us to realize lower supply cost. So really, really good management all around and our plants performed as expected, which I think that's what we expect going forward but Bruce, any other additional details? Thank you, Shar. Yes. Good morning, Angie. So yes we are keeping \u2013 we're affirming our guidance ranges at this point. I have indicated that we're trending toward the high-end of the guidance. Obviously, the third quarter is a very important quarter. We are well positioned for it, our plants are performing well, our supply strategy is working well for us, but we'll have an opportunity to update you on our results in the third quarter call. So far, I am very pleased with how the business has performed across all business segments: Generation Retail Smart Home. And -- but third quarter the summer is very important. Thus you appreciate given the extreme weather that we have seen. But so far, the business is performing very well. I mean we have -- remember the full requirement is really C&I. We share C&I customers across Texas and the East. I think Bruce already mentioned that what we are seeing is higher margins because there is greater volatility in the market right both in Texas and in the East. So greater volatility means higher load following premiums which means higher margins on the customers. This is a trend that we are also seeing in our business and again, the changes that we made to our diversified supply strategy are working really well both for C&I, but also for residential customers. Yeah. So I mean the increase is twofold. Number one, you have higher interest rates. And then number two, the customers are buying more products and that's a really good thing. Now what you also should be able to see on the KPIs that we're providing you, our revenues are also higher. And by the way much higher than that increase so net-net is an increase on profitability. But Rasesh perhaps you want to just provide a little bit more color? Thank you, Angie. Hey, good morning, Durgesh. Yes. So I mean, we're seeing top the unit in middle of July. We are working right now through additional testing and as you can appreciate this was basically a rebuild of the entire generator. But I'm confident that we're going to come back end of August. In terms of planning, you're correct. We actually took all the necessary steps to manage our low in the market at really good economics. So I feel that even if Parish comes back at the end of the month, it's not going to have an impact on the guidance that we provided you today. Thank you, Durgesh. Good morning, David. Sure. Bruce? Sure. I'll pass it over to Elizabeth, but I will say that our KPIs on our Retail Energy business are pretty much in line with our expectation, including customer growth. But Elizabeth can you provide more details? Thank you. Good morning, Ryan. Thank you, Ryan. Thank you, Jana. And thank you everyone for your interest and your time today and I look forward to speaking with all of you in the days and weeks to come. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Mauricio. NRG built on a solid first quarter with strong results in the second quarter that materially exceeded performance from last year. The company generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $819 million in the quarter, which is $433 million higher than the second quarter of 2022. As you can see in the chart at the bottom of the page, legacy NRG results once again included the impact of asset sales and retirements in the second quarter of 2022 totaling $30 million. The quarter also reflected $60 million of benefit compared to 2Q 2022 from the reversal of transitory items such as coal constraints and increased ancillary expenses. Strong performance in our core Energy business resulted in $186 million of uplift from the prior year. That uplift was driven by lower supply costs and improved plant performance relative to 2022. Finally, the remaining year-over-year increase to consolidated results is attributable to Vivint EBITDA of $217 million, which was not included in our 2022 results. Looking at our segments, and starting with Texas, adjusted EBITDA increased by $241 million versus the prior year on the back of higher gross margin of $273 million. As outlined earlier, meaningful unit margin expansion from lower supply costs, coupled with improved plant performance, were the primary drivers for the increase in gross margin. This increase in gross margin was partially offset by increased OpEx from the timing of planned outages and higher insurance premiums. In the East/West segment, adjusted EBITDA declined $25 million versus last year driven primarily by asset sales and retirements. Similar to Texas, gross margin increased year-over-year and lower power supply costs more than offset the negative impact of volume declines due to mild weather. In Q2, Vivint continued to deliver strong financial results contributing $217 million in adjusted EBITDA. Revenue grew 12% year-over-year driven by favorable retention and higher recurring monthly revenue per subscriber which combined with reductions in monthly service cost per customer drove a 14% increase in adjusted EBITDA compared to Q2 2022. Lastly, with average subscriber growth of 7% year-over-year, Vivint recently achieved a key milestone surpassing two million customers. NRG's free cash flow before growth for the quarter was $425 million, a year-over-year increase of $328 million, primarily driven by the increase in adjusted EBITDA. In addition to improved EBITDA, falling gas prices have reduced cash outflows for gas inventory that is typically built in the second quarter. Finally, building on our strong year-to-date results, we are reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth guidance for 2023. Now turning to Slide 12 for a brief update on our 2023 allocation, capital allocation. You will notice that the numbers shown on this slide align with the guidance we gave during our June Investor Day presentation. I would call your attention to the progress we have made so far on debt reduction and share repurchases. Through July 31st, we have paid down $200 million of debt and remain on track to complete our target of $1.4 billion in debt reduction for 2023. Additionally we executed $50 million of share repurchases in July as part of our $2.7 billion share repurchase authorization through 2025. Quickly turning to Slide 13. Our credit profile has not changed meaningfully since our last earnings call. As a result this slide has not substantially changed since our last update except for an update to the adjustments to capture the non-cash fulfillment amortization costs that are included in adjusted EBITDA as a result of the EBITDA harmonization we did last quarter. We remain on track to achieve our 2023 targeted leverage ratio and we reiterate our commitment to achieving investment-grade credit metrics by the end of 2025. Before turning it back to Mauricio, I wanted to be sure to augment his earlier comments regarding our commitment to enhance disclosure especially with respect to Vivint. As part of that commitment, you will see in the appendix of the presentation some new disclosure providing key metrics related to Vivint. We will continue to provide these key metrics on a quarterly basis and we look forward to working with you to help you understand how these metrics drive the financial results of the business. With that, I'll turn it back to you Mauricio. Yes, sure. So when you think about the $186 million, the preponderance of that really came out of Texas, not surprisingly as you think about year-over-year. With the improved plant performance, that's going to translate into a much better setup for us to be able to service our supply obligations appropriately. Just to give you a little bit of context, as you look at the power price landscape year-over-year between the two quarters, you'll see that around-the-clock prices in ERCOT were about 50% lower, which really helped us optimize how we service our load. And then to your point about the question on durability, look, the reality is as long as our plants perform, our margins should be durable and so that's what we continue to intend to do and continue to plan around. So on the East, there was a little bit of \u2013 there was some margin expansion as well on the C&I side. We have seen C&I customers sign up contracts at better margins for us, alongside the optimization activities that Mauricio had referred to. So overall, preponderance of it came from Texas but some amount in the East as well. Yeah, David. So as you know, we don't report free cash flow before growth for any individual segment of the company. But based on what we are seeing given the outperformance on the EBITDA side, we would expect to achieve the free cash flow before growth guidance that we had provided in our first quarter earnings call. Yes, Ryan. So, the primary drivers of that reduction, about 50% of that really is a function of fewer truck rolls and reduced supply chain constraints. We probably realized about 25% fewer truck rolls than we had in the past. The other 50% or the other 50% of the favorability really results from the ending of our payments to Alarm.com, which had started towards the -- towards the second half of last year. Yes. So Rasesh, why don't you take that one?"
        },
        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Rasesh Patel",
            "content": "Yeah. Thank you, Mauricio. You said it well. What we're seeing is customers are more engaged in buying more services in the home. I think you can see through the KPIs that the monthly recurring service margin per customer is up 9% and that's 9% across the entire customer base. When we look at our customer acquisition cohort, it's up more substantively than that and so you can think of this as the increased acquisition cost will drive over $250 of incremental revenue over the life of the customer. And so we feel very good about the engagement level and the margin expansion in the base. Yes, you bet. We feel very good about where net service cost per subscriber is and we would expect the current rate at which we are to continue. The favorability we've seen is durable and it's a perfect thing when you see customers buying more products and you see higher penetration of your service, while simultaneously you see the cost to serve going down and that's exactly what's driving the margin expansion.

I'm joined this morning by Alberto Fornaro, Chief Financial Officer; and also on the call and available for questions are other members of our management team, including Rasesh Patel, Head of Vivint Smart Home. I'd like to start on slide four with the three key messages for today's presentation. First, our wholesale and retail businesses performed well during the first quarter and delivered strong financial results. We are focused on our core energy operations and have taken steps to make our platform more predictable and resilient. This brings me to my second point. We are seeing improving market fundamentals that should benefit our portfolio as we head into the summer. Finally, we completed the Vivint Smart Home acquisition and integration efforts have now begun in full. We are also updating our 2023 guidance ranges to account for this acquisition. Moving to the first quarter results on slide five. We delivered top decile safety performance and $646 million of adjusted EBITDA. This is a 28% improvement from last year when adjusted for asset sales and retirements. These results were driven primarily by strong operations in our core energy business, direct energy synergies and the addition of one month of Vivint earnings. During the quarter, we made good progress advancing our strategic priorities. We are on track to achieve the full synergy target for direct energy this year. We continue to be opportunistic on our portfolio optimization efforts with the sale of Astoria and we closed the Vivint acquisition in early March. Integration efforts for Vivint are now fully underway. Day one activities went well, and we have now defined the growth synergy target of $30 million for 2023. We will share additional details for the total program at our upcoming Investor Day. I want to take a moment and welcome the Vivint team to the NRG family. I continue to be impressed with the business and particularly the alignment in our corporate values that focuses on safety and customer experience. Finally, we are updating our 2023 guidance ranges to include Vivint and the alignment of adjusted EBITDA between our two companies. Alberto will unpack this in more detail, but let me provide you a quick overview. We're updating our full year guidance to $3.01 billion to $3.25 billion adjusted EBITDA, and $1.62 billion to $1.86 billion of free cash flow before growth. This includes 10 months of Vivint, expected growth and cost synergies for this year. This also reflects the harmonization of adjusted EBITDA to align both companies more with the consumer services industry. Excluding the impact of these changes, the traditional core energy business of NRG remains unchanged with previous stand-alone 2023 guidance ranges. Now, turning to slide 6. I want to provide a brief market update for Texas. We continue to see robust tenant demand growth on a weather-normalized basis north of 3%, driven by population growth and a strong state economy. We expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future. As you can see in the chart on the left-hand side of the slide, the first quarter was characterized by mild weather and much lower natural gas and power prices, which settled well below market expectations. This benefited our integrated platform by allowing us to bring down our power plants during periods of low prices and performed additional preventive maintenance, while buying power from the market cheaper than our own generation. This resulted in margin expansion fully offsetting lower weather-driven demand, and this is exactly our platform was designed to perform. Looking ahead to this summer, our portfolio is well positioned to deliver stable results. Supply chain constraints are for the most part behind us, and our power plants are ready to run as we progress on our second year of increased maintenance spend. We are also more conservative on our hedging and the operating assumptions we're using for our power plants. Importantly, WA Parish unit remains on track to return to service before the summer. As you can see, we have taken steps to make our portfolio more predictable. Finally, I want to provide a brief update on ERCOT market design enhancements. After considering many alternatives during 2022, the Public Utility Commission of Texas unanimously approved the performance credit mechanism or PCM. This is a market-based solution that is widely supported by competitive entities and regulators. The Texas legislature is currently reviewing the PCM and other enhancements. We expect market design resolution by the end of May with the Texas legislative session, concluding on May 29. We anticipate that PCM will take a few years to be implemented. In the interim, ERCOT and the PUCT are considering a bridge solution that enhances the operating reserve demand curve or ORDC to increase online reserves. We applaud the efforts by the governor, legislature, PUCT and ERCOT to improve the reliability of the grid through market-based solutions. We have several brownfield projects in various stages of development, but all of them will require regulatory certainty before they can move forward. Moving to slide 7. I want to provide an update on our consumer-facing businesses. Beginning with our Retail Energy & Services platform, margins were up year-over-year by 7%, driven by lower supply costs and stable customer count. This was somewhat offset by lower load due to mild weather during the quarter. In the East, we grew through our customer acquisition efforts to provide consumers an alternative to rising incumbent utility prices. We continue to see no material increase in bad debt, which is a direct result of the essential nature of the services we provide. Finally, we launched a modernized digital experience on our web and model app that enables customers to manage their energy usage and provide actionable insights that we are uniquely able to generate regarding uses of energy in their home for their EVs and through their solar solutions. While we have only owned Vivint for one month, I want to provide a full first quarter statistics for comparison. Vivint grew customers by 9% and revenue by 14% compared to the same period last year. Like NRG, Vivint continues to experience strong retention and stable bad debt. The company was also busy in the quarter, enhancing their products and introducing innovative offerings, two of which I want to highlight. First, the Vivint app now includes solar production beta so our customers can actively monitor their energy conservation and cost savings. Second, they introduced a do-it-yourself product called driven basics that makes it easy for owners and renters alike to get the starter system for less than $300. Having a viable DIY and single point solutions is key to our strategy of creating more entry points for customers that we can later upgrade to our fully integrated smart home offering. Now, with respect to synergies, we are reaffirming our cost and growth targets for both 2023 and the full plan. Cost synergies are primarily the result of the combination of two public companies and are expected to total $100 million in recurring run rate free cash flow before growth. Growth synergies of $300 million will be achieved through a target for cross-sell, Vivint organic growth and sales channel optimization. In total, we expect $400 million of recurring synergies to be achieved over the next three years. The synergy and integration plan is now fully underway and is led by the same team responsible for the transformation plan and the direct energy integration. On the right-hand side of the slide, you will see the scorecard for Vivint. We have now introduced 2023 growth targets and cost to achieve. We plan to update this scorecard in the coming quarters to provide further transparency and keep you informed on our progress. I know I have said this before, but we are very excited about the opportunities for the combined company moving forward. Vivint brings a complementary business that expands our customer network by nearly 40% and that smart home technology and infrastructure to strengthen our platform. Together, we create the leading essential home services provider in North America, serving a network of nearly 7.5 million customers, and the acquisition also accelerates the plan we laid out at our 2021 Investor Day and creates the opportunity to deliver significantly shareholder value. During the first three years of integration, this value will be created through both cost and growth synergies, which are laid out on the slide. In the medium and long-term, I see even more opportunity to create value through growing customer count nationally, increasing the average number of solutions per customer and materially extending the customer lifetime. So, with that, I will pass it over to Alberto for the financials review.\nAlberto Fornaro: Thank you, Mauricio. NRG experienced a good start to the year and delivered strong results during milder-than-expected weather conditions. We entered the winter season seeing high forward gas and power curves. Moderate weather and relatively geopolitical stability translated into much lower power volumes in Texas and in the East and much lower actual prices in most markets with the exception of California. Additionally, NRG liquidity has significantly improved due to global collateral requirements after the winter season and the proactive management of our collateral utilization. We also completed the acquisition of Vivint Smart Home and have included Vivint's March performance in our financial stake. Before we continue, let me provide a little bit more detail about Vivint. At close, the EBITDA metric for the two companies was not identical. Therefore, we have harmonized it. I will go into more detail in the guidance section, but please note that all figures, including prior year reflect a consistent EBITDA across segments. Let's go now to the first quarter results. NRG consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $647 million is $137 million higher than the first quarter of 2022. As you can see in the chart at the bottom of the page, Legacy Energy results include the anticipated negative impact of asset sales and retirements in the second quarter of 2022, totaling $30 million. On a like-to-like basis, Legacy Energy EBITDA increased by approximately $67 million. Last year, transitory items, including the Limestone Unit 1 extended outage, coal and chemical constraints and the temporary spike in ancillary costs impacted our profitability. Our Q1 2023 results show that these items have been fully recovered. We've also included Vivint March results in our first quarter financials, which contributed $73 million of additional EBITDA. The remaining $27 million increase is related to EBITDA harmonization. Going now to segment performance on the top left. Across the different geographical regions, we have in general experienced an expansion of unit margins that have been mitigated by lower volumes and usage. Starting with Texas, adjusted EBITDA increased by $43 million versus prior year and gross margin was $120 million higher. Opportunistic planned outages, insurance premium and pension cost increases and the return on bad debt to historical levels contributed to an increase in operating expenses compared to the first quarter of 2022. In the East, West & Services and Other segment, adjusted EBITDA declined $6 million versus last year, driven primarily by asset sales and retirement similar to Texas. Gross margin increased year-over-year, a lower power supply cost more than offset the negative impact of a volume decline. As said, we have included March results in our Q1 EBITDA, and these results were better than prior year on a comparable basis. While we are not reporting full Q1 quarterly results for Vivint, we are very encouraged by the results. On a standalone basis, all major KPIs, including profitability metrics, having improved compared to the prior year. We have begun integration in cross-selling activities and targets have been confirmed and are expected to be realized as planned.  Energy free cash flow before growth was $203 million, in line with our expectations impacted by milder temperatures that drove power purchases up and power generation down, thus increasing fuel inventory levels. We have identified the initiative to reduce inventories, but expect to defer any action until after the summer season. Lastly, on NRG balance sheet, cash collateral received by counterparties positive mark-to-market of the derivative portfolio and the account receivable and account payables are all trending down. This is an inversion of the trend that we have seen in the last six quarters. Let's move now to slide 10 to discuss the guidance for 2023. As mentioned, we are providing additional detail for adjusted EBITDA. Prior to the acquisition, NRG and Vivint accounted for items within adjusted EBITDA differently, and we are now harmonized what will be included in this metric going forward. Capitalized costs can be split into acquisition costs and fulfillment costs. The amortization of capital customer acquisition costs mostly sales commission paid by both NRG and Vivint will be excluded from adjusted EBITDA. The amortization of capitalized fulfillment costs, mostly Vivint product and installation expenses will no longer be excluded from adjusted EBITDA. Stock-based compensation expenses will also be excluded from adjusted EBITDA. There are no impacts to free cash flow. Moving to the world at the bottom of the page, Legacy Energy 2023 guidance is substantially unchanged compared to our Q3 earnings call. The only exception is a $120 million increase due to EBITDA harmonization. For Vivint, guidance includes pro forma 2022 EBITDA unchanged from December. This has been prorated for 10 months of owner fleet. We have added $65 million in expected 2023 synergies and growth, minus $35 million from the EBITDA harmonization. Overall, the net impact in 2023 is positive, and we have updated guidance accordingly. Free cash flow before guidance is simply the sum of the Legacy NRG guidance and the $110 million pro forma free cash flow number from December 2022. This has increased by the growth contribution and prorated for 10 months. As a reminder, the original 2022 pro forma free cash flow before growth for Vivint, included the free cash flow before growth, the impact of synergies and the additional interest on the acquisition debt. Lastly, the addition of Vivint to our guidance, we have incorporated a slightly higher range of plus or minus $120 million from the guidance midpoint on a consolidated basis. Now turning to slide 11 for a brief update on our 2023 capital allocation. Moving left to right with blue shading indicating updates. 2023 excess cash equals $1.999 billion. This includes roughly $250 million of excess cash for 2022, including $209 million in proceeds from the sale of Astoria, and the full year free cash flow below growth of $1.740 billion, inclusive of energy standalone guidance of $1.620 billion, plus $120 million provision. This also captured the expected impact of the additional debt finance. There is no change to the $500 million target of leverage neutral net inflow from asset sales. Moving on to cash utilized for Vivint. This includes the additional requirement of $100 million in the cash minimum balance, about $250 million of NRG cash utilization, net of Vivint cash, $545 million Vivint integration expenses and $900 million of expected debt reduction. Next, we have the remuneration of our equity holders and the dividend to the preferred issued in March. The allocation of cash to investments totaled about $190 million, including $90 million for growth initiatives. Now, moving to the far right bar. We expect a total of $506 million available for future allocation. This will fund the remaining share repurchase program upon full visibility of achieving our 2023 target credit methods, which are detailed in the next slide. Quickly turning to slide 12. We remain committed to a strong balance sheet. This slide does not substantially change since our last update, we just updated partially -- we updated a higher energy EBITDA, partially mitigated by lower adjustment and the slightly lower [indiscernible]. We are focused on achieving our 2023 target ready metrics, which include a leverage ratio approximately 3.2 times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, and we are on track for investment-grade credit metrics by later 2025 and 2026 through both debt reduction and growth. Back to you Mauricio.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Thank you, Alberto. Turning to slide 14. I want to provide a few closing thoughts on today's presentation. We delivered strong results for the first quarter and are well positioned for the balance of the year. With the Vivint acquisition complete, we turn our focus to integration, growth and synergies. Our efforts are well underway, and it is now all about execution. I look forward to providing you a comprehensive update on our home business and strategy at our upcoming Investor Day. So with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. Sean, we're now ready to open the lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And at this time, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning team. Thank you guys very much for the time. Appreciate it. Nicely done here.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Hey good morning, Julien.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning, Mauricio. Pleasure. Just wanted to follow up on the synergy scorecard here and just thinking through Vivint here. I mean you're laying out -- you've got the $300 million and $100 million in revenue and cost synergies, respectively. How do you think about that translating back to consolidated EBITDA for Vivint here again? And/or, how does that fit with the 12% to 15% FCF target as well? Just want to try to tie it out at least $225 million as best you can today, if we can be a little bit more specific.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Yes. So Julien, I'm assuming that you're talking about the target that we provide on our free cash flow per share that support 15% or 20% growth. And when you look at the EBITDA and free cash flow generation capability of NRG and then you lay on top of that, the $400 million of cost synergies and revenue synergies, we feel very confident that we're going to be on path to achieve that 15% to 20% free cash flow per share return. As a matter of fact, the acquisition of Vivint now gives us a little bit more control on achieving that. Remember, before we have tremendous financial flexibility, and we generate excess cash will be on what the traditional NRG needed, that we have used to reduce the denominator. The one variable that we cannot control there is at the price that we can buy back our stock. Now with the Vivint engine and the opportunity to create this $400 million of incremental value, we just increased the tools that we have to increase the numerator. And put more in control the achievement of this $12.50 that we have laid out for 2025. So I feel very comfortable that with what we laid out today and in previous calls that we are on track to achieving that $12.50 a share by 2025.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. So -- yeah, clearly 15% to 20%. And more to the point, as you think about layering on additional assumptions rolling out potentially updated guidance with this Analyst Day. Any initial thoughts on what else can be done with the Vivint platform to continue to grow it. I'll note that the commentary here at the outset is really focused on synergies. You talked about revenue and growth here in the first couple of years, how do you think about compounding that beyond the 2025 period that you're providing here today? Maybe any initial thoughts on how far you can go at this prospective Analyst Day.\nMauricio Gutierrez: Right. Well, the first thing that I will say is when I think about the Vivint business, there are three big leverages that we're going to be focused on, the Vivint business was high, had high leverage. It has a high acquisition cost and there was also an opportunity on the consumer financing. So these are three specific buckets that we're focused on optimizing. And for me, it creates an opportunity for value creation. Now right now, we're focused on optimizing the 7.5 million net worth customers that we have. We have opened the lines of communication across our sales channels we're going to continue to optimize them. We're going to -- we have introduced bundling. We now are doing cross-sell between our call centers and our digital assets. We are testing in the market bundle. So that is the focus right now. When I think about 2025 and beyond, it's really about how do we bring the energy experience that we currently have with the smart home experience that we have and we create a best-in-class product for customers that is going to drive the growth on 2025 and beyond. This is something that we're going to be talking more about on our Investor Day on how this vision comes together with the two offerings that we have one in energy, one in a smart home. So we will make it more tangible and real for all our investors at the upcoming investor.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Wonderful. All right. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you guys very much. Have a great day.\nMauricio Gutierrezk: Thank you, Julie.\nOperator: At this time, I would like to turn it back to Mauricio for closing comments.\nMauricio Gutierrezk: Okay. Well, thank you. Thank you for your interest in NRG. I look forward to hosting all of you in our upcoming Investor Day that we should have in early summer where we're going to be talking about the smart home strategy. We're going to provide additional details on our growth plan and provide you more transparency on our key performance indicators that will help you better model the business. So with that, I want to thank you for your interest and look forward to speaking with you soon. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program.",

            "name": "Mauricio Gutierrez",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm joined this morning by Alberto Fornaro, Chief Financial Officer; and also on the call and available for questions are other members of our management team, including Rasesh Patel, Head of Vivint Smart Home. I'd like to start on slide four with the three key messages for today's presentation. First, our wholesale and retail businesses performed well during the first quarter and delivered strong financial results. We are focused on our core energy operations and have taken steps to make our platform more predictable and resilient. This brings me to my second point. We are seeing improving market fundamentals that should benefit our portfolio as we head into the summer. Finally, we completed the Vivint Smart Home acquisition and integration efforts have now begun in full. We are also updating our 2023 guidance ranges to account for this acquisition. Moving to the first quarter results on slide five. We delivered top decile safety performance and $646 million of adjusted EBITDA. This is a 28% improvement from last year when adjusted for asset sales and retirements. These results were driven primarily by strong operations in our core energy business, direct energy synergies and the addition of one month of Vivint earnings. During the quarter, we made good progress advancing our strategic priorities. We are on track to achieve the full synergy target for direct energy this year. We continue to be opportunistic on our portfolio optimization efforts with the sale of Astoria and we closed the Vivint acquisition in early March. Integration efforts for Vivint are now fully underway. Day one activities went well, and we have now defined the growth synergy target of $30 million for 2023. We will share additional details for the total program at our upcoming Investor Day. I want to take a moment and welcome the Vivint team to the NRG family. I continue to be impressed with the business and particularly the alignment in our corporate values that focuses on safety and customer experience. Finally, we are updating our 2023 guidance ranges to include Vivint and the alignment of adjusted EBITDA between our two companies. Alberto will unpack this in more detail, but let me provide you a quick overview. We're updating our full year guidance to $3.01 billion to $3.25 billion adjusted EBITDA, and $1.62 billion to $1.86 billion of free cash flow before growth. This includes 10 months of Vivint, expected growth and cost synergies for this year. This also reflects the harmonization of adjusted EBITDA to align both companies more with the consumer services industry. Excluding the impact of these changes, the traditional core energy business of NRG remains unchanged with previous stand-alone 2023 guidance ranges. Now, turning to slide 6. I want to provide a brief market update for Texas. We continue to see robust tenant demand growth on a weather-normalized basis north of 3%, driven by population growth and a strong state economy. We expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future. As you can see in the chart on the left-hand side of the slide, the first quarter was characterized by mild weather and much lower natural gas and power prices, which settled well below market expectations. This benefited our integrated platform by allowing us to bring down our power plants during periods of low prices and performed additional preventive maintenance, while buying power from the market cheaper than our own generation. This resulted in margin expansion fully offsetting lower weather-driven demand, and this is exactly our platform was designed to perform. Looking ahead to this summer, our portfolio is well positioned to deliver stable results. Supply chain constraints are for the most part behind us, and our power plants are ready to run as we progress on our second year of increased maintenance spend. We are also more conservative on our hedging and the operating assumptions we're using for our power plants. Importantly, WA Parish unit remains on track to return to service before the summer. As you can see, we have taken steps to make our portfolio more predictable. Finally, I want to provide a brief update on ERCOT market design enhancements. After considering many alternatives during 2022, the Public Utility Commission of Texas unanimously approved the performance credit mechanism or PCM. This is a market-based solution that is widely supported by competitive entities and regulators. The Texas legislature is currently reviewing the PCM and other enhancements. We expect market design resolution by the end of May with the Texas legislative session, concluding on May 29. We anticipate that PCM will take a few years to be implemented. In the interim, ERCOT and the PUCT are considering a bridge solution that enhances the operating reserve demand curve or ORDC to increase online reserves. We applaud the efforts by the governor, legislature, PUCT and ERCOT to improve the reliability of the grid through market-based solutions. We have several brownfield projects in various stages of development, but all of them will require regulatory certainty before they can move forward. Moving to slide 7. I want to provide an update on our consumer-facing businesses. Beginning with our Retail Energy & Services platform, margins were up year-over-year by 7%, driven by lower supply costs and stable customer count. This was somewhat offset by lower load due to mild weather during the quarter. In the East, we grew through our customer acquisition efforts to provide consumers an alternative to rising incumbent utility prices. We continue to see no material increase in bad debt, which is a direct result of the essential nature of the services we provide. Finally, we launched a modernized digital experience on our web and model app that enables customers to manage their energy usage and provide actionable insights that we are uniquely able to generate regarding uses of energy in their home for their EVs and through their solar solutions. While we have only owned Vivint for one month, I want to provide a full first quarter statistics for comparison. Vivint grew customers by 9% and revenue by 14% compared to the same period last year. Like NRG, Vivint continues to experience strong retention and stable bad debt. The company was also busy in the quarter, enhancing their products and introducing innovative offerings, two of which I want to highlight. First, the Vivint app now includes solar production beta so our customers can actively monitor their energy conservation and cost savings. Second, they introduced a do-it-yourself product called driven basics that makes it easy for owners and renters alike to get the starter system for less than $300. Having a viable DIY and single point solutions is key to our strategy of creating more entry points for customers that we can later upgrade to our fully integrated smart home offering. Now, with respect to synergies, we are reaffirming our cost and growth targets for both 2023 and the full plan. Cost synergies are primarily the result of the combination of two public companies and are expected to total $100 million in recurring run rate free cash flow before growth. Growth synergies of $300 million will be achieved through a target for cross-sell, Vivint organic growth and sales channel optimization. In total, we expect $400 million of recurring synergies to be achieved over the next three years. The synergy and integration plan is now fully underway and is led by the same team responsible for the transformation plan and the direct energy integration. On the right-hand side of the slide, you will see the scorecard for Vivint. We have now introduced 2023 growth targets and cost to achieve. We plan to update this scorecard in the coming quarters to provide further transparency and keep you informed on our progress. I know I have said this before, but we are very excited about the opportunities for the combined company moving forward. Vivint brings a complementary business that expands our customer network by nearly 40% and that smart home technology and infrastructure to strengthen our platform. Together, we create the leading essential home services provider in North America, serving a network of nearly 7.5 million customers, and the acquisition also accelerates the plan we laid out at our 2021 Investor Day and creates the opportunity to deliver significantly shareholder value. During the first three years of integration, this value will be created through both cost and growth synergies, which are laid out on the slide. In the medium and long-term, I see even more opportunity to create value through growing customer count nationally, increasing the average number of solutions per customer and materially extending the customer lifetime. So, with that, I will pass it over to Alberto for the financials review. Thank you, Alberto. Turning to slide 14. I want to provide a few closing thoughts on today's presentation.

Moving to the world at the bottom of the page, Legacy Energy 2023 guidance is substantially unchanged compared to our Q3 earnings call. The only exception is a $120 million increase due to EBITDA harmonization. For Vivint, guidance includes pro forma 2022 EBITDA unchanged from December. This has been prorated for 10 months of owner fleet. We have added $65 million in expected 2023 synergies and growth, minus $35 million from the EBITDA harmonization. Overall, the net impact in 2023 is positive, and we have updated guidance accordingly. Free cash flow before guidance is simply the sum of the Legacy NRG guidance and the $110 million pro forma free cash flow number from December 2022. This has increased by the growth contribution and prorated for 10 months. As a reminder, the original 2022 pro forma free cash flow before growth for Vivint, included the free cash flow before growth, the impact of synergies and the additional interest on the acquisition debt. Lastly, the addition of Vivint to our guidance, we have incorporated a slightly higher range of plus or minus $120 million from the guidance midpoint on a consolidated basis. Now turning to slide 11 for a brief update on our 2023 capital allocation. Moving left to right with blue shading indicating updates. 2023 excess cash equals $1.999 billion. This includes roughly $250 million of excess cash for 2022, including $209 million in proceeds from the sale of Astoria, and the full year free cash flow below growth of $1.740 billion, inclusive of energy standalone guidance of $1.620 billion, plus $120 million provision. This also captured the expected impact of the additional debt finance. There is no change to the $500 million target of leverage neutral net inflow from asset sales. Moving on to cash utilized for Vivint. This includes the additional requirement of $100 million in the cash minimum balance, about $250 million of NRG cash utilization, net of Vivint cash, $545 million Vivint integration expenses and $900 million of expected debt reduction. Next, we have the remuneration of our equity holders and the dividend to the preferred issued in March. The allocation of cash to investments totaled about $190 million, including $90 million for growth initiatives. Now, moving to the far right bar. We expect a total of $506 million available for future allocation. This will fund the remaining share repurchase program upon full visibility of achieving our 2023 target credit methods, which are detailed in the next slide. Quickly turning to slide 12. We remain committed to a strong balance sheet. This slide does not substantially change since our last update, we just updated partially -- we updated a higher energy EBITDA, partially mitigated by lower adjustment and the slightly lower [indiscernible]. We are focused on achieving our 2023 target ready metrics, which include a leverage ratio approximately 3.2 times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, and we are on track for investment-grade credit metrics by later 2025 and 2026 through both debt reduction and growth. Back to you Mauricio."

After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's conference is being recorded. I will now hand the conference over to your speaker host, Kevin Cole, Head of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKevin Cole: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to NRG Energy's third quarter 2024 earnings call. This morning's call will be 45 minutes in length. It will be broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investor section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations and Webcasts. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based upon assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor in today's presentation, as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's presentation. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Larry Coben, NRG's Chair and CEO.\nLarry Coben: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm joined this morning by Bruce Chung, our CFO; and Rasesh Patel, Head of NRG Consumer, who will share an exciting update on our virtual Power Plant initiative. Other members of our management team are also on the call, and available to answer questions. Let's start with today's three messages as shown on slide four. First, our strong performance this year led us to raise our 2024 financial guidance by $175 million in late September, the second consecutive year we have surpassed our original earnings target. Today, we're reaffirming this elevated outlook for 2024 in initiating strong guidance for 2025. Second, we're excited to announce a strategic partnership with Renew Home and Google Cloud, supported by Google's AI platform to accelerate our Virtual Power Plant efforts. This partnership strengthens our ability to meet evolving customer needs, and marks the beginnings of our effort to scale VPP. Finally, we're enhancing our guidance framework by introducing adjusted EPS. We're also presenting a multiyear outlook supported by a new organic growth program, and highlighting additional opportunities to exceed those targets and drive further shareholder value. On slide five, let's review our 2024 performance and 2025 guidance. Our year-to-date results and increased guidance are driven by strong plant operations, effective supply risk management throughout the summer, margin growth across all of our business segments, and continued success in smart home. These results underscore the strength of our business model, and position us exceptionally well for the future. I'd also like to note that in response to investor feedback, we are now including all amortization costs related to Vivint Smart Home and retail home energy in the depreciation and amortization line of the income statement. Bruce will provide more details and clear disclosures on this change, which is non-cash and has no impact on our cash flow metrics or adjusted EPS. This updated enhances transparency and simplifies financial reporting and modeling for our shareholders. We're initiating 2025 guidance, now including adjusted EPS alongside our usual metric of adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth. For 2025, we expect adjusted EPS of $7.25, adjusted EBITDA of $3.85 billion, and free cash flow before growth of $2.1 billion. This reflects a 14% increase in adjusted EPS from our raised 2024 guidance, and a 28% increase from our initial 2024 guidance. Our 2025 guidance incorporates the achievement of our key 2023 Investor Day commitments; reaching $550 million in run rate synergies, achieving investment-grade credit metrics, and delivering 15% free cash flow before growth per share growth. This achievement is significant as our June 2023 projection of 15% to 20% free cash flow before growth per share growth was based on a 2025 share price of $46.00 or less than half today's trading price. Through operational improvement and excellence, accelerated growth and synergy achievement, we have stayed on and achieved this target. Today, we are also announcing that we are increasing our share repurchase authorization by an additional $1 billion. In short, 2024 has been an outstanding year, and 2025 will be even better. Market conditions are highly favorable. Our operations remain superb, and our outlook has never been stronger. It's an exciting time to be part of NRG. On slide six, with the introduction of adjusted EPS, we're presenting our multiyear growth outlook, targeting at least a 10% CAGR through 2029 based on our raised 2024 guidance. Staring from our original 2024 guidance, this raise would approach 13%, reflecting the extraordinary operations and opportunities in our business. To provide a clear view of our EPS drivers, we've divided this outlook into two categories; organic business earnings growth, and capital allocation. This business earnings portion only incorporates the organic growth plans of our core businesses, with no value added for such opportunities as the tightening of the Texas power market or datacenters. I will return to these additional opportunities shortly. Our long-term outlook includes an annualized $750 million in adjusted EBITDA organic growth through 2029, largely driven by our consumer businesses. Key drivers include customer growth in smart home, initiatives to increase home energy wallet share and advancements in our virtual power plant. We're also strategically expanding our commercial and industrial energy services footprint. In terms of capital allocation, we plan to return $8.8 billion to shareholders with $7.1 billion dedicated to share repurchases. Looking at potential opportunities to significantly exceed this outlook, we have not factored in any rise in Texas power prices, which we've held at $47 through 2029, despite expected market tightening from growing demand. We have provided growth sensitivities for your additional visibility into our gearing, and to allow our investors to reflect on, and sensitize their expectations. Our projections also include contributions from our 21 site development portfolio and two shovel-ready Texas brownfield projects that were not selected for the Texas Energy Fund. Each of these represents additional upside to our baseline growth expectations. I'll explore these elements in greater depth over the next two slides. Our long-term outlook emphasizes the strength of our platform and shows that we're well-positioned to capture emerging opportunities in our sector. Moving to slide seven, let's break down our $750 million growth plan, driven by disciplined investments and high-value initiatives. Our growth is expected in each of our primary businesses, around 30% from home energy, 50% from smart home, and 20% from commercial and industrial energy. In home energy, we're focused on leveraging our strong Texas market share to expand wallet with our customers. We have been testing a home essentials bundle that provides energy customers added value while increasing margin and retention and the results have been very encouraging. This initiative also enhances our ability to scale our virtual power plant offering. We will provide details of these initiatives later on in the presentation. For smart home, growth is driven primarily by continued customer base expansion, which we have a strong record of achieving historically. We will also attract a broader segment of customers through new and less expensive bundles. In Commercial and Industrial Energy and NRG business, we're enhancing our platform by incorporating AI into both sales and customer care, which will increase speed, improve service quality and reduce costs. We're also expanding in our existing markets by offering advanced products such as load management and reduced carbon options. Additionally, we're broadening our highly successful strategic client services for both electric and natural gas customers resulting in incrementally higher unit margins. To meet our $750 million annualized EBITDA target, we plan to invest up to $1.6 billion over the next five years. That's the total investment, implying return on investments approaching 50%. We expect these initiatives to convert to free cash flow before growth at a rate of approximately 90%. These initiatives align with our 80:20 capital allocation framework; reinforcing our commitment to you of disciplined high return growth. I'm very confident that we will meet and likely exceed these base targets. I look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. Now, let's look at some of our other opportunities on slide eight. On the left, we show our 2025 Texas generation open gross margin sensitivity to various around the clock power price scenarios. This analysis assumes stable natural gas prices and normal weather conditions. For further details on multiple hedging scenarios, please refer to the appendix. This highlights the substantial value potential of our Texas generation under different price scenarios. As markets tighten due to rising demand, previously uneconomic generation can become not only economic, but highly profitable. The table also highlights the asymmetrical nature of our gearing to power plight rise fluctuations. Texas remains the country's most attractive power market, drawing major demand growth. For instance, the largest Houston transmission company recently reported an 8 gigawatt queue of data center demand, a 700% increase from pre-summer levels. By comparison, northern Virginia, the largest U.S. data center market, has a total installed capacity of around half that. This demonstrates the kind of structural load growth in Texas that could drive significant value beyond our base case. On the right, we feature our portfolio of 21 development sites at current or former power plants, all located in competitive markets. These sites offer desirable attributes and key infrastructure, making them ideal for projects that prioritize speed to market. In Texas, we also continue to evaluate the best use for our two shovel-ready brownfield projects that total 1.1 gigawatts in capacity. Since they were not selected under the Texas Energy Fund's one asset per developer allocation, we have the flexibility to explore other value-enhancing options for these projects, such as directing them to hyperscalers. Together, these opportunities present two of the many high-quality tangible paths to creating additional value well beyond our baseline expectations. On slide nine, we outline what this means for the substantial cash generation we anticipate in the coming years. Our capital allocation plan balances disciplined growth with substantial capital returns to drive sustained value well into the future. Our growth initiatives exceed our hurdle rates, and we invest only where we see exceptional value. Importantly, these investments also exceed the implied return of repurchasing our own stock, which currently trades at a low teens free cash flow yield. That is an extraordinary value in my view. With that, let me turn it over to Rasesh Patel, the head of NRG Consumer, who will provide an exciting update on our virtual power plant initiatives.\nRasesh Patel: Thank you, Larry. Turning to slide 10, I am thrilled to announce our strategic partnership with Renew Home and Google to develop a 1 gigawatt residential virtual power plant or VPP in Texas. This partnership brings together leaders across the energy and consumer technology industries to develop an innovative energy management solution for NRG and our customers. Our intention is to combine NRG's consumer reach and supply management expertise with Renew Home's residential demand response capabilities and Google's advanced AI technology. This will enable us to deploy smart thermostats and other devices that will allow our customers to optimize their energy use and save money while enhancing the stability and flexibility of our supply strategy and the Texas grid. On slide 11, you will find the key components of our partnership. We will develop a compelling personalized energy management platform that provides near real-time dispatch of capacity at a fraction the cost of a generation plant. Renew Home will provide the demand response capabilities and will fund a significant portion of customer acquisition costs, minimizing NRG's capital outlay. This collaboration also positions NRG as the partner for all new Google Nest VPP enrollments in Texas. NRG will manage the customer relationship, experience, and dispatch of VPP events. As illustrated in the VPP capital efficiency metrics at the bottom left of the slide, this is an economically attractive approach to supplementing our generation portfolio. The upfront investment is roughly one tenth of a new peaker plant while delivering an IRR greater than 50%, which is significantly higher than traditional alternatives. On the right-hand side of the page, you can see our plan to scale this program with the goal of reaching 650 megawatts of dispatchable capacity by 2030 and a gigawatt by 2035. Now, let's turn to slide 12, where we outline our strategy for bringing the virtual power plant program to market with an exciting new offering. To accelerate our VPP efforts in Texas, we're introducing the Home Essentials bundle, which includes a Vivint Smart Thermostat, doorbell camera, and professional installation, all provided at no cost to customers enrolled in a VPP plan, as long as they remain an NRG Energy customer. Should they choose to leave, they can continue to receive the smart home services for a monthly fee of $14.99, allowing customers to continue enjoying the benefits of smart home while protecting our investment in their experience. We have tested this new value proposition with select energy customers in Texas, and the results have been very encouraging. In our pilot, we're seeing strong adoption of this offer and a step change in customer engagement with the average household using our smart home app more than 160 times per month. Moreover, 20% of these customers have opted to purchase additional smart home products and services that generate incremental recurring revenue. Over time, we see this bundle becoming a powerful entry point that will deliver enhanced value to customers, build scale for VPP, and encourage customers to explore a broader suite of smart home services. We are leveraging our strong market share in Texas to expand our share of wallet with customers with Renew Home co-funding up to $150 of customer acquisition costs through our VPP partnership. This go-to-market strategy focuses on making smart energy solutions accessible, valuable, and deeply engaging. We're meeting our customers where they are, with solutions that empower them to take control of their home and energy experiences while strengthening their relationship with NRG. We will make home-based essentials broadly available in Texas spring 2025. Moving to slide 13, let's take a closer look at how our virtual power plant generates value and delivers strong economics through two distinct value streams, consumer and supply. On the consumer side, where we retain 100% of the economic benefits, we expect margin uplift and increased tenure for customers adopting the Home Based Essentials Bundle, as well as incremental recurring revenue from customers opting for additional smart home services. The home energy industry, relative to other consumer services, has elevated customer churn, and we expect this initiative to improve customer retention due to the enhanced value, engagement, and savings from this integrated offering. On the supply side, where we retain over half the economic benefit, we've provided an illustrated breakdown that shows how VPP creates margin opportunity based on the number of events per summer and the implied in the money power price. Beyond direct value, this asset also provides critical risk mitigation, allowing us to dispatch the VPP to further stabilize our supply portfolio during periods of volatility. At scale, for a 650-megawatt VPP, we anticipate approximately $110 million in annual recurring margin for NRG, $80 million from consumer value, and $30 million from supply value. Looking ahead to a 1-gigawatt VPP, we project the total annual incremental margin to exceed $160 million, making VPP a highly profitable and flexible asset that strengthens both our financial and operational resilience. If Texas supply becomes more constrained in the coming years, as many expect, the value to NRG and our customers will only increase. I look forward to keeping you updated on our progress as we execute this plan. With that, I will turn it over to Bruce to provide the financial review.\nBruce Chung: Thank you, Rasesh. Before I discuss our third quarter results, I'd like to provide a few updates on our key financial performance and valuation metrics. As you can see on the slide, we are introducing adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share as part of our reporting framework. These metrics offer additional context for NRG's profitability and growth, capturing both underlying business growth driven by investment into our platform, as well as the impact of our robust capital allocation program. For 2024, we are on track to deliver $1.3 billion of adjusted net income, equivalent to $6.35 per share of adjusted EPS. The midpoint of our raised adjusted EPS guidance represents a 12% increase over the midpoint of our original guidance, reflecting the strong business performance. We are pleased to provide these additional tools for investors to use in their evaluation of the investment merits of NRG. We believe these new metrics, coupled with our preexisting metrics, such as free cash flow before growth per share, will continue to shine a spotlight on NRG's attractive valuation. We will continue to provide adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth alongside these two new disclosures for the foreseeable future. Going forward and including today's third quarter results, adjusted EBITDA has been updated to recast all amortization of capitalized customer acquisition costs from SG&A and cost of operations into the depreciation amortization line item. This change addresses a point of common confusion that investors have given us direct feedback on. This is part of our ongoing commitment to provide better visibility into our businesses and simplify the modeling process. More details are available in our 10Q, as well as in the Reg G tables appended to this presentation and this morning's press release. As you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, this change results in an upward adjustment to the midpoint of our 2024 guidance by $130 million from $3.56 billion to $3.73 billion. We have accordingly recast adjusted EBITDA for historical periods to conform with this methodology and to allow for direct comparison of our results across reporting periods. This is simply a geography change of non-cash items and therefore has no impact on any of our reported free cash flow before growth or adjusted EPS metrics and outlook. Turning to slide 16, NRG delivered another strong quarter of financial and operational performance with adjusted EBITDA of $1.055 billion, an increase of $68 million over the third quarter of the prior year. Texas delivered $584 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, $32 million higher than Q3 of 2023. When adjusted for asset sales executed in 2023, our outperformance was approximately $80 million. This improvement reflects the strength and resilience of our integrated platform. Unlike last year, Texas was marked by a lack of power price volatility and generally lower pricing despite warm temperatures. Our integrated supply strategy and the ability to turn off units during periods of low pricing enabled us to maximize margins as we served our retail load. The ability to cycle our plans on and off as part of our overall supply strategy is what gives us confidence in delivering consistent financial results through a variety of market conditions. Our east, west, and services segments also demonstrated improved year-over-year outperformance. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $214 million, representing an $18 million increase from the prior year. This improvement was primarily driven by lower power and natural gas supply costs resulting in margin expansion and an increase in average customer counts of 7%. Finally, our smart home segment delivered $257 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, an $18 million increase from the prior year. This was driven by mid-single-digit growth in our subscriber count and continued net service margin expansion of 6%, reflecting the embedded operating leverage of the business as the subscriber base continues to grow. As you can see on the table, we have added disclosures for adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. For the third quarter, NRG produced $393 million of adjusted net income, equivalent to $1.90 of earnings per share. This represents a 21% increase over Q3 2023 results, primarily driven by higher gross margin and share of purchases. Free cash flow before growth for the quarter was $815 million, a $460 million increase over Q3 2023. This reflects higher gross margin, favorable working capital, and lower CapEx given the completion of the Parish restoration work in 2023. Lastly, we are reaffirming our revised 2024 financial guidance and have provided our guidance ranges across all the key reporting metrics, including adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. Turning to 2024 capital allocation on slide 17, we continue to deliver on our capital allocation priorities. There are only a few minor changes to the capital allocation waterfall from our second quarter earnings call. On our last earnings call, we announced an agreement to sell our Airtron HVAC business. That transaction closed in late September. As a result, we are updating the net cash proceeds from the Airtron sale to approximately $425 million. We are also increasing free cash flow before growth by $100 million. For liability management preferred dividends, we've reduced our 2024 allocation to $420 million from $602 million. Our aggressive debt reduction over the past few years, coupled with improved financial performance, will result in achieving our target credit metrics by the end of 2024, a full-year earlier than originally intended. As a result, we have reduced the amount of liability management we had intended to pursue in 2024 and have reallocated that cash to our remaining unallocated CAFA. We have increased our share repurchase total from $825 million to $925 million, which reflects the increase in our 2024 FCFbG guidance. Through October 31, we completed $544 million of repurchases, and we expect to complete the remaining repurchases by year-end. Inclusive of our year-to-date activity, we have executed over $3.8 billion in share repurchases at an average price of around $50 since 2019, representing nearly 30% of our shares outstanding. In our other investments, we have allocated $122 million for other growth, including updated spend associated with our ERCOT New Build project. Finally, we expect to end 2024 with approximately $605 million of unallocated capital, which we have rolled into 2025 for application towards continued share buyback programs. Turning to the next slide, we are excited to introduce our financial guidance for 2025. We are guiding 2025 full-year adjusted EBITDA to a range of $3.725 to $3.975 billion, representing a midpoint of $3.85 billion, or an 8% increase from our original 2024 guidance midpoint. As you can see from the chart at the bottom, this is driven by the completion of our previously announced growth and cost synergy programs, margin expansion from higher power prices, and partly offset by the loss EBITDA from the sale of Airtron. We are also guiding 2025 full-year free cash flow before growth to a range of $1.975 billion to $2.225 billion, representing a mid-point of $2.1 billion, also an 8% increase over the midpoint of our original 2024 guidance. In addition to adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth, we are initiating guidance for adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share. For full-year 2025, we are initiating guidance on adjusted net income to a range of $1.33 billion to $1.53 billion, representing a midpoint of $1.43 billion, and a range of 675 to 775 for adjusted EPS, representing a midpoint of $7.25 per share. Moving to the next slide, we are providing a five-year roadmap with the major drivers of our adjusted EPS and free cash flow before growth investment outlook on a per-share basis. As you can see on the slide, we are targeting long-term adjusted EPS and FCFbG per share growth of greater than 10%. These growth rates are pegged against our recently increased 2024 guidance. More modeling disclosures can be found in the appendix of today's presentation. Our five-year outlook is underpinned by visible organic growth resulting in $750 million of incremental run rate adjusted EBITDA and a robust capital return program of nearly $9 billion over the 2025 to 2029 period. I'd also highlight that this five-year outlook assumes flat power pricing and does not include any of the additional upside opportunities Larry touched on earlier. As you can see on the slide, our organic growth plan and share of purchases comprise nearly $4 of EPS growth and nearly $6.50 of FCFbG per share growth. Offsetting this growth is an increase in taxes as available tax credits expire in 2025 and as NRG continues to generate strong earnings that utilize its NOL balance. In addition to taxes, we are projecting the impact of higher interest costs on earnings and free cash flow growth as maturing low-cost debt is refinanced at higher rates. Turning to 2025 capital allocation on the next slide and starting on the left side of the chart, we are showing approximately $2.7 billion of cash available for allocation, which includes the carryover amounts from 2024. As I have already noted, we will achieve our target credit metrics earlier than originally forecasted. And as such, our liability management program in 2025 will be comprised of selling the convertible note hedge and preferred stock dividends. As you can see, the primary focus of our 2025 capital allocation activity will continue to be share purchases with $1.36 billion planned for 2025. Together with the planned 8% increase in the common dividend to $1.76 per share, our total return of capital is currently expected to be about 85% of CAFA after liability management and integration costs. Importantly, for those keeping a scorecard, we're on track to significantly exceed the original return of capital commitment shared as part of our 2023 Investor Day, with more than $4.5 billion to be returned from 2023 through 2025. Given our outstanding performance relative to the 2023 Investor Day plan, our Board of Directors approved an increase in total authorization for repurchases from $2.7 billion to $3.7 billion. As of October 31, approximately $2 billion is remaining under the total authorization inclusive of this increase. In 2025, we have allocated $165 million to other investment, which includes continued progress on our ERCOT new build program, and investment in near-term actionable initiatives related to our long-term organic growth plan. Finally, we are showing $235 million of unallocated capital, which we will allocate over the course of 2025. With that, I'll turn it back to you, Larry.\nLarry Coben: Thank you, Bruce. Turning to slide 22, we provided you today a detailed view of our compelling five-year financial outlook enhanced with additional disclosures for clear insights into our earnings and growth trajectory. Our plan is simple, transparent, and backed by durable recurring cash flows and a strong balance sheet. We're confident in achieving our long-term targets of at least 10% growth in adjusted EPS and free cash flow before growth per share, with numerous opportunities to significantly exceed these goals. In closing, on slide 23, 2024 has been another year of strong execution, where we have delivered financial, operation, and capital allocation results well ahead of guidance and expectations. I'm exceptionally proud of the work of our 18,000 employees across all of our organization who have driven these results. I'm deeply committed to driving NRG forward to creating additional significant shareholder value. We are seeing a long-term step change improvement in fundamentals across our platform. You can expect a continued and remaining heightened focus on operational excellence, prudent growth, and being good stewards of our investors' capital. I have never been more excited about the potential of NRG than I am today. Thank you for your time and continued interest. Operator, we're now ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from the line of Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open.\nShahriar Pourreza: Hey, guys, good morning.\nLarry Coben: Morning, Shahriar, how are you?\nShahriar Pourreza: All right. Quite an update, Larry, quite an update. Let me just start just, I want to touch on the process around the sites. Some of your peers this week mentioned portfolio approaches to hyperscaler deals. You have the ability to provide a degree of additionality with the gas units. Is it still your plan to update the Street in January, and how are you seeing -- are you seeing more interest in one region versus the other? Thanks.\nLarry Coben: Yes, and yes -- no, sorry, Shahriar.\nShahriar Pourreza: [Multiple Speakers] -- before, by the way.\nLarry Coben: It worked.\nShahriar Pourreza: I got tongue-tied for the first time.\nLarry Coben: No, we are -- so, we are going to provide an update, as we said, by the fourth quarter call. And we're seeing a lot of interest across our sites, both in PJM and in Texas, both in portfolio approaches and in individual approaches. Look, I think it's a very complex process, rapidly changing. We're still figuring out exactly it is that we want. And I think by stepping back, as we did, and now diving back in, we're really in a position to optimize the value of what we have, so still super-excited. We've done a lot more site analysis, as you can see in the appendix here. And we look forward to updating you when that time comes.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. And then, as we get more disclosures, you plan on layering in the optionality into the numbers through time or how do we get an update --\nLarry Coben: Yes, I mean I think as we know what the numbers are, we will layer them in. Now, remember how we talked about before some of this may be things that we never ever disclosed because someone comes to us and they want an extra 1,000 megs of something, and then we decide we're going to build the plant and some hyperscalers may or may not want those two events tied together. So, one of the ways that you may see that we're doing this is all of a sudden raising our estimates, raising our CAGR, all of those kind of things rather than one-off announcements. Could go either way, but that's where you'll see it.\nShahriar Pourreza: All right, perfect. And then, just lastly, coming back to sort of the identified growth component of the plan, appreciate obviously the breakdowns between the segments through '29. Some of these are obviously familiar to investors like the C&I margin, customer counts, but some aren't. Where do you see kind of the most room for variability within these three verticals? And then, any color on cost to achieve? Appreciate it, guys.\nLarry Coben: Sure. Look, I think we've put out a plan that we're really excited to and feeling really good about signing up for. And I think we see bias to the upside across all of these things. I mean, if there's a world recession or something, are people going to move less and maybe purchase less energy or fewer smart home? Anything is possible same in the industrial sector. But we feel really good, Shar, about what we've signed up here for. And to achieve this $750 million of annualized EBITDA over the next five years, we're going to invest $1.6 billion in total. So, that's the cost to achieve.\nShahriar Pourreza: Perfect. I appreciate it guys. Congrats on the results and it's good to see that Bruce was busy. Appreciate it.\nLarry Coben: Once a year whether he needs to or not, Shar. Thank you, Shar.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is coming from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, Larry, team. Good morning, guys. Nice to chat. Just following up a little bit on -- hey, good, good, good, pleasure guys; nicely done. Maybe just following up a little bit on what Shar picked you on first here. Let me needle you a little further on this in terms of, just the update timeline and more specifically what that could look like as you think about, what to set expectations around. Should we say January or otherwise here, right? Is it principally are your efforts geared principally towards this additionality and leveraging those two additional sites, or are you still thinking it seems earlier that you were principally focused on the Midwest portfolio, the site value there? We've seen a lot of excitement in the Midwest. Is that more of where we should be thinking about again? I know there's 20 plus sites here. Tell me what permutation may be.\nLarry Coben: Julien, I think it's both. I mean, I think what's happened is we were obviously still laser focused on the 21 sites and we remain so. But when the TEF decided that they were only going to give one loan per customer as they did that we felt for us that opened up the additionality potential for those two shovel ready projects. And so, we kind of just put them into the mix post the TEF announcement which was around the end of August you'll recall. And there's I think a fair amount of interest because as you know, I think you've written about additionality is going to be critical going forward to the development of these kind of sites and to have shovel ready additionality is rare.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. Yes, indeed. And actually just to clarify that even, with respect to TEF, would you expect TEF part 2 here to include those sites here? I mean, is sort of the idea to double dip, if you will, between TEF and additionality next year potentially with the customer?\nLarry Coben: We haven't put out any guidance at all about TEF II. We don't know if it's going to occur. So, we're going to push forward right now as if there is no TEF II for those projects. But if that shows up, obviously that's one option that we will consider. I don't know that you'll be able to double dip. We'll have to wait and see what the rules are. But we don't need to double dip to make those very attractive to somebody who's looking for additionality.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. Okay, excellent. Thank you. And VPP, out of that $1.6 billion I think, how much does it cost you to do the VPP? I think you said $100 a kilowatt, so it's like $65 million for the 650 kilowatt?\nLarry Coben: Yes, Julien, one of the unique things about VPP is we don't have to wait to get the benefit as we acquire customers and put the assets to work. We actually start to realize the value. And so, think of it as, we ramp up investment, and it stays below $50 million for us because we start to gain benefits from the deployed assets.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: All right. Excellent, guys. Thank you so much. All the best.\nLarry Coben: Thanks, Julien. Talk to you later.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent, guys. Thank you so much. All the best.\nLarry Coben: Thank you, Julien. Talk to you later.\nOperator: Thank you. Now, our next question is coming from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Your line is now open.\nAngie Storozynski: Thank you. It's kind of funny that all these questions are focused on what else do you have to say, even though the entire call was filled with announcements.\nLarry Coben: Well said, Angie.\nAngie Storozynski: Anyway, the bar is set really high, I guess. So, my question is about the VPP, Virtual Power Plant. So, we're seeing some cooling off in, like, battery investments in Texas, right? I mean, there is this realization that existing batteries are starting to cannibalize on peak power prices and that eats into the pricing arbitrage that these batteries rely on. And so, why shouldn't the same be true for the VPP? And I understand that the biggest component of the profitability of this business is basically customer retention, so the energy component is relatively small, but why shouldn't that be true that in a sense, the curve gets sort of flatter and your ability to actually capture this additional energy benefit is lower?\nRob Gaudette: Hey, Angie, it's Rob, and great observation. What I would tell you or remind you is, because we serve consumer energy customers, we're always building our portfolio and we're including that component that I've called insurance, right, the options on the back end. What VPP does is it self-provides that, right? So as we think about the customer and as we think about how we insure against an extreme event, the beauty of VPP is it is the perfect hedge for that kind of exposure. So, when I look out the curve and as we're building the portfolio over time, what VPP does is it helps me manage the risks of a consumer energy business without having to go to a third-party or dropping a lot of money to build massive peakers to meet that same obligation. So, I feel really good about the economics that we've got here and as far as the long-term perspective, this is absolutely the best tool to manage the risk of a home-based energy book. Does that help?\nAngie Storozynski: Okay, so basically it's the most cost-effective way to hedge against spikes and super peaks, right? I mean --\nRob Gaudette: Absolutely.\nAngie Storozynski: Not that we've seen it, and that's my other question, is that we -- I mean, keep hearing those incredible announcements. It's almost hard to even believe that they can be said with a straight face, right, 80 gigs of load in Texas from non-core. I mean, and yet the curve is just not reacting at all. It's almost as if -- and again, could it be that this load is not going to impact '28 or even '29, and that's why we're not seeing any response or how can you actually reconcile the lack of response in forward power curves in Texas?\nRob Gaudette: Yes, so I look at both of those things. And what I would tell you is that I am with you. I don't believe that the curve reflects the load that we expect or the supply-demand picture that we would expect in the future. As far as how we think about it and whether or not it's going to show up, I believe that the load is coming. I don't know if it's 80 gigs and honestly, we don't need 80 gigs. But part of the curve, remember, in the reaction inside of pricing is pretty short-sighted viewing or just looking a little bit into history. This summer was a little less warm than last year. We didn't have any real price formation like we did last year, and then everybody kind of lost sight of what could happen. If you look into the future and you think about, okay, well, if you just add a little bit of incremental load into the ERCOT market, you have a real opportunity giving a renewables profile and call it just abnormal weather to really get price formation. And then, everybody will be excited again and the curves will go to the moon and we'll be managing through it. You've seen this before. We've all seen it. I just don't think that these curves in '28, '29 and beyond reflect reality.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And the last question. So, maybe to both Bruce and Larry, so is there a free cash flow yield that below which you think that the share buybacks are just unwarranted and there is some other way of capital return or maybe M&A or some other strategy change?\nLarry Coben: Angie, there is one, but I don't think we're anywhere close to it. I mean, we're still in the double digits. So, when we get to the mid-single digits, maybe we can have that kind of a look again, depending on what the opportunities in the world looks like. But right now, given the undervaluation of the stock, it's still a pretty high hurdle rate for us. But we all look forward to the day, and I'm sure you do too, that when the stock is trading so high that that becomes a real question for us.\nAngie Storozynski: Yes, to infinity and beyond. Okay. Thank you.\nLarry Coben: To infinity and beyond.\nAngie Storozynski: Thank you.\nRasesh Patel: Thank you, Angie.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is coming from the line of Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nMichael Sullivan: Hey, good morning.\nLarry Coben: Good morning. How are you?\nMichael Sullivan: Good, good. Congrats on all the announcements here. Just, I know, so you gave this 10% plus and said it can vary year-to-year, but just to clarify, does that mean you can go below it, below 10% in some years, or it's just going to be 10% or better in every year and how much better can vary?\nLarry Coben: Yes, I mean, Mike, I think the reality is there may be some years where it might go below, there might be some years where it's going to go above, but generally speaking on a long-term basis, we see visibility around that plus 10% over the long-term.\nMichael Sullivan: Okay. And just specifically on that, so if we go to slide 19 with the tax impact, does that all fall away in '26? So should we think of like '26 as being a lower year and then you kind of catch back up again in the out year or?\nLarry Coben: I mean, there is an incremental increase in the tax rate after '25 because of expiring tax credits. I think the way that we think about that growth is to the extent that there's a drag as a result of an incrementally higher tax rate, we probably see some business performance and business growth offsetting that drag.\nMichael Sullivan: Okay, great. And then, yes, the VPP announcement, good to see there, and maybe just -- is it fair to kind of bifurcate it as you broke out the 80 million component as being more stable and then locked in, and then that 30 million component, it looks like would have been a lot better in '23 if you get a summer like that, and then if we got this summer, maybe wouldn't have been around that level. Is that fair?\nRasesh Patel: Hey, Michael. This is Rasesh. Yes, that's a good way to think about it. The customer value is going to be stable and very sustainable. The supply value, which Rob can add a little more color on, that can be significantly higher in years of tighter markets. And so, I think that's the right way to think about it. Rob, would you add anything?\nRob Gaudette: Yes, so the thing I would have you think about from the supply perspective, remember that we're using this in lieu of some form of insurance, right? So the values on the page represents what it would cost me, right? On the top part of the slide, this is what we would have, this is what we save by not having to go and replace this with a heat rate call option or something like that, the representation down at the bottom where we talk about the different years. So, in '23, the value of that insurance would have been considerably more valuable than say this year, where we didn't have any real price formation. But when you think about it long-term with NRG and how we build it in the portfolio, I'm going to buy that insurance regardless. So, I'm building the book 12 to 18 months out. We're putting in the insurance to protect our business. And so, we're going to capture the values up at the top. And then, the representation at the bottom is just the value that, that protected me from, right? So, I bought insurance in '23. It was really valuable. I bought insurance this year, and I didn't need it. That's the examples at the bottom. So, the value that we see around VPP is consistent year, every year, regardless of the circumstances, because I'm going to buy that insurance to protect the portfolio anyway. Does that make sense?\nMichael Sullivan: It does. Thanks, Rob. That's really helpful. Okay. And the last one, just to round it out there too, I mean, it's pretty sizable. Can you maybe just give us a sense of, are there any competitors out there or other people looking to do this or how big does that VPP market get in Texas overall, outside of what you were doing?\nLarry Coben: That's a great question. And one of the reasons I think NRG is so uniquely positioned is we have a skilled customer base. We have the supply management expertise. And now partnering with Renew Home and Google, we're partnered with the largest demand response platform in North America. The partnership also gives us exclusivity to all new Nest thermostat enrollments and to demand response in Texas. And to give you context around that, there are already a million Nest thermostats deployed in ERCOT, almost 300,000 of which are overlapped with the NRG customer base. And so, this is a very unique opportunity for NRG. And two, everything that we've outlined today is showing you the thermostat opportunity. But we will be working with our partners to tie in batteries, electric vehicles, other things onto the platform where we can leverage already deployed resources into this platform. And so, Michael, I think it'd be very hard for anybody else to replicate this at scale.\nMichael Sullivan: Okay, awesome. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nDavid Arcaro: Hey, thanks so much. Good morning.\nLarry Coben: Hi, David. How are you?\nDavid Arcaro: Good, good. Hey, I was wondering if there's an organic growth kind of opportunity at the retail energy business that could be potential upside from here. How is that incorporated in there? I mean, it seems like we're seeing pretty good residential growth in Texas over time, plus all of the C&I growth potential from new data center load. I didn't really see that maybe clearly called out as one of the components of the EBITDA growth opportunity. So, wondering how you're thinking about that?\nRasesh Patel: Yes. It's a great question. The way I would really think about this is we have very strong market share on the residential energy side in Texas. Nearly 40% share of the market. And so, the larger opportunity we see is how do we leverage that household relationship to actually expand share of wallet with customers. And through the launch of Homes Base Essentials, we're giving our existing skilled customer base a lot of incremental value. And in the trial that we've seen over the summer, where we've provided customers this new bundle, 20% of them have already bought incremental smart home services from us. And that's very attractive. So, I would just characterize that as there will be opportunity, obviously, with modest household growth. But, the larger opportunity for NRG is to expand the share of wallet, leveraging the near 40% market share we have in home energy.\nDavid Arcaro: Yes, got you. Absolutely. Makes sense. And maybe on that data center side, is there growth coming to your service territory that would boost the commercial and industrial side of the business in terms of retail contract opportunities and retail growth? Are you seeing data centers show up in the retail business coming to you with multi-year energy contract opportunities?\nLarry Coben: Short answer is yes. We are definitely seeing data centers coming with long-term contract requirements. And then, the way to think about how it affects the rest of the C&I marketplace is that in a market where there's growing tightness and there's competition for those megawatts, I've said it before and we've talked about it, there's a flight to quality that occurs amongst large industrials and commercial customers where they want additional service. They want skilled operators on the other side of their contracts. And so, we see an uplift into our opportunity set as we see this trend continue in ERCOT and honestly in PJM.\nDavid Arcaro: Got it. Okay, great. Thanks so much.\nLarry Coben: Yes, sir.\nRasesh Patel: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'm showing up for the questions in the queue at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Larry Coben for any closing remarks.\nLarry Coben: I want to thank you all for your interest in NRG. As you can tell from our releases, our slides, and our presentation, we are all super excited about our business. And, we look forward to keeping you up-to-date on it going forward. Have a great day and have a great weekend.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Larry Coben",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm joined this morning by Bruce Chung, our CFO; and Rasesh Patel, Head of NRG Consumer, who will share an exciting update on our virtual Power Plant initiative. Other members of our management team are also on the call, and available to answer questions. Let's start with today's three messages as shown on slide four. First, our strong performance this year led us to raise our 2024 financial guidance by $175 million in late September, the second consecutive year we have surpassed our original earnings target. Today, we're reaffirming this elevated outlook for 2024 in initiating strong guidance for 2025. Second, we're excited to announce a strategic partnership with Renew Home and Google Cloud, supported by Google's AI platform to accelerate our Virtual Power Plant efforts. This partnership strengthens our ability to meet evolving customer needs, and marks the beginnings of our effort to scale VPP. Finally, we're enhancing our guidance framework by introducing adjusted EPS. We're also presenting a multiyear outlook supported by a new organic growth program, and highlighting additional opportunities to exceed those targets and drive further shareholder value. On slide five, let's review our 2024 performance and 2025 guidance. Our year-to-date results and increased guidance are driven by strong plant operations, effective supply risk management throughout the summer, margin growth across all of our business segments, and continued success in smart home. These results underscore the strength of our business model, and position us exceptionally well for the future. I'd also like to note that in response to investor feedback, we are now including all amortization costs related to Vivint Smart Home and retail home energy in the depreciation and amortization line of the income statement. Bruce will provide more details and clear disclosures on this change, which is non-cash and has no impact on our cash flow metrics or adjusted EPS. This updated enhances transparency and simplifies financial reporting and modeling for our shareholders. We're initiating 2025 guidance, now including adjusted EPS alongside our usual metric of adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth. For 2025, we expect adjusted EPS of $7.25, adjusted EBITDA of $3.85 billion, and free cash flow before growth of $2.1 billion. This reflects a 14% increase in adjusted EPS from our raised 2024 guidance, and a 28% increase from our initial 2024 guidance. Our 2025 guidance incorporates the achievement of our key 2023 Investor Day commitments; reaching $550 million in run rate synergies, achieving investment-grade credit metrics, and delivering 15% free cash flow before growth per share growth. This achievement is significant as our June 2023 projection of 15% to 20% free cash flow before growth per share growth was based on a 2025 share price of $46.00 or less than half today's trading price. Through operational improvement and excellence, accelerated growth and synergy achievement, we have stayed on and achieved this target. Today, we are also announcing that we are increasing our share repurchase authorization by an additional $1 billion. In short, 2024 has been an outstanding year, and 2025 will be even better. Market conditions are highly favorable. Our operations remain superb, and our outlook has never been stronger. It's an exciting time to be part of NRG. On slide six, with the introduction of adjusted EPS, we're presenting our multiyear growth outlook, targeting at least a 10% CAGR through 2029 based on our raised 2024 guidance. Staring from our original 2024 guidance, this raise would approach 13%, reflecting the extraordinary operations and opportunities in our business. To provide a clear view of our EPS drivers, we've divided this outlook into two categories; organic business earnings growth, and capital allocation. This business earnings portion only incorporates the organic growth plans of our core businesses, with no value added for such opportunities as the tightening of the Texas power market or datacenters. I will return to these additional opportunities shortly. Our long-term outlook includes an annualized $750 million in adjusted EBITDA organic growth through 2029, largely driven by our consumer businesses. Key drivers include customer growth in smart home, initiatives to increase home energy wallet share and advancements in our virtual power plant. We're also strategically expanding our commercial and industrial energy services footprint. In terms of capital allocation, we plan to return $8.8 billion to shareholders with $7.1 billion dedicated to share repurchases. Looking at potential opportunities to significantly exceed this outlook, we have not factored in any rise in Texas power prices, which we've held at $47 through 2029, despite expected market tightening from growing demand. We have provided growth sensitivities for your additional visibility into our gearing, and to allow our investors to reflect on, and sensitize their expectations. Our projections also include contributions from our 21 site development portfolio and two shovel-ready Texas brownfield projects that were not selected for the Texas Energy Fund. Each of these represents additional upside to our baseline growth expectations. I'll explore these elements in greater depth over the next two slides. Our long-term outlook emphasizes the strength of our platform and shows that we're well-positioned to capture emerging opportunities in our sector. Moving to slide seven, let's break down our $750 million growth plan, driven by disciplined investments and high-value initiatives. Our growth is expected in each of our primary businesses, around 30% from home energy, 50% from smart home, and 20% from commercial and industrial energy. In home energy, we're focused on leveraging our strong Texas market share to expand wallet with our customers. We have been testing a home essentials bundle that provides energy customers added value while increasing margin and retention and the results have been very encouraging. This initiative also enhances our ability to scale our virtual power plant offering. We will provide details of these initiatives later on in the presentation. For smart home, growth is driven primarily by continued customer base expansion, which we have a strong record of achieving historically. We will also attract a broader segment of customers through new and less expensive bundles. In Commercial and Industrial Energy and NRG business, we're enhancing our platform by incorporating AI into both sales and customer care, which will increase speed, improve service quality and reduce costs. We're also expanding in our existing markets by offering advanced products such as load management and reduced carbon options. Additionally, we're broadening our highly successful strategic client services for both electric and natural gas customers resulting in incrementally higher unit margins. To meet our $750 million annualized EBITDA target, we plan to invest up to $1.6 billion over the next five years. That's the total investment, implying return on investments approaching 50%. We expect these initiatives to convert to free cash flow before growth at a rate of approximately 90%. These initiatives align with our 80:20 capital allocation framework; reinforcing our commitment to you of disciplined high return growth. I'm very confident that we will meet and likely exceed these base targets. I look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. Now, let's look at some of our other opportunities on slide eight. On the left, we show our 2025 Texas generation open gross margin sensitivity to various around the clock power price scenarios. This analysis assumes stable natural gas prices and normal weather conditions. For further details on multiple hedging scenarios, please refer to the appendix. This highlights the substantial value potential of our Texas generation under different price scenarios. As markets tighten due to rising demand, previously uneconomic generation can become not only economic, but highly profitable. The table also highlights the asymmetrical nature of our gearing to power plight rise fluctuations. Texas remains the country's most attractive power market, drawing major demand growth. For instance, the largest Houston transmission company recently reported an 8 gigawatt queue of data center demand, a 700% increase from pre-summer levels. By comparison, northern Virginia, the largest U.S. data center market, has a total installed capacity of around half that. This demonstrates the kind of structural load growth in Texas that could drive significant value beyond our base case. On the right, we feature our portfolio of 21 development sites at current or former power plants, all located in competitive markets. These sites offer desirable attributes and key infrastructure, making them ideal for projects that prioritize speed to market. In Texas, we also continue to evaluate the best use for our two shovel-ready brownfield projects that total 1.1 gigawatts in capacity. Since they were not selected under the Texas Energy Fund's one asset per developer allocation, we have the flexibility to explore other value-enhancing options for these projects, such as directing them to hyperscalers. Together, these opportunities present two of the many high-quality tangible paths to creating additional value well beyond our baseline expectations. On slide nine, we outline what this means for the substantial cash generation we anticipate in the coming years. Our capital allocation plan balances disciplined growth with substantial capital returns to drive sustained value well into the future. Our growth initiatives exceed our hurdle rates, and we invest only where we see exceptional value. Importantly, these investments also exceed the implied return of repurchasing our own stock, which currently trades at a low teens free cash flow yield. That is an extraordinary value in my view. With that, let me turn it over to Rasesh Patel, the head of NRG Consumer, who will provide an exciting update on our virtual power plant initiatives. Thank you, Bruce. Turning to slide 22, we provided you today a detailed view of our compelling five-year financial outlook enhanced with additional disclosures for clear insights into our earnings and growth trajectory. Our plan is simple, transparent, and backed by durable recurring cash flows and a strong balance sheet. We're confident in achieving our long-term targets of at least 10% growth in adjusted EPS and free cash flow before growth per share, with numerous opportunities to significantly exceed these goals. In closing, on slide 23, 2024 has been another year of strong execution, where we have delivered financial, operation, and capital allocation results well ahead of guidance and expectations. I'm exceptionally proud of the work of our 18,000 employees across all of our organization who have driven these results. I'm deeply committed to driving NRG forward to creating additional significant shareholder value. We are seeing a long-term step change improvement in fundamentals across our platform. You can expect a continued and remaining heightened focus on operational excellence, prudent growth, and being good stewards of our investors' capital. I have never been more excited about the potential of NRG than I am today. Thank you for your time and continued interest. Operator, we're now ready to open the line for questions. Morning, Shahriar, how are you? Yes, and yes -- no, sorry, Shahriar. It worked. No, we are -- so, we are going to provide an update, as we said, by the fourth quarter call. And we're seeing a lot of interest across our sites, both in PJM and in Texas, both in portfolio approaches and in individual approaches. Look, I think it's a very complex process, rapidly changing. We're still figuring out exactly it is that we want. And I think by stepping back, as we did, and now diving back in, we're really in a position to optimize the value of what we have, so still super-excited. We've done a lot more site analysis, as you can see in the appendix here. And we look forward to updating you when that time comes. Yes, I mean I think as we know what the numbers are, we will layer them in. Now, remember how we talked about before some of this may be things that we never ever disclosed because someone comes to us and they want an extra 1,000 megs of something, and then we decide we're going to build the plant and some hyperscalers may or may not want those two events tied together. So, one of the ways that you may see that we're doing this is all of a sudden raising our estimates, raising our CAGR, all of those kind of things rather than one-off announcements. Could go either way, but that's where you'll see it. Sure. Look, I think we've put out a plan that we're really excited to and feeling really good about signing up for. And I think we see bias to the upside across all of these things. I mean, if there's a world recession or something, are people going to move less and maybe purchase less energy or fewer smart home? Anything is possible same in the industrial sector. But we feel really good, Shar, about what we've signed up here for. And to achieve this $750 million of annualized EBITDA over the next five years, we're going to invest $1.6 billion in total. So, that's the cost to achieve. Once a year whether he needs to or not, Shar. Thank you, Shar. Julien, I think it's both. I mean, I think what's happened is we were obviously still laser focused on the 21 sites and we remain so. But when the TEF decided that they were only going to give one loan per customer as they did that we felt for us that opened up the additionality potential for those two shovel ready projects. And so, we kind of just put them into the mix post the TEF announcement which was around the end of August you'll recall. And there's I think a fair amount of interest because as you know, I think you've written about additionality is going to be critical going forward to the development of these kind of sites and to have shovel ready additionality is rare. We haven't put out any guidance at all about TEF II. We don't know if it's going to occur. So, we're going to push forward right now as if there is no TEF II for those projects. But if that shows up, obviously that's one option that we will consider. I don't know that you'll be able to double dip. We'll have to wait and see what the rules are. But we don't need to double dip to make those very attractive to somebody who's looking for additionality. Yes, Julien, one of the unique things about VPP is we don't have to wait to get the benefit as we acquire customers and put the assets to work. We actually start to realize the value. And so, think of it as, we ramp up investment, and it stays below $50 million for us because we start to gain benefits from the deployed assets. Thanks, Julien. Talk to you later. Thank you, Julien. Talk to you later. Well said, Angie. Angie, there is one, but I don't think we're anywhere close to it. I mean, we're still in the double digits. So, when we get to the mid-single digits, maybe we can have that kind of a look again, depending on what the opportunities in the world looks like. But right now, given the undervaluation of the stock, it's still a pretty high hurdle rate for us. But we all look forward to the day, and I'm sure you do too, that when the stock is trading so high that that becomes a real question for us. To infinity and beyond. Good morning. How are you? Yes, I mean, Mike, I think the reality is there may be some years where it might go below, there might be some years where it's going to go above, but generally speaking on a long-term basis, we see visibility around that plus 10% over the long-term. I mean, there is an incremental increase in the tax rate after '25 because of expiring tax credits. I think the way that we think about that growth is to the extent that there's a drag as a result of an incrementally higher tax rate, we probably see some business performance and business growth offsetting that drag. That's a great question. And one of the reasons I think NRG is so uniquely positioned is we have a skilled customer base. We have the supply management expertise. And now partnering with Renew Home and Google, we're partnered with the largest demand response platform in North America. The partnership also gives us exclusivity to all new Nest thermostat enrollments and to demand response in Texas. And to give you context around that, there are already a million Nest thermostats deployed in ERCOT, almost 300,000 of which are overlapped with the NRG customer base. And so, this is a very unique opportunity for NRG. And two, everything that we've outlined today is showing you the thermostat opportunity. But we will be working with our partners to tie in batteries, electric vehicles, other things onto the platform where we can leverage already deployed resources into this platform. And so, Michael, I think it'd be very hard for anybody else to replicate this at scale. Hi, David. How are you? Short answer is yes. We are definitely seeing data centers coming with long-term contract requirements. And then, the way to think about how it affects the rest of the C&I marketplace is that in a market where there's growing tightness and there's competition for those megawatts, I've said it before and we've talked about it, there's a flight to quality that occurs amongst large industrials and commercial customers where they want additional service. They want skilled operators on the other side of their contracts. And so, we see an uplift into our opportunity set as we see this trend continue in ERCOT and honestly in PJM. Yes, sir. I want to thank you all for your interest in NRG. As you can tell from our releases, our slides, and our presentation, we are all super excited about our business. And, we look forward to keeping you up-to-date on it going forward. Have a great day and have a great weekend."

            "name": "Bruce Chung",
            "content": "Thank you, Rasesh. Before I discuss our third quarter results, I'd like to provide a few updates on our key financial performance and valuation metrics. As you can see on the slide, we are introducing adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share as part of our reporting framework. These metrics offer additional context for NRG's profitability and growth, capturing both underlying business growth driven by investment into our platform, as well as the impact of our robust capital allocation program. For 2024, we are on track to deliver $1.3 billion of adjusted net income, equivalent to $6.35 per share of adjusted EPS. The midpoint of our raised adjusted EPS guidance represents a 12% increase over the midpoint of our original guidance, reflecting the strong business performance. We are pleased to provide these additional tools for investors to use in their evaluation of the investment merits of NRG. We believe these new metrics, coupled with our preexisting metrics, such as free cash flow before growth per share, will continue to shine a spotlight on NRG's attractive valuation. We will continue to provide adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth alongside these two new disclosures for the foreseeable future. Going forward and including today's third quarter results, adjusted EBITDA has been updated to recast all amortization of capitalized customer acquisition costs from SG&A and cost of operations into the depreciation amortization line item. This change addresses a point of common confusion that investors have given us direct feedback on. This is part of our ongoing commitment to provide better visibility into our businesses and simplify the modeling process. More details are available in our 10Q, as well as in the Reg G tables appended to this presentation and this morning's press release. As you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, this change results in an upward adjustment to the midpoint of our 2024 guidance by $130 million from $3.56 billion to $3.73 billion. We have accordingly recast adjusted EBITDA for historical periods to conform with this methodology and to allow for direct comparison of our results across reporting periods. This is simply a geography change of non-cash items and therefore has no impact on any of our reported free cash flow before growth or adjusted EPS metrics and outlook. Turning to slide 16, NRG delivered another strong quarter of financial and operational performance with adjusted EBITDA of $1.055 billion, an increase of $68 million over the third quarter of the prior year. Texas delivered $584 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, $32 million higher than Q3 of 2023. When adjusted for asset sales executed in 2023, our outperformance was approximately $80 million. This improvement reflects the strength and resilience of our integrated platform. Unlike last year, Texas was marked by a lack of power price volatility and generally lower pricing despite warm temperatures. Our integrated supply strategy and the ability to turn off units during periods of low pricing enabled us to maximize margins as we served our retail load. The ability to cycle our plans on and off as part of our overall supply strategy is what gives us confidence in delivering consistent financial results through a variety of market conditions. Our east, west, and services segments also demonstrated improved year-over-year outperformance. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $214 million, representing an $18 million increase from the prior year. This improvement was primarily driven by lower power and natural gas supply costs resulting in margin expansion and an increase in average customer counts of 7%. Finally, our smart home segment delivered $257 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, an $18 million increase from the prior year. This was driven by mid-single-digit growth in our subscriber count and continued net service margin expansion of 6%, reflecting the embedded operating leverage of the business as the subscriber base continues to grow. As you can see on the table, we have added disclosures for adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. For the third quarter, NRG produced $393 million of adjusted net income, equivalent to $1.90 of earnings per share. This represents a 21% increase over Q3 2023 results, primarily driven by higher gross margin and share of purchases. Free cash flow before growth for the quarter was $815 million, a $460 million increase over Q3 2023. This reflects higher gross margin, favorable working capital, and lower CapEx given the completion of the Parish restoration work in 2023. Lastly, we are reaffirming our revised 2024 financial guidance and have provided our guidance ranges across all the key reporting metrics, including adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. Turning to 2024 capital allocation on slide 17, we continue to deliver on our capital allocation priorities. There are only a few minor changes to the capital allocation waterfall from our second quarter earnings call. On our last earnings call, we announced an agreement to sell our Airtron HVAC business. That transaction closed in late September. As a result, we are updating the net cash proceeds from the Airtron sale to approximately $425 million. We are also increasing free cash flow before growth by $100 million. For liability management preferred dividends, we've reduced our 2024 allocation to $420 million from $602 million. Our aggressive debt reduction over the past few years, coupled with improved financial performance, will result in achieving our target credit metrics by the end of 2024, a full-year earlier than originally intended. As a result, we have reduced the amount of liability management we had intended to pursue in 2024 and have reallocated that cash to our remaining unallocated CAFA. We have increased our share repurchase total from $825 million to $925 million, which reflects the increase in our 2024 FCFbG guidance. Through October 31, we completed $544 million of repurchases, and we expect to complete the remaining repurchases by year-end. Inclusive of our year-to-date activity, we have executed over $3.8 billion in share repurchases at an average price of around $50 since 2019, representing nearly 30% of our shares outstanding. In our other investments, we have allocated $122 million for other growth, including updated spend associated with our ERCOT New Build project. Finally, we expect to end 2024 with approximately $605 million of unallocated capital, which we have rolled into 2025 for application towards continued share buyback programs. Turning to the next slide, we are excited to introduce our financial guidance for 2025. We are guiding 2025 full-year adjusted EBITDA to a range of $3.725 to $3.975 billion, representing a midpoint of $3.85 billion, or an 8% increase from our original 2024 guidance midpoint. As you can see from the chart at the bottom, this is driven by the completion of our previously announced growth and cost synergy programs, margin expansion from higher power prices, and partly offset by the loss EBITDA from the sale of Airtron. We are also guiding 2025 full-year free cash flow before growth to a range of $1.975 billion to $2.225 billion, representing a mid-point of $2.1 billion, also an 8% increase over the midpoint of our original 2024 guidance. In addition to adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth, we are initiating guidance for adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share. For full-year 2025, we are initiating guidance on adjusted net income to a range of $1.33 billion to $1.53 billion, representing a midpoint of $1.43 billion, and a range of 675 to 775 for adjusted EPS, representing a midpoint of $7.25 per share. Moving to the next slide, we are providing a five-year roadmap with the major drivers of our adjusted EPS and free cash flow before growth investment outlook on a per-share basis. As you can see on the slide, we are targeting long-term adjusted EPS and FCFbG per share growth of greater than 10%. These growth rates are pegged against our recently increased 2024 guidance. More modeling disclosures can be found in the appendix of today's presentation. Our five-year outlook is underpinned by visible organic growth resulting in $750 million of incremental run rate adjusted EBITDA and a robust capital return program of nearly $9 billion over the 2025 to 2029 period. I'd also highlight that this five-year outlook assumes flat power pricing and does not include any of the additional upside opportunities Larry touched on earlier. As you can see on the slide, our organic growth plan and share of purchases comprise nearly $4 of EPS growth and nearly $6.50 of FCFbG per share growth. Offsetting this growth is an increase in taxes as available tax credits expire in 2025 and as NRG continues to generate strong earnings that utilize its NOL balance. In addition to taxes, we are projecting the impact of higher interest costs on earnings and free cash flow growth as maturing low-cost debt is refinanced at higher rates. Turning to 2025 capital allocation on the next slide and starting on the left side of the chart, we are showing approximately $2.7 billion of cash available for allocation, which includes the carryover amounts from 2024. As I have already noted, we will achieve our target credit metrics earlier than originally forecasted. And as such, our liability management program in 2025 will be comprised of selling the convertible note hedge and preferred stock dividends. As you can see, the primary focus of our 2025 capital allocation activity will continue to be share purchases with $1.36 billion planned for 2025. Together with the planned 8% increase in the common dividend to $1.76 per share, our total return of capital is currently expected to be about 85% of CAFA after liability management and integration costs. Importantly, for those keeping a scorecard, we're on track to significantly exceed the original return of capital commitment shared as part of our 2023 Investor Day, with more than $4.5 billion to be returned from 2023 through 2025. Given our outstanding performance relative to the 2023 Investor Day plan, our Board of Directors approved an increase in total authorization for repurchases from $2.7 billion to $3.7 billion. As of October 31, approximately $2 billion is remaining under the total authorization inclusive of this increase. In 2025, we have allocated $165 million to other investment, which includes continued progress on our ERCOT new build program, and investment in near-term actionable initiatives related to our long-term organic growth plan. Finally, we are showing $235 million of unallocated capital, which we will allocate over the course of 2025. With that, I'll turn it back to you, Larry."

            "name": "Rob Gaudette",
            "content": "Hey, Angie, it's Rob, and great observation. What I would tell you or remind you is, because we serve consumer energy customers, we're always building our portfolio and we're including that component that I've called insurance, right, the options on the back end. What VPP does is it self-provides that, right? So as we think about the customer and as we think about how we insure against an extreme event, the beauty of VPP is it is the perfect hedge for that kind of exposure. So, when I look out the curve and as we're building the portfolio over time, what VPP does is it helps me manage the risks of a consumer energy business without having to go to a third-party or dropping a lot of money to build massive peakers to meet that same obligation. So, I feel really good about the economics that we've got here and as far as the long-term perspective, this is absolutely the best tool to manage the risk of a home-based energy book. Does that help? Absolutely. Yes, so I look at both of those things. And what I would tell you is that I am with you. I don't believe that the curve reflects the load that we expect or the supply-demand picture that we would expect in the future. As far as how we think about it and whether or not it's going to show up, I believe that the load is coming. I don't know if it's 80 gigs and honestly, we don't need 80 gigs. But part of the curve, remember, in the reaction inside of pricing is pretty short-sighted viewing or just looking a little bit into history. This summer was a little less warm than last year. We didn't have any real price formation like we did last year, and then everybody kind of lost sight of what could happen. If you look into the future and you think about, okay, well, if you just add a little bit of incremental load into the ERCOT market, you have a real opportunity giving a renewables profile and call it just abnormal weather to really get price formation. And then, everybody will be excited again and the curves will go to the moon and we'll be managing through it. You've seen this before. We've all seen it. I just don't think that these curves in '28, '29 and beyond reflect reality. Yes, so the thing I would have you think about from the supply perspective, remember that we're using this in lieu of some form of insurance, right? So the values on the page represents what it would cost me, right? On the top part of the slide, this is what we would have, this is what we save by not having to go and replace this with a heat rate call option or something like that, the representation down at the bottom where we talk about the different years. So, in '23, the value of that insurance would have been considerably more valuable than say this year, where we didn't have any real price formation. But when you think about it long-term with NRG and how we build it in the portfolio, I'm going to buy that insurance regardless. So, I'm building the book 12 to 18 months out. We're putting in the insurance to protect our business. And so, we're going to capture the values up at the top. And then, the representation at the bottom is just the value that, that protected me from, right? So, I bought insurance in '23. It was really valuable. I bought insurance this year, and I didn't need it. That's the examples at the bottom. So, the value that we see around VPP is consistent year, every year, regardless of the circumstances, because I'm going to buy that insurance to protect the portfolio anyway. Does that make sense?"

            "name": "Rasesh Patel",
            "content": "Thank you, Larry. Turning to slide 10, I am thrilled to announce our strategic partnership with Renew Home and Google to develop a 1 gigawatt residential virtual power plant or VPP in Texas. This partnership brings together leaders across the energy and consumer technology industries to develop an innovative energy management solution for NRG and our customers. Our intention is to combine NRG's consumer reach and supply management expertise with Renew Home's residential demand response capabilities and Google's advanced AI technology. This will enable us to deploy smart thermostats and other devices that will allow our customers to optimize their energy use and save money while enhancing the stability and flexibility of our supply strategy and the Texas grid. On slide 11, you will find the key components of our partnership. We will develop a compelling personalized energy management platform that provides near real-time dispatch of capacity at a fraction the cost of a generation plant. Renew Home will provide the demand response capabilities and will fund a significant portion of customer acquisition costs, minimizing NRG's capital outlay. This collaboration also positions NRG as the partner for all new Google Nest VPP enrollments in Texas. NRG will manage the customer relationship, experience, and dispatch of VPP events. As illustrated in the VPP capital efficiency metrics at the bottom left of the slide, this is an economically attractive approach to supplementing our generation portfolio. The upfront investment is roughly one tenth of a new peaker plant while delivering an IRR greater than 50%, which is significantly higher than traditional alternatives. On the right-hand side of the page, you can see our plan to scale this program with the goal of reaching 650 megawatts of dispatchable capacity by 2030 and a gigawatt by 2035. Now, let's turn to slide 12, where we outline our strategy for bringing the virtual power plant program to market with an exciting new offering. To accelerate our VPP efforts in Texas, we're introducing the Home Essentials bundle, which includes a Vivint Smart Thermostat, doorbell camera, and professional installation, all provided at no cost to customers enrolled in a VPP plan, as long as they remain an NRG Energy customer. Should they choose to leave, they can continue to receive the smart home services for a monthly fee of $14.99, allowing customers to continue enjoying the benefits of smart home while protecting our investment in their experience. We have tested this new value proposition with select energy customers in Texas, and the results have been very encouraging. In our pilot, we're seeing strong adoption of this offer and a step change in customer engagement with the average household using our smart home app more than 160 times per month. Moreover, 20% of these customers have opted to purchase additional smart home products and services that generate incremental recurring revenue. Over time, we see this bundle becoming a powerful entry point that will deliver enhanced value to customers, build scale for VPP, and encourage customers to explore a broader suite of smart home services. We are leveraging our strong market share in Texas to expand our share of wallet with customers with Renew Home co-funding up to $150 of customer acquisition costs through our VPP partnership. This go-to-market strategy focuses on making smart energy solutions accessible, valuable, and deeply engaging. We're meeting our customers where they are, with solutions that empower them to take control of their home and energy experiences while strengthening their relationship with NRG. We will make home-based essentials broadly available in Texas spring 2025. Moving to slide 13, let's take a closer look at how our virtual power plant generates value and delivers strong economics through two distinct value streams, consumer and supply. On the consumer side, where we retain 100% of the economic benefits, we expect margin uplift and increased tenure for customers adopting the Home Based Essentials Bundle, as well as incremental recurring revenue from customers opting for additional smart home services. The home energy industry, relative to other consumer services, has elevated customer churn, and we expect this initiative to improve customer retention due to the enhanced value, engagement, and savings from this integrated offering. On the supply side, where we retain over half the economic benefit, we've provided an illustrated breakdown that shows how VPP creates margin opportunity based on the number of events per summer and the implied in the money power price. Beyond direct value, this asset also provides critical risk mitigation, allowing us to dispatch the VPP to further stabilize our supply portfolio during periods of volatility. At scale, for a 650-megawatt VPP, we anticipate approximately $110 million in annual recurring margin for NRG, $80 million from consumer value, and $30 million from supply value. Looking ahead to a 1-gigawatt VPP, we project the total annual incremental margin to exceed $160 million, making VPP a highly profitable and flexible asset that strengthens both our financial and operational resilience. If Texas supply becomes more constrained in the coming years, as many expect, the value to NRG and our customers will only increase. I look forward to keeping you updated on our progress as we execute this plan. With that, I will turn it over to Bruce to provide the financial review. Thank you, Angie. Hey, Michael. This is Rasesh. Yes, that's a good way to think about it. The customer value is going to be stable and very sustainable. The supply value, which Rob can add a little more color on, that can be significantly higher in years of tighter markets. And so, I think that's the right way to think about it. Rob, would you add anything? Yes. It's a great question. The way I would really think about this is we have very strong market share on the residential energy side in Texas. Nearly 40% share of the market. And so, the larger opportunity we see is how do we leverage that household relationship to actually expand share of wallet with customers. And through the launch of Homes Base Essentials, we're giving our existing skilled customer base a lot of incremental value. And in the trial that we've seen over the summer, where we've provided customers this new bundle, 20% of them have already bought incremental smart home services from us. And that's very attractive. So, I would just characterize that as there will be opportunity, obviously, with modest household growth. But, the larger opportunity for NRG is to expand the share of wallet, leveraging the near 40% market share we have in home energy. Thanks, David."

After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Kevin Cole, Head of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKevin Cole: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to NRG Energy\u2019s second quarter 2024 earnings call. This morning\u2019s call will be 45 minutes in length. It will be broadcast live over the phone via webcast, which can be located in the Investor section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations and Webcasts. Please note that today\u2019s discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based upon assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor in today\u2019s presentation, as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today\u2019s presentation. And with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Larry Coben, NRG\u2019s Chairman and CEO.\nLarry Coben: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I\u2019m joined this morning by Bruce Chung, our Chief Financial Officer. We also have members of the management team on the call and they are all available to answer questions. First, I just want to express how excited I am to be leading NRG as Chairman, President and CEO. I\u2019m grateful for the outpouring of support I\u2019ve received from the investment community, employees and other stakeholders over the last nine months, and again, in the last week following the Board\u2019s announcement of August 1st. We are laser-focused on delivering exceptional shareholder value by meeting the growing and evolving needs of our customers, while returning billions of dollars in capital. We believe we have the right strategy and the best team to fix the depressed valuation of our company once and for all. Let\u2019s begin with NRG\u2019s strategic positioning. For those new to NRG, we have the largest energy and smart home platform in North America. We\u2019re the trusted partner to over 8 million residential customers, offering tailored energy and smart home solutions. We are also the second largest energy and energy services provider, as well as the largest natural gas provider to commercial and industrial companies. If there\u2019s been one takeaway from today\u2019s discussion that you should have, it\u2019s that our business and financial outlook has never been stronger. We are witnessing a structural long-term tightening in power supply and demand, driving a step-change improvement in fundamentals. Customers across our platform are using more of our products and increasingly requesting premium customized experiences, as well as innovative offerings focused on convenience, sustainability and cost. Our integrated platform enables us to stabilize and increase our near-term earnings, while capturing medium- to long-term growth opportunities. We generate significant excess cash well beyond our current business needs, resulting in the financial flexibility to grow earnings, while at the same time returning substantial capital to our shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. The strength of our business and financial outlook has positioned us to capitalize on what we believe to be the beginning stages of an exceptional time for our industry and an exciting time for our company. I have never been more excited about the opportunities in front of us than I am today. Let\u2019s dive into the key messages on Slide 5. Our business performance exceeded expectations in the second quarter and year-to-date. We are reaffirming our financial guidance ranges and trending toward the upper end of that guidance range. Next, electrification trends compounded by GenAI data center and other large load growth continue to materialize. We expect competitive markets, such as ours, to realize outsized benefits from this trend, driven by business-friendly policies, available resources and the ability to cite projects quickly. Additionally, we have made progress on the strategic priorities discussed in our last earnings call. This includes submitting our brownfield development projects to the Texas Energy Fund and continuing to advance with our portfolio of sites. Finally, we continue to fulfill our capital allocation commitments with our share repurchase program underway and line of sight to achieving our balance sheet targets. Turning to Slide 6, we delivered $935 million in adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, a 14% year-on-year increase. This brings year-to-date adjusted EBITDA to $1.784 billion, up 22% from last year. Following this strong first half, we are reaffirming our financial guidance ranges, and again, trending toward the upper part of that range. All of our businesses are excelling and demonstrating strong performance across the Board. Our consumer segments demonstrated strong year-on-year growth. Home energy subscribers increased by 8% at stable margins. Smart home had a 5% increase in subscribers and 7% growth in revenue and delivered industry-leading retention rates and expanded margins. We continue to make substantial progress toward our Virtual Power Plant offering and look forward to sharing more about that by the time of our third quarter earnings call. On the supply side, we continue to experience significant improvements in the availability and reliability of our generation assets, thanks to the investments we have made in them in recent years. We are well-prepared for the summer and winter seasons across our fleet after successfully completing our spring maintenance outages. This level of preparedness helps ensure we can meet demand and consistently deliver exceptional service to our customers. A shout-out to our incredible team of plant operators as our assets delivered 97% reliability during Hurricane Beryl in July with no storm-induced or caused outages or lost generation. I\u2019m also happy to report that our cost and growth synergies are on track. Today, we\u2019re reaffirming our plan of $550 million in synergies by the end of 2025 and we remain on track to achieve our 15 to 20% free cash flow before growth per share growth target, even as our rising stock price means repurchasing shares at higher prices, much higher prices, than projected a year ago. On share repurchases, we\u2019ve completed $176 million of the current buyback program with $649 million to be completed over the balance of the year. Lastly, we are announcing the sale of Airtron HVAC, which will result in $400 million in net cash grosses. Turning to Slide 7, I\u2019d like to provide you a little additional context on the strong demand outlook we are seeing in Texas. In the first half of the year, Texas experienced over 3% weather-normalized load growth, setting new record peaks in January, April and May. Looking ahead, ERCOT continues to anticipate substantial load growth in the coming years. ERCOT\u2019s latest projection indicates that more than 60 gigawatts of growth through 2030 will take place, driven by on-shoring, data centers and other large load customers. Notably, many of these new loads are backed by contracts with the transmission and distribution utilities in ERCOT or have been confirmed by an officer of a TDU, adding credibility to the projected growth. Within our own portfolio, we continue to advance our 1.5 gigawatts of brownfield natural gas development in Texas. We filed applications for all three projects with the Texas Energy Fund in June. We anticipate the PUCT will announce later this month which projects are advancing to the due diligence phase, which is expected to last four months to eight months, depending on the quality of the projects and their applications. Following that, loan agreements will be executed. We believe our projects are well-situated for a timely approval, given their shovel-ready nature and the completeness of the applications that we submitted. Finally, we\u2019ve received numerous questions about our site portfolio since our first quarter call. Our singularly devoted development team is diligently working to maximize the value of these sites. As a reminder, our portfolio includes 21 sites encompassing 21,000 acres of land in competitive markets. These sites are ideally suited for new large loads and power plant development, offering co-location opportunities both behind and in front of the meter. To identify the sites best suited for data centers, key factors include access to water for cooling, premium fiber channel access for low latency, and existing grid access and infrastructure for rapid market entry. As you can see, our sites possess these attributes, but also have potential for other large load applications. In this appendix, we provide several paths to value under consideration. I look forward to discussing this more with you as we progress. With that, let me turn it over to Bruce Chung for the financial review. Bruce?\nBruce Chung: Thank you, Larry. Turning to Slide 9, NRG delivered another strong quarter of financial and operational performance with adjusted EBITDA of $935 million, an increase of $116 million over the prior year. Free cash flow before growth was $663 million, exceeding prior year results by $238 million. Each segment of our business performed well, with much of the performance underscored by positive momentum and growing subscriber counts, increased volumes and margin expansion. Starting with our results in our East/West/Services/Other segments, we saw strong performance producing $282 million of adjusted EBITDA, a $184 million increase over the prior year. $132 million of the year-over-year increase came from the East segment, where an increase in subscriber counts and lower realized retail supply costs were the primary drivers of performance. The remainder of the year-over-year growth was driven by a decrease in realized power supply costs in the West. Adjusted EBITDA in Texas for the second quarter was $452 million, a slight decline compared to prior year. Texas performance was driven by favorable hedging activity, along with increased volumes and subscriber counts in the region. This favorability was offset by an estimated $40 million due to the impact of last year\u2019s STP and Gregory asset sales, as well as $50 million in higher maintenance costs from the extended plant outage program we deployed in the quarter to ensure our plants are well positioned for this summer\u2019s operations and beyond. This marks our third year of enhanced preventative investment to improve reliability and flexibility across our fleet. Our plants have performed well through the year, and we expect them to continue to do so as the summer rolls on. Our smart home business has continued to execute well, growing subscriber count by 5% and service margins by 4% year-over-year, and generating $201 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. While that represents a slight decrease from the prior year, it is important to point out the decrease was primarily driven by an expected increase in the amortization of fulfillment expenses, which began impacting EBITDA after we closed on the acquisition of the business. Absent this non-cash impact and other non-recurring adjustments, adjusted EBITDA for this segment would have shown an increase of 6% year-over-year. Key performance indicators for the smart home segment continue to remain strong, as the average smart home subscriber interacts with their systems more than 16 times per day, and we see this high level of engagement carried through to our best-in-class retention, which is nearly 90%. Our free cash flow before growth came in at $663 million, $238 million higher than the prior year, and driven by our significant growth in adjusted EBITDA and favorable working capital. We are reaffirming our 2024 guidance of $3.3 billion to $3.55 billion for adjusted EBITDA and $1.825 billion to $2.075 billion for free cash flow before growth. Our strong year-to-date performance, coupled with the investments we have made in our plans, give us confidence that we are trending towards the upper end of guidance. We continue to see growth and momentum in our business platforms and the continued execution of our diversified supply strategy positions us well through the remainder of the year. Turning to Slide 10 for a current view of our 2024 capital allocation. As you can see, there have been few changes since our first quarter call. We are on track to deliver on nearly $600 million of liability management initiatives and $1.2 billion in return of capital through share repurchases and the common dividend. As I mentioned last time, the strength of our share price performance has made our convertible notes one of the most expensive pieces of paper in our capital structure. And we subsequently seized the opportunity to mitigate that through strategic repurchases as part of our liability management program. We repurchased $343 million or approximately 60% of the original issuance. For the remainder of these notes, we have fully hedged the premium we will pay when the notes are retired. Turning briefly to share repurchases, we have completed $176 million of the $825 million share repurchase target for 2024 via open market repurchases, bringing us to over 40% of our total $2.7 billion authorization. We see tremendous value in buying our shares and will continue to take advantage of our currently depressed stock price through share repurchases. The only substantial change to our capital available for allocation relates to the sale of our Airtron HVAC business for $500 million, which will yield approximately $400 million of net proceeds. We expect the transaction to close before the end of the year. Finally, we now show $441 million of unallocated capital available for allocation in 2024 after taking into account the incremental $400 million of net proceeds from the Airtron transaction. We will evaluate the use of this unallocated capital as we move into the latter part of the year and after closing of the Airtron sale. With that, I will turn it back to you, Larry.\nLarry Coben: Thank you, Bruce. On Slide 12, I\u2019d like to share a few closing thoughts on our 2024 priorities and expectations. During the quarter, we\u2019ve made significant progress on our strategic initiatives and I\u2019m confident we have the right platform and strategy to deliver on our commitments to both our customers and our shareholders. As CEO, I\u2019m deeply committed to driving NRG forward to create significant additional shareholder value. We are seeing a long-term step change improvement in fundamentals across our platform. You can expect a continued heightened focus on operational excellence, prudent growth and being good stewards of you, our investors\u2019 capital. I have never been more excited about the potential of our company than I am today. Thank you for your time and continued interest in NRG. Operator, we\u2019re now ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nShahriar Pourreza: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nLarry Coben: Good morning, Shahriar.\nShahriar Pourreza: Good morning. Good morning. Larry, since we last spoke, we\u2019ve seen something like 40 gigs to 60 gigs get in line for the Energy Fund. Do you think the state could do a second fund if this one helps meet the demand? Do you think this means the curves could revert to backwardation and could you get involved with more generation, assuming an expanded program next year, so do you have more bandwidth? Thanks.\nLarry Coben: Is that one question, Shahriar, or three? But they\u2019re all great questions. And look, this state has talked about, I think you probably saw the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor talk about adding a second tranche to the TEP, and I think they\u2019ll then see what happens and what the availability is. I think the bigger question, Shahriar, is, first of all, how much of these are real? And we don\u2019t know yet. We know that ours are shovel-ready. But if you look at people who\u2019ve applied for transmission studies and the like, it\u2019s an awful lot less than 40 gigs. I think it\u2019s about 12 gigs, to be exact. And so, there\u2019s a long way to go before a lot of those projects become real and ready to go. Some of them, I\u2019m sure, will, but many will not. So I don\u2019t see the curve -- while in the short-term we\u2019ve seen some fluctuation in curves, I don\u2019t see what we\u2019ve seen from the TEF filings to have a major impact on what the long-term market is going to look like. I\u2019m sorry. There\u2019s a second half to your question, Shahriar, I think.\nShahriar Pourreza: Just assuming, like, you see an expanded program, do you guys have, like, kind of bandwidth to do additional generation?\nLarry Coben: Absolutely we do if, our customers and clients continue to need it and it\u2019s optimal for our portfolio strategy. Though, remember, as we\u2019ve talked about before, the lead times for development, primarily because of turbines and other equipment is several years. So if you don\u2019t have a place in the turbine queue today, there\u2019s no way you\u2019re getting a new project online before 2030 at the earliest.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. And just lastly, Larry, just on transitioning to EPS, I mean, I know I asked you this on the last call, but has your thoughts evolved around just maybe changing disclosures and guidance a little bit?\nLarry Coben: My thoughts have evolved. I\u2019ll let Bruce expand on how my thoughts have evolved.\nBruce Chung: Shahriar, I guess, in short, Larry\u2019s thoughts have evolved such that there hasn\u2019t been no change in terms of what we\u2019re thinking about. I think what we had indicated last time is that we are working towards making that transition. We see our third quarter earnings as being the optimal time to be able to do that and that\u2019s what we\u2019re currently working towards.\nShahriar Pourreza: Okay. That\u2019s a perfect call. Thanks. Larry, big congrats. I know a couple of quarters ago I highlighted that we didn\u2019t want you to leave and just stay as the CEO. So we\u2019re glad the Board listened. Thanks, guys.\nLarry Coben: Well, Shahriar, when the thing has taken off like a rocket ship, you want to wait until you get to the stars before you get off.\nShahriar Pourreza: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. Congrats, guys.\nLarry Coben: Thanks, Shahriar.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski from Seaport. Please go ahead.\nAngie Storozynski: Thank you. So maybe, I mean, we\u2019re all trying to be as excited as you are, Larry, about the prospect of power markets. I mean, clearly the curves disagree, and I\u2019m just wondering if you can explain to us why do you think we\u2019ve had this sharp pullback in Texas power curves given the load outlook you see and we see?\nLarry Coben: Good morning, Angie. I\u2019m going to let Rob kind of take you through that, because it\u2019s something we talk about a lot. But Rob, maybe?\nRob Gaudette: Yeah. So, Angie, obviously, we\u2019ve seen the same moves and curves that you have. As well as I do that to start with the long-term curve gets impacted by the noise of whatever is going on in the front end of the market. We\u2019ve had a warm but not very pricey summer and that\u2019s kind of impacted things out the curve. What I would tell you is as we look at these curves, regardless of whether or not you see a bunch of demand come into ERCOT or not, the back end of the curve actually looks like a place where we would be buyers, right? So 2027 and 2028 summers look cheap. The market itself is constructive or would be constructive and we think these are the right levels for us to step in because we think they\u2019re undervaluing what the curve looks like and that\u2019s before you add demand. So I\u2019m pretty bullish on what you -- what the market looks like. We feel very strongly about where our portfolio is and we think that our retail business will continue to churn out the earnings that it\u2019s done over time. So I\u2019m not very concerned about that curve.\nAngie Storozynski: Speaking about retail business, if you could talk to us about what\u2019s happening in New England, any potential reviews to the retail electric market and how that could impact your business?\nRasesh Patel: Good morning, Angie. This is Rasesh. To put the context of what\u2019s happening in the Northeast, our retail business overall performed a really -- it was a very strong quarter, right? 8% subscriber growth, double-digit growth in volume and strong margin performance. In the Northeast, there are a couple of things going on that we watch very carefully. The regulatory environment and some of the changes in the specific states. As an example, Massachusetts ended up not making any changes. In Maryland, where we have seen some changes as a result of SB1, that\u2019s a very, very small part of our overall earnings stream, and so the impact of that will be negligible to our results. but we watch the environment very closely.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And then back to the generation assets. So, I mean, this whole discussion about newbuilds and the need to actually supply additional generation capacity, I\u2019m just wondering, those are assets with 40-year lives and you guys are making decisions based on two to three-year visibility into the profitability of these assets. So, one is how you approach the newbuild, given that previous cycles were very painful for IPPs. And two, I mean, is there a way to basically maybe pursue newbuilds through a long-term contract as opposed to a truly merchant newbuild? I mean, if the demand is truly there, one could argue that the demand should be comfortable with signing PPAs to support newbuilds as opposed to just truly merchant assets, both actually in ERCOT and PJM.\nLarry Coben: Angie, I\u2019m going to let Rob expand on that, but remember that we have the ability to contract and use all of the power. This isn\u2019t a merchant build for us. We have the ability to cross it to ourselves or utilize it ourselves and so we\u2019re not doing speculative merchant builds. That\u2019s not the business that we\u2019re in. This is part of the supply stack that Rob and team are really crucially putting together to meet all of our customers\u2019 needs going forward. But I don\u2019t know, Rob, do you want to?\nRob Gaudette: Larry covered it. This is for our portfolio. These assets were designed, built and planned to support the retail portfolio, regardless of what we see kind of long-term. We have a long-term consumer-facing business and we support that.\nAngie Storozynski: And nothing about potential long-term contracts. I\u2019m clearly fishing for some comments about those brownfield sites, if the monetization of those could come through a newbuild backed by PPAs?\nRob Gaudette: So, Angie, as we consider the sites and the strategy that we do with the sites, right? So, as we disclosed before, two-thirds of those, at least, are up in PJM, where we don\u2019t play with generation quite as much as we do down in Texas. All of the answers that Larry and I just gave were in reference to the three newbuild projects that are on the way. When I think about the sites themselves, if we have an opportunity to build generation on one of those sites, and it\u2019s for a customer, then we obviously will be thinking about PPAs and different structures to support the capital for those.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. Thank you.\nRob Gaudette: Sure.\nLarry Coben: Thanks, Angie.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Antoine Aurimond from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nAntoine Aurimond: Hey, guys. Hope you\u2019re doing well. Congrats on the results.\nLarry Coben: Thank you. Good morning.\nAntoine Aurimond: And Larry, congrats on the permanent appointment. I guess on that note, just more broadly, taking a step back, how do you think about the strategic trajectory of the company under your new leadership? So, again, over the past year, NRG to de-emphasize physical generation, asset light strategy. Do you think that\u2019s still the best positioning in the current market conditions and any other strategic shifts we should be considering?\nLarry Coben: I mean, Antoine, I think our strategy isn\u2019t changing, but I don\u2019t -- I\u2019ve never really liked the description asset light. I\u2019ve always considered it to be supply optimal. I mean, a good mix of our own generation and other instruments or tolls in order to be able to do that and that\u2019s continuing. One of the reasons we would like to have more iron than we did a year or two ago is because our customers and clients are demanding more electricity. And so, as we construct the appropriate supply portfolio or supply stack, and we optimize that, having more hard metal in the ground is a good thing for us and so we\u2019re doing that. But we\u2019re also going to have more of the other types of instruments that we use as well, because as you can see from this presentation and I know you follow the industry, so you don\u2019t need me to tell you, the growth in power demand is continuing and we need to be in a position to meet our clients\u2019 needs to do that.\nAntoine Aurimond: Yeah. That makes sense. And then I guess on the data center opportunity, can you maybe comment on status of any discussions you may have with data center providers, type of contracts that you may be contemplating, how advanced you are in the negotiation process and how should we think about sort of timeline, potential announcements?\nLarry Coben: Look, Antoine, one of the things we did was we were getting so many inbounds that we just kind of pulled back for a strategic review of it all. And you can see the kinds of things we\u2019re contemplating on that slide in the appendix, say, is it 18 or?\nBruce Chung: 21.\nLarry Coben: 21, sorry. And I think as we\u2026\nAntoine Aurimond: All right.\nLarry Coben: \u2026land on a strategy, we\u2019re obviously going to share that with you and I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll be sometime probably before the end of the year. But we were getting lots of people sort of throwing us bids for our sites, and we\u2019re like, well, we know they think we\u2019re just a bunch of power guys who don\u2019t know anything about data centers. So, if that\u2019s what they\u2019re bidding us, we really need to look at this, because it means there\u2019s a lot more value in there than the bids that we\u2019re receiving. So, can\u2019t really comment too much more on it now, but look forward to sharing more with you as we have it.\nAntoine Aurimond: Fair enough. And then lastly, under $400 million of net proceeds from HVAC divestiture is somewhat unexpected. Where do you expect to allocate that extra cash?\nBruce Chung: I\u2019m sorry. Can you just repeat that last part, Antoine?\nLarry Coben: [Inaudible]\nBruce Chung: Oh! Yeah. So, look, yeah, we\u2019ll -- from an allocation standpoint, we\u2019ll certainly provide more visibility around the allocation once we close and we get the proceeds in place, but you should expect that we\u2019ll remain consistent with our capital allocation principles.\nAntoine Aurimond: Okay. Great. Thank you so much, guys. Talk to you soon.\nLarry Coben: Thank you.\nBruce Chung: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteve Fleishman: Hey. Good morning, and congrats, Larry.\nLarry Coben: Thank you, Steve. Appreciate it. Good morning.\nSteve Fleishman: Yeah. So, just a couple kind of near-term questions first. The -- how should we think about if we do end up having a kind of a milder, lower priced summer in Texas? You\u2019ve done a lot to kind of make sure you were ready for a high-priced hot summer, just protection from the opposite and I assume that\u2019s kind of embedded in saying to the upper end, but just how should we think about that?\nRob Gaudette: Hey, Steve. It\u2019s Rob. We don\u2019t talk about it often, but we also do manage to the downside. The great thing about our portfolio is that we have those assets that we can turn down in markets that aren\u2019t constructive, like you\u2019ve seen for the last two quarters. As far as the way we look forward into the year, we contemplate both up and down scenarios in where we feel we\u2019re going to land on guidance.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And then also, just kind of more, we had this PJM auction outcome. Just how should we think about that capacity price flow through the retail business? If -- I don\u2019t know how much you\u2019ve already contracted or it\u2019s just not enough of a scale to matter much.\nRob Gaudette: Yeah. So when you -- so the BRA print for this last auction is indicative of kind of the supply demand structure that we kind of see across the country. So it\u2019s going to provide additional dollars towards generation. We don\u2019t have a very large portfolio in PJM, so it is what it is. On the C&I and retail sides, think about our consumer business is very short-term, so don\u2019t expect a lot of impact there. And then on the C&I side, we contract with these guys and depending on what changes in the markets, we can use change in law depending on what happens if we chose. But as we look at the impacts to the book on the retail side, it\u2019s de minimis state. It\u2019s nothing that I would even talk about.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Thank you. And then just, sorry to go back to Texas newbuild, but so obviously the ETF has the low cost loans and performance bonuses and the like. But then, you do have to kind of have a market price for return on equity. So just, I mean, is your messaging that basically, hey, this works for us at any forward curve and just how should we think about kind of protecting equity?\nLarry Coben: I wouldn\u2019t say any forward curve.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay.\nLarry Coben: I know you don\u2019t mean any forward curves.\nSteve Fleishman: I don\u2019t, but I\u2019m just -- it is\u2026\nLarry Coben: Look, look\u2026\nSteve Fleishman: I\u2019m just trying to understand the thought process on. Yeah.\nLarry Coben: If we actually believe that a depressed curve was reality, that would, Chris heard from here was reality that would obviously impact our decision. But as Rob discussed earlier, what we\u2019re really seeing in terms of increased demand is somewhat belies the short-term blip in the curve. But we look at that all the time. And there are -- there is a place where we wouldn\u2019t do the project. I don\u2019t think, we\u2019re not there today. Go ahead, Rob.\nRob Gaudette: Yeah. No. Obviously, the one thing I would add to the math or as you think about like the value of these assets, flexible gas generation is a function of both power price, but it\u2019s also a function of volatility, right? And so the volatility curves, which are not very transparent, you can\u2019t see them by looking into megawatt daily, those are still up. And so the value of these projects as something that can move around with our load continues to support us developing them and putting them into the portfolio.\nSteve Fleishman: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Then one last quick one just on the Q3 disclosures. You\u2019ve talked about the earnings and DPPs, just the site, the 21 sites. Do you think we\u2019ll get some update on kind of the Q3 call or is that more kind of late year or next year? Like what timeline on that?\nBruce Chung: We\u2019re pushing to do that, but it\u2019s a slow and iterative process a bit, Steve. So I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have some updates. It may not be as complete a one as you all would like. That may have to wait until the first quarter of next year or some conference in between. But we are working expeditiously, but it\u2019s more important that we get it right than do it fast.\nSteve Fleishman: Understood. Thank you very much.\nLarry Coben: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Neil Kalton from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nNeil Kalton: Hi, guys. Just a quick question on, yeah, economic outlook. How do you think about, so we\u2019ve seen a softening in the consumer side? Like how do you think about the impacts to your business? Thinking both the home security business, retail energy as well, are you seeing any evidence that the consumer is stepping back, weakness, et cetera?\nRasesh Patel: Hey, Neil. This is Rasesh. Good morning. We delivered a really strong quarter with 5% year-over-year subscriber growth, 7% revenue growth for the smart home business. And that\u2019s sort of, think of that as that\u2019s in an environment where we have high interest rates and a slowdown in housing activity. As that normalizes, we would expect that to potentially deliver a tailwind to the business. And I think it\u2019s largely a function of the fact that we\u2019ve got a business that has a very high quality customer base with an average FICO score of greater than 700 and so you saw we posted near all-time record results for retention, customer retention, which is almost at 90% on an annualized basis and we\u2019re still largely in an underpenetrated market. And so we see opportunities to not only continue to grow the customer base at the mid-single-digit rate, but also grow the number of devices and services we provide to the customer within the home. And so we feel really good about our position and with a potential for a tailwind if rates normalize and housing activity picks up.\nNeil Kalton: Got it. Thank you. Very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our last question. Our last question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISS -- ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Thank you. Larry, congrats. I\u2019ve got two questions.\nLarry Coben: Thanks, Durgesh. Appreciate it.\nDurgesh Chopra: Sure. Thanks. Two questions. First, just for housekeeping, August 29th, will we get a list of projects? Will that be formally announced or how will we know which ones kind of made it to the second round of due diligence by the PUCT?\nChris Moser: Hey. This is Chris. Yeah. What we\u2019ve been led to believe is that the PUCT will have either an order or a draft order which would list the assets, the projects that are moving forward towards due diligence and that has been targeted for the August 29th meeting.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then just, Larry, back to you. As you take the permanent role, obviously, there was this transaction announced here. Are there other non-core assets that we could potentially see being liquidated for cash proceeds back into the core portion of the company? How are you thinking through that?\nLarry Coben: Look, I mean, we always look to optimize everything we own. There\u2019s nothing on the horizon that I see that would be divestible. But sometimes people walk in the door with very attractive offers for things that we own and we would be silly not to take a look at those, especially given we have a broad and amazing range of opportunities, number one, in which to invest capital. And number two, we have a very undervalued stock in which to invest capital as well. So when we look at those two things, if we can make a transaction that makes sense, we\u2019ll obviously do that. I don\u2019t see anything on the horizon today. But if the opportunity arises, we will certainly look at it hard and try to take advantage of it.\nDurgesh Chopra: Understood. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We have one last question. The last question comes from Dave Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDave Arcaro: Oh! Hey. Thanks so much. The last question here. Hey, I was just curious on the PJM market, just reflecting on the capacity print that we just saw. Is there an opportunity for you to look at newbuild there? Like, does newbuild economics work at this point and do you have any opportunities to look at that market in terms of power plant expansion?\nRob Gaudette: Hey. It\u2019s Rob. So, the print is constructive as it comes to actually highlighting the supply-demand picture in the market. So I think that\u2019s a positive. We have newbuild sites, which regardless, or we have sites, regardless if you newbuild them or not, that print is definitely supportive in the overall value as we think about them from a development perspective, whether that\u2019s for load or for generation. The one thing I would tell you, David, is that one print isn\u2019t going to get a bunch of generation running into the market. So I wouldn\u2019t expect to see a whole bunch of people applying to build generation based on one PJM print. But we do have another mark in December, which I expect would be supportive and so the supply dynamics in PJM aren\u2019t going to improve anytime soon. But I believe that ultimately competitive energy players are rational and will build when it makes sense.\nDave Arcaro: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And just maybe expanding on that a little bit, do you have a sense as to when new gas plants could realistically get built in the PJM market given the supply chain challenges that you mentioned and your outlook for energy prices\u2026\nRob Gaudette: Yeah. So\u2026\nDave Arcaro: \u2026 too in the context of that.\nRob Gaudette: So there\u2019s two challenges in PJM. One is PJM specific and that\u2019s the interconnection queue, right? It\u2019s very deep and very slow and so it\u2019s probably frustrating a lot of people. The second piece is the one that is a global issue, which Larry alluded to earlier, which is if you want to build a power plant today and you\u2019re not in the queue, you\u2019re not going to get anything on the ground before 2030. So demand is coming faster than that supply window. So I expect tight markets, both from a capacity and an energy perspective, over the next several years.\nDave Arcaro: Okay. Great. Very helpful. Thanks for the color and congratulations, Larry.\nLarry Coben: Thank you, David. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I will turn it back over to Larry Coben for those remarks.\nLarry Coben: Thank you all for being on the call and for your interest in NRG. And on a more personal note, for all the kind words and congratulations on my appointment. I\u2019m here and we\u2019re all here because we are super excited about the future of NRG. I think you all know that I\u2019ve been here for 20 years and I\u2019ve never been more excited or more optimistic about the prospects. So I hope you\u2019ll stick with us and join us as we continue to execute well and take advantage of the amazing strategic opportunities and initiatives in front of us. Thank you all very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program.",

As well as I do that to start with the long-term curve gets impacted by the noise of whatever is going on in the front end of the market. We've had a warm but not very pricey summer and that's kind of impacted things out the curve. What I would tell you is as we look at these curves, regardless of whether or not you see a bunch of demand come into ERCOT or not, the back end of the curve actually looks like a place where we would be buyers, right?

All of the answers that Larry and I just gave were in reference to the three newbuild projects that are on the way. When I think about the sites themselves, if we have an opportunity to build generation on one of those sites, and it's for a customer, then we obviously will be thinking about PPAs and different structures to support the capital for those. Sure. Hey, Steve. It's Rob. We don't talk about it often, but we also do manage to the downside. The great thing about our portfolio is that we have those assets that we can turn down in markets that aren't constructive, like you've seen for the last two quarters. As far as the way we look forward into the year, we contemplate both up and down scenarios in where we feel we're going to land on guidance. Yeah. So when you -- so the BRA print for this last auction is indicative of kind of the supply demand structure that we kind of see across the country. So it's going to provide additional dollars towards generation. We don't have a very large portfolio in PJM, so it is what it is. On the C&I and retail sides, think about our consumer business is very short-term, so don't expect a lot of impact there. And then on the C&I side, we contract with these guys and depending on what changes in the markets, we can use change in law depending on what happens if we chose. But as we look at the impacts to the book on the retail side, it's de minimis state. It's nothing that I would even talk about. Yeah. No. Obviously, the one thing I would add to the math or as you think about like the value of these assets, flexible gas generation is a function of both power price, but it's also a function of volatility, right? And so the volatility curves, which are not very transparent, you can't see them by looking into megawatt daily, those are still up. And so the value of these projects as something that can move around with our load continues to support us developing them and putting them into the portfolio. Hey. It's Rob. So, the print is constructive as it comes to actually highlighting the supply-demand picture in the market. So I think that's a positive. We have newbuild sites, which regardless, or we have sites, regardless if you newbuild them or not, that print is definitely supportive in the overall value as we think about them from a development perspective, whether that's for load or for generation. The one thing I would tell you, David, is that one print isn't going to get a bunch of generation running into the market. So I wouldn't expect to see a whole bunch of people applying to build generation based on one PJM print. But we do have another mark in December, which I expect would be supportive and so the supply dynamics in PJM aren't going to improve anytime soon. But I believe that ultimately competitive energy players are rational and will build when it makes sense. Yeah. So... So there's two challenges in PJM. One is PJM specific and that's the interconnection queue, right? It's very deep and very slow and so it's probably frustrating a lot of people. The second piece is the one that is a global issue, which Larry alluded to earlier, which is if you want to build a power plant today and you're not in the queue, you're not going to get anything on the ground before 2030. So demand is coming faster than that supply window. So I expect tight markets, both from a capacity and an energy perspective, over the next several years."

            "content": "Thank you, Larry. Turning to Slide 9, NRG delivered another strong quarter of financial and operational performance with adjusted EBITDA of $935 million, an increase of $116 million over the prior year. Free cash flow before growth was $663 million, exceeding prior year results by $238 million. Each segment of our business performed well, with much of the performance underscored by positive momentum and growing subscriber counts, increased volumes and margin expansion. Starting with our results in our East/West/Services/Other segments, we saw strong performance producing $282 million of adjusted EBITDA, a $184 million increase over the prior year. $132 million of the year-over-year increase came from the East segment, where an increase in subscriber counts and lower realized retail supply costs were the primary drivers of performance. The remainder of the year-over-year growth was driven by a decrease in realized power supply costs in the West. Adjusted EBITDA in Texas for the second quarter was $452 million, a slight decline compared to prior year. Texas performance was driven by favorable hedging activity, along with increased volumes and subscriber counts in the region. This favorability was offset by an estimated $40 million due to the impact of last year's STP and Gregory asset sales, as well as $50 million in higher maintenance costs from the extended plant outage program we deployed in the quarter to ensure our plants are well positioned for this summer's operations and beyond. This marks our third year of enhanced preventative investment to improve reliability and flexibility across our fleet. Our plants have performed well through the year, and we expect them to continue to do so as the summer rolls on. Our smart home business has continued to execute well, growing subscriber count by 5% and service margins by 4% year-over-year, and generating $201 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. While that represents a slight decrease from the prior year, it is important to point out the decrease was primarily driven by an expected increase in the amortization of fulfillment expenses, which began impacting EBITDA after we closed on the acquisition of the business. Absent this non-cash impact and other non-recurring adjustments, adjusted EBITDA for this segment would have shown an increase of 6% year-over-year. Key performance indicators for the smart home segment continue to remain strong, as the average smart home subscriber interacts with their systems more than 16 times per day, and we see this high level of engagement carried through to our best-in-class retention, which is nearly 90%. Our free cash flow before growth came in at $663 million, $238 million higher than the prior year, and driven by our significant growth in adjusted EBITDA and favorable working capital. We are reaffirming our 2024 guidance of $3.3 billion to $3.55 billion for adjusted EBITDA and $1.825 billion to $2.075 billion for free cash flow before growth. Our strong year-to-date performance, coupled with the investments we have made in our plans, give us confidence that we are trending towards the upper end of guidance. We continue to see growth and momentum in our business platforms and the continued execution of our diversified supply strategy positions us well through the remainder of the year. Turning to Slide 10 for a current view of our 2024 capital allocation. As you can see, there have been few changes since our first quarter call. We are on track to deliver on nearly $600 million of liability management initiatives and $1.2 billion in return of capital through share repurchases and the common dividend. As I mentioned last time, the strength of our share price performance has made our convertible notes one of the most expensive pieces of paper in our capital structure. And we subsequently seized the opportunity to mitigate that through strategic repurchases as part of our liability management program. We repurchased $343 million or approximately 60% of the original issuance. For the remainder of these notes, we have fully hedged the premium we will pay when the notes are retired. Turning briefly to share repurchases, we have completed $176 million of the $825 million share repurchase target for 2024 via open market repurchases, bringing us to over 40% of our total $2.7 billion authorization. We see tremendous value in buying our shares and will continue to take advantage of our currently depressed stock price through share repurchases. The only substantial change to our capital available for allocation relates to the sale of our Airtron HVAC business for $500 million, which will yield approximately $400 million of net proceeds. We expect the transaction to close before the end of the year. Finally, we now show $441 million of unallocated capital available for allocation in 2024 after taking into account the incremental $400 million of net proceeds from the Airtron transaction. We will evaluate the use of this unallocated capital as we move into the latter part of the year and after closing of the Airtron sale. With that, I will turn it back to you, Larry. Shahriar, I guess, in short, Larry's thoughts have evolved such that there hasn't been no change in terms of what we're thinking about. I think what we had indicated last time is that we are working towards making that transition. We see our third quarter earnings as being the optimal time to be able to do that and that's what we're currently working towards. 21. I'm sorry. Can you just repeat that last part, Antoine? Oh! Yeah. So, look, yeah, we'll -- from an allocation standpoint, we'll certainly provide more visibility around the allocation once we close and we get the proceeds in place, but you should expect that we'll remain consistent with our capital allocation principles. Thanks. We're pushing to do that, but it's a slow and iterative process a bit, Steve. So I'm sure we'll have some updates. It may not be as complete a one as you all would like. That may have to wait until the first quarter of next year or some conference in between. But we are working expeditiously, but it's more important that we get it right than do it fast."

            "name": "Rasesh Patel",
            "content": "Good morning, Angie. This is Rasesh. To put the context of what's happening in the Northeast, our retail business overall performed a really -- it was a very strong quarter, right? 8% subscriber growth, double-digit growth in volume and strong margin performance. In the Northeast, there are a couple of things going on that we watch very carefully. The regulatory environment and some of the changes in the specific states. As an example, Massachusetts ended up not making any changes. In Maryland, where we have seen some changes as a result of SB1, that's a very, very small part of our overall earnings stream, and so the impact of that will be negligible to our results. but we watch the environment very closely. Hey, Neil. This is Rasesh. Good morning. We delivered a really strong quarter with 5% year-over-year subscriber growth, 7% revenue growth for the smart home business. And that's sort of, think of that as that's in an environment where we have high interest rates and a slowdown in housing activity. As that normalizes, we would expect that to potentially deliver a tailwind to the business. And I think it's largely a function of the fact that we've got a business that has a very high quality customer base with an average FICO score of greater than 700 and so you saw we posted near all-time record results for retention, customer retention, which is almost at 90% on an annualized basis and we're still largely in an underpenetrated market. And so we see opportunities to not only continue to grow the customer base at the mid-single-digit rate, but also grow the number of devices and services we provide to the customer within the home. And so we feel really good about our position and with a potential for a tailwind if rates normalize and housing activity picks up."

            "name": "Larry Coben",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm joined this morning by Bruce Chung, our Chief Financial Officer. We also have members of the management team on the call and they are all available to answer questions. First, I just want to express how excited I am to be leading NRG as Chairman, President and CEO. I'm grateful for the outpouring of support I've received from the investment community, employees and other stakeholders over the last nine months, and again, in the last week following the Board's announcement of August 1st. We are laser-focused on delivering exceptional shareholder value by meeting the growing and evolving needs of our customers, while returning billions of dollars in capital. We believe we have the right strategy and the best team to fix the depressed valuation of our company once and for all. Let's begin with NRG's strategic positioning. For those new to NRG, we have the largest energy and smart home platform in North America. We're the trusted partner to over 8 million residential customers, offering tailored energy and smart home solutions. We are also the second largest energy and energy services provider, as well as the largest natural gas provider to commercial and industrial companies. If there's been one takeaway from today's discussion that you should have, it's that our business and financial outlook has never been stronger. We are witnessing a structural long-term tightening in power supply and demand, driving a step-change improvement in fundamentals. Customers across our platform are using more of our products and increasingly requesting premium customized experiences, as well as innovative offerings focused on convenience, sustainability and cost. Our integrated platform enables us to stabilize and increase our near-term earnings, while capturing medium- to long-term growth opportunities. We generate significant excess cash well beyond our current business needs, resulting in the financial flexibility to grow earnings, while at the same time returning substantial capital to our shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. The strength of our business and financial outlook has positioned us to capitalize on what we believe to be the beginning stages of an exceptional time for our industry and an exciting time for our company. I have never been more excited about the opportunities in front of us than I am today. Let's dive into the key messages on Slide 5. Our business performance exceeded expectations in the second quarter and year-to-date. We are reaffirming our financial guidance ranges and trending toward the upper end of that guidance range. Next, electrification trends compounded by GenAI data center and other large load growth continue to materialize. We expect competitive markets, such as ours, to realize outsized benefits from this trend, driven by business-friendly policies, available resources and the ability to cite projects quickly. Additionally, we have made progress on the strategic priorities discussed in our last earnings call. This includes submitting our brownfield development projects to the Texas Energy Fund and continuing to advance with our portfolio of sites. Finally, we continue to fulfill our capital allocation commitments with our share repurchase program underway and line of sight to achieving our balance sheet targets. Turning to Slide 6, we delivered $935 million in adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, a 14% year-on-year increase. This brings year-to-date adjusted EBITDA to $1.784 billion, up 22% from last year. Following this strong first half, we are reaffirming our financial guidance ranges, and again, trending toward the upper part of that range. All of our businesses are excelling and demonstrating strong performance across the Board. Our consumer segments demonstrated strong year-on-year growth. Home energy subscribers increased by 8% at stable margins. Smart home had a 5% increase in subscribers and 7% growth in revenue and delivered industry-leading retention rates and expanded margins. We continue to make substantial progress toward our Virtual Power Plant offering and look forward to sharing more about that by the time of our third quarter earnings call. On the supply side, we continue to experience significant improvements in the availability and reliability of our generation assets, thanks to the investments we have made in them in recent years. We are well-prepared for the summer and winter seasons across our fleet after successfully completing our spring maintenance outages. This level of preparedness helps ensure we can meet demand and consistently deliver exceptional service to our customers. A shout-out to our incredible team of plant operators as our assets delivered 97% reliability during Hurricane Beryl in July with no storm-induced or caused outages or lost generation. I'm also happy to report that our cost and growth synergies are on track. Today, we're reaffirming our plan of $550 million in synergies by the end of 2025 and we remain on track to achieve our 15 to 20% free cash flow before growth per share growth target, even as our rising stock price means repurchasing shares at higher prices, much higher prices, than projected a year ago. On share repurchases, we've completed $176 million of the current buyback program with $649 million to be completed over the balance of the year. Lastly, we are announcing the sale of Airtron HVAC, which will result in $400 million in net cash grosses. Turning to Slide 7, I'd like to provide you a little additional context on the strong demand outlook we are seeing in Texas. In the first half of the year, Texas experienced over 3% weather-normalized load growth, setting new record peaks in January, April and May. Looking ahead, ERCOT continues to anticipate substantial load growth in the coming years. ERCOT's latest projection indicates that more than 60 gigawatts of growth through 2030 will take place, driven by on-shoring, data centers and other large load customers. Notably, many of these new loads are backed by contracts with the transmission and distribution utilities in ERCOT or have been confirmed by an officer of a TDU, adding credibility to the projected growth. Within our own portfolio, we continue to advance our 1.5 gigawatts of brownfield natural gas development in Texas. We filed applications for all three projects with the Texas Energy Fund in June. We anticipate the PUCT will announce later this month which projects are advancing to the due diligence phase, which is expected to last four months to eight months, depending on the quality of the projects and their applications. Following that, loan agreements will be executed. We believe our projects are well-situated for a timely approval, given their shovel-ready nature and the completeness of the applications that we submitted. Finally, we've received numerous questions about our site portfolio since our first quarter call. Our singularly devoted development team is diligently working to maximize the value of these sites. As a reminder, our portfolio includes 21 sites encompassing 21,000 acres of land in competitive markets. These sites are ideally suited for new large loads and power plant development, offering co-location opportunities both behind and in front of the meter. To identify the sites best suited for data centers, key factors include access to water for cooling, premium fiber channel access for low latency, and existing grid access and infrastructure for rapid market entry. As you can see, our sites possess these attributes, but also have potential for other large load applications. In this appendix, we provide several paths to value under consideration. I look forward to discussing this more with you as we progress. With that, let me turn it over to Bruce Chung for the financial review. Bruce? Thank you, Bruce. On Slide 12, I'd like to share a few closing thoughts on our 2024 priorities and expectations. During the quarter, we've made significant progress on our strategic initiatives and I'm confident we have the right platform and strategy to deliver on our commitments to both our customers and our shareholders. As CEO, I'm deeply committed to driving NRG forward to create significant additional shareholder value. We are seeing a long-term step change improvement in fundamentals across our platform. You can expect a continued heightened focus on operational excellence, prudent growth and being good stewards of you, our investors' capital. I have never been more excited about the potential of our company than I am today. Thank you for your time and continued interest in NRG. Operator, we're now ready to open the line for questions. Good morning, Shahriar. Is that one question, Shahriar, or three? But they're all great questions. And look, this state has talked about, I think you probably saw the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor talk about adding a second tranche to the TEP, and I think they'll then see what happens and what the availability is. I think the bigger question, Shahriar, is, first of all, how much of these are real? And we don't know yet. We know that ours are shovel-ready. But if you look at people who've applied for transmission studies and the like, it's an awful lot less than 40 gigs. I think it's about 12 gigs, to be exact. And so, there's a long way to go before a lot of those projects become real and ready to go. Some of them, I'm sure, will, but many will not. So I don't see the curve -- while in the short-term we've seen some fluctuation in curves, I don't see what we've seen from the TEF filings to have a major impact on what the long-term market is going to look like. I'm sorry. There's a second half to your question, Shahriar, I think. Absolutely we do if, our customers and clients continue to need it and it's optimal for our portfolio strategy. Though, remember, as we've talked about before, the lead times for development, primarily because of turbines and other equipment is several years. So if you don't have a place in the turbine queue today, there's no way you're getting a new project online before 2030 at the earliest. My thoughts have evolved. I'll let Bruce expand on how my thoughts have evolved. Well, Shahriar, when the thing has taken off like a rocket ship, you want to wait until you get to the stars before you get off. Thanks, Shahriar. Good morning, Angie. I'm going to let Rob kind of take you through that, because it's something we talk about a lot. But Rob, maybe? Angie, I'm going to let Rob expand on that, but remember that we have the ability to contract and use all of the power. This isn't a merchant build for us. We have the ability to cross it to ourselves or utilize it ourselves and so we're not doing speculative merchant builds. That's not the business that we're in. This is part of the supply stack that Rob and team are really crucially putting together to meet all of our customers' needs going forward. But I don't know, Rob, do you want to? Thanks, Angie. Thank you. Good morning. I mean, Antoine, I think our strategy isn't changing, but I don't -- I've never really liked the description asset light. I've always considered it to be supply optimal. I mean, a good mix of our own generation and other instruments or tolls in order to be able to do that and that's continuing. One of the reasons we would like to have more iron than we did a year or two ago is because our customers and clients are demanding more electricity. And so, as we construct the appropriate supply portfolio or supply stack, and we optimize that, having more hard metal in the ground is a good thing for us and so we're doing that. But we're also going to have more of the other types of instruments that we use as well, because as you can see from this presentation and I know you follow the industry, so you don't need me to tell you, the growth in power demand is continuing and we need to be in a position to meet our clients' needs to do that. Look, Antoine, one of the things we did was we were getting so many inbounds that we just kind of pulled back for a strategic review of it all. And you can see the kinds of things we're contemplating on that slide in the appendix, say, is it 18 or? 21, sorry. And I think as we... ...land on a strategy, we're obviously going to share that with you and I'm sure that'll be sometime probably before the end of the year. But we were getting lots of people sort of throwing us bids for our sites, and we're like, well, we know they think we're just a bunch of power guys who don't know anything about data centers. So, if that's what they're bidding us, we really need to look at this, because it means there's a lot more value in there than the bids that we're receiving. So, can't really comment too much more on it now, but look forward to sharing more with you as we have it. [Inaudible] Thank you. Thank you, Steve. Appreciate it. Good morning. I wouldn't say any forward curve. I know you don't mean any forward curves. Look, look... If we actually believe that a depressed curve was reality, that would, Chris heard from here was reality that would obviously impact our decision. But as Rob discussed earlier, what we're really seeing in terms of increased demand is somewhat belies the short-term blip in the curve. But we look at that all the time. And there are -- there is a place where we wouldn't do the project. I don't think, we're not there today. Go ahead, Rob. Thanks, Steve. Thanks, Durgesh. Appreciate it. Look, I mean, we always look to optimize everything we own. There's nothing on the horizon that I see that would be divestible. But sometimes people walk in the door with very attractive offers for things that we own and we would be silly not to take a look at those, especially given we have a broad and amazing range of opportunities, number one, in which to invest capital. And number two, we have a very undervalued stock in which to invest capital as well. So when we look at those two things, if we can make a transaction that makes sense, we'll obviously do that. I don't see anything on the horizon today. But if the opportunity arises, we will certainly look at it hard and try to take advantage of it. Thank you, David. Appreciate it. Thank you all for being on the call and for your interest in NRG. And on a more personal note, for all the kind words and congratulations on my appointment. I'm here and we're all here because we are super excited about the future of NRG. I think you all know that I've been here for 20 years and I've never been more excited or more optimistic about the prospects. So I hope you'll stick with us and join us as we continue to execute well and take advantage of the amazing strategic opportunities and initiatives in front of us. Thank you all very much."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Kevin Cole, Head of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nKevin Cole: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to NRG Energy's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. This morning's call will be 45 minutes in length and is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations & Webcasts.  \n Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based upon assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the safe harbor in today's presentation as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.   \n For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's presentation.  \n And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Dr. Larry Coben, NRG's Chair and Interim President and CEO. \nLawrence Coben: Thank you very much, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm joined this morning also by Bruce Chung, our Chief Financial Officer. And we also have members of the management team on the call who are available to answer questions. Let's begin with the 3 key messages for today's presentation on Slide 4.  \n First, our business performance exceeded expectations in the first quarter. I'm incredibly pleased with our strong start to the year and in reaffirming our 2024 financial guidance ranges. Second, electrification trends compounded by Gen AI data center growth forecast a signal of transformative rises in power demand. As a result, we expect competitive markets to realize outsized benefits driven by business-friendly environments, available resources and the ability to cite projects quickly.  \n Finally, NRG is well positioned to capitalize on tightened supply and demand in our core markets. Our technology-led consumer platform, our diversified generation portfolio, our leading business energy platform and a real estate site portfolio present a unique opportunity to create significant shareholder value. I'm going to give you visibility into this later in the presentation. \n Let's move to Slide 5 because I want to share again our value proposition, which may not be familiar to those of you who are new to NRG, and I understand there are several of you on this call. We serve nearly 8 million residential customers and operate the second largest C&I energy and natural gas retail business by volume in the United States.  \n Our company sits at the intersection of energy and technology in the home and the grid. We generate significant excess cash well beyond our current business needs, resulting in the financial flexibility to grow earnings while returning significant capital to our shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. \n The strength of our business and financial outlook has us uniquely positioned to capitalize on what we believe to the beginning stages of an exceptional time for our industry. It's an exciting time for our company. We remain on track to achieve our 15% to 20% free cash flow before growth per share CAGR target, even as our rising stock price means buying shares at higher prices than projected a year ago. \n Turning to Slide 6. In recent months, we've received numerous questions about the impacts of the forthcoming power demand growth super cycle on the industry and in NRG in particular. Today, I'd like to talk about what we are seeing. Bruce will then discuss the first quarter results later in the presentation.  \n Starting with macro trends. We're seeing clear signs of a step change in the long-term fundamentals of power demand from multiple catalysts. This marks the departure from an extended period of stagnant power demand during which energy efficiency outpaced usage growth. For the first time in decades, and perhaps in my 40 years in this business, we are experiencing fundamental improvements driven by demand rather than commodity prices. We, along with every other forecasting expert I have read, are now expecting a step change in long-term power demand.  \n This increase in demand is attributed to several factors, including electrification, manufacturing, onshoring, LNG, crypto, greater industrial loads and data center growth. Recent advancements in Gen AI are compounding and accelerating these factors, leading to the formation of the next power demand super cycle. At the same time, the U.S. power supply that is expected to accommodate this growth will increasingly depend on intermittent resources, which highlights a growing and unprecedented imbalance between dispatchable supply and demand.  \n To be clear, it takes only a fraction of what is being forecasted to not just into this super cycle. And this super cycle will require an all-of-the-above supply approach, including retaining existing generation assets, developing new generation, and approaching supply and demand differently through the adoption of technology by shifting large loads, residential VPP and other forms of demand and energy management. This is a transformative opportunity for our sector and for NRG. \n If you turn to Slide 7, you'll see why competitive markets such as those in which NRG operates are best positioned to realize outsized benefits of this large load growth. It's due to the competitive framework that offers speed-to-market, affordability and resource availability. We see Texas and portions of the Northeast as the most favorable markets. \n Texas stands out as it is already a preferred destination for large loads including crypto, LNG and manufacturing onshoring, which all have experienced substantial growth in recent years and are exhibiting strong outlooks on the future. Texas benefits from its business-friendly practices, favorable regulatory environment, tax incentives and large land footprint, positioning it as a winner in the era of generative AI and other large load growth.  Furthermore, coupled with our ability to cite projects years faster than in regulated markets and its proximity to main fiber channels, I expect Texas to continue to be a leader in load growth. \n On Slide 8, I'd like to highlight 4 of the many key opportunities for value creation that exists across our platform. To leave no doubt, each of these opportunities represents upside to our June 2023 Investor Day growth plan, and it's not relying on potentially transitory subsidies or inflation reduction act funding.  \n First, we are the only company to have residential energy and smart technologies at scale with nearly 8 million customers. We're a trusted provider and have the unique capability to provide novel energy management through our smart home ecosystem, a capability that will be necessary and increase in value in a tightening market. Second, you may not be aware or fully cognizant of the opportunity that it represents, but we are the second largest business-to-business electricity and largest natural gas provider by volume in North America.  \n Beyond selling customers more of our products, we are a leader in premium services. We offer tailored energy management solutions that focus on optimizing and stabilizing energy costs. We're also able to commercially help our customers achieve their sustainability goals. These customers include many of America's largest industrial players and corporations as well as the hyperscalers. \n Third, our Texas generation fleet mix is a diverse set of assets that enable us to deliver stable supply costs while maintaining insurance for volatility through higher cost units that are not economical in the current year. These uneconomic units are primarily higher heat rate natural gas assets and in recent low price times may have run for only a few peak hours per year.  \n We primarily use our generation fleet to supply our residential retail portfolio with customer fixed price contracts typically lasting a year or 2. As a result, our generation fleet is mostly open 18 to 24 months out. This creates a significant opportunity to swiftly capitalize on rising power prices and rising demand. As the value of our product increases and equally importantly, units that have historically operated only a few hours annually could now see increasing run times and, of course, profitability.  \n Lastly, our real estate portfolio has several potential development sites for colocation of large loads or power plants. We own 21 sites with 21,000 acres at retired and existing generation facilities that generally have existing or access to grid interconnection. They are in competitive markets and given the extreme focus on project speed, potentially provide another avenue of value creation. Let's try to unpack each of these a bit. \n Turning to Slide 9. We operate 1 of the leading business-to-business power and natural gas platforms in North America. We serve nearly 100 terawatt hours of electricity and almost 1.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas annually.  \n As demand growth scales, we anticipate increasing electric and natural gas sales volumes. Through our business platform, we help large load customers accomplish their intended goals through tailored plans, including stabilizing their energy costs, delivering specific attributes for their sustainability commitments and optimizing their usage through services such as demand response. At heart, these customers are looking for a partner to help them navigate complicated energy markets while minimizing their risk.  \n We stand ready to provide the services they need as a large market participant with a best-in-class commercial operations platform and a track record of high-quality customer experiences. With respect to data centers. It is still the early days, but we are seeing signs that they are planning to ramp up capacity in the current years. As an anecdotal example, a data center customer approached us about increasing their capacity by 3x at an existing facility in the next 36 months. We are seeing and experiencing demand growth in real time.  \n Moving to Slide 10. Our Texas generation fleet is diverse in technology, age and merit order. We operate 8.5 gigawatts of generation capacity in Texas, supplemented by 1.6 gigawatts of long-term power purchase agreements. We also have 1.5 gigawatts of shovel-ready brownfield projects in development. This strategic diversification across technologies, fuel types and merit orders ensures near-term stability and positions us to capitalize on opportunities from medium- to long-term margin expansion driven by higher power prices. \n On the right hand of the slide, we provide our Texas generation open growth margin sensitivity to changes in around-the-clock power price scenarios. This sensitivity provides insight into our generation portfolio's earnings power as economic generation increases in value and currently, uneconomic generation becomes not only economic but very profitable. \n On Slide 11 -- provide a more detailed look at our Texas generation gross margin sensitivity. This analysis focuses on changes in power prices, assuming flat natural gas pricing and normal weather. On the left side of the slide, we have included Texas as around-the-clock and peak pricing forwards for July 2023 and April 2024, which represents the assumed pricing in our 2024 guidance and are compared to today's forward.  \n As you can see, ERCOT forward pricing has moved up significantly. The only explanation for this is that the market is starting to reflect increased power demand from large load growth. Also noteworthy is that the curve is no longer backward dated, suggesting a view and a long-term view of sustained tightness in the Texas power market. Building upon last quarter's additional modeling disclosure. On the right side of the slide, we have provided the necessary components to directionally model the gross margin opportunities for our Texas fleet in a dynamic pricing environment.  \n We begin with the 2024 Texas generation base gross margin and include expected hedge positions of nearly fully hedged in year 1, roughly half in year 2 and less than 25% in year 3 for economic generation, respectively. We have also included an open gross margin scenario, which assumes no hedges. You will observe that our price sensitivity doesn't follow a linear pattern. Units becoming economically viable at different price levels, resulting in disproportionately larger benefits from increases in power prices compared to decreases. \n With ERCOT forward pricing rising $10 in the outer years on an open gross margin basis, this complies more than $400 million of margin benefit compared to 2024. Assuming we are 25% hedged in the year that, that move occurs, it translates to approximately $350 million of upside compared to 2024, and this is simply the beginning. This sensitivity analysis demonstrates that our portfolio is well positioned to capture significant margin upside in a rising price environment and that the underlying fundamental value of our fleet has materially increased. Supported by our diversified supply strategy, we have the agility and flexibility to leverage these market dynamics and translate them into significant and durable shareholder value. \n On Slide 12, I want to close by providing details of our site portfolio. Driven by the need for more capacity in the highly valued attributes these sites possess, we are incredibly excited about their potential value. We have 21 sites with 21,000 acres of land within competitive markets that are prime locations for new large loads and power plant development, with colocation opportunities both behind and in front of the meter. \n These sites offer a mix of valuable and critical access to infrastructure, including transmission, interconnection, water, abundance of land and proximity to long-haul fiber networks. Of particular significance to data centers, these attributes offer expedited construction time lines measured in years of time savings. \n We have established a dedicated team focused on maximizing the value of our site portfolio. When the analysis is complete later in the year, you can expect to hear more information from us regarding the potential for these sites and what would be required to turn them into new capacity, data center locations or behind the meter projects.  \n With that, let me turn it over to Bruce for the first quarter review. \nBruce Chung: Thank you, Larry. Turning to Slide 14. Our top decile safety and strong operating performance resulted in first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $849 million, exceeding the first quarter of 2023 by $203 million. This represents a 31% increase in our adjusted EBITDA from the prior year. $150 million of the year-over-year increase was the result of the inclusion of a full quarter's worth of Smart Home EBITDA. \n The remaining increase was attributable to outperformance in our East and West segments, driven by lower realized supply costs, partially offset by a slight decline in our Texas region due to mild weather. Our consumer energy and smart home platforms increased customer counts year-over-year by 8% and 6%, respectively.  \n Most notably, we added 35,000 customers from the newly opened Lubbock market in Texas, representing a healthy share of the available customer base. This is a testament to the hard work of our consumer energy team over the past 2 years to position NRG and its brands as the electricity provider of choice in Lubbock. Similar to 2023, our Smart Home platform continued to demonstrate strong execution. In addition to growing customer count 6% year-over-year, service margins increased 5% year-over-year, and monthly recurring revenue per subscriber grew 5% over the same period. \n It is clear that customers recognize the value of our Smart Home services as evidenced by our growth in the face of various macro headwinds affecting the consumer discretionary sector. Our diversified supply strategy continued to deliver, ensuring that we sustain the level of margin expansion we saw in 2023 while also providing the necessary coverage against potential volatility in the winter months.  \n As we discussed in our last earnings call, our fleet performed well in the first quarter, demonstrating a 12% improvement in our in-the-money availability factor winter-over-winter. We have taken advantage of the mild winter in February and March to conduct our maintenance activities more proactively, and we feel confident about fleet performance heading into the critical summer months. \n Next, I would like to highlight some of what we have focused on as an organization through the first quarter as well as what we continue to remain focused on through the balance of the year. During the quarter, we concluded the $950 million accelerated share repurchase program we launched in November of last year. Through that program, we repurchased nearly 19 million shares at an average price of $50.43 per share, or almost 10% of the shares outstanding, at the time that we launched the ASR. \n We remain committed to our capital allocation plan, and we are reaffirming our 2024 return of capital amount of approximately $1.2 billion, comprised of our common dividends, which we increased earlier this year and a further $825 million in share repurchases. As Larry discussed, we continue to advance our 1.5 gigawatts of brownfield development in Texas. We will be filing our Notices of Intent for the 3 projects to the Texas Energy Fund in the coming days, and we anticipate filing formal loan applications in early June when they are due. \n Our brownfield development portfolio comprised of 2 peaking plants and 1 combined cycle project, with CODs ranging from 2026 to 2028 is shovel-ready, and represents some of the most real natural gas-fired development opportunities in the ERCOT market. We have been developing these projects since 2021 and we believe that the advancements we have made on the permitting and equipment procurement fronts should position these projects at the front of the queue for consideration by the PUCT for funding out of the loan program. \n Next, we continue to remain on track to achieve our $550 million program of growth and efficiency initiatives across our business platforms. As I mentioned earlier, our consumer platforms continue to drive strong stand-alone growth, and we continue to see positive momentum in our ability to generate more margin per customer. A great example of this is the tremendous progress we've made in selling the Vivint protection plan. We started selling this plan shortly after closing the Vivint acquisition. And to date, we have about 15% penetration of the existing Smart Home customer base or over 300,000 active plans, with each plan generating approximately $9 of monthly revenue per customer. \n Finally, we are reaffirming our 2024 guidance for both EBITDA and free cash flow before growth. We have tremendous momentum in both our consumer and business platforms and the measures we are taking in our diversified supply strategy should set us up well for the balance of the year.\n Turning to Slide 15 for an updated view of our 2024 capital allocation. As you can see from the slide, there have been no substantial changes since our last earnings call in terms of the quantum of capital allocated to liability management and capital return. As you may recall, we had planned $500 million of debt reduction in our last earnings call as part of the 2024 capital allocation plan. \n As you can see from the slide, that has changed slightly given our efforts in Q1 to address our outstanding convertible notes. Through April 30, we repurchased $343 million of the outstanding principal of the convertible notes, resulting in $257 million of additional premium paid to retiring noteholders. Given the cash allocated to settle the convertible note premium, that reduced our net debt reduction to $243 million planned for the year. \n Our strong share price performance over the past year made the convertible notes one of the most expensive pieces of paper in our capital structure. Therefore, we believe that made the most economic sense to pursue a retirement of that instrument before it would get even more expensive as our share price continues to reflect our fair value. \n Moving a few columns over to the right, you will see that the share repurchase column is $865 million versus the $825 million we showed in our last earnings call. The reason for that is because we now include $40 million of cash allocated to settle tax matters related to our 2023 share repurchases and Employee Stock Compensation Plan. This would include the excise tax on share repurchases instituted as part of the passage of the inflation Reduction Act. \n Previously, we had bucketed that allocated cash in other categories, but we decided to move those dollars into the share repurchases category in order to more accurately reflect what the cash is being used for. Finally, similar to our last earnings call, we continue to show $41 million of unallocated capital available for allocation in 2024, which we will evaluate the use of as we move along the year. With that, I will turn it back to you, Larry. \nLawrence Coben: Thank you very much, Bruce. On Slide 17, I want to provide you a few closing thoughts on our 2024 priorities and expectations. We remain laser focused on execution and on delivering on our financial, operational and safety commitments. We are seeing a step change improvement in fundamentals across all of our platforms. We believe that this will put a spotlight on the scarcity of the critical products and services we sell and the durability of that platform. We are uniquely positioned to deliver significant shareholder value for years to come. \n Again, we are the only company to combine residential, energy and smart technologies at scale, with nearly 8 million customers and the necessary capabilities to create sustainable value through both tightening and loosening power market conditions. We operate the second largest business-to-business electricity and largest natural gas platform in North America, positioning us as a leader in premium services and tailored energy management solutions. \n Our integrated supply strategy provides incredible capabilities to stabilize near-term earnings while capturing medium- to long-term margin expansion opportunities from higher power prices. And we own a large Latin portfolio with premium attributes for what is to come in the super cycle of power demand. \n In my 20 years at the company and over 40 years in power, I have never been more excited about the future of our sector at NRG. The step change in demand should lead also to a change in the depressed valuations for NRG and its peers. These depressed valuations have resulted in double-digit cash flow yields such as ours. This revaluation will be good for NRG and others in our space, and it's very exciting times. I look forward to updating you on our progress along the way. \n With that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. We're now ready to open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. \nShahriar Pourreza: Just Larry, on the curves themselves. There's, obviously, a lot of chatter in the industry right now about some large generators like nukes to go behind the meter. Is this something, I guess, that concerns you as you look at your length in the Eastern markets? So as you go out to the market to match load, are suppliers raising any kind of concerns there? \nRobert Gaudette: Shar, it's Rob. Like it doesn't raise any concerns for us as far as trying to purchase supply so that we can meet retail obligations. Even if they do go behind the meter, there's plenty of players in the East. It's a very liquid market. \nShahriar Pourreza: Okay. Got it. Perfect. And then maybe just a little longer dated. But as you're kind of highlighting the Texas fleet heavily here, it seems warranted. How would you -- the recent sort of the EPA regs as they stand, impact your generation profile maybe over the next couple of years, right? Is it just additional CapEx? Could we see an acceleration of gas development work beyond the 1.5 gigs that, obviously, Bruce was highlighting of shovel-ready proposals. Just more color on how these items are kind of interacting. \nRobert Gaudette: Sure. So when you think about the regulations that were promulgated, the first thing I would say, Shar, is that they're all going to be litigated, right? AG, states, ISOs, consumers, everyone has a view and a reason to make sure that these rules get set in place in a way that works for the system and provides reliable and affordable power over time. As far as specifics around us, some of the rules will have to see how they pan out at the end.  \n But what I would tell you is that our decisions to invest around the gas fleet or the 1.5 gig that Bruce talked about earlier, have nothing to do with these regs. It's all about the opportunity that we see in the markets, and we'll continue to drive that way. Does that make sense? \nShahriar Pourreza: Yes. That was perfect. And then, Larry, it sounds like you're having a really good time on the job right now. So maybe you're not in a rush. But is there anything as far as any updates on the CEO search? Or are you having too much fun? \nLawrence Coben: Well, Shar, I am having a lot of fun. But look, it's a great team, and it's a great company and it's -- look, it's a fantastic job. The committee continues to do its work. I think they're still on the time frame that I talked to you about, but there's no rush. I've told them that, to take their time and that I will continue in this position as long as necessary, until they find the right person that they're happy with to be the next CEO of NRG. But given all the opportunities that we have and everything that we've been talking about on this call, you're right, Shar, I am having fun. And I think you're supposed to have fun. \nShahriar Pourreza: Perfect. Really big congrats to Elizabeth. She's been such a fantastic phase for NRG for some time. \nOperator: The next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. \nAgnieszka Storozynski: So first, for the last maybe 20 years, you were trying to convince us that you are power price-agnostic. Clearly, not any longer. That's number one. So how do we think about it, this new backdrop, how it impacts your retail business versus wholesale business? Is this additional margin going to be realized by selling this more expensive power to the retail arm? So that's number one. Number two is, so this is gross margin. Is there like an additional O&M layer, we should think about or on maintenance, both on the cost side and CapEx side? Just to get a sense of how big an impact you will have on the EBITDA of the sway in power prices. \nLawrence Coben: And let me have Rob talk a little bit about the CapEx and repair side. And then I'd ask Rasesh to talk a little bit about the margin side . \nRobert Gaudette: Angie, when you think about taking the gross margin expansion that you see on the chart and then trying to translate that across over to EBITDA, I would point out -- so think about it in 2 pieces, right? So on the plants that are the generation that's currently running today, right, the stuff that we've built into our numbers and are running today. When you see a step change in power that has zero impact on OpEx for those megawatts because they're already running.  \n The place where you'll pick up additional OpEx and translate that down to EBITDA is on the stuff that's running more. So we talked to you guys historically about an increase in run times on some assets, given a change in price. It's those additional hours that actually cost you more. And the way that I would translate that down would probably be at the same kind of rate, which is Bruce, correct me if I'm wrong, 80%. \nBruce Chung: Yes, we would probably see something like an 80% translation to EBITDA and then probably like a 75% translation of the free cash flow. \nRobert Gaudette: Does that answer your question? \nAgnieszka Storozynski: Yes. \nRasesh Patel: And then, Angie, on the retail margins, I mean, I think we've proven our ability to maintain strong retail margins over time. Increasing power prices really affect our competitors as well, and they historically proven to be rational in pricing. And so when you look at quarterly move up of the curve like we're experiencing now, it gives us ample time to pass that through to consumers. And in fact, energy prices have gone up almost 75% caused from 2017 to 2023. We've actually been able to increase margin over that period. And so we feel confident in our ability to do that. \nAgnieszka Storozynski: Okay. And then one other question. So you're talking about the gas-fired new build. I mean I was just doing some -- running some simple math here. Given growing supply of renewable power, right, you probably can't necessarily count on very high capacity factors for these assets, which would suggest that power prices need to be multiples of what we are seeing in the forward curve, in order to justify construction of these new gas plants. So I'm just wondering how you see it. Even in Texas, those peakers and combined cycle gas plant that you're pitching. Even with subsidized loans, it's hard to imagine that these assets would be economic at a $60 around-the-clock or north price. \nRobert Gaudette: Angie, it's Rob again. I would tell you that the assets are economic. The way to think about the beauty of peakers, or CCGTs, is that they can flex meaning they can move. And they can capture the value in the hours that matter. We've been trying to transfer our portfolio to something like that for a few years now. And so when you see prices move, right, so as you see the curves go up, particularly in ERCOT, it doesn't mean that every hour goes up by that same amount. \n It's the very tight hours that go up those exponential amounts that you're talking about. Is that cleared up? So think about the afternoon in Texas in the summer. That is going to go up 5 or 6x versus morning of that same day may have gone up once. And peakers are the things that make money in that [ work ]. \nRasesh Patel: Yes. Angie, let me just add that every one of these projects, even on a sort of -- without thinking about lots of rising pricing, without thinking about [indiscernible] instruments costs or things, pencils out to be -- they all pencil out to be over our stated hurdle rate. And everything I just mentioned and the things that Rob just mentioned or upside on top of that. \nAgnieszka Storozynski: So but in light of that, I'm sorry, I'm asking [indiscernible] line questions. But in light of that, the fact that the new build is materializing at these prices, wouldn't that suggest that there's a cap on the upside to power prices? Because that's usually what it suggests, right, that the new build materializes and that sort of deflates the tightness of power markets. \nRasesh Patel: Angie, I think if you look at the tightness versus the 1.5 gigawatts, the tightness far exceeds it. And so yes, at some point, of course, if there's enough new build that might exclude the tightness. But if you look at the number of projects that are on the books, not just ours, but everybody's, the time it's going to take to complete those, I don't worry about that tightness being loosened in any significant way for the next several years. \nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. \nSteven Fleishman: So just, I guess, following on Angie's first question, I just want to try to reconcile kind of NRG in the old world of low prices for longer versus NRG now in this new world. I don't recall you talking about hedges rolling off and then suddenly being exposed to low power prices.  \n There was the integrated model and the customers kind of side to kind of hedge the low prices. So just how do I -- why wouldn't I still not have to think about some kind of integrated model and maybe the retail margins coming down against the lower, against the higher power prices? Or just how do we reconcile the two? \nLawrence Coben: Steve, I think what it has to do with really is the step change in the market. I mean before we have prices moved and really commodity-driven, those were sort of transitory, and we were managing for the steadiness. I think what you're seeing here is a step change where the flexibility of the integrated model allows us to gear ourselves, in order to take advantage of the higher prices. So the model hasn't changed. It's one of the things -- the reason we never talked about it is we never saw a step change like this. But one of the benefits of the integrated model that we've been pursuing is that it allows us to gear to price increases like this. \nSteven Fleishman: Got it. Okay. And then on the kind of sites opportunity and also on the new build generation. Could you give us maybe a little bit more color on how you're thinking about funding for those opportunities? And how much might come from NRG versus kind of third-party buying stakes or making the investment? Just maybe some kind of broader overlay how you're thinking about that. \nBruce Chung: Yes. So Steve, it's Bruce here. First, on the new builds. Obviously, from a funding perspective, we intend to access the Texas Energy Fund. So that's going to be 60% of the capital costs related to the new builds right there. The other 40% of equity, we feel confident that we can fund that from our own cash and cash flow, without impacting any of our capital allocation commitments, in terms of share repurchases and deleveraging. \n So from our perspective, we feel pretty well capitalized to be able to handle all of that by ourselves. Obviously, as we've always said, to the extent that these projects are getting built and there's a unique opportunity to potentially attract third-party capital at a very attractive proposition, then we would certainly give that some consideration. \n But right now, as we sit here today, we feel good about our ability to fund those projects on our own. As far as the 21 sites, it's still early days. How it is that, that ultimately translates into what sort of opportunities that results in are still to be discovered. And so don't really have a perspective on any capital need in that regard as we sit here today. \nSteven Fleishman: Okay. And just last quick one. Obviously, the higher stock price, you mentioned still reaffirming the 15% to 20% growth. So that, I assume means you're expecting a better numerator there in terms of free cash flow to support that? And what is driving that? Is that mainly the higher power prices? \nRobert Gaudette: I always have my opportunity to give you a warmer answer [indiscernible] Larry Coben but -- well, the first part of your answer, yes. Look, I mean I think we see, obviously, not only continued execution against our $550 million growth and cost program. But I think as you can see here, based on the sensitivities we provided you, there is going to be -- we do see upside as a result of the forward curve. \nOperator: The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. \nDurgesh Chopra: Just maybe can you help us just frame very high level on the 21 sites that you discussed. How many -- if there's a way to think about how many potential gigawatts that you can add over time? And then also address how quickly you can add the gigawatts. Just the reason being that the demand, like you just said Larry, this is a step change in demand. I'm just thinking about how quick the response can lead to that. \nRobert Gaudette: Yes. It's a great question, Durgesh, and it's one that we're working on and it's why we've set up this sort of new group to deal with data centers. I don't know the answer yet. I don't -- we're trying to figure that out. We see ginormous potential, but obviously, there's a ton of work to do in terms of -- to figure out exactly how quickly, what's best on this site? Is it better for a data center or a power plant? Is it better for colocation behind the meter, in front of the meter? So we're spending a lot of time working through those. And I think when we have more color on them, we'll certainly provide that to you all, but I'm not sure that will be in the next 2 or 3 months. It will probably be closer to the end of the year. As you know, the power plant development is an awful lot of work. \nDurgesh Chopra: That makes sense. I appreciate that, Larry. And then maybe just -- I know this is going to be another tough question, but just can you share your calculus or how you're thinking about buybacks here, given how the stock has kind of gone up in valuation versus investing in these in these opportunities, which obviously, have a tremendous run rate. How do you think about that? \nRobert Gaudette: Let me begin by repeating what Bruce said, which is we are reaffirming our capital allocation that we promised everybody. Obviously, when your stock is trading at a 25% free cash flow yield, it's an easy decision, but we still believe we have enough capital to both do our investing and return capital to our shareholders. And I don't see that changing in the short or medium term. So I think we're going to just continue to be disciplined in terms of returning capital and given -- especially given the rises that we've been talking about here will likely should actually have more capital to invest ourselves. \n And it won't surprise you to hear that there's an awful lot of people who also now want to co-invest with us in a lot of these kind of projects. So I think the possibilities for doing accretive generation and related projects are there, regardless -- irrespective of our capital allocation principles. \nOperator: Next question comes from David Zimmerman at Morgan Stanley. \nDavid Arcaro: Dave Arcaro here. Following up on one of the earlier questions. I was wondering, just on the ERCOT market and pricing in the market and the forward curves. Do you have a view from here on where ERCOT prices could go? Is there still room for upside? Do you think in terms of where the forward curve is currently pricing? \nRobert Gaudette: David, it's Rob. Yes. The markets can definitely go up. If you look at the large loans that are coming to the state into the system, ERCOT is already beginning to monitor and take a look at it. It's a lot. And you're seeing that price in. There is more upside in the curves from here. \nDavid Arcaro: Okay. Got it. And does that -- as you're kind of hedging into that, then, is that a view that you're embedding as you start to layer in hedges and firm up some of your out-year EBITDA forecast? \nRobert Gaudette: So when we think about our out-year EBITDA, remember that a big part of our hedging program is through the retail book, right? So as we sell to our 8 million consumers, that ultimately takes a lot of that value and translates it over through the retail revenue rates. We're always looking way out the curve, David. If I thought that something was really high and out of whack, then I would say that we could take something off the table. But we like the position, we like the trend and we like where our portfolio is. \nDavid Arcaro: Got it. And could you touch on what the competitive dynamics are that you're seeing in the retail energy business right now, in terms of any pressure from new entrants or pricing pressure in the market that might push margin one way or the other right now? \nRobert Gaudette: It's been a very stable performance. As you saw, we had strong performance in terms of customer growth year-over-year. We saw similarly good performance and load growth and our margins. And so we feel very good. I think there are a couple of new entrants in the market, but as we look at our outflow reports, we don't really see any meaningful traction there. \nOperator: The final question comes from Ryan Levine with Citi. \nRyan Levine: A follow-up on some of the capital -- just a follow up on some of the capital allocation framework. Is there a price where you would reconsider buybacks? Or are you not trying to take any view on the value of the energy security? \nLawrence Coben: Brian, there is no price that we would necessarily sit here and tell you is the absolute line at which we would stop buybacks. We're always going to be looking what is implied in the share price with respect to our free cash flow yield, and we'll make the termination from that standpoint. But as we sit here today, we see plenty of room to run for us to continue to be buying back shares. \nRyan Levine: Okay. And then as you're looking at on investment opportunities related to power generation growth in your service territory. Are you are you focusing -- you mentioned a number of opportunities for new build and partnerships. Do you have a preference for partnerships? Or would you prefer to own the assets out right? \nLawrence Coben: I think for us, it's just a maximization and optimization process. And so I don't think we have a preference, one way or another. It's related to cost of capital, operational flexibility. And at the end of the day, what falls best to our bottom line. \nRyan Levine: Okay. And given the economic outlook that you suggested was attractive for these new builds, are there any customer commitments or duration of demand that you're looking for the data centers to commit to, to underwrite some of these new builds? \nRobert Gaudette: It's Rob. The answer to that is no. The new builds that we talked about are not set up for data centers or forward to meet that load. The conversations we are in early days with around colocation or use of our sites. Those will be a case-by-case basis as to whether or not it's a long-term deal or not, right, with a data center or other large load. But that's going to come as we evaluate each opportunity. But the things we've talked about thus far are for our book and our portfolio. \nRyan Levine: And just one last question in terms of retail margin on electricity. The movement in ERCOT forward prices, do you think that will have any impact on the margin that you'll ultimately be able to realize on that part of your business? \nLawrence Coben: Well, we've proven the ability to maintain strong retail margins through various curves. And so we have a very sophisticated analytic engine that gives us insights into the price sensitivity of customers. And when you have sort of these orderly shifts in power prices, we're able to pass them on to consumers over time. So we feel good about our muscle there. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it back to Larry Coben, Chairman and Interim President and CEO, for closing remarks. \nLawrence Coben: Thank you all very much for joining us. I think you can hear the palpable excitement that we all feel here at n NRG for the potential, and we look forward to continuing to deliver great results and executing on that upside in the days, months and years ahead. Thank you all. \nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program.",

            "content": "Thank you very much, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm joined this morning also by Bruce Chung, our Chief Financial Officer. And we also have members of the management team on the call who are available to answer questions. Let's begin with the 3 key messages for today's presentation on Slide 4.  \n First, our business performance exceeded expectations in the first quarter. I'm incredibly pleased with our strong start to the year and in reaffirming our 2024 financial guidance ranges. Second, electrification trends compounded by Gen AI data center growth forecast a signal of transformative rises in power demand. As a result, we expect competitive markets to realize outsized benefits driven by business-friendly environments, available resources and the ability to cite projects quickly.  \n Finally, NRG is well positioned to capitalize on tightened supply and demand in our core markets. Our technology-led consumer platform, our diversified generation portfolio, our leading business energy platform and a real estate site portfolio present a unique opportunity to create significant shareholder value. I'm going to give you visibility into this later in the presentation. \n Let's move to Slide 5 because I want to share again our value proposition, which may not be familiar to those of you who are new to NRG, and I understand there are several of you on this call. We serve nearly 8 million residential customers and operate the second largest C&I energy and natural gas retail business by volume in the United States.  \n Our company sits at the intersection of energy and technology in the home and the grid. We generate significant excess cash well beyond our current business needs, resulting in the financial flexibility to grow earnings while returning significant capital to our shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. \n The strength of our business and financial outlook has us uniquely positioned to capitalize on what we believe to the beginning stages of an exceptional time for our industry. It's an exciting time for our company. We remain on track to achieve our 15% to 20% free cash flow before growth per share CAGR target, even as our rising stock price means buying shares at higher prices than projected a year ago. \n Turning to Slide 6. In recent months, we've received numerous questions about the impacts of the forthcoming power demand growth super cycle on the industry and in NRG in particular. Today, I'd like to talk about what we are seeing. Bruce will then discuss the first quarter results later in the presentation.  \n Starting with macro trends. We're seeing clear signs of a step change in the long-term fundamentals of power demand from multiple catalysts. This marks the departure from an extended period of stagnant power demand during which energy efficiency outpaced usage growth. For the first time in decades, and perhaps in my 40 years in this business, we are experiencing fundamental improvements driven by demand rather than commodity prices. We, along with every other forecasting expert I have read, are now expecting a step change in long-term power demand.  \n This increase in demand is attributed to several factors, including electrification, manufacturing, onshoring, LNG, crypto, greater industrial loads and data center growth. Recent advancements in Gen AI are compounding and accelerating these factors, leading to the formation of the next power demand super cycle. At the same time, the U.S. power supply that is expected to accommodate this growth will increasingly depend on intermittent resources, which highlights a growing and unprecedented imbalance between dispatchable supply and demand.  \n To be clear, it takes only a fraction of what is being forecasted to not just into this super cycle. And this super cycle will require an all-of-the-above supply approach, including retaining existing generation assets, developing new generation, and approaching supply and demand differently through the adoption of technology by shifting large loads, residential VPP and other forms of demand and energy management. This is a transformative opportunity for our sector and for NRG. \n If you turn to Slide 7, you'll see why competitive markets such as those in which NRG operates are best positioned to realize outsized benefits of this large load growth. It's due to the competitive framework that offers speed-to-market, affordability and resource availability. We see Texas and portions of the Northeast as the most favorable markets. \n Texas stands out as it is already a preferred destination for large loads including crypto, LNG and manufacturing onshoring, which all have experienced substantial growth in recent years and are exhibiting strong outlooks on the future. Texas benefits from its business-friendly practices, favorable regulatory environment, tax incentives and large land footprint, positioning it as a winner in the era of generative AI and other large load growth.  Furthermore, coupled with our ability to cite projects years faster than in regulated markets and its proximity to main fiber channels, I expect Texas to continue to be a leader in load growth. \n On Slide 8, I'd like to highlight 4 of the many key opportunities for value creation that exists across our platform. To leave no doubt, each of these opportunities represents upside to our June 2023 Investor Day growth plan, and it's not relying on potentially transitory subsidies or inflation reduction act funding.  \n First, we are the only company to have residential energy and smart technologies at scale with nearly 8 million customers. We're a trusted provider and have the unique capability to provide novel energy management through our smart home ecosystem, a capability that will be necessary and increase in value in a tightening market. Second, you may not be aware or fully cognizant of the opportunity that it represents, but we are the second largest business-to-business electricity and largest natural gas provider by volume in North America.  \n Beyond selling customers more of our products, we are a leader in premium services. We offer tailored energy management solutions that focus on optimizing and stabilizing energy costs. We're also able to commercially help our customers achieve their sustainability goals. These customers include many of America's largest industrial players and corporations as well as the hyperscalers. \n Third, our Texas generation fleet mix is a diverse set of assets that enable us to deliver stable supply costs while maintaining insurance for volatility through higher cost units that are not economical in the current year. These uneconomic units are primarily higher heat rate natural gas assets and in recent low price times may have run for only a few peak hours per year.  \n We primarily use our generation fleet to supply our residential retail portfolio with customer fixed price contracts typically lasting a year or 2. As a result, our generation fleet is mostly open 18 to 24 months out. This creates a significant opportunity to swiftly capitalize on rising power prices and rising demand. As the value of our product increases and equally importantly, units that have historically operated only a few hours annually could now see increasing run times and, of course, profitability.  \n Lastly, our real estate portfolio has several potential development sites for colocation of large loads or power plants. We own 21 sites with 21,000 acres at retired and existing generation facilities that generally have existing or access to grid interconnection. They are in competitive markets and given the extreme focus on project speed, potentially provide another avenue of value creation. Let's try to unpack each of these a bit. \n Turning to Slide 9. We operate 1 of the leading business-to-business power and natural gas platforms in North America. We serve nearly 100 terawatt hours of electricity and almost 1.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas annually.  \n As demand growth scales, we anticipate increasing electric and natural gas sales volumes. Through our business platform, we help large load customers accomplish their intended goals through tailored plans, including stabilizing their energy costs, delivering specific attributes for their sustainability commitments and optimizing their usage through services such as demand response. At heart, these customers are looking for a partner to help them navigate complicated energy markets while minimizing their risk.  \n We stand ready to provide the services they need as a large market participant with a best-in-class commercial operations platform and a track record of high-quality customer experiences. With respect to data centers. It is still the early days, but we are seeing signs that they are planning to ramp up capacity in the current years. As an anecdotal example, a data center customer approached us about increasing their capacity by 3x at an existing facility in the next 36 months. We are seeing and experiencing demand growth in real time.  \n Moving to Slide 10. Our Texas generation fleet is diverse in technology, age and merit order. We operate 8.5 gigawatts of generation capacity in Texas, supplemented by 1.6 gigawatts of long-term power purchase agreements. We also have 1.5 gigawatts of shovel-ready brownfield projects in development. This strategic diversification across technologies, fuel types and merit orders ensures near-term stability and positions us to capitalize on opportunities from medium- to long-term margin expansion driven by higher power prices. \n On the right hand of the slide, we provide our Texas generation open growth margin sensitivity to changes in around-the-clock power price scenarios. This sensitivity provides insight into our generation portfolio's earnings power as economic generation increases in value and currently, uneconomic generation becomes not only economic but very profitable. \n On Slide 11 -- provide a more detailed look at our Texas generation gross margin sensitivity. This analysis focuses on changes in power prices, assuming flat natural gas pricing and normal weather. On the left side of the slide, we have included Texas as around-the-clock and peak pricing forwards for July 2023 and April 2024, which represents the assumed pricing in our 2024 guidance and are compared to today's forward.  \n As you can see, ERCOT forward pricing has moved up significantly. The only explanation for this is that the market is starting to reflect increased power demand from large load growth. Also noteworthy is that the curve is no longer backward dated, suggesting a view and a long-term view of sustained tightness in the Texas power market. Building upon last quarter's additional modeling disclosure. On the right side of the slide, we have provided the necessary components to directionally model the gross margin opportunities for our Texas fleet in a dynamic pricing environment.  \n We begin with the 2024 Texas generation base gross margin and include expected hedge positions of nearly fully hedged in year 1, roughly half in year 2 and less than 25% in year 3 for economic generation, respectively. We have also included an open gross margin scenario, which assumes no hedges. You will observe that our price sensitivity doesn't follow a linear pattern. Units becoming economically viable at different price levels, resulting in disproportionately larger benefits from increases in power prices compared to decreases. \n With ERCOT forward pricing rising $10 in the outer years on an open gross margin basis, this complies more than $400 million of margin benefit compared to 2024. Assuming we are 25% hedged in the year that, that move occurs, it translates to approximately $350 million of upside compared to 2024, and this is simply the beginning. This sensitivity analysis demonstrates that our portfolio is well positioned to capture significant margin upside in a rising price environment and that the underlying fundamental value of our fleet has materially increased. Supported by our diversified supply strategy, we have the agility and flexibility to leverage these market dynamics and translate them into significant and durable shareholder value. \n On Slide 12, I want to close by providing details of our site portfolio. Driven by the need for more capacity in the highly valued attributes these sites possess, we are incredibly excited about their potential value. We have 21 sites with 21,000 acres of land within competitive markets that are prime locations for new large loads and power plant development, with colocation opportunities both behind and in front of the meter. \n These sites offer a mix of valuable and critical access to infrastructure, including transmission, interconnection, water, abundance of land and proximity to long-haul fiber networks. Of particular significance to data centers, these attributes offer expedited construction time lines measured in years of time savings. \n We have established a dedicated team focused on maximizing the value of our site portfolio. When the analysis is complete later in the year, you can expect to hear more information from us regarding the potential for these sites and what would be required to turn them into new capacity, data center locations or behind the meter projects.  \n With that, let me turn it over to Bruce for the first quarter review. Thank you very much, Bruce. On Slide 17, I want to provide you a few closing thoughts on our 2024 priorities and expectations. We remain laser focused on execution and on delivering on our financial, operational and safety commitments. We are seeing a step change improvement in fundamentals across all of our platforms. We believe that this will put a spotlight on the scarcity of the critical products and services we sell and the durability of that platform. We are uniquely positioned to deliver significant shareholder value for years to come. \n Again, we are the only company to combine residential, energy and smart technologies at scale, with nearly 8 million customers and the necessary capabilities to create sustainable value through both tightening and loosening power market conditions. We operate the second largest business-to-business electricity and largest natural gas platform in North America, positioning us as a leader in premium services and tailored energy management solutions. \n Our integrated supply strategy provides incredible capabilities to stabilize near-term earnings while capturing medium- to long-term margin expansion opportunities from higher power prices. And we own a large Latin portfolio with premium attributes for what is to come in the super cycle of power demand. \n In my 20 years at the company and over 40 years in power, I have never been more excited about the future of our sector at NRG. The step change in demand should lead also to a change in the depressed valuations for NRG and its peers. These depressed valuations have resulted in double-digit cash flow yields such as ours. This revaluation will be good for NRG and others in our space, and it's very exciting times. I look forward to updating you on our progress along the way. \n With that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. We're now ready to open the line for questions. Well, Shar, I am having a lot of fun. But look, it's a great team, and it's a great company and it's -- look, it's a fantastic job. The committee continues to do its work. I think they're still on the time frame that I talked to you about, but there's no rush. I've told them that, to take their time and that I will continue in this position as long as necessary, until they find the right person that they're happy with to be the next CEO of NRG. But given all the opportunities that we have and everything that we've been talking about on this call, you're right, Shar, I am having fun. And I think you're supposed to have fun. And let me have Rob talk a little bit about the CapEx and repair side. And then I'd ask Rasesh to talk a little bit about the margin side . Steve, I think what it has to do with really is the step change in the market. I mean before we have prices moved and really commodity-driven, those were sort of transitory, and we were managing for the steadiness. I think what you're seeing here is a step change where the flexibility of the integrated model allows us to gear ourselves, in order to take advantage of the higher prices. So the model hasn't changed. It's one of the things -- the reason we never talked about it is we never saw a step change like this. But one of the benefits of the integrated model that we've been pursuing is that it allows us to gear to price increases like this. Brian, there is no price that we would necessarily sit here and tell you is the absolute line at which we would stop buybacks. We're always going to be looking what is implied in the share price with respect to our free cash flow yield, and we'll make the termination from that standpoint. But as we sit here today, we see plenty of room to run for us to continue to be buying back shares. I think for us, it's just a maximization and optimization process. And so I don't think we have a preference, one way or another. It's related to cost of capital, operational flexibility. And at the end of the day, what falls best to our bottom line. Well, we've proven the ability to maintain strong retail margins through various curves. And so we have a very sophisticated analytic engine that gives us insights into the price sensitivity of customers. And when you have sort of these orderly shifts in power prices, we're able to pass them on to consumers over time. So we feel good about our muscle there. Thank you all very much for joining us. I think you can hear the palpable excitement that we all feel here at n NRG for the potential, and we look forward to continuing to deliver great results and executing on that upside in the days, months and years ahead. Thank you all."

            "name": "Robert Gaudette",
            "content": "Shar, it's Rob. Like it doesn't raise any concerns for us as far as trying to purchase supply so that we can meet retail obligations. Even if they do go behind the meter, there's plenty of players in the East. It's a very liquid market. Sure. So when you think about the regulations that were promulgated, the first thing I would say, Shar, is that they're all going to be litigated, right? AG, states, ISOs, consumers, everyone has a view and a reason to make sure that these rules get set in place in a way that works for the system and provides reliable and affordable power over time. As far as specifics around us, some of the rules will have to see how they pan out at the end.  \n But what I would tell you is that our decisions to invest around the gas fleet or the 1.5 gig that Bruce talked about earlier, have nothing to do with these regs. It's all about the opportunity that we see in the markets, and we'll continue to drive that way. Does that make sense? Angie, when you think about taking the gross margin expansion that you see on the chart and then trying to translate that across over to EBITDA, I would point out -- so think about it in 2 pieces, right? So on the plants that are the generation that's currently running today, right, the stuff that we've built into our numbers and are running today. When you see a step change in power that has zero impact on OpEx for those megawatts because they're already running.  \n The place where you'll pick up additional OpEx and translate that down to EBITDA is on the stuff that's running more. So we talked to you guys historically about an increase in run times on some assets, given a change in price. It's those additional hours that actually cost you more. And the way that I would translate that down would probably be at the same kind of rate, which is Bruce, correct me if I'm wrong, 80%. Does that answer your question? Angie, it's Rob again. I would tell you that the assets are economic. The way to think about the beauty of peakers, or CCGTs, is that they can flex meaning they can move. And they can capture the value in the hours that matter. We've been trying to transfer our portfolio to something like that for a few years now. And so when you see prices move, right, so as you see the curves go up, particularly in ERCOT, it doesn't mean that every hour goes up by that same amount. \n It's the very tight hours that go up those exponential amounts that you're talking about. Is that cleared up? So think about the afternoon in Texas in the summer. That is going to go up 5 or 6x versus morning of that same day may have gone up once. And peakers are the things that make money in that [ work ]. I always have my opportunity to give you a warmer answer [indiscernible] Larry Coben but -- well, the first part of your answer, yes. Look, I mean I think we see, obviously, not only continued execution against our $550 million growth and cost program. But I think as you can see here, based on the sensitivities we provided you, there is going to be -- we do see upside as a result of the forward curve. Yes. It's a great question, Durgesh, and it's one that we're working on and it's why we've set up this sort of new group to deal with data centers. I don't know the answer yet. I don't -- we're trying to figure that out. We see ginormous potential, but obviously, there's a ton of work to do in terms of -- to figure out exactly how quickly, what's best on this site? Is it better for a data center or a power plant? Is it better for colocation behind the meter, in front of the meter? So we're spending a lot of time working through those. And I think when we have more color on them, we'll certainly provide that to you all, but I'm not sure that will be in the next 2 or 3 months. It will probably be closer to the end of the year. As you know, the power plant development is an awful lot of work. Let me begin by repeating what Bruce said, which is we are reaffirming our capital allocation that we promised everybody. Obviously, when your stock is trading at a 25% free cash flow yield, it's an easy decision, but we still believe we have enough capital to both do our investing and return capital to our shareholders. And I don't see that changing in the short or medium term. So I think we're going to just continue to be disciplined in terms of returning capital and given -- especially given the rises that we've been talking about here will likely should actually have more capital to invest ourselves. \n And it won't surprise you to hear that there's an awful lot of people who also now want to co-invest with us in a lot of these kind of projects. So I think the possibilities for doing accretive generation and related projects are there, regardless -- irrespective of our capital allocation principles. David, it's Rob. Yes. The markets can definitely go up. If you look at the large loans that are coming to the state into the system, ERCOT is already beginning to monitor and take a look at it. It's a lot. And you're seeing that price in. There is more upside in the curves from here. So when we think about our out-year EBITDA, remember that a big part of our hedging program is through the retail book, right? So as we sell to our 8 million consumers, that ultimately takes a lot of that value and translates it over through the retail revenue rates. We're always looking way out the curve, David. If I thought that something was really high and out of whack, then I would say that we could take something off the table. But we like the position, we like the trend and we like where our portfolio is. It's been a very stable performance. As you saw, we had strong performance in terms of customer growth year-over-year. We saw similarly good performance and load growth and our margins. And so we feel very good. I think there are a couple of new entrants in the market, but as we look at our outflow reports, we don't really see any meaningful traction there. It's Rob. The answer to that is no. The new builds that we talked about are not set up for data centers or forward to meet that load. The conversations we are in early days with around colocation or use of our sites. Those will be a case-by-case basis as to whether or not it's a long-term deal or not, right, with a data center or other large load. But that's going to come as we evaluate each opportunity. But the things we've talked about thus far are for our book and our portfolio."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Bruce Chung",
            "content": "Thank you, Larry. Turning to Slide 14. Our top decile safety and strong operating performance resulted in first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $849 million, exceeding the first quarter of 2023 by $203 million. This represents a 31% increase in our adjusted EBITDA from the prior year. $150 million of the year-over-year increase was the result of the inclusion of a full quarter's worth of Smart Home EBITDA. \n The remaining increase was attributable to outperformance in our East and West segments, driven by lower realized supply costs, partially offset by a slight decline in our Texas region due to mild weather. Our consumer energy and smart home platforms increased customer counts year-over-year by 8% and 6%, respectively.  \n Most notably, we added 35,000 customers from the newly opened Lubbock market in Texas, representing a healthy share of the available customer base. This is a testament to the hard work of our consumer energy team over the past 2 years to position NRG and its brands as the electricity provider of choice in Lubbock. Similar to 2023, our Smart Home platform continued to demonstrate strong execution. In addition to growing customer count 6% year-over-year, service margins increased 5% year-over-year, and monthly recurring revenue per subscriber grew 5% over the same period. \n It is clear that customers recognize the value of our Smart Home services as evidenced by our growth in the face of various macro headwinds affecting the consumer discretionary sector. Our diversified supply strategy continued to deliver, ensuring that we sustain the level of margin expansion we saw in 2023 while also providing the necessary coverage against potential volatility in the winter months.  \n As we discussed in our last earnings call, our fleet performed well in the first quarter, demonstrating a 12% improvement in our in-the-money availability factor winter-over-winter. We have taken advantage of the mild winter in February and March to conduct our maintenance activities more proactively, and we feel confident about fleet performance heading into the critical summer months. \n Next, I would like to highlight some of what we have focused on as an organization through the first quarter as well as what we continue to remain focused on through the balance of the year. During the quarter, we concluded the $950 million accelerated share repurchase program we launched in November of last year. Through that program, we repurchased nearly 19 million shares at an average price of $50.43 per share, or almost 10% of the shares outstanding, at the time that we launched the ASR. \n We remain committed to our capital allocation plan, and we are reaffirming our 2024 return of capital amount of approximately $1.2 billion, comprised of our common dividends, which we increased earlier this year and a further $825 million in share repurchases. As Larry discussed, we continue to advance our 1.5 gigawatts of brownfield development in Texas. We will be filing our Notices of Intent for the 3 projects to the Texas Energy Fund in the coming days, and we anticipate filing formal loan applications in early June when they are due. \n Our brownfield development portfolio comprised of 2 peaking plants and 1 combined cycle project, with CODs ranging from 2026 to 2028 is shovel-ready, and represents some of the most real natural gas-fired development opportunities in the ERCOT market. We have been developing these projects since 2021 and we believe that the advancements we have made on the permitting and equipment procurement fronts should position these projects at the front of the queue for consideration by the PUCT for funding out of the loan program. \n Next, we continue to remain on track to achieve our $550 million program of growth and efficiency initiatives across our business platforms. As I mentioned earlier, our consumer platforms continue to drive strong stand-alone growth, and we continue to see positive momentum in our ability to generate more margin per customer. A great example of this is the tremendous progress we've made in selling the Vivint protection plan. We started selling this plan shortly after closing the Vivint acquisition. And to date, we have about 15% penetration of the existing Smart Home customer base or over 300,000 active plans, with each plan generating approximately $9 of monthly revenue per customer. \n Finally, we are reaffirming our 2024 guidance for both EBITDA and free cash flow before growth. We have tremendous momentum in both our consumer and business platforms and the measures we are taking in our diversified supply strategy should set us up well for the balance of the year.\n Turning to Slide 15 for an updated view of our 2024 capital allocation. As you can see from the slide, there have been no substantial changes since our last earnings call in terms of the quantum of capital allocated to liability management and capital return. As you may recall, we had planned $500 million of debt reduction in our last earnings call as part of the 2024 capital allocation plan. \n As you can see from the slide, that has changed slightly given our efforts in Q1 to address our outstanding convertible notes. Through April 30, we repurchased $343 million of the outstanding principal of the convertible notes, resulting in $257 million of additional premium paid to retiring noteholders. Given the cash allocated to settle the convertible note premium, that reduced our net debt reduction to $243 million planned for the year. \n Our strong share price performance over the past year made the convertible notes one of the most expensive pieces of paper in our capital structure. Therefore, we believe that made the most economic sense to pursue a retirement of that instrument before it would get even more expensive as our share price continues to reflect our fair value. \n Moving a few columns over to the right, you will see that the share repurchase column is $865 million versus the $825 million we showed in our last earnings call. The reason for that is because we now include $40 million of cash allocated to settle tax matters related to our 2023 share repurchases and Employee Stock Compensation Plan. This would include the excise tax on share repurchases instituted as part of the passage of the inflation Reduction Act. \n Previously, we had bucketed that allocated cash in other categories, but we decided to move those dollars into the share repurchases category in order to more accurately reflect what the cash is being used for. Finally, similar to our last earnings call, we continue to show $41 million of unallocated capital available for allocation in 2024, which we will evaluate the use of as we move along the year. With that, I will turn it back to you, Larry. Yes, we would probably see something like an 80% translation to EBITDA and then probably like a 75% translation of the free cash flow. Yes. So Steve, it's Bruce here. First, on the new builds. Obviously, from a funding perspective, we intend to access the Texas Energy Fund. So that's going to be 60% of the capital costs related to the new builds right there. The other 40% of equity, we feel confident that we can fund that from our own cash and cash flow, without impacting any of our capital allocation commitments, in terms of share repurchases and deleveraging. \n So from our perspective, we feel pretty well capitalized to be able to handle all of that by ourselves. Obviously, as we've always said, to the extent that these projects are getting built and there's a unique opportunity to potentially attract third-party capital at a very attractive proposition, then we would certainly give that some consideration. \n But right now, as we sit here today, we feel good about our ability to fund those projects on our own. As far as the 21 sites, it's still early days. How it is that, that ultimately translates into what sort of opportunities that results in are still to be discovered. And so don't really have a perspective on any capital need in that regard as we sit here today."

            "content": "And then, Angie, on the retail margins, I mean, I think we've proven our ability to maintain strong retail margins over time. Increasing power prices really affect our competitors as well, and they historically proven to be rational in pricing. And so when you look at quarterly move up of the curve like we're experiencing now, it gives us ample time to pass that through to consumers. And in fact, energy prices have gone up almost 75% caused from 2017 to 2023. We've actually been able to increase margin over that period. And so we feel confident in our ability to do that. Yes. Angie, let me just add that every one of these projects, even on a sort of -- without thinking about lots of rising pricing, without thinking about [indiscernible] instruments costs or things, pencils out to be -- they all pencil out to be over our stated hurdle rate. And everything I just mentioned and the things that Rob just mentioned or upside on top of that. Angie, I think if you look at the tightness versus the 1.5 gigawatts, the tightness far exceeds it. And so yes, at some point, of course, if there's enough new build that might exclude the tightness. But if you look at the number of projects that are on the books, not just ours, but everybody's, the time it's going to take to complete those, I don't worry about that tightness being loosened in any significant way for the next several years."
